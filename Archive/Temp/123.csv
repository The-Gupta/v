In this pre-clinical study we evaluated the in vitro activity of both traditional antifols (methotrexate, aminopterin) and novel antifols (pemetrexed, talotrexin) in childhood acute leukemias and lymphomas. METHODS: We compared the in vitro cytotoxicity of methotrexate, aminopterin, pemetrexed, and talotrexin in a panel of six pediatric leukemia and lymphoma cell lines using the sulforhodamine B assay. In addition to defining a 50% growth inhibitory concentration (IC50) for a 120-h drug exposure, we contrasted the activity of the drugs in the context of clinically achievable (tolerable) drug exposures using the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). We defined each agent's clinical potency index (CPI) as the AUC achieved with standard pediatric dosing regimens divided by the in vitro IC50. RESULTS: Across all cell lines, talotrexin (median IC50 7 nM) and aminopterin (median IC50 17 nM) had lower IC50's than methotrexate (median IC50 78 nM) and pemetrexed (median IC50 155 nM). However, the CPI for methotrexate (median 0.9) was significantly greater than that for aminopterin (median 0.4). In contrast, pemetrexed had a significantly better CPI (median 13) than the traditional antifols. CONCLUSIONS: Aminopterin does not appear to offer any advantage over methotrexate for the treatment of childhood ALL. Further study of pemetrexed in childhood leukemias is warranted.","['Norris, Robin E', 'Adamson, Peter C']","['Norris RE', 'Adamson PC']","[""Division of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Abramson Research Center, 3615 Civic Center Blvd., Suite 916, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. norrisr@email.chop.edu""]",['eng'],['T32-CA09615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090927,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Glutamates)', '0 (Pterins)', '04Q9AIZ7NO (Pemetrexed)', '113857-87-7', '(N(alpha)-(4-amino-4-deoxypteroyl)-N(delta)-hemiphthaloyl-L-ornithine)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Aminopterin/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Glutamates/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Guanine/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymphoma/pathology', 'Methotrexate/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Ornithine/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Pemetrexed', 'Pterins/chemistry/pharmacology']",2009/09/29 06:00,2010/05/04 06:00,['2009/09/29 06:00'],"['2009/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-009-1120-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2010 May;65(6):1125-30. doi: 10.1007/s00280-009-1120-8.

Many investigators have observed reduced toxicity due to circumvention of drug-induced inhibition of de novo purine and pyrimidine synthesis. However, exogenous purine nucleosides and bases may also enhance the cytotoxicity of even moderate concentrations of antifolate drugs (MTX and PTX) which inhibit dihydrofolate reductase. In this study, the effects of nucleosides in the medium on the cytotoxicity and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools after brief exposure of cultured cells to methotrexate have been studied in cultured L1210 murine leukaemia cells. METHODS: Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion assay. Colony formation was assessed by microtitration cloning assay. The deoxyribonucleotides were measured by a modification of the DNA polymerase assay. Purines were extracted with trioctylamine and 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane buffer and concentrations of purine bases were determined by HPLC. RESULTS: Subculture of drug-treated cells in fresh medium containing 10% FCS led to greater toxicity than sub culture in 'conditioned' medium, i.e. fresh medium in which logarithmically growing cells had been cultured for 24 h before separation. Cells resuspended in fresh medium had increased dATP and sustained inhibition of dTTP levels, while cells subcultured in 'conditioned' medium had no elevation of dATP. Hypoxanthine concentration determined by HPLC in 'conditioned' medium was 0.9 microM compared to 6.7 microM in fresh medium. Resuspension of drug-treated cells in conditioned medium supplemented with 10 or 100 microM HX enhanced cytotoxicity and increased the dATP levels. CONCLUSION: These results add further evidence that purines present in normal culture conditions are important determinants of methotrexate cytotoxicity. Elevation of dATP levels after methotrexate treatment is an important modulator of cytotoxicity.","['Chong, Li', 'Ma, Guoyi', 'Bartier, Wendy A', 'Tattersall, Martin H N']","['Chong L', 'Ma G', 'Bartier WA', 'Tattersall MH']","['Department of Cancer Medicine, Blackburn Building D06, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia. li.chong@email.cs.nsw.gov.au']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090927,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Purines)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Dipyridamole/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Hypoxanthine/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Purines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2009/09/29 06:00,2010/05/07 06:00,['2009/09/29 06:00'],"['2009/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-009-1142-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2010 May;66(1):121-7. doi: 10.1007/s00280-009-1142-2.

Previous work has shown a significant positive correlation in incidence between the two conditions both at the international and small-area level. The aim was to extend the methodology by including shared spatial and temporal trends using a more extensive dataset among individuals diagnosed with ALL and T1D in Yorkshire (UK) aged 0-14 years from 1978-2003. Cases with ALL and T1D were ascertained from 2 high quality population-based disease registers covering the Yorkshire region of the UK and linked to an electoral ward from the 1991 UK census. A Bayesian model was fitted where similarities and differences in risk profiles of the two diseases were captured by the shared and disease-specific components using a shared-component model, with space-time interactions. The extended model revealed a positive correlation of at least 0.70 between diseases across all time periods, and an increasing risk across time for both diseases, which was more evident for T1D. Furthermore, both diseases exhibited lower rates in the more urban county of West Yorkshire and higher rates in the more rural northern and eastern part of the region. A differential effect of T1D over ALL was found in the south-eastern part of the region, which had a more pronounced association with population mixing than with population density or deprivation. Our approach has demonstrated the utility in modelling temporally and spatially varying disease incidence patterns across small geographical areas. The findings suggest searching for environmental factors that exhibit similar geographical-temporal variation in prevalence may help in the development and testing of plausible aetiological hypotheses. Furthermore, identifying environmental exposures specific to the south-eastern part of the region, especially locally varying risk factors which may differentially affect the development of T1D and ALL, may also be fruitful.","['Manda, Samuel O M', 'Feltbower, Richard G', 'Gilthorpe, Mark S']","['Manda SO', 'Feltbower RG', 'Gilthorpe MS']","['Biostatistics Unit, South African Medical Research Council, 1 Soutpansberg Road, Pretoria, South Africa. samuel.manda@mrc.ac.za']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090926,Netherlands,Eur J Epidemiol,European journal of epidemiology,8508062,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Demography', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*epidemiology', '*Epidemiologic Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Pediatrics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2009/09/29 06:00,2010/04/14 06:00,['2009/09/29 06:00'],"['2009/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10654-009-9391-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Epidemiol. 2009;24(12):743-52. doi: 10.1007/s10654-009-9391-2.

Recent findings suggest that the committed ExEn precursor is present already in the embryonic Inner Cell Mass (ICM) as a group of cells that intermingles with the closely related epiblast precursor. All ICM cells contain Oct4, a key transcription factor that is first expressed at the morula stage. In vitro, the epiblast precursor is most closely represented by the well-characterized embryonic stem (ES) cell lines that maintain the expression of Oct4, but analogous ExEn precursor cell lines are not known and it is unclear if they would express Oct4. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we report the isolation and characterization of permanently proliferating Oct4-expressing rat cell lines (""XEN-P cell lines""), which closely resemble the ExEn precursor. We isolated the XEN-P cell lines from blastocysts and characterized them by plating and gene expression assays as well as by injection into embryos. Like ES cells, the XEN-P cells express Oct4 and SSEA1 at high levels and their growth is stimulated by leukemia inhibitory factor, but instead of the epiblast determinant Nanog, they express the ExEn determinants Gata6 and Gata4. Further, they lack markers characteristic of the more differentiated primitive/visceral and parietal ExEn stages, but exclusively differentiate into these stages in vitro and contribute to them in vivo. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings (i) suggest strongly that the ExEn precursor is a self-renewable entity, (ii) indicate that active Oct4 gene expression (transcription plus translation) is part of its molecular identity, and (iii) provide an in vitro model of early ExEn differentiation.","['Debeb, Bisrat G', 'Galat, Vasiliy', 'Epple-Farmer, Jessica', 'Iannaccone, Steve', 'Woodward, Wendy A', 'Bader, Michael', 'Iannaccone, Philip', 'Binas, Bert']","['Debeb BG', 'Galat V', 'Epple-Farmer J', 'Iannaccone S', 'Woodward WA', 'Bader M', 'Iannaccone P', 'Binas B']","['Department of Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, United States of America.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090928,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Separation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Endoderm/*cytology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2009/09/29 06:00,2010/02/02 06:00,['2009/09/29 06:00'],"['2009/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0007216 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Sep 28;4(9):e7216. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0007216.,PMC2747266,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JAK2 is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates several cellular processes by inducing cytoplasmic signalling cascades. Here we show that human JAK2 is present in the nucleus of haematopoietic cells and directly phosphorylates Tyr 41 (Y41) on histone H3. Heterochromatin protein 1alpha (HP1alpha), but not HP1beta, specifically binds to this region of H3 through its chromo-shadow domain. Phosphorylation of H3Y41 by JAK2 prevents this binding. Inhibition of JAK2 activity in human leukaemic cells decreases both the expression of the haematopoietic oncogene lmo2 and the phosphorylation of H3Y41 at its promoter, while simultaneously increasing the binding of HP1alpha at the same site. Tauhese results identify a previously unrecognized nuclear role for JAK2 in the phosphorylation of H3Y41 and reveal a direct mechanistic link between two genes, jak2 and lmo2, involved in normal haematopoiesis and leukaemia.","['Dawson, Mark A', 'Bannister, Andrew J', 'Gottgens, Berthold', 'Foster, Samuel D', 'Bartke, Till', 'Green, Anthony R', 'Kouzarides, Tony']","['Dawson MA', 'Bannister AJ', 'Gottgens B', 'Foster SD', 'Bartke T', 'Green AR', 'Kouzarides T']","['Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK.']",['eng'],"['089957/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '12765/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'G0800784/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UP_1102/2/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090927,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CBX1 protein, human)', '0 (CBX5 protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '107283-02-3 (Chromobox Protein Homolog 5)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'Chromatin/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Chromobox Protein Homolog 5', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/enzymology', 'Histones/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia/enzymology/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Metalloproteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Oncogenes/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2009/09/29 06:00,2009/10/21 06:00,['2009/09/29 06:00'],"['2009/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['nature08448 [pii]', '10.1038/nature08448 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2009 Oct 8;461(7265):819-22. doi: 10.1038/nature08448.

In some cases the raised level of enzyme activity in biological fluids can be regarded as an additional marker of malignant growth (pancreas cancer, chronic myeloid leukemia, etc.).

High substrate specificity of particular RNases provides metabolic balance between various kinds of RNAs with various half-time exchange turn. RNases are the important factors of epigenetic regulation of gene activity in cells. The activity of RNases is adjustable by inhibitors and other factors, and defines time of existence of different kinds of RNAs. RNases (the modified variants of RNase A, RNases of semen fluid of the cattle, RNase of amphibia oocytes) can be used as anti-tumor therapeutic agents. On the other hand, some inhibitors of RNases of natural or synthetic origin were demonstrated to be perspective drugs that inhibit tumor growth.","['Shlyakhovenko, V A']",['Shlyakhovenko VA'],"['R.

The mechanisms that are involved in triptolide-mediated apoptosis or growth inhibition in cancer cells are not fully understood. We identified a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) as a novel molecular target of triptolide using affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry. The identification was confirmed by western blot analysis using an anti-ADAM10 antibody. The expression of ADAM10 is enhanced in several tumors including leukemia and is involved in malignant cell growth and cancer progression. ADAM10 is a type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein that cleaves several plasma membrane proteins. We show that triptolide, at concentrations in the nM range, resulted in a significant decrease in ADAM10 expression followed by the appearance of ADAM10 cleaved product. Furthermore, triptolide reduced the viability of monocytic leukemic U937 cells. Triptolide treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells expressing ectopic ADAM10 or dominant negative ADAM10 (DN ADAM10) resulted in a decreased expression of ADAM10 with a concomitant increase in ADAM10 cleaved products. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of ADAM10 mRNA significantly affected the growth of MCF-7 cells. Interestingly, the combination of siRNA-mediated knockdown of ADAM10 mRNA expression and triptolide treatment lead to a further reduction in cell growth. Taken together, we provide evidence that ADAM10 is a novel target of triptolide, presenting a novel strategy to inhibit ADAM10 activity in tumorigenesis.","['Soundararajan, Ramani', 'Sayat, Ria', 'Robertson, George S', 'Marignani, Paola A']","['Soundararajan R', 'Sayat R', 'Robertson GS', 'Marignani PA']","['Department of Pharmacology and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, CA.']",['eng'],['MOP-67039/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091114,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '19ALD1S53J (triptolide)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.81 (ADAM10 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.81 (ADAM10 protein, human)']",IM,"['ADAM Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'ADAM10 Protein', 'Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Epoxy Compounds/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Phenanthrenes/*pharmacology', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2009/09/29 06:00,2010/06/26 06:00,['2009/09/29 06:00'],"['2009/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['9803 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.8.21.9803 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2009 Nov;8(21):2054-62. doi: 10.4161/cbt.8.21.9803.

Substitution of the other lactam NH with aryl or arylalkyl side chains retained or improved activity in most instances.

Tax function is strictly dependent upon the phosphorylated form of the cellular transcription factor CREB (pCREB), and together they bind novel cAMP response elements located within the viral promoter. The DNA-bound Tax/pCREB complex recruits the cellular coactivators CBP/p300, which are essential for viral gene expression. The coactivators, via their histone acetyltransferase activity, function to promote changes in chromatin architecture that are permissive to transcriptional activation. Tax expression in vivo recruits p300 to the HTLV-1 promoter and correlates with depletion of nucleosomes from the integrated provirus. We recently developed a novel in vitro, chromatin-based experimental system that recapitulates the eviction of nucleosomes from the HTLV-1 promoter observed in vivo. These assays establish the essential function of Tax/pCREB recruitment of CBP/p300, and concomitant histone acetylation, in the nucleosome disassembly process. These observations are of particular significance, as Tax mediates disassembly of the full nucleosome octamer independent of transcriptional activity and ATP utilization. Instead, nucleosome eviction is absolutely dependent upon acetyl CoA and the histone chaperone Nap1. In this review, we will discuss HTLV-1, Tax transactivation, and our recent findings that uncover the critical role of Tax in promoting chromatin transitions that accompany activation of viral transcription. We will describe the phenomenon of acetylation-dependent promoter nucleosome disassembly and the emerging view that the formation of nucleosome-free promoter regions may represent a general prerequisite for transcriptional activation in eukaryotes.","['Nyborg, Jennifer K', 'Egan, Dinaida', 'Sharma, Neelam']","['Nyborg JK', 'Egan D', 'Sharma N']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Campus Box 1870, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523-1870, USA.

We examined the changes of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein level following TRAIL treatment of human cell lines representing different stages of colon carcinogenesis-adenocarcinoma (HT-29, HCT116) or secondary metastasis (SW620), together with cell line derived from human fetal colon (FHC). While TRAIL was capable of triggering an anti-apoptotic signaling leading to significant early ERK-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of Mcl-1 in selected colon adenocarcinoma cell lines, none or very limited effects were demonstrated in cell lines derived from colon lymph node metastasis or fetal colon, respectively. We demonstrated an immediate impact of Mcl-1 protein level manipulations on the course of early acute apoptotic response of colon adenocarcinoma cells to TRAIL. It is therefore essential to consider the dynamics of modulation of Mcl-1 level and the balance between TRAIL-induced pro- and anti-apoptotic pathways when predicting the response of cells in different stages of cancer development, and designing the anticancer therapy using TRAIL.","['Vaculova, Alena', 'Hofmanova, Jirina', 'Zatloukalova, Jirina', 'Kozubik, Alois']","['Vaculova A', 'Hofmanova J', 'Zatloukalova J', 'Kozubik A']","['Department of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Brno, Czech Republic. vaculova@ibp.cz']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090925,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Colonic Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*physiology']",2009/09/29 06:00,2010/01/20 06:00,['2009/09/29 06:00'],"['2008/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(09)00409-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.09.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2009 Nov 15;315(19):3259-66. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.09.019.

This work investigates the sensitivity of four leukemic cell lines to the HDACI, trichostatin A (TSA) as compared to normal lymphocytes with respect to acetylation and apoptotic levels. Specifically, this study analyzes the time kinetics of histone H4 and alpha-tubulin acetylation and associates these findings to the time course of TSA-induced PARP cleavage and DFF45 proteolysis. The results of this study show (1) that a non-responsive leukemic cell line to the apoptotic effects of TSA does not have increased acetylation levels in contrast to the responsive leukemic cell lines that show a hyperacetylated profile. This indicates that acetylation levels may be of special importance in accessing the potential sensitivities of leukemic cells to HDACIs, (2) TSA induced apoptosis in lymphocytes but at lower levels and (3) the lack of PARP cleavage and DFF45 proteolysis found in lymphocytes clearly differentiates the final stages apoptosis of human peripheral blood lymphocytes from those of the TSA-sensitive leukemic cell lines. Of value is that the results of this study show that the evaluation of the acetylation levels of target proteins may possibly have the potential of being used as additional indicators of the responsiveness or sensitivity of different cancer cell types to this continuously growing class of anticancer agents.","['Ninios, Yiannis P', 'Sekeri-Pataryas, Kalliope E', 'Sourlingas, Thomae G']","['Ninios YP', 'Sekeri-Pataryas KE', 'Sourlingas TG']","['Institute of Biology, National Centre for Scientific Research Demokritos, Attikis, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090925,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Tubulin)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Tubulin/metabolism']",2009/09/29 06:00,2010/06/09 06:00,['2009/09/29 06:00'],"['2009/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/03 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00464-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.09.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Jun;34(6):786-92. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.09.004.

In this study, we investigated the effects of nine naturally occurring compounds isolated from Citrus jambhiri Lush and Citrus pyriformis Hassk (Rutaceae) for their potential to modulate the activity of P-gp in the multidrug-resistant human leukaemia cell line CEM/ADR5000. Limonin, deacetylnomilin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, stigmasterol and ss-sitosterol-O-glucoside inhibited the efflux of the P-gp substrate rhodamine 123 in a concentration-dependent manner. Some of these compounds were more active than verapamil, which was used as a positive control. Treatment of drug-resistant Caco-2 cells with the most active C. jambhiri and C. pyriformis compounds increased their sensitivity to doxorubicin and completely reversed doxorubicin resistance, which agrees with a decreased P-gp activity. Limonin was the most potent P-glycoprotein inhibitor - when it was applied at a non-toxic concentration of 20 microM, it significantly enhanced doxorubicin cytotoxicity 2.98-fold (P<0.001) and 2.2-fold (P<0.001) in Caco2 and CEM/ADR5000 cells, respectively. These isolated Citrus compounds could be considered as good candidates for the development of novel P-gp/MDR1 reversal agents which may enhance the accumulation and efficacy of chemotherapy agents.","['El-Readi, Mahmoud Zaki', 'Hamdan, Dalia', 'Farrag, Nawal', 'El-Shazly, Assem', 'Wink, Michael']","['El-Readi MZ', 'Hamdan D', 'Farrag N', 'El-Shazly A', 'Wink M']","['Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg University, Im Neuenheimer Feld 364, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090924,Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Limonins)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'L0F260866S (limonin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Citrus/*metabolism', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Limonins/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Rhodamine 123/metabolism']",2009/09/29 06:00,2010/02/18 06:00,['2009/09/29 06:00'],"['2009/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/02 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-2999(09)00806-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2009.09.040 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2010 Jan 25;626(2-3):139-45. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2009.09.040.

The prognosis of aggressive ATL patients remains poor because of its resistance to conventional chemotherapy. We examined the effect of deguelin, a naturally occurring rotenoid, on HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines, KUT-1 and MT-2 cells. We found that deguelin suppressed cell proliferation and induced cell death in these cells. Immunoblot analysis showed the inhibition of survivin expression and signal transducers, and activators of transcription (STAT) 3 phosphorylation of both cells. We also observed the cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in deguelin-treated cells, indicating that deguelin induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in these cells. Furthermore, proteasome inhibitor MG132 prevented the down-regulation of survivin expression and STAT3 dephosphorylation by deguelin, suggesting that the action mechanism of deguelin involves the degradation of survivin and phosphorylated STAT3 through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. Our data indicate that deguelin presents a potent anti-proliferative effect in part via the down-regulation of survivin expression and STAT3 phosphorylation in HTLV-1-transformed cells.

The CA-074Me treatment of NIH3T3 cells inhibited cathepsin L activity, and a cathepsin L specific inhibitor, CLIK148, attenuated the Eco-MLV vector infection.

The CA-074Me treatment inhibited the Eco-MLV infection in human cells expressing the exogenous mouse ecotropic receptor and endogenous cathepsins B and L, but the CLIK148 treatment did not, showing that only the cathepsin L suppression by CLIK148 is not enough to prevent the Eco-MLV infection in cells expressing both of cathepsins B and L, and CA-074Me inhibits the Eco-MLV infection by suppressing both of cathepsins B and L.

METHODS: Using a dispersion model and the prevailing wind direction, two parishes with about 5000 inhabitants were a priori considered to be exposed to VOCs from the refinery. Numbers of observed and expected leukaemia cases in 1975-2004 were calculated using regional sex- and age-specific incidence rates. In addition, five nearby parishes (12000 inhabitants), considered unaffected by the emissions, served as a local reference area. Based on emission data, dispersion modelling and VOC measurements, the refinery's contribution to the population's exposure to carcinogenic VOCs was estimated. Published ""unit risks"" for carcinogenic VOCs were used to estimate the expected excess leukaemia risk. RESULTS: The incidence of leukaemia in the ""exposed parishes"" was significantly increased in 1975-2004 (33 cases v. 22 expected cases), owing to an increase in the last 10-year period, from 1995 to 2004 (19 cases v. 8.5 expected cases). The leukaemia incidence in the local control area was normal (50 cases v. 56 expected cases). The estimated contribution from the refinery to VOC concentrations was, however, only about 2 microg/m(3) (yearly average) for benzene, 2 microg/m(3) for ethylene, 0.5 microg/m(3) for 1,3-butadiene and 5 microg/m(3) for propene. Calculations of expected excess risk using published risk estimates would indicate a much lower excess risk in the exposed parishes. CONCLUSIONS: Using risk estimates extrapolated from high-level exposure, we would not expect an increase of leukaemia at low exposure to VOC emissions. Nevertheless, the clear elevation of leukaemia in the priori selected, exposed parishes was remarkable. Our finding may reflect a causal association due to emissions, but it could also be due to unknown confounding, or chance.","['Barregard, Lars', 'Holmberg, Erik', 'Sallsten, Gerd']","['Barregard L', 'Holmberg E', 'Sallsten G']","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital and Academy, University of Gothenburg, PO Box 414, SE-405 30 Gothenburg, Sweden. lars.barregard@amm.gu.se']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090924,Netherlands,Environ Res,Environmental research,0147621,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Petroleum)', '0 (Volatile Organic Compounds)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants/*toxicity', '*Chemical Industry', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', '*Petroleum', 'Volatile Organic Compounds/*toxicity']",2009/09/29 06:00,2009/10/27 06:00,['2009/09/29 06:00'],"['2009/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/21 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0013-9351(09)00169-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.envres.2009.09.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Environ Res. 2009 Nov;109(8):985-90. doi: 10.1016/j.envres.2009.09.001.

The purposes of this study were to examine the current health and secondary prevention behaviors of long-term HCT survivors compared with matched controls without cancer, and to identify sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with appropriate preventive practices. HCT survivors (n = 662) were drawn from 40 North American transplantation centers. Peer-nominated acquaintances of survivors matched on sex, age, education, and marital status served as controls (n = 158). Data were collected a mean of 6.7 years post-HCT (range, 1.8-22.6 years). Despite a greater frequency of physical exams, the HCT survivors had similar health and screening behaviors as the matched controls. Sociodemographic factors were associated with health prevention behaviors in expected ways. Some differences between disease group and type of transplant were found, with survivors of acute leukemia less likely to report regular exercise, autologous transplant survivors more likely than allogeneic transplant survivors to report screenings for breast and cervical cancer, and allogeneic transplant survivors more likely than autologous transplant survivors to report undergoing a skin exam in the previous year. Despite higher levels of engagement with health care providers, HCT survivors had similar health behaviors as matched controls and comparable to those reported by cancer survivors who did not undergo HCT.

However, the cure rates are unlikely to be raised further with current therapies. Since increasing the dosage of chemotherapeutic agents could also elevate toxicity, a solution to how one could achieve maximum therapeutic effect with the minimum dosage possible is imminent. One possibility is the employment of combination drug therapies. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is a widely used drug for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Its combination with other drugs presented therapeutic activities in malignant cancers other than APL. Considering the fact that ATO induces mitotic arrest prior to apoptosis induction, we attempted to investigate the potential anti-cancer effects of ATO in combination with the microtubule-stabilizing agent, paclitaxel (PTX), using malignant lymphocytes as in vitro models. Three malignant lymphocytic cell lines and primary cells were treated with ATO and/or PTX. Using the Chou-Talalay analysis for evaluation of combined effect of ATO and PTX, we found a synergistic effect of the two drugs in the inhibition of cell growth. We also found that the combination of ATO and PTX at low concentrations synergistically induced mitotic arrest followed by apoptosis in malignant lymphocytes, which increased phosphorylated cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) on Thr(161) and promoted the dysregulated activation of Cdk1. The ATO/PTX combination also significantly enhanced the activation of spindle checkpoint by inducing the formation of the inhibitory checkpoint complex BubR1/Cdc20. Our study provided the first in vitro demonstration that low concentrations of ATO and PTX synergistically induce mitotic arrest in malignant lymphocytes.","['Duan, Xu-Fang', 'Wu, Ying-Li', 'Xu, Han-Zhang', 'Zhao, Meng', 'Zhuang, Han-Yi', 'Wang, Xiao-Dong', 'Yan, Hua', 'Chen, Guo-Qiang']","['Duan XF', 'Wu YL', 'Xu HZ', 'Zhao M', 'Zhuang HY', 'Wang XD', 'Yan H', 'Chen GQ']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of National Ministry of Education, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Tubulin Modulators/*pharmacology']",2009/09/29 06:00,2010/01/29 06:00,['2009/09/29 06:00'],"['2009/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(09)00393-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2009.09.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2010 Jan 5;183(1):222-30. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2009.09.012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytogenetic and molecular pathogenesis of MDS has not been well understood. SALL4, a newly identified oncogene, modulates stem cell pluripotency and self-renewal capability in embryonic development and also plays a role in leukemogenesis. Overexpression of SALL4 induces MDS-like features and subsequent leukemic progression in transgenic mice. Here, we examined SALL4 expression levels in bone marrow mononuclear cells from MDS patients, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, and normal control subjects using a semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Higher levels of SALL4 expression were seen in MDS and AML samples than in control samples. The expression level of SALL4 positively correlated with those of MYC and CCND1, both of which are downstream target genes in the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. We therefore propose that SALL4 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of MDS by causing the aberrant activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.","['Shuai, Xiao', 'Zhou, Daobin', 'Shen, Ti', 'Wu, Yongji', 'Zhang, Jieping', 'Wang, Xuan', 'Li, Qian']","['Shuai X', 'Zhou D', 'Shen T', 'Wu Y', 'Zhang J', 'Wang X', 'Li Q']","['Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100730, PR China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (SALL4 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Wnt1 Protein)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogenes/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'Wnt1 Protein/*genetics', 'Young Adult', 'beta Catenin/*genetics']",2009/09/29 06:00,2009/10/09 06:00,['2009/09/29 06:00'],"['2009/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-4608(09)00323-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2009.06.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2009 Oct 15;194(2):119-24. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2009.06.006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that annexin II (Ann II), a high-affinity co-receptor for plasminogen/tissue plasminogen activator, plays a central role in primary hyperfibrinolysis in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The expression of Ann II in cells from patients with major subtypes of AML and the effect of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) on Ann II expression in AML cells were investigated to determine whether As2O3-mediated downregulation of Ann II could restore hemostatic stability. METHODS: A total of 103 patients (48 females and 55 males; age, 19 - 58 years) were included. Plasma samples were collected before and after treatment as well as after complete remission. Ann II and plasminogen activation were measured in leukemic cells during treatment with 1 micromol/L As2O3. RESULTS: Before As2O3 treatment, Ann II mRNA expression (real-time PCR) was the highest in M3 cells (P < 0.05), higher in M5 cells than that in M1, M2, M4, and M6 cells (P < 0.001), and positively correlated with Ann II protein expression (flow cytometry) (r = 0.752, P < 0.01). Exposure for up to 120 hours to As2O3 (1 micromol/L) had no significant effect on Ann II protein in M1 and M2 leukemic cells, but decreased Ann II protein expression twofold within 48 hours of exposure in M3 cells (P < 0.05) and twofold within 96 hours in M5 cells (P < 0.05). The rate of plasmin generation was higher in APL, M5, and M4 cells than in M1, M2, and M6 cells. CONCLUSIONS: As2O3 may reduce hyperfibrinolysis in AML by downregulation of Ann II. Furthermore, As2O3 affects more than one form of AML (APL, M4 and M5), suggesting its potential role in their management.","['Zhang, Xiao-hui', 'Hu, Yu', 'Bao, Li', 'Jiang, Qian', 'Yang, Ling-hua', 'Lu, Xi-jing', 'Hong, Mei', 'Xia, Ling-hui', 'Guo, Tao', 'Shen, Guan-xin', 'Zhu, Hong-hu', 'Zhao, Ting', 'Song, Shan-jun']","['Zhang XH', 'Hu Y', 'Bao L', 'Jiang Q', 'Yang LH', 'Lu XJ', 'Hong M', 'Xia LH', 'Guo T', 'Shen GX', 'Zhu HH', 'Zhao T', 'Song SJ']","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430022, China. zhangxh100@sina.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Annexin A2)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Annexin A2/*metabolism', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Young Adult']",2009/09/29 06:00,2010/02/05 06:00,['2009/09/29 06:00'],"['2009/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2009 Sep 5;122(17):1969-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pitx3 has been implicated in the proper development of mDA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which are selectively lost in Parkinson's disease. However, the basic mechanisms underlying its role in mDA neuron development and/or survival are poorly understood. Toward this goal, we sought to identify downstream target genes of Pitx3 by comparing gene expression profiles in mDA neurons of wild-type and Pitx3-deficient aphakia mice. This global gene expression analysis revealed many potential target genes of Pitx3; in particular, the expression of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 and dopamine transporter, responsible for dopamine storage and reuptake, respectively, is greatly reduced in mDA neurons by Pitx3 ablation. In addition, gain-of-function analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation strongly indicate that Pitx3 may directly activate transcription of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 and dopamine transporter genes, critically contributing to neurotransmission and/or survival of mDA neurons. As the two genes have been known to be regulated by Nurr1, another key dopaminergic transcription factor, we propose that Pitx3 and Nurr1 may coordinately regulate mDA specification and survival, at least in part, through a merging and overlapping downstream pathway.","['Hwang, Dong-Youn', 'Hong, Sunghoi', 'Jeong, Joo-Won', 'Choi, Sangdun', 'Kim, Hansoo', 'Kim, Jangwoo', 'Kim, Kwang-Soo']","['Hwang DY', 'Hong S', 'Jeong JW', 'Choi S', 'Kim H', 'Kim J', 'Kim KS']","['Molecular Neurobiology Laboratory, McLean Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Belmont, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 MH048866/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 MH048866/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DC006501/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 NS039793/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS084869/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090924,England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Vesicular Monoamine Transport Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein PITX3)', 'VTD58H1Z2X (Dopamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation/methods', 'Dopamine/*metabolism', 'Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mesencephalon/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microdissection/methods', 'Neurons/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vesicular Monoamine Transport Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/09/29 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/29 06:00'],"['2009/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JNC6404 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06404.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 2009 Dec;111(5):1202-12. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06404.x.

The erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog family of receptor TKs, to which EGFR (HER1) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu TKs belong, has been implicated in a variety of cancers, and several agents that inhibit these TKs are in clinical use, with many more in various stages of development. OBJECTIVES: To summarize current knowledge about neratinib (HKI-272), an oral, irreversible dual inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 and to define its future clinical role, especially in the context of related agents that are either available or in the pipeline. METHODS: A Medline search using Pubmed was conducted using the keywords neratinib, HKI-272, EGFR, HER2, lapatinib, trastuzumab, erlotinib, gefitinib, cetuximab and panitumumab. Relevant abstracts presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology and San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium meetings were also reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Both preclinical and human studies have shown that neratinib has promising activity in both advanced breast cancer and NSCLC with an acceptable safety profile. The data support its continued clinical development.","['Bose, Prithviraj', 'Ozer, Howard']","['Bose P', 'Ozer H']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology-Oncology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Quinolines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'JJH94R3PWB (neratinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'ErbB Receptors/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Quinolines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/antagonists & inhibitors']",2009/09/29 06:00,2010/02/26 06:00,['2009/09/29 06:00'],"['2009/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543780903305428 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2009 Nov;18(11):1735-51. doi: 10.1517/13543780903305428.,,,,52,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Darinaparsin has significant activity in a broad spectrum of hematologic and solid tumors in preclinical models. Here, we review the literature describing the signaling pathways and mechanisms of action of darinaparsin and compare them to mechanisms of cell death induced by arsenic trioxide. Darinaparsin has overlapping, but distinct, signaling mechanisms.

In the present study, 214 patients with AL (106 children and 108 adults) were evaluated for the aberrant expression of CD33 in ALL (B cell and T cell) and CD3, CD5, CD7, and CD19 in AML. In B-ALL, aberrant expression of CD33 was found in 39 and 23% cases of adult and children, respectively. In T-ALL, CD33 was seen in 33% cases of adults while in children CD33 was not observed. In AML, aberrant expression of CD19 was expressed in 52 and 32% while CD7 was expressed in 14 and 15% cases of childhood and adult AML, respectively. Among FAB subtypes, aberrant expression of CD19 and CD7 was more commonly seen in M5 subtype. One adult patient (AML-M5) showed expression of CD3, CD5, and CD19. In summary, aberrant phenotype was commonly seen in adults than childhood B-ALL while in AML, aberrant phenotype was more common in children than adults. CD19 was most commonly expressed antigen followed by CD7 in both childhood and adult AML. Interestingly, aberrant phenotype was not found in childhood T-ALL; however, it was seen in 33% cases of adults. We did not find any association of aberrant phenotype with adverse prognosis factors, CD34 marker, and clinical outcome except the absence of auer rod which was found to be significantly associated with aberrant phenotype of childhood AML (P = 0.01).","['Bhushan, Bharat', 'Chauhan, Pradeep Singh', 'Saluja, Sumita', 'Verma, Saurabh', 'Mishra, Ashwani Kumar', 'Siddiqui, Saeed', 'Kapur, Sujala']","['Bhushan B', 'Chauhan PS', 'Saluja S', 'Verma S', 'Mishra AK', 'Siddiqui S', 'Kapur S']","['Institute of Pathology, Indian Council of Medical Research, Safdarjung Hospital Campus, New Delhi, 110029, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090925,Italy,Clin Exp Med,Clinical and experimental medicine,100973405,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/09/26 06:00,2010/03/13 06:00,['2009/09/26 06:00'],"['2009/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10238-009-0067-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Med. 2010 Mar;10(1):33-40. doi: 10.1007/s10238-009-0067-8.

Recently, it was shown that the ER membrane leaks Ca(2+) that is captured and delivered back by mitochondria in order to prevent its loss. Thus, we hypothesized that the highly active and abundant ER in MM cells results in greater Ca(2+)-regulation by mitochondria which would render them sensitive to mitochondrial inhibitors. Here, we indeed find that Ca(2+) leak is greater in 3 MM, when compared to 2 B-cell leukemia cell lines. Moreover, this greater leak in MM cells is associated with hypersensitivity to various mitochondrial inhibitors, including CCCP. Consistent with our hypothesis, CCCP is more potent in inducing the unfolded protein response marker, CHOP/GADD153 in MM versus B-cell leukemia lines. Additionally, MM cells are found to be significantly more sensitive to clinically used fenofibrate and troglitazone, both of which were recently shown to have inhibitory effects on mitochondrial function. Overall, our results demonstrate that the unusually high ER activity in MM cells may be exploited for therapeutic benefit through the use of mitochondrial inhibitors including troglitazone and fenofibrate.","['Kurtoglu, Metin', 'Philips, Katherine', 'Liu, Huaping', 'Boise, Lawrence H', 'Lampidis, Theodore J']","['Kurtoglu M', 'Philips K', 'Liu H', 'Boise LH', 'Lampidis TJ']","['Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy and Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, 1550 NW 10th Ave, PAP Bldg, Room# 115, Miami, FL 33136, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA037109/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA037109-21/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA127910/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37109/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090925,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chromans)', '0 (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '0 (Uncoupling Agents)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', '555-60-2 (Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone)', 'I66ZZ0ZN0E (Troglitazone)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'U202363UOS (Fenofibrate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromans/pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*metabolism', 'Fenofibrate/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors/*agonists', 'Thiazolidinediones/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/metabolism', 'Troglitazone', 'Uncoupling Agents/*pharmacology', 'Unfolded Protein Response/drug effects']",2009/09/26 06:00,2010/05/07 06:00,['2009/09/26 06:00'],"['2009/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-009-1143-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2010 May;66(1):129-40. doi: 10.1007/s00280-009-1143-1.

Deregulation of miRNAs is common in human tumorigenesis. The miRNAs, MIR-15a/16-1, at chromosome band 13q14 are down-regulated in the majority of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have measured the expression of MIR-15a/16-1, and 92 computationally-predicted MIR-15a/16-1 target genes in CLL patients and in normal controls. We identified 35 genes that are deregulated in CLL patients, 5 of which appear to be specific targets of the MIR-15a/16-1 cluster. These targets included 2 genes (BAZ2A and RNF41) that were significantly up-regulated (p<0.05) and 3 genes (RASSF5, MKK3 and LRIG1) that were significantly down-regulated (p<0.05) in CLL patients with down-regulated MIR-15a/16-1 expression. SIGNIFICANCE: The genes identified here as being subject to MIR-15a/16-1 regulation could represent direct or indirect targets of these miRNAs. Many of these are good biological candidates for involvement in tumorigenesis and as such, may be important in the aetiology of CLL.","['Hanlon, Katy', 'Rudin, Claudius E', 'Harries, Lorna W']","['Hanlon K', 'Rudin CE', 'Harries LW']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust, Exeter, Devon, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090925,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (MIRN15 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN16 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Chromosomes/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis', 'RNA/metabolism']",2009/09/26 06:00,2010/02/02 06:00,['2009/09/26 06:00'],"['2009/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0007169 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Sep 25;4(9):e7169. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0007169.,PMC2745703,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we show that in human leukemia Jurkat cells, which express mainly SMS1, Fas ligand (FasL) treatment inhibited SMS activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner before nuclear fragmentation. The SMS inhibition elicited by FasL (1) was abrogated by benzyloxycarbonyl valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-(O-methyl)-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk), a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor; (2) did not occur in caspase-8-deficient cells and (3) was not affected in caspase-9-deficient cells. Western blot experiments showed SMS1 cleavage in a caspase-dependent manner upon FasL treatment. In a cell-free system, caspase-2, -7, -8 and -9, but not caspase-3 and -10, cleaved SMS1. In HeLa cells, SMS1 was Golgi localized and relocated throughout the cytoplasm in cells exhibiting an early apoptotic phenotype on FasL treatment. zVAD-fmk prevented FasL-induced SMS1 relocation. Thus, FasL-mediated SMS1 inhibition and relocation depend on caspase activation and likely represent proximal events in Fas signaling. FasL-induced ceramide production and cell death were enhanced in cells stably expressing an siRNA against SMS1. Conversely, in cells stably overexpressing SMS1, FasL neither increased ceramide generation nor efficiently induced cell death. Altogether, our data show that SMS1 is a novel caspase target that is functionally involved in the regulation of FasL-induced apoptosis.","['Lafont, E', 'Milhas, D', 'Carpentier, S', 'Garcia, V', 'Jin, Z-X', 'Umehara, H', 'Okazaki, T', 'Schulze-Osthoff, K', 'Levade, T', 'Benoist, H', 'Segui, B']","['Lafont E', 'Milhas D', 'Carpentier S', 'Garcia V', 'Jin ZX', 'Umehara H', 'Okazaki T', 'Schulze-Osthoff K', 'Levade T', 'Benoist H', 'Segui B']","['Cancer Department, U858 INSERM, Equipe 14, BP84225, 31432 Toulouse cedex 4, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090925,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', 'EC 2.7.8.- (SGMS1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.8.- (Transferases (Other Substituted Phosphate Groups))', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Ceramides/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fas Ligand Protein/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Golgi Apparatus/enzymology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference/physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Sphingomyelins/*metabolism', 'Transferases (Other Substituted Phosphate Groups)/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/09/26 06:00,2010/06/16 06:00,['2009/09/26 06:00'],"['2009/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd2009130 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2009.130 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2010 Apr;17(4):642-54. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2009.130.

The expression of DLK1 mRNA in patients in the test group was higher than that in the control group (P=0.018), while there was no significance between acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myelogenous leukemia (P>0.05).The expression of DLK1 mRNA in the test group at onset had no relation with the WBC and platelet count in the total peripheral blood, and the same was true for blast cell rates in bone marrow cells.The level of DLK1 protein in the test group was higher than that in the control group, which was consistent with the mRNA expression (P=0.042). The expression of DLK1 mRNA decreased gradually with K562 cells towards hemin-induced erythroid differentiation. CONCLUSION: DLK1 gene may be involved in leukemia,but the mRNA level of DLK1 has no relation with some clinical characteristics of AL patients at onset. DLK1 may inhibit the erythroid differentiation of K562 cells.","['Tang, Xueyuan', 'Long, Chan', 'Wang, Chenghong', 'Xiao, Guangfen']","['Tang X', 'Long C', 'Wang C', 'Xiao G']","['Department of Hematology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.']",['chi'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

Imatinib failure is commonly caused by BCR-ABL mutations. Here, dasatinib efficacy was analyzed in patients recruited to phase 2/3 trials with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia with or without BCR-ABL mutations after prior imatinib. Among 1043 patients, 39% had a preexisting BCR-ABL mutation, including 48% of 805 patients with imatinib resistance or suboptimal response. Sixty-threedifferent BCR-ABL mutations affecting 49 amino acids were detected at baseline, with G250, M351, M244, and F359 most frequently affected. After 2 years of follow-up, dasatinib treatment of imatinib-resistant patients with or without a mutation resulted in notable response rates (complete cytogenetic response: 43% vs 47%) and durable progression-free survival (70% vs 80%). High response rates were achieved with different mutations except T315I, including highly imatinib-resistant mutations in the P-loop region. Impaired responses were observed with some mutations with a dasatinib median inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) greater than 3nM; among patients with mutations with lower or unknown IC(50), efficacy was comparable with those with no mutation. Overall, dasatinib has durable efficacy in patients with or without BCR-ABL mutations.

Given the strong association between the polymerase domain of reverse transcriptase and a DNA 3' primer terminus, we asked whether the distance from the primer terminus is paramount for positioning DNA 3' end-directed cleavages or whether preferred sequences and/or a cleavage window are important as they are for RNA 5' end-directed cleavages. Using the reverse transcriptases of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV), we determined the effects of sequence, distance, and substrate end structure on DNA 3' end-directed cleavages. Utilizing sequence-matched substrates, our analyses showed that DNA 3' end-directed cleavages share the same sequence preferences as RNA 5' end-directed cleavages, but the sites must fall in a narrow window between the 15th and 20th nucleotides from the recessed end for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and between the 17th and 20th nucleotides for M-MuLV. Substrates with an RNA 5' end recessed by 1 (HIV-1) or 2-3 (M-MuLV) bases on a longer DNA could accommodate both types of end-directed cleavage, but further recession of the RNA 5' end excluded DNA 3' end-directed cleavages. For HIV-1 RNase H, the inclusion of the cognate dNTP enhanced DNA 3' end-directed cleavages at the 17th and 18th nucleotides. These data demonstrate that all three modes of retroviral RNase H cleavage share sequence determinants that may be useful in designing assays to identify inhibitors of retroviral RNases H.","['Schultz, Sharon J', 'Zhang, Miaohua', 'Champoux, James J']","['Schultz SJ', 'Zhang M', 'Champoux JJ']","['Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA051605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA051605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090924,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (ribonuclease HI)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Crystallography, X-Ray/methods', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Retroviridae/enzymology/*genetics', 'Ribonuclease H/*chemistry']",2009/09/26 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/26 06:00'],"['2009/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)37812-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.043158 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Nov 20;284(47):32225-38. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.043158.

Bacterial infections predominate during the initial phases of neutropenic episodes. The spectrum of bacterial infection continues to evolve globally and locally at the institutional level, as do patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility/resistance. These trends are often associated with local treatment practices (eg, use of antimicrobial prophylaxis, open versus restricted formularies, clinical pathways and/or guidelines) and have a significant effect on the nature of empiric antimicrobial therapy. Increasing rates of resistance among gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria are posing new therapeutic challenges. These challenges can to some extent be overcome by new drug development. Many novel agents for the treatment of resistant gram-positive infections have been developed and are being evaluated in clinical trials. Newer agents for the treatment of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea are also in the pipeline. Far fewer options to treat multi-drug resistant gram-negative infections exist, and new drug development is lagging behind. Consequently, the judicious use of currently available agents is essential. This is best achieved by the development of multidisciplinary antibiotic stewardship teams that gather baseline data, make recommendations for appropriate antimicrobial usage, and provide monitoring and feedback services to clinical care providers. Along with strict adherence to infection control policies, antimicrobial stewardship provides the best strategies for the management of infectious complications in patients with hematologic malignancies and other high-risk settings.","['Rolston, Kenneth V I']",['Rolston KV'],"['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas M.

""First-generation"" recombinant forms of TPO were developed over a decade ago and were found to increase the platelet count in patients undergoing nonmyeloablative chemotherapy, in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and myelodysplasia, as well as in platelet apheresis donors. Thrombopoietin did not improve platelet counts in patients undergoing stem cell transplantation or acute leukemia induction. Further development ended when antibodies formed against one of the recombinant proteins. Subsequently, 2 ""second-generation"" TPO mimetics have been developed and are entering clinical practice: romiplostim and eltrombopag. Romiplostim is an injectable peptide TPO mimetic that activates the TPO receptor just like native TPO. Eltrombopag is an oral nonpeptide TPO mimetic that activates the TPO receptor by binding to a different region of the TPO receptor that does not compete with TPO binding. Both increased the platelet counts in healthy subjects and in over two thirds of patients with ITP both before and after splenectomy; responses were maintained for at least 1 year. Romiplostim and eltrombopag are now US Food and Drug Administration approved for the second-line treatment of patients with ITP. Adverse events have been few, but long-term assessment for reticulin formation, increased bone marrow blasts, and thromboembolism is ongoing. Studies are under way to assess the efficacy of these drugs in the treatment of other thrombocytopenic disorders associated with chemotherapy, myelodysplasia, and chronic hepatitis.","['Kuter, David J']",['Kuter DJ'],"['Hematology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA. kuter.david@MGH.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['HL72299/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL82889/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma,Clinical lymphoma & myeloma,101256500,"['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'GN5XU2DXKV (romiplostim)', 'S56D65XJ9G (eltrombopag)']",IM,"['Benzoates/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Hematology/methods/trends', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/therapeutic use', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Chemical', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Platelet Count', 'Pyrazoles/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Fc/therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Thrombocytopenia/drug therapy', 'Thrombopoiesis/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Thrombopoietin/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/09/26 06:00,2010/01/15 06:00,['2009/09/26 06:00'],"['2009/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['UX5WQ673X1835196 [pii]', '10.3816/CLM.2009.s.034 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma. 2009;9 Suppl 3:S347-56. doi: 10.3816/CLM.2009.s.034.,,,,84,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improvements in somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technology, enabling the cloning of Dolly the sheep, and the derivation and differentiation of human embryonic stem cells raised hopes that normal cells could be generated to replace diseased or injured tissue. At the same time, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that somatic cells of one tissue are capable of generating cells of another tissue. It was theorized that any cell might be reprogrammed, by exposure to a new environment, to become another cell type. This concept contradicts two established hypotheses: (1) that only specific tissues are generated from the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm and (2) that tissue cells arise from a rare population of tissue-specific stem cells in a hierarchical fashion. SCNT, cell fusion experiments, and most recent gene transfer studies also contradict these hypotheses, as they demonstrate that mature somatic cells can be reprogrammed to regain pluripotent (or even totipotent) stem cell capacity. On the basis of the stem cell theory, hierarchical cancer stem cell differentiation models have been proposed. Cancer cell plasticity is an established phenomenon that supports the notion that cellular phenotype and function might be altered. Therefore, mechanisms of cellular plasticity should be exploited and the clinical significance of the cancer stem cell theory cautiously assessed.","['Estrov, Zeev']",['Estrov Z'],"['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

In lower-risk, transfusion-dependent patients with MDS without del(5q), lenalidomide has significant, albeit less erythropoietic, activity that could relate to dual effects on both the MDS clone and the bone marrow environment.

We now have a panoply of technologic advances that allow us to characterize individual leukemias by molecular profiles that relate directly to clinical behavior, to detect minimal residual disease, and to begin to develop ""targeted"" therapeutic strategies based on molecular considerations. There are a number of challenges surrounding this task: first, how to combine these agents with traditional chemotherapeutics and/or with each other to maximize leukemic cell kill and increase the cure rate; second, how to use these targeted agents in the minimal residual disease with potential curative intent; third, for patients unable to tolerate or unlikely to benefit from aggressive approaches, how to use one or more of these agents to reduce tumor bulk and either permit some restoration of normal marrow function or induce morphologic and functional differentiation of the leukemic clone to overcome the leukemia-associated bone marrow failure; and lastly, how to measure the effects of these agents on the molecular and cellular biologic levels in ways that correlate with and might even predict overall clinical outcome. These challenges are further complicated by the inherent heterogeneity in host biology; disease etiology and biology; and interactions among host, disease, and treatment that ultimately determine individual clinical outcomes. Toward this end, we will discuss selected issues surrounding new clinical trial designs and the development of clinically relevant molecular endpoints that might facilitate the development of new treatment approaches that will improve the outlook for adults with acute leukemias.","['Smith, B Douglas', 'Karp, Judith E']","['Smith BD', 'Karp JE']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD 21231-1000, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2P30 CA06973-44/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA70095/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA070095/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR000052/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR000052-466553/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma,Clinical lymphoma & myeloma,101256500,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Therapy/methods', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology/*therapy', 'Medical Oncology/*methods', 'Neoplasm, Residual/therapy', 'Research Design', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/09/26 06:00,2010/01/15 06:00,['2009/09/26 06:00'],"['2009/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['00265271458H7774 [pii]', '10.3816/CLM.2009.s.027 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma. 2009;9 Suppl 3:S296-301. doi: 10.3816/CLM.2009.s.027.,PMC2851207,['NIHMS187883'],,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A minority of patients have clinical and biologic features associated with a very high risk of relapse. For the remaining patients, no clear prognostic factors can be identified at diagnosis. The degree of treatment response is likely to be an informative predictor of outcome for these patients. Modern assays to detect AML cells that are undetectable by conventional morphologic techniques, ie, minimal residual disease (MRD), can potentially improve measurements of treatment response. It is plausible that modifications to treatment based on the results of these assays will improve clinical management and ultimately increase cure rates. Established MRD assays for AML are based on either polymerase chain reaction amplification of genetic abnormalities or flow cytometric detection of abnormal immunophenotypes. Residual disease and treatment response can be measured by these assays in a manner that is much more sensitive and objective than that afforded by conventional morphologic examination. The expanding use of MRD testing is beginning to change the definitions of treatment response and of remission.

However, imatinib failure is observed in around 25%-30% of patients. With the availability of second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and/or allogeneic transplantation, many of these patients with imatinib failure can still achieve durable cytogenetic and molecular responses. Early evidence of imatinib resistance, when the biology of the emerging leukemia might still be relatively favorable, is the best time to switch to second-line therapy. Close cytogenetic and molecular monitoring will facilitate early intervention in appropriate cases. However, caution should be used when interpreting minimal residual disease data, and the danger of inappropriate changes in therapy based on assay fluctuations should be recognized. A significant increase in the level of BCR-ABL to a level > 0.1% on the international scale (major molecular response) should prompt a repeat BCR-ABL assay, a mutation screen, and possibly marrow cytogenetics. What constitutes a significant increase depends on the laboratory-specific measurement reliability. The possibilities of poor compliance or drug interactions should be considered. If the repeat BCR-ABL assay, fluorescence in situ hybridization assay, or cytogenetics confirms loss of complete cytogenetic response or if a mutation is identified, a dose increase or a switch in therapy to a second-line kinase inhibitor might be indicated. At least until complete molecular response is achieved, regular real-time polymerase chain reaction monitoring reinforces the fact that leukemia is still present and that compliance is a challenge that requires ongoing vigilance from the patient and the clinician.","['Hughes, Timothy P', 'Branford, Susan']","['Hughes TP', 'Branford S']","['Division of Haematology, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide 5000, South Australia, Australia. tim.hughes@health.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma,Clinical lymphoma & myeloma,101256500,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Medical Oncology/*methods', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/09/26 06:00,2010/01/15 06:00,['2009/09/26 06:00'],"['2009/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['M27342HQT7X15684 [pii]', '10.3816/CLM.2009.s.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma. 2009;9 Suppl 3:S266-71. doi: 10.3816/CLM.2009.s.022.,,,,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Relapse risk can be predicted by early response to therapy, clinical and pharmacogenetic features of the host, and genetic characteristics of leukemic cells. Though early treatment response can be assessed by the peripheral blast cell count after 1 week of single-agent glucocorticoid treatment or percent of bone marrow blasts by morphology after 1 or 2 weeks of multiagent induction treatment, determination of minimal residual disease by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or flow cytometry after 2 to 6 weeks of induction is the most precise and useful measure. Augmented therapy has improved outcome for the poor responders to initial treatment. Infants with mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged ALL comprise a very poor-risk group wherein further intensification of chemotherapy causes significant toxicity. Hybrid protocols incorporating drugs effective for acute myeloid leukemia could improve survival, a strategy being tested in international trials. Studies on the biology of MLL-induced leukemogenesis have prompted the development of novel targeted agents, currently under evaluation in clinical trials. Short-term outcomes of patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive ALL have improved significantly by adding tyrosine kinase inhibitors to standard chemotherapy regimens. New agents and methods to overcome resistance are under investigation, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation is recommended for certain subsets of patients, for example those with Ph+ and T-cell ALL with poor early response.

According to recent gene expression profiling data, T-ALL and T-LBL can be separated by prediction analysis of microarrays showing an overexpression of MML1 in T-LBL and CD47 in T-ALL. Immunophenotypes of T-LBL and T-ALL are identical but differ in frequency, with a higher rate of cortical or mature immunophenotypes in T-LBL, which is probably related to the higher rate (> 90%) of mediastinal tumors. Treatment approaches in T-LBL changed from conventional non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) protocols to intensive NHL protocols but recently to ALL-designed protocols. T-ALL remission rates are 90%, and overall survival (OS) has improved to 60%-70%. Mediastinal tumors resolve in most cases of T-ALL with chemotherapy only, whereas in T-LBL additional mediastinal irradiation seems to be beneficial. Strategies for stem cell transplantation (SCT) in T-LBL and T-ALL differ. Autologous SCT in complete remission (CR) in T-LBL gives a 70% survival rate, which is similar to chemotherapy alone. In T-ALL, the subtypes of early and mature T-ALL have a poor outcome with chemotherapy alone (< 30%) and might profit from an allogeneic transplantation in first CR (OS > 50%). There seems to be no need for transplantation in thymic T-ALL in first CR. Prognostic factors are published for T-ALL but not for T-LBL. MRD may guide further treatment strategies in T-ALL and probably also in T-LBL as indications for a SCT or for the evaluation of novel, particularly T-cell-specific, drugs.","['Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Gokbuget, Nicola']","['Hoelzer D', 'Gokbuget N']","['Onkologikum Frankfurt, D- 60596 Frankfurt, Germany. hoelzer@em.uni-frankfurt.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma,Clinical lymphoma & myeloma,101256500,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Mediastinum/pathology', 'Medical Oncology/methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",2009/09/26 06:00,2010/01/15 06:00,['2009/09/26 06:00'],"['2009/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['T625844186G7N1L0 [pii]', '10.3816/CLM.2009.s.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma. 2009;9 Suppl 3:S214-21. doi: 10.3816/CLM.2009.s.015.,,,,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study aims at investigating the effect of a cell-free fraction of kefir on HuT-102 cells, which are HTLV-1-positive malignant T-lymphocytes. Cells were incubated with different kefir concentrations: the cytotoxicity of the compound was evaluated by determining the percentage viability of cells. The effect of all the noncytotoxic concentrations of kefir cell-free fraction on the proliferation of HuT-102 cells was then assessed. The levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha mRNA upon kefir treatment were then analyzed using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Finally, the growth inhibitory effects of kefir on cell cycle progression and/or apoptosis were assessed by flow cytometry. The maximum cytotoxicity recorded at 80 microg/microL for 48 hours was only 43%. The percent reduction in proliferation was very significant, dose and time dependent, and reached 98% upon 60-microg/microL treatment for 24 hours. Kefir cell-free fraction caused the downregulation of TGF-alpha, which is a cytokine that induces the proliferation and replication of cells. Finally, a marked increase in cell cycle distribution was noted in the pre-G1 phase. In conclusion, kefir is effective in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of HTLV-1-positive malignant T-lymphocytes.

Dysfunction of p53 leads to resistance to fludarabine-based therapies. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKi) are a novel class of agents that induce apoptosis in CLL cells independent of p53 mutational status. The synthetic flavone flavopiridol demonstrated promising in vitro activity in CLL. In initial phase I studies using a continuous infusion dosing schedule in a variety of malignancies, no clinical activity was observed. Detailed pharmacokinetic modeling led to the development of a novel dosing schedule designed to achieve target drug concentrations in vivo. In phase I testing, this dosing schedule resulted in acute tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) as the dose-limiting toxicity. With the implementation of a standardized protocol to prevent severe TLS, flavopiridol was administered safely, and responses were observed in heavily pretreated, fludarabine-refractory patients, cytogenetically high-risk patients, and patients with bulky lymphadenopathy. In a pharmacokinetic analysis, flavopiridol area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) correlated with clinical response and cytokine release syndrome. Phase II studies are under way with encouraging preliminary results. Flavopiridol is currently under active investigation in combination with other agents and as a means to eradicate minimal residual disease in patients following cytoreductive chemotherapy. Several other investigational CDKi in preclinical and early clinical development are briefly discussed in this review.","['Christian, Beth A', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Byrd, John C', 'Lin, Thomas S']","['Christian BA', 'Grever MR', 'Byrd JC', 'Lin TS']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA. beth.christian@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['5U01 CA76576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA102276/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA112947-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma,Clinical lymphoma & myeloma,101256500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Flavonoids/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Medical Oncology/methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperidines/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/09/26 06:00,2010/01/15 06:00,['2009/09/26 06:00'],"['2009/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['U0585332P3807873 [pii]', '10.3816/CLM.2009.s.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma. 2009;9 Suppl 3:S179-85. doi: 10.3816/CLM.2009.s.009.,,,,52,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The serum protein were isolated from patients with RAEB, acute myeloid leukemia or normal subjects by 2-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), and the electrophoresis gels were obtained to identify the differentially reacting protein spots. The replica gels of the differentially reacting proteins were analyzed to locate the matching protein spots, which were identified by peptide mass fingerprint based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and database searching. RESULTS: Seven differentially expressed proteins in RAEB were found by 2-DE. Of the 7 proteins, 4 were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS to have significantly differential expression in RAEB, including dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP/CD26), polymerase (DNA directed) kappa, PRO2044 and an albumin-like protein. CONCLUSION: 2-DE-based serum proteome profiling helps identify serum proteomic biomarkers related to MDS. DDP/CD26 has increased expression in the serum in RAEB subtype MDS, suggesting its possible role in advanced MDS.","['Zhong, Li-ye', 'Liu, Tian-hao', 'Li, Yang-qiu', 'Geng, Su-xia', 'Lu, Ze-sheng', 'Weng, Jian-yu', 'Wu, Sui-jing', 'Luo, Cheng-wei', 'Du, Xin']","['Zhong LY', 'Liu TH', 'Li YQ', 'Geng SX', 'Lu ZS', 'Weng JY', 'Wu SJ', 'Luo CW', 'Du X']","['Department of Hematology, Guangdong General Hospital/Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China. zhongliye99@163.com']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,"['EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (POLK protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.14.- (Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases)']",IM,"['Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/*blood/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*blood', 'Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/classification/genetics', '*Proteomics']",2009/09/26 06:00,2011/04/05 06:00,['2009/09/26 06:00'],"['2009/09/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2009 Sep;29(9):1799-801.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The conventional therapeutic modalities are mostly ineffective and thus new therapeutic strategies for malignant neuroblastoma are urgently warranted. We examined the synergistic efficacy of combination of sorafenib (SF) and genistein (GST) in human malignant neuroblastoma SK-N-DZ (N-Myc amplified) and SH-SY5Y (N-Myc non-amplified) cell lines. MTT assay showed dose-dependent decrease in cell viability and the combination therapy more prominently inhibited the cell proliferation in both cell lines than either treatment alone. Apoptosis was confirmed morphologically by Wright staining. Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle phase distribution and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining showed increase in subG1 DNA content and early apoptosis, respectively, after treatment with the combination of drugs. Apoptosis was further confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Combination therapy showed activation of caspase-8, cleavage of Bid to tBid, increase in p53 and p21 expression, down regulation of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1, and increase in Bax:Bcl-2 ratio to trigger apoptosis. Down regulation of MDR, hTERT, N-Myc, VEGF, FGF-2, NF-kappaB, p-Akt, and c-IAP2 indicated suppression of angiogenic and survival pathways. Mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and Smac into cytosol indicated involvement of mitochondia in apoptosis. Increases in proteolytic activities of calpain and caspase-3 were also confirmed. Our results suggested that combination of SF and GST inhibited angiogenic and survival factors and increased apoptosis via receptor and mitochondria mediated pathways in both neuroblastoma SK-N-DZ and SH-SY5Y cell lines. Thus, this combination of drugs could be a potential therapeutic strategy against human malignant neuroblastoma cells having N-Myc amplification or non-amplification.","['Roy Choudhury, Subhasree', 'Karmakar, Surajit', 'Banik, Naren L', 'Ray, Swapan K']","['Roy Choudhury S', 'Karmakar S', 'Banik NL', 'Ray SK']","['Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, University of South Carolina School of Medicine, Building 2, Room C11, 6439 Garners Ferry Road, Columbia, SC 29209, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01CA-91460/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01NS-57811/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090924,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inducing Agents)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inducing Agents/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Amplification/drug effects', 'Genistein/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neuroblastoma/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sorafenib', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2009/09/25 06:00,2011/02/04 06:00,['2009/09/25 06:00'],"['2009/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-009-9324-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2010 Dec;28(6):812-24. doi: 10.1007/s10637-009-9324-7.

SHM remains the definitive memory imprint in normal human B cells, but CD27 expression also delineates memory. Recently, dye extrusion adenosine triphosphate-binding transporter assays identified circulating isotype-switched memory B cells that lacked CD27, yet exhibited low levels of SHM. To extend findings, we report a pre-switched CD27(-ve) circulating memory B-cell population in normal blood using comparable assays, and isolated CD19(+)IgM(+)D(+)CD27(-ve) cells (>99% purity) for the analysis of IGHV5/IGHV3-IGHM transcripts. Of these (n=334), approximately 78% were germ line and naive B cell derived. Strikingly, 21.9% of the transcripts were mutated. They showed 3-5 mutations (13.5% of sequences) and >5 mutations (8.4% of sequences) per transcript. Accrual of mutations in a subset of CD19(+)IgM(+)D(+)CD27(-ve) cells define a new circulating pre-switched memory B-cell pool, present in substantial numbers in the population harboring naive B cells. These CD19(+)IgM(+)D(+)CD27(-ve) memory B cells may have a distinct lineage and function, and seem relevant to understanding origins of malignant B cells, in particular those of hairy cell leukemia cells, which display mutated V genes yet lack CD27 expression.","['Weston-Bell, N', 'Townsend, M', 'Di Genova, G', 'Forconi, F', 'Sahota, S S']","['Weston-Bell N', 'Townsend M', 'Di Genova G', 'Forconi F', 'Sahota SS']","['Cancer Sciences Division, School of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090924,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Immunoglobulin D)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD19/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Lineage/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin D/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin M/metabolism', 'Immunologic Memory/*genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/*metabolism']",2009/09/25 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/25 06:00'],"['2009/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009178 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.178 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Nov;23(11):2075-80. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.178.

Identifying novel agents that have the potential to target these LSPC in their niche microenvironment will aid in the characterization of candidate agents for post-remission chemotherapy. Using an in vitro model, we found that 48-h culture with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) resulted in a 34% reduction in CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(+) LSPC number, whereas normal CD34(+)CD38(-) haemapoietic stem cells were insensitive to this agent. As there was considerable heterogeneity in LSPC response to Mylotarg treatment, various factors potentially underpinning the differential response were assessed. LSPC that overexpressed CD33 (P=0.01), which were P-glycoprotein-negative (P=0.008) and with internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the FLT3 gene (FLT3/ITD) status (P=0.006) responded better to Mylotarg treatment. LSPC from patient samples that have these combined characteristics as well as low LSPC burden showed significantly more chemosensitivity to Mylotarg compared with all other cases (P=0.002). In multivariate analysis, LSPC burden and FLT3 status were found to be predictors of LSPC chemosensitivity to Mylotarg treatment (P<0.0001). In conclusion, we have shown heterogeneity in the LSPC compartment of AML patients underpinning differential in vitro sensitivity to Mylotarg.","['Jawad, M', 'Seedhouse, C', 'Mony, U', 'Grundy, M', 'Russell, N H', 'Pallis, M']","['Jawad M', 'Seedhouse C', 'Mony U', 'Grundy M', 'Russell NH', 'Pallis M']","['Division of Haematology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK. mays.jawad@nottingham.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090924,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis', 'Aminoglycosides/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Prognosis', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2009/09/25 06:00,2010/01/28 06:00,['2009/09/25 06:00'],"['2009/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009199 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.199 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Jan;24(1):74-80. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.199.

Aberrant expression of EVI-1 has been frequently found in myeloid leukaemia as well as in several solid tumours, and is associated with a poor patient survival. It was recently shown that EVI-1 associates with two different histone methyltransferases (HMTs), SUV39H1 and G9a. However, the functional roles of these HMTs in EVI-1-mediated leukemogenesis remain unclear. In this study, we showed that EVI-1 physically interacts with SUV39H1 and G9a, but not with Set9. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that EVI-1 colocalizes with these HMTs in nuclei. We also found that the catalytically inactive form of SUV39H1 abrogates the transcriptional repression mediated by EVI-1, suggesting that SUV39H1 is actively involved in EVI-1-mediated transcriptional repression. Furthermore, RNAi-based knockdown of SUV39H1 or G9a in Evi-1-expressing progenitors significantly reduced their colony-forming activity. In contrast, knockdown of these HMTs did not impair bone marrow immortalization by E2A/HLF. These results indicate that EVI-1 forms higher-order complexes with HMTs, and this association has a role in the transcription repression and bone marrow immortalization. Targeting these HMTs may be of therapeutic benefit in the treatment for EVI-1-related haematological malignancies.","['Goyama, S', 'Nitta, E', 'Yoshino, T', 'Kako, S', 'Watanabe-Okochi, N', 'Shimabe, M', 'Imai, Y', 'Takahashi, K', 'Kurokawa, M']","['Goyama S', 'Nitta E', 'Yoshino T', 'Kako S', 'Watanabe-Okochi N', 'Shimabe M', 'Imai Y', 'Takahashi K', 'Kurokawa M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090924,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.1.1.

WT1 mRNA is overexpressed in the minimal residual disease (MRD) of patients with hematopoietic malignancy patients, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MRD represents the condition with the low levels of leukemia cells in the bone marrow and is known as a sign of recurrence. In hematopoietic malignancies, definition of remission is based on the lack of MRD at submicroscopic level. Between December 2005 and June 2008, we started to measure WT1 mRNA levels in the peripheral blood (PB) from patients by quantitative real-time PCR in Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital. Three hundreds and eight samples from 95 patients were evaluated. The patients included AML (55 patients), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (11), myelodysplastic syndrome (20), malignant lymphoma (5), chronic myeloid leukemia (1), prostatic carcinoma (1), and leukopenia (2). Among the 55 AML patients, 21 patients were pretreated with remission induction therapy. In the clinical course of 21 patients, timely therapeutic approaches could be started for relapse by the early detection of WT1 mRNA overexpression before the morphological findings were apparent. Monitoring WT1 mRNA is helpful to identify patients at high-risk relapse. High overall survival rate (71.2%, 15/21, median: 24.6 months, range 1.1-35.6 months) was achieved in 3 years. The overall survival rate of 34 post-treatment patients was 61.7% (median: 23.5 months, range 0.13-126.5 months after treatment start). In conclusion, the WT1 mRNA level is a sensitive biomarker for monitoring MRD.","['Sakamoto, Yuichi', 'Mariya, Yasushi', 'Sasaki, Sumiko', 'Teshiromori, Ryuichi', 'Oshikiri, Toshiyuki', 'Segawa, Megumi', 'Ogura, Kazuto', 'Akagi, Tomoaki', 'Kubo, Koumei', 'Kaimori, Mitsuomi', 'Funato, Tadao']","['Sakamoto Y', 'Mariya Y', 'Sasaki S', 'Teshiromori R', 'Oshikiri T', 'Segawa M', 'Ogura K', 'Akagi T', 'Kubo K', 'Kaimori M', 'Funato T']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital, Aomori, Japan. 97036ys@jichi.ac.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Japan,Tohoku J Exp Med,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,0417355,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*genetics/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Neoplasm, Residual/blood/*genetics/prevention & control', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'WT1 Proteins/*blood/*genetics']",2009/09/25 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/25 06:00'],"['2009/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/tjem/219.169 [pii]', '10.1620/tjem.219.169 [doi]']",ppublish,Tohoku J Exp Med. 2009 Oct;219(2):169-76. doi: 10.1620/tjem.219.169.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the use of cytarabine plus either standard-dose or high-dose daunorubicin as induction therapy, followed by intensive consolidation therapy, in inducing complete remission to improve overall survival. METHODS: In this phase 3 randomized trial, we assigned 657 patients between the ages of 17 and 60 years who had untreated AML to receive three once-daily doses of daunorubicin at either the standard dose (45 mg per square meter of body-surface area) or a high dose (90 mg per square meter), combined with seven daily doses of cytarabine (100 mg per square meter) by continuous intravenous infusion. Patients who had a complete remission were offered either allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation or high-dose cytarabine, with or without a single dose of the monoclonal antibody gemtuzumab ozogamicin, followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation. The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat analysis, high-dose daunorubicin, as compared with a standard dose of the drug, resulted in a higher rate of complete remission (70.6% vs. 57.3%, P<0.001) and improved overall survival (median, 23.7 vs. 15.7 months; P=0.003). The rates of serious adverse events were similar in the two groups. Median follow-up was 25.2 months. CONCLUSIONS: In young adults with AML, intensifying induction therapy with a high daily dose of daunorubicin improved the rate of complete remission and the duration of overall survival, as compared with the standard dose.

Daunorubicin is a cornerstone of the induction regimen, but the optimal dose is unknown. In older patients, it is usual to give daunorubicin at a dose of 45 to 50 mg per square meter of body-surface area. METHODS: Patients in whom AML or high-risk refractory anemia had been newly diagnosed and who were 60 to 83 years of age (median, 67) were randomly assigned to receive cytarabine, at a dose of 200 mg per square meter by continuous infusion for 7 days, plus daunorubicin for 3 days, either at the conventional dose of 45 mg per square meter (411 patients) or at an escalated dose of 90 mg per square meter (402 patients); this treatment was followed by a second cycle of cytarabine at a dose of 1000 mg per square meter every 12 hours [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] for 6 days. The primary end point was event-free survival. RESULTS: The complete remission rates were 64% in the group that received the escalated dose of daunorubicin and 54% in the group that received the conventional dose (P=0.002); the rates of remission after the first cycle of induction treatment were 52% and 35%, respectively (P<0.001). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of hematologic toxic effects, 30-day mortality (11% and 12% in the two groups, respectively), or the incidence of moderate, severe, or life-threatening adverse events (P=0.08). Survival end points in the two groups did not differ significantly overall, but patients in the escalated-treatment group who were 60 to 65 years of age, as compared with the patients in the same age group who received the conventional dose, had higher rates of complete remission (73% vs. 51%), event-free survival (29% vs. 14%), and overall survival (38% vs. 23%). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AML who are older than 60 years of age, escalation of the dose of daunorubicin to twice the conventional dose, with the entire dose administered in the first induction cycle, effects a more rapid response and a higher response rate than does the conventional dose, without additional toxic effects.

The genetic causes of these variants are unknown. METHODS: We collected longitudinal clinical data on 11 patients from eight families who had recurrent sinopulmonary and cutaneous viral infections. We performed comparative genomic hybridization arrays and targeted gene sequencing. Variants with predicted loss-of-expression mutations were confirmed by means of a quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay and immunoblotting. We evaluated the number and function of lymphocytes with the use of in vitro assays and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Patients had recurrent otitis media, sinusitis, and pneumonias; recurrent Staphylococcus aureus skin infections with otitis externa; recurrent, severe herpes simplex virus or herpes zoster infections; extensive and persistent infections with molluscum contagiosum; and human papillomavirus infections. Most patients had severe atopy with anaphylaxis; several had squamous-cell carcinomas, and one had T-cell lymphoma-leukemia. Elevated serum IgE levels, hypereosinophilia, low numbers of T cells and B cells, low serum IgM levels, and variable IgG antibody responses were common. Expansion in vitro of activated CD8 T cells was impaired. Novel homozygous or compound heterozygous deletions and point mutations in the gene encoding the dedicator of cytokinesis 8 protein (DOCK8) led to the absence of DOCK8 protein in lymphocytes.

These noncoding RNA polymerase III transcripts are normally complexed with the Ro60 and La proteins, which are autoantigens associated with rheumatic disease that function in RNA biogenesis and quality control. Here, MLV replication and mY RNA packaging were analyzed using Ro60 knockout embryonic fibroblasts, which contain only approximately 3% as much mY RNA as wild-type cells. Virus spread at the same rate in wild-type and Ro knockout cells. Surprisingly, MLV virions shed by Ro60 knockout cells continued to package high levels of mY1 and mY3 (about two copies of each) like those from wild-type cells, even though mY RNAs were barely detectable within producer cells. As a result, for MLV produced in Ro60 knockout cells, encapsidation selectivity from among all cell RNAs was even higher for mY RNAs than for the viral genome. Whereas mY RNAs are largely cytoplasmic in wild-type cells, fractionation of knockout cells revealed that the residual mY RNAs were relatively abundant in nuclei, likely reflecting the fact that most mY RNAs were degraded shortly after transcription in the absence of Ro60.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT scans were reviewed with regard to the sites, number, morphologic appearance, attenuation, and the contrast enhancement patterns of the lesions in six patients (5 women, 1 man; mean age, 43.4 years; range, 23-59 years) with pathologically proved abdominal aspergillosis by two gastrointestinal radiologists in consensus. Medical records were also reviewed to determine each patient's clinical status and outcome. RESULTS: All patients were immunocompromised state: 4 patients received immunosuppressive therapy for solid organ transplantation and 2 patients received chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia. Aspergillosis involved blood vessels (n = 3), liver (n = 2), spleen (n = 2), gastrointestinal tract (n = 2), native kidney (n = 1), transplanted kidney (n = 1), peritoneum (n = 1), and retroperitoneum (n = 1). CT demonstrated solid organ or bowel infarction or perforation secondary to vascular thrombosis or pseudoaneurysm, multiple low-attenuating lesions of solid organs presenting as abscesses, concentric bowel wall thickening mimicking typhlitis, or diffuse or nodular infiltration of the peritoneum and retroperitoneum. CONCLUSION: Familiarity with findings commonly presenting as angioinvasive features or abscesses on CT, may facilitate the diagnosis of rare and fatal abdominal aspergillosis.","['Yeom, Suk Keu', 'Kim, Hye Jin', 'Byun, Jae Ho', 'Kim, Ah Young', 'Lee, Moon-Gyu', 'Ha, Hyun Kwon']","['Yeom SK', 'Kim HJ', 'Byun JH', 'Kim AY', 'Lee MG', 'Ha HK']","['Department of Radiology and Research Institute of Radiology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 388-1 Poongnap2-dong, Songpa-gu, Seoul 138-736, Republic of Korea. pagoda20@hanmail.net']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090922,Ireland,Eur J Radiol,European journal of radiology,8106411,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aspergillosis/*diagnostic imaging/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiography, Abdominal/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods', 'Young Adult']",2009/09/25 06:00,2011/08/06 06:00,['2009/09/25 06:00'],"['2009/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0720-048X(09)00507-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejrad.2009.08.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Radiol. 2011 Mar;77(3):478-82. doi: 10.1016/j.ejrad.2009.08.016.

The leukaemia stem cell was the first of such subsets to be described although the origins of these cells have been difficult to dissect. Consequently, their biology is not fully elucidated, which also holds true for the normal-tissue counterparts. The stem cell concept describes stem cells to be of low frequency, self renewing and with multilineage potential based on phenomenology - a definition which may not hold strictly true for CSCs when studied in animals and humans in vivo and in vitro. Several studies have analysed the cellular hierarchy of the haematopoietic system by cell sorting of few and even single cells, tracking acquired genetic changes and performing transplantation model studies to document subsets within the differentiating hierarchy as potential CSC compartments. In leukaemia the CSC has been described in the bone marrow compartment of haematopoietic stem cells (HSC); however, in other bone marrow disorders like multiple myeloma it is likely that the cell of origin is a more differentiated cell, like post-germinal memory B cells or plasmablasts. Studies performed so far have even indicated that the genetic events may occur in different B cell subsets in accordance with the stepwise oncogenesis of the disease. Although our understanding of the nature and biology of these initiating cells remains unknown, the obvious existence of such cells has implications for understanding initial malignant transformation and disease metastasis or progression and, most important, the selection of individualised therapeutic strategies targeting the subsets harbouring the CSC function. In the present review on stem cells in haematological malignancies we have focused on two topics, first, describing the stem cell concept in health and disease, and its ""phenomenology"", and second, describing the CSC compartments in leukaemia and multiple myeloma.","['Johnsen, Hans Erik', 'Kjeldsen, Malene Krag', 'Urup, Thomas', 'Fogd, Kirsten', 'Pilgaard, Linda', 'Boegsted, Martin', 'Nyegaard, Mette', 'Christiansen, Ilse', 'Bukh, Anne', 'Dybkaer, Karen']","['Johnsen HE', 'Kjeldsen MK', 'Urup T', 'Fogd K', 'Pilgaard L', 'Boegsted M', 'Nyegaard M', 'Christiansen I', 'Bukh A', 'Dybkaer K']","['Department of Haematology, Medical Centre Aalborg Hospital and Aalborg Hospital Science and Innovation Centre (AHSIC), Aarhus University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology']",2009/09/25 06:00,2010/01/29 06:00,['2009/09/25 06:00'],"['2009/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(09)70033-4 [pii]', '10.1016/S0959-8049(09)70033-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2009 Sep;45 Suppl 1:194-201. doi: 10.1016/S0959-8049(09)70033-4.,,,,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the present study was to carry out a cost-minimization analysis for two alternative forms of fludarabine (oral and intravenous) used to treat B-CLL in Spain. METHODS: The presence of clinical evidence about the treatment equivalence of the two options being compared (oral fludarabine vs. intravenous fludarabine) led us to carry out a cost-minimization analysis. A pharmacoeconomic model was constructed to compile data from the literature and experts' opinions in order to determine the use of health resources associated with the treatment; unit costs were obtained from Spanish databases. The analysis contemplated two perspectives: that of the national health service, which includes only direct health costs, and the social perspective, which also includes the indirect costs that result from loss of productivity. RESULTS: Although fludarabine in its oral form has a higher purchase price than generic intravenous fludarabine does, increased administration costs for the latter, which is used in hospitals, mean that oral fludarabine use produces total savings of euro1,908 and euro1,292 for single-drug therapy and combined therapy with cyclophosphamide, respectively. Including indirect costs increased the savings associated with the oral form of the drug. CONCLUSIONS: In B-CLL patients, treatment with oral fludarabine has a lower cost than treatment with intravenous fludarabine, in both single-drug therapy and combined therapy. Various sensitivity analyses confirmed these results and showed that oral fludarabine should be the treatment of choice for B-CLL in Spain, unless contrain.","['Delgado, Julio', 'Febrer, Laia', 'Nieves, Diana', 'Pinol, Carme', 'Brosa, Max']","['Delgado J', 'Febrer L', 'Nieves D', 'Pinol C', 'Brosa M']","['Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Espana.']",['spa'],,"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Spain,Farm Hosp,Farmacia hospitalaria : organo oficial de expresion cientifica de la Sociedad Espanola de Farmacia Hospitalaria,9440679,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '1X9VK9O1SC (fludarabine phosphate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/*economics', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*economics', 'Spain', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/economics']",2009/09/25 06:00,2010/03/04 06:00,['2009/09/25 06:00'],"['2009/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/04 06:00 [medline]']",['S1130-6343(09)72463-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Farm Hosp. 2009 Sep-Oct;33(5):240-6.,,,,,,,,,Analisis de minimizacion de costes de fludarabina (Beneflur) oral vs. via intravenosa en Espana.,,,,,,,,

The study has triggered debates as to the cause(s) of these increased cancers. This article reports on the findings of the KiKK study; discusses past and more recent epidemiological studies of leukemias near nuclear installations around the world, and outlines a possible biological mechanism to explain the increased cancers. This suggests that the observed high rates of infant leukemias may be a teratogenic effect from incorporated radionuclides. Doses from environmental emissions from nuclear reactors to embryos and fetuses in pregnant women near nuclear power stations may be larger than suspected. Hematopoietic tissues appear to be considerably more radiosensitive in embryos/fetuses than in newborn babies.

Polymorphisms in folate-related genes may influence the susceptibility to childhood ALL. This review summarizes the results of 14 studies that focussed on the relationship between folate-related gene polymorphisms and the susceptibility to ALL and that fulfilled certain quality criteria. The total group consisted of 729 children and 1821 adults or non age-defined patients. The results of different studies sometimes contradict each other, for which there are several possible explanations. This includes an influence of the type of population studied, because there was a difference between Asian and European study results. Based on several studies, it is plausible that polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene, 677C>T and 1298A>C, are associated with a decreased susceptibility to childhood ALL in non-Asian populations. Polymorphisms in other folate related genes (MTRR, MTR [MS], TYMS [TS], SLC19A1 [RFC1], NNMT, and SHMT1) are less clearly associated with susceptibility to ALL, and the number of included studies on this subject in this review is limited. Further investigations on the relevance of these polymorphisms need to be performed. In general, it is clear that susceptibility to (childhood) ALL is partly related to constitutional differences in folate gene polymorphisms.","['Koppen, Ilan J N', 'Hermans, Frederik J R', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L']","['Koppen IJ', 'Hermans FJ', 'Kaspers GJ']","['Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",20090922,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))']",IM,"['Child', 'Folic Acid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Genes, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism']",2009/09/25 06:00,2010/04/07 06:00,['2009/09/25 06:00'],"['2009/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7898 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07898.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Jan;148(1):3-14. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07898.x.

We studied FLT3-associated biological parameters in 322 acute myeloid leukaemia samples to establish their importance. Expression of total FLT3 transcripts was shown to be significantly higher in the FLT3-ITD cohort (n = 121) compared to the wild-type cohort (P = 0.004). Whilst phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (phospho-STAT5) was not confined to FLT3-ITD samples, within the FLT3-ITD group phosphorylation correlated with adjusted FLT3-ITD levels assessed by determining the total transcripts and proportion of FLT3-ITD within a sample. Expression of the STAT5 downstream target Bcl-xl (an isoform of BCL2L1) was strongly correlated with FLT3 total and adjusted FLT3-ITD levels in FLT3-ITD samples (P < 0.001), however there was no association between Bcl-xl and phospho-STAT5 levels suggesting that STAT5 is not the sole regulator of Bcl-xl in FLT3-ITD cells. We further stratified our cohort by the presence/absence of a cytoplasmic nucleophosmin NPMc+ mutation. Samples co-expressing NPMc+ had longer FLT3-ITD mutations (P = 0.01) and there was a high occurrence of NPMc+ in samples that had >1 FLT3-ITD mutation. Phospho-STAT5 levels were reduced in the FLT3-ITD/NPMc+ group (P = 0.04) suggesting that NPMc+ may oppose the FLT3-ITD-dependent activation of STAT5.","['Seedhouse, Claire H', 'Pallis, Monica', 'Grundy, Martin', 'Shang, Shili', 'Russell, Nigel H']","['Seedhouse CH', 'Pallis M', 'Grundy M', 'Shang S', 'Russell NH']","['Department of Academic Haematology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK. claire.seedhouse@nottingham.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090922,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/biosynthesis/*genetics']",2009/09/25 06:00,2010/03/27 06:00,['2009/09/25 06:00'],"['2009/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7901 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07901.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Dec;147(5):653-61. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07901.x.

Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of Notch signaling inhibitors for treating T-ALL. To further examine this possibility, we applied a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) to T-ALL xenograft models. Treatment of established subcutaneous tumors with GSI resulted in partial or complete regression of tumors arising from four T-ALL cell lines that were also sensitive to GSI in vitro. To elucidate the mechanism of action, we transduced DND-41 cells with the active form of Notch1 (aN1), which conferred resistance to in vitro GSI treatment. Nevertheless, in vivo treatment with GSI induced a partial but significant regression of subcutaneous tumors that developed from aN1-transduced DND-41 cells, whereas it induced complete regression of tumors that developed from mock-transduced DND-41 cells. These findings indicate that the remarkable efficacy of GSI might be attributable to dual mechanisms, directly via apoptosis of DND-41 cells through the inhibition of cell-autonomous Notch signaling, and indirectly via disturbance of tumor angiogenesis through the inhibition of non-cell-autonomous Notch signaling.","['Masuda, Shigeo', 'Kumano, Keiki', 'Suzuki, Takahiro', 'Tomita, Taisuke', 'Iwatsubo, Takeshi', 'Natsugari, Hideaki', 'Tojo, Arinobu', 'Shibutani, Makoto', 'Mitsumori, Kunitoshi', 'Hanazono, Yutaka', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Kurokawa, Mineo', 'Chiba, Shigeru']","['Masuda S', 'Kumano K', 'Suzuki T', 'Tomita T', 'Iwatsubo T', 'Natsugari H', 'Tojo A', 'Shibutani M', 'Mitsumori K', 'Hanazono Y', 'Ogawa S', 'Kurokawa M', 'Chiba S']","['Department of Cell Therapy and Transplantation Medicine, University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090827,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Receptors, Notch/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/09/25 06:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2009/09/25 06:00'],"['2009/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['CAS1328 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01328.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2009 Dec;100(12):2444-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01328.x.

The ability of GSIs to decrease T-ALL cell viability in vitro is a slow process requiring >8 days, however, such treatment durations are not well tolerated in vivo. Here we study GSI's effect on tumour and normal cellular processes to optimize dosing regimens for anti-tumour efficacy. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Inhibition of the Notch pathway in mouse intestinal epithelium was used to evaluate the effect of GSIs and guide the design of dosing regimens for xenograft models. Serum Abeta(40) and Notch target gene modulation in tumours were used to evaluate the degree and duration of target inhibition. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic correlations with biochemical, immunohistochemical and profiling data were used to demonstrate GSI mechanism of action in xenograft tumours. KEY RESULTS: Three days of >70% Notch pathway inhibition was sufficient to provide an anti-tumour effect and was well tolerated. GSI-induced conversion of mouse epithelial cells to a secretory lineage was time- and dose-dependent. Anti-tumour efficacy was associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis that was in part due to Notch-dependent regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Intermittent but potent inhibition of Notch signalling is sufficient for anti-tumour efficacy in these T-ALL models. These findings provide support for the use of GSI in Notch-dependent malignancies and that clinical benefits may be derived from transient but potent inhibition of Notch.","['Tammam, J', 'Ware, C', 'Efferson, C', ""O'Neil, J"", 'Rao, S', 'Qu, X', 'Gorenstein, J', 'Angagaw, M', 'Kim, H', 'Kenific, C', 'Kunii, K', 'Leach, K J', 'Nikov, G', 'Zhao, J', 'Dai, X', 'Hardwick, J', 'Scott, M', 'Winter, C', 'Bristow, L', 'Elbi, C', 'Reilly, J F', 'Look, T', 'Draetta, G', 'Van der Ploeg, Lht', 'Kohl, N E', 'Strack, P R', 'Majumder, P K']","['Tammam J', 'Ware C', 'Efferson C', ""O'Neil J"", 'Rao S', 'Qu X', 'Gorenstein J', 'Angagaw M', 'Kim H', 'Kenific C', 'Kunii K', 'Leach KJ', 'Nikov G', 'Zhao J', 'Dai X', 'Hardwick J', 'Scott M', 'Winter C', 'Bristow L', 'Elbi C', 'Reilly JF', 'Look T', 'Draetta G', 'Van der Ploeg L', 'Kohl NE', 'Strack PR', 'Majumder PK']","['Department of Oncology/Pharmacology, Merck Research Laboratories, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090923,England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Amyloid beta-Peptides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclic S-Oxides)', '0 (MRK 003)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Thiadiazoles)', '0 (amyloid beta-protein (1-40))', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides/blood', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colon/cytology/drug effects', 'Cyclic S-Oxides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/cytology/drug effects', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Peptide Fragments/blood', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thiadiazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2009/09/25 06:00,2010/02/13 06:00,['2009/09/25 06:00'],"['2009/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['BPH389 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00389.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2009 Nov;158(5):1183-95. doi: 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00389.x.

The initial aims of the present study were: (i) to use stirred suspension bioreactors to expand and differentiate ESCs into osteogenic and chondrogenic cell types and (ii) to explore if these ESC-derived cells influenced skeletal healing in an in vivo fracture model. We show that differentiation protocols used in static culture are insufficient when applied directly to suspension culture bioreactors. Moreover, when bioreactor-differentiated cells are transplanted into a burr-hole defect in bone, severe disruption of the bone architecture was noted at the fracture site, as determined by microcomputed tomography (microCT) imaging and histopathology. Further characterization of the bioreactor-differentiated cultures revealed that a subpopulation of cells in the resulting aggregates expressed the pluripotency marker Oct-4 in the nucleus. Nuclear Oct-4 expression persisted even after 30 days of culture in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Remarkably, and unlike ESCs differentiated into skeletal cell types in static cultures, bioreactor-differentiated aggregates implanted subcutaneously into SCID mice formed teratomas. The development of effective ESC differentiation protocols for suspension bioreactors will require a more complete understanding of the environmental conditions within these culture systems and the influence that these conditions have on the regulation of pluripotency and differentiation in ESCs.","['Taiani, Jaymi T', 'Krawetz, Roman J', 'Zur Nieden, Nicole I', 'Elizabeth Wu, Yiru', 'Kallos, Michael S', 'Matyas, John R', 'Rancourt, Derrick E']","['Taiani JT', 'Krawetz RJ', 'Zur Nieden NI', 'Elizabeth Wu Y', 'Kallos MS', 'Matyas JR', 'Rancourt DE']","['Department of Medical Science, Schulich School of Engineering, Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary , Calgary, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', '*Bioreactors', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Teratoma/pathology']",2009/09/25 06:00,2010/10/26 06:00,['2009/09/25 06:00'],"['2009/09/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2009.0297 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2010 Jul;19(7):989-98. doi: 10.1089/scd.2009.0297.,PMC3128313,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormalities of tumor suppressor genes have suggested that these genes may be important to the development of autism in some cases, and result in an increased risk of developing cancer or other neoplasms. We explore possible associations between AD and childhood cancer. PROCEDURE: We reviewed our institutional pediatric cancer database for all new cancer diagnoses 1997-2007. Medical records from patients older than 2 years at last visit were reviewed for a diagnosis of AD. The prevalence of AD was estimated for neoplasms overall and for specific tumor types, and compared with that in the general pediatric population. RESULTS: Of 702 eligible patients, 7 (1%; 95% CI: (0.4%, 2.04%)) were labeled as AD, not different than the prevalence of AD in North Carolina's general population (0.65%, P = 0.35).

METHODS: A total of 105 childhood ALL patients received combined chemotherapy of different intensities based on risk-directed Taiwan Pediatric Oncology Group (TPOG)-ALL-93 protocols. Seventeen genetic polymorphisms in 13 pharmacogenomic targets were analyzed by PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO) probe hybridization. Pharmacogenomic polymorphisms were correlated with event-free survival (EFS) of patients, with confounding effects adjusted by multivariate regression. RESULTS: Three polymorphic alleles in the multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR1) ABCB1 gene, and homozygotic MDR1 2677GG, 3435CC, and 2677G-3435C genotypes were highly associated with a significant reduction in EFS in those patients treated by the standard risk (SR) protocol (TPOG-ALL-93-SR).

The objectives of this study were to assess the number of childhood cancer survivors from the BCCSS who were currently divorced or separated, examine factors associated with marriage dissolution and compare survivor divorce rates to population rates. PROCEDURE: The BCCSS is a population-based cohort of 18,119 individuals diagnosed with cancer aged 0-14 years between 1940 and 1991, and survived at least 5 years. 14,539 were alive, aged 16 years or over and eligible to receive a questionnaire, which ascertained marital status. RESULTS: From 8,155 survivors, who were aged at least 20 years at questionnaire completion, the proportions currently divorced and divorced or separated were 13.5% and 18.1%, respectively. Only current age, educational attainment and age at marriage were associated with divorce, and for divorce and separation status only age at marriage (P < 0.05). Overall the survivors were no different to the general population for being currently divorced (odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence intervals (95% CI)): 0.94 (0.81-1.10)). However, the survivors overall (OR (95% CI): 0.82 (0.72-0.94)), and separately for those diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR (95% CI): 0.55 (0.34-0.89)) and leukaemia (OR (95% CI): 0.70 (0.52-0.95)), were less likely to be currently divorced or separated than the general population. CONCLUSIONS: It is reassuring that survivors do not experience more divorce than the general population, and that no cancer or treatment factors were shown to be associated with marriage dissolution.","['Frobisher, Clare', 'Lancashire, Emma R', 'Winter, David L', 'Taylor, Aliki J', 'Reulen, Raoul C', 'Hawkins, Michael M']","['Frobisher C', 'Lancashire ER', 'Winter DL', 'Taylor AJ', 'Reulen RC', 'Hawkins MM']","['Centre for Childhood Cancer Survivor Studies (CCCSS), School of Health and Population Sciences, Public Health Building, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, UK. c.frobisher@bham.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Divorce/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Marital Status/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Survivors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2009/09/24 06:00,2009/12/18 06:00,['2009/09/24 06:00'],"['2009/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22290 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Jan;54(1):116-22. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22290.,,,,,,"['Copyright 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,['British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study'],,"['Hawkins M', 'Jenkinson H', 'Jenney M', 'Lancashire E', 'Pritchard-Jones K', 'Stevens M', 'Stiller C', 'Sugden E', 'Toogood A', 'Wallace H']","['Hawkins, Michael', 'Jenkinson, Helen', 'Jenney, Meriel', 'Lancashire, Emma', 'Pritchard-Jones, Kathryn', 'Stevens, Michael', 'Stiller, Charles', 'Sugden, Elaine', 'Toogood, Andrew', 'Wallace, Hamish']",,

Morphologic evaluation of the bone marrow aspirate and biopsy has recently been supplemented by increasingly sophisticated ancillary assays, including immunocytochemistry, cytogenetic analysis, flow cytometry, and molecular assays. With our rapidly expanding knowledge of the clinical and biologic diversity of leukemia and other hematologic neoplasms, and an increasing variety of therapeutic options, the bone marrow examination has became more critical for therapeutic monitoring and planning optimal therapy. Sensitive molecular techniques, in vitro drug sensitivity testing, and a number of other special assays are available to provide valuable data to assist these endeavors. Fortunately, improvements in bone marrow aspirate and needle technology has made the procurement of adequate specimens more reliable and efficient, while the use of conscious sedation has improved patient comfort. The procurement of bone marrow specimens was reviewed in the first part of this series. This paper specifically addresses the diagnostic interpretation of bone marrow specimens and the use of ancillary techniques.","['Riley, Roger S', 'Williams, David', 'Ross, Micaela', 'Zhao, Shawn', 'Chesney, Alden', 'Clark, Bradly D', 'Ben-Ezra, Jonathan M']","['Riley RS', 'Williams D', 'Ross M', 'Zhao S', 'Chesney A', 'Clark BD', 'Ben-Ezra JM']","['Medical College of Virginia Hospitals of Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA. rsriley@vcu.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Clin Lab Anal,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,8801384,,IM,"['Biopsy, Fine-Needle/methods', 'Biopsy, Needle/*methods', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/*pathology', 'Hematologic Diseases/diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Pathology/*methods', 'Staining and Labeling/methods']",2009/09/24 06:00,2010/02/03 06:00,['2009/09/24 06:00'],"['2009/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcla.20305 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Lab Anal. 2009;23(5):259-307. doi: 10.1002/jcla.20305.,PMC6648980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since then, few population-based data about the incidence of childhood HZ are available. METHODS: We identified children aged < or = 12 years who were vaccinated with 1 dose of varicella vaccine between 2002 and 2008 in a prepaid health plan and followed them through their electronic health records for a diagnosis of HZ. The medical records of these children were reviewed. Persistent and chronic conditions for these children before HZ were identified. RESULTS: There were 172,163 children vaccinated, with overall follow-up of 446,027 person-years (Incidence rate = 27.4 per 100,000 person-years, 95% confidence interval: 22.7-32.7). Children vaccinated after age 5 years had a higher but not statistically significant different rate than children vaccinated between 12 and 18 months (34.3 vs. 28.5 per 100,000 person-years). Among children vaccinated between 12 and 18 months, incidence rates gradually increased each year in the first 4 years after vaccination (P < 0.001). Among the HZ cases, there were 1 (0.7%) case of lymphoid leukemia, 1 (0.7%) case of drug abuse, 16 (11.1%) cases of asthma with 3 or more acute exacerbations, 12 (8.3%) cases of developmental disorders, and 3 (2.1%) cases of psychological or mental disorders. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that diagnosed HZ is rare among children following varicella vaccine. Despite the small numbers, the roles of delayed vaccination, severe asthma, and development disorders warrant further investigation. In the future, analyses of HZ isolates will be needed to identify the virus strains causing reactivation.","['Tseng, Hung Fu', 'Smith, Ning', 'Marcy, Stephan Michael', 'Sy, Lina S', 'Jacobsen, Steven J']","['Tseng HF', 'Smith N', 'Marcy SM', 'Sy LS', 'Jacobsen SJ']","['Department of Research and Evaluation, Southern California Permanente Medical Group, Kaiser Permanente, Pasadena, CA 91101, USA. hung-fu.x.tseng@kp.org']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,['0 (Chickenpox Vaccine)'],IM,"['Chickenpox Vaccine/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Herpes Zoster/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Prepaid Health Plans', 'United States/epidemiology']",2009/09/24 06:00,2010/03/03 06:00,['2009/09/24 06:00'],"['2009/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/INF.0b013e3181acf84f [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2009 Dec;28(12):1069-72. doi: 10.1097/INF.0b013e3181acf84f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The secondary objectives were to describe risk factors for microbiologically documented infections and for patients with a febrile episode, to identify risk factors for recurrence of fever or reinitiation of antibiotics. METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of children from 1 to 18 years of age who received induction chemotherapy between March 1997 and September 2006. Microbiologically documented infections were examined through the induction period. RESULTS: There were 425 children evaluated. The most common pre-existing risk factor for infection was Down syndrome in 11 children. Of the 425 children, 83 (19.5%) experienced at least one microbiologically documented infection. There were 85 infections consisting of 65 bacterial, 15 viral and 5 fungal infections.Variables significantly associated with a microbiologically documented infection were pre-existing risk factors (odds ratio [OR]: 3.63; P = 0.01) and neutropenia at initial infectious episode (OR: 1.86; P = 0.03). Factors associated with recurrence of fever and reinitiation of antibiotics after an initial infectious episode were receipt of a 4-drug induction, neutropenia at the initial infectious episode, initial fever documented in hospital, and lack of bone marrow recovery at the time of initial antibiotic cessation. CONCLUSIONS: About 20% of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia have a microbiologically documented infection during induction. Those with pre-existing risk factors and neutropenia at the initial infectious episode were at higher risk of microbiologically documented infection. Continued efforts to refine risk groups may allow for risk-directed prophylactic or empiric strategies.","['Afzal, Samina', 'Ethier, Marie-Chantal', 'Dupuis, L Lee', 'Tang, Laureen', 'Punnett, Angela S', 'Richardson, Susan E', 'Allen, Upton', 'Abla, Oussama', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Afzal S', 'Ethier MC', 'Dupuis LL', 'Tang L', 'Punnett AS', 'Richardson SE', 'Allen U', 'Abla O', 'Sung L']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/*complications/microbiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2009/09/24 06:00,2010/03/03 06:00,['2009/09/24 06:00'],"['2009/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/INF.0b013e3181aa6eae [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2009 Dec;28(12):1064-8. doi: 10.1097/INF.0b013e3181aa6eae.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of these pathways using the MEK inhibitor PD184352 or U0126 and the PI3K/Akt inhibitor perifosine strikingly induced apoptosis in multiple malignant human hematopoietic cells, and substantially reduced the colony-forming capacity of primary acute myeloblastic leukemia, but not normal CD34+ cells. These events were associated with pronounced Bim up-regulation, Mcl-1 down-regulation, marked Bak/Bax conformational change accompanied by Bax membrane translocation, and a pronounced increase in Bax/Bak association. Molecular studies using tet-inducible Akt, constitutively active MEK1, dominant-negative Akt, and MEK1 small interfering RNA revealed that inhibition of both MEK/ERK1/2 and Akt pathways plays a critical functional role in perifosine/PD184352-mediated lethality. Ectopic Mcl-1 expression potently inhibited perifosine/PD184352-induced apoptosis, as did Bak or Bax knockdown. Notably, knockdown of Bim, but not Bad, blocked Bak and Bax conformational change, inhibited Bax membrane translocation, diminished Bax/Bak binding, and sharply attenuated perifosine/PD184352-induced apoptosis. Finally, enforced expression of Bim significantly enhanced apoptosis induced by PI3K/Akt inhibitors, analogous to the effects of MEK1/2 inhibitors. Collectively, these findings suggest that Bim, and Mcl-1, but not Bad, integrate death signaling triggered by concomitant disruption of the PI3K/Akt and MEK1/2/ERK1/2 pathways in human leukemia cells.","['Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Anderson, Anh', 'Habibi, Joseph Reza', 'Crabtree, Timothy Ryan', 'Mayo, Mandy', 'Harada, Hisashi', 'Ferreira-Gonzalez, Andrea', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Rahmani M', 'Anderson A', 'Habibi JR', 'Crabtree TR', 'Mayo M', 'Harada H', 'Ferreira-Gonzalez A', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University and Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA093738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA130805/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA141703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK052825/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA150214/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA063753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA130805/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090922,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/metabolism']",2009/09/24 06:00,2009/12/23 06:00,['2009/09/24 06:00'],"['2009/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38934-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-09-177881 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Nov 12;114(20):4507-16. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-09-177881.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is intimately involved in protein processing. An accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER leads to a cascade of transcriptional and translational events collectively called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is one of the most abundant ER proteins and maintains a sentinel function in organizing accurate protein folding. Treatment of cells with O(2)-[2,4-dinitro-5-(N-methyl-N-4-carboxyphenylamino)phenyl]1-(N,N-dimethylamino) diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (PABA/NO) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in intracellular nitric oxide that caused S-glutathionylation of various proteins. Within 4 h, PABA/NO activated the UPR and led to translational attenuation as measured by the phosphorylation and activation of the ER transmembrane kinase, pancreatic ER kinase, and its downstream effector eukaryotic initiation factor 2 in human leukemia (HL60) and ovarian cancer cells (SKOV3). Cleavage of the transcription factor X-box protein 1 and transcriptional activation of the ER resident proteins BiP, PDI, GRP94, and ERO1 (5- to 10-fold induction) also occurred. Immunoprecipitation of PDI showed that whereas nitrosylation was undetectable, PABA/NO treatment caused S-glutathionylation of PDI. Mass spectroscopy analysis showed that single cysteine residues within each of the catalytic sites of PDI had a mass increase [+305.3 Da] consistent with S-glutathionylation. Circular dichroism confirmed that S-glutathionylation of PDI results in alterations in the alpha-helix content of PDI and is concurrent with inhibition of its isomerase activity. Thus, it appears that S-glutathionylation of PDI is an upstream signaling event in the UPR and may be linked with the cytotoxic potential of PABA/NO.","['Townsend, Danyelle M', 'Manevich, Yefim', 'He, Lin', 'Xiong, Ying', 'Bowers, Robert R Jr', 'Hutchens, Steven', 'Tew, Kenneth D']","['Townsend DM', 'Manevich Y', 'He L', 'Xiong Y', 'Bowers RR Jr', 'Hutchens S', 'Tew KD']","['Departments of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences and Cell and Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA08660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA085660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R41 CA117259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA117259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA085660-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090922,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Azo Compounds)', '0 (O(2)-(2,4-dinitro-5-(N-methyl-N-4-carboxyphenylamino)phenyl', '1-N,N-dimethylamino)diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate)', '0 (para-Aminobenzoates)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 5.3.4.1 (Protein Disulfide-Isomerases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'TL2TJE8QTX (4-Aminobenzoic Acid)']",IM,"['4-Aminobenzoic Acid/pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Azo Compounds/pharmacology', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cysteine/metabolism', 'Female', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/*metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism', 'Protein Disulfide-Isomerases/*metabolism', 'Protein Folding', 'Proteomics/methods', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'para-Aminobenzoates']",2009/09/24 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/24 06:00'],"['2009/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-0493 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0493 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Oct 1;69(19):7626-34. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0493.

We have previously found that obesity in children is associated with a 50% increased recurrence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in high-risk patients. We have therefore developed novel in vivo and in vitro preclinical models to study the mechanism(s) of this association. Obesity increased relapse after monotherapy with vincristine (P = 0.03) in obese mice injected with syngeneic ALL cells. This occurred although the drug was dosed proportionally to body weight, equalizing blood and tissue drug levels. In coculture, 3T3-L1 adipocytes significantly impaired the antileukemia efficacy of vincristine, as well as three other chemotherapies (P < 0.05). Interestingly, this protection was independent of cell-cell contact, and it extended to human leukemia cell lines as well. Adipocytes prevented chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, and this was associated with increased expression of the two prosurvival signals Bcl-2 and Pim-2. These findings highlight the role of the adipocyte in fostering leukemia chemotherapy resistance, and may help explain the increased leukemia relapse rate in obese children and adults. Given the growing prevalence of obesity worldwide, these effects are likely to have increasing importance to cancer treatment.","['Behan, James W', 'Yun, Jason P', 'Proektor, Marina P', 'Ehsanipour, Ehsan A', 'Arutyunyan, Anna', 'Moses, Ara S', 'Avramis, Vassilios I', 'Louie, Stan G', 'Butturini, Anna', 'Heisterkamp, Nora', 'Mittelman, Steven D']","['Behan JW', 'Yun JP', 'Proektor MP', 'Ehsanipour EA', 'Arutyunyan A', 'Moses AS', 'Avramis VI', 'Louie SG', 'Butturini A', 'Heisterkamp N', 'Mittelman SD']","['Divisions of Endocrinology, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA090321/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 HD052954/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA116848-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA139060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 HD052954-02/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA139060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA139060-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA 116848/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 P30 CA 14089-27/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090321/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014089-339009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA116848/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090321-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090922,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['3T3-L1 Cells', 'Adipocytes/*pathology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Communication/physiology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Obesity/pathology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",2009/09/24 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/24 06:00'],"['2009/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-0800 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0800 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Oct 1;69(19):7867-74. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0800.

Animal models, gene expression microarray experiments, and functional studies in cell lines have suggested a potential role for IER3 in oncogenesis, but, to date, no abnormalities of IER3 at the DNA level have been reported in patients with neoplasia. Here, we describe breakpoint cloning of a t(6;9)(p21;q34) translocation from a patient with a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), facilitated by conversion technology and array-based comparative genomic hybridization, which revealed a rearrangement translocating the IER3 coding region away from critical flanking/regulatory elements and to a transcript-poor chromosomal region, markedly decreasing expression. Using split-signal and locus-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes, we analyzed 204 patients with diverse hematological malignancies accompanied by clonal chromosome 6p21 abnormalities, and found 8 additional patients with MDS with IER3 rearrangements (translocations or amplification). Although FISH studies on 157 additional samples from patients with MDS and a normal-karyotype were unrevealing, and sequencing the IER3 coding and proximal promoter regions of 74 MDS patients disclosed no point mutations, reverse transcription-PCR results suggested that dysregulated expression of IER3 is common in MDS (61% >4-fold increase or decrease in expression with decreased expression primarily in early MDS and increased expression primarily in later MDS progressing toward leukemia), consistent with findings in previous microarray experiments. These data support involvement of IER3 in the pathobiology of MDS.","['Steensma, David P', 'Neiger, Jessemy D', 'Porcher, Julie C', 'Keats, J Jonathan', 'Bergsagel, P Leif', 'Dennis, Thomas R', 'Knudson, Ryan A', 'Jenkins, Robert B', 'Santana-Davila, Rafael', 'Kumar, Rajiv', 'Ketterling, Rhett P']","['Steensma DP', 'Neiger JD', 'Porcher JC', 'Keats JJ', 'Bergsagel PL', 'Dennis TR', 'Knudson RA', 'Jenkins RB', 'Santana-Davila R', 'Kumar R', 'Ketterling RP']","['Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.

METHODS: To further examine if genetic variation contributes to benzene haematotoxicity, we analysed 1023 tagSNPs in 121 gene regions important for benzene metabolism, haematopoiesis, leukaemia and lymphoma among 250 workers exposed to benzene and 140 unexposed controls in a cross-sectional study carried out in China. Linear regression was used to analyse the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and total white blood cell (WBC) count and its subtypes, adjusting for potential confounders and occupational exposure to benzene and toluene among exposed workers. The minp test assessed the association on the gene region level. The false discovery rate method was used to control for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: VEGF (minp = 0.0030) and ERCC3 (minp = 0.0042) were the most significantly associated gene regions with altered WBC counts among benzene-exposed workers, after accounting for multiple comparisons. Highly significant changes were also found for WBC subtype counts, including granulocytes, CD4+ T cells and lymphocytes for VEGF and granulocytes and NK cells for ERCC3. Further, in workers exposed to <1 ppm, a SNP in VEGF was associated with changes in WBC and granulocyte counts, and SNPs in ERCC3 were associated with changes in WBC, NK cell and granulocyte counts. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that genetic variation in VEGF, which plays an important role in blood vessel growth, and ERCC3, which is a member of the DNA repair pathway and is responsible for repairing bulky DNA adducts formed by chemicals, may contribute to individual susceptibility to benzene-induced haematotoxicity at relatively low levels of benzene exposure.","['Hosgood, H D 3rd', 'Zhang, L', 'Shen, M', 'Berndt, S I', 'Vermeulen, R', 'Li, G', 'Yin, S', 'Yeager, M', 'Yuenger, J', 'Rothman, N', 'Chanock, S', 'Smith, M', 'Lan, Q']","['Hosgood HD 3rd', 'Zhang L', 'Shen M', 'Berndt SI', 'Vermeulen R', 'Li G', 'Yin S', 'Yeager M', 'Yuenger J', 'Rothman N', 'Chanock S', 'Smith M', 'Lan Q']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD 20892-7240, USA. hosgoodd@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['R01ES06721/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES006721/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'Z99 CA999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'P30ES01896/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES001896/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20090922,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '146045-44-5 (XPBC-ERCC-3 protein)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Benzene/*toxicity', 'DNA Helicases/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematologic Diseases/blood/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes/drug effects', 'Male', 'Occupational Diseases/blood/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects/analysis', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*genetics']",2009/09/24 06:00,2010/01/05 06:00,['2009/09/24 06:00'],"['2009/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['oem.2008.044024 [pii]', '10.1136/oem.2008.044024 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2009 Dec;66(12):848-53. doi: 10.1136/oem.2008.044024.

In 143 adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative BCP-ALL treated in the multicentric GRAALL 2003 trial, CD20 positivity over 20% was observed in 32% of patients. While not influencing complete remission achievement, CD20 expression was associated with a higher cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) at 42 months (P=0.04), independently of the ALL high-risk subset (P=0.025). Notably, the negative impact of CD20 expression on CIR was only observed in patients with a white blood cell count (WBC) over 30x10(9)/L (P=0.006), while not in those with a lower WBC. In the former subgroup, this impact translated into lower event-free survival (15% vs. 59% at 42 months, P=0.003).

This originally French-American-British classification is still used in the new World Health Organization classification when other criteria are not met. Apart from RUNX1 mutation, no characteristic molecular aberrations are recognized. DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism analysis and extensive molecular analysis in a cohort of 52 patients with minimally differentiated acute myeloid leukemia. RESULTS: Many recurring and potentially relevant regions of loss of heterozygosity were revealed. These point towards a variety of candidate genes that could contribute to the pathogenesis of minimally differentiated acute myeloid leukemia, including the tumor suppressor genes TP53 and NF1, and reinforced the importance of RUNX1 in this leukemia. Furthermore, for the first time in this minimally differentiated form of leukemia we detected mutations in the transactivation domain of RUNX1. Mutations in other acute myeloid leukemia associated transcriptions factors were infrequent. In contrast, FLT3, RAS, PTPN11 and JAK2 were often mutated. Irrespective of the RUNX1 mutation status, our results show that RAS signaling is the most important pathway for proliferation in minimally differentiated acute myeloid leukemia. Importantly, we found that high terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase expression is closely associated with RUNX1 mutation, which could allow an easier diagnosis of RUNX1 mutation in this hematologic malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that in patients without RUNX1 mutation, several other molecular aberrations, separately or in combination, contribute to a common minimally differentiated phenotype.","['Silva, Fernando P G', 'Almeida, Ines', 'Morolli, Bruno', 'Brouwer-Mandema, Geeske', 'Wessels, Hans', 'Vossen, Rolf', 'Vrieling, Harry', 'Marijt, Erik W A', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Kluin-Nelemans, Hanneke C', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Ludwig, Wolf-Dieter', 'Giphart-Gassler, Micheline']","['Silva FP', 'Almeida I', 'Morolli B', 'Brouwer-Mandema G', 'Wessels H', 'Vossen R', 'Vrieling H', 'Marijt EW', 'Valk PJ', 'Kluin-Nelemans HC', 'Sperr WR', 'Ludwig WD', 'Giphart-Gassler M']","['Department of Toxicogenetics, Leiden University Medical Center, PO box 9600, Postzone S4-P, 2300 RC Leiden, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090922,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', '*Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*classification/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Young Adult']",2009/09/24 06:00,2010/01/09 06:00,['2009/09/24 06:00'],"['2009/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.009324 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.009324 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Nov;94(11):1546-54. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.009324.

However, the high cytotoxicity of the free thiosemicarbazones against leukemia, together with their hepatotoxic profile similar to that of cisplatin suggest that N(4)-tolyl thiosemicarbazones have potential as chemotherapeutic drug candidates.","['Ferraz, Karina S O', 'Ferandes, Lucas', 'Carrilho, Diego', 'Pinto, Mauro C X', 'Leite, Maria de Fatima', 'Souza-Fagundes, Elaine M', 'Speziali, Nivaldo L', 'Mendes, Isolda C', 'Beraldo, Heloisa']","['Ferraz KS', 'Ferandes L', 'Carrilho D', 'Pinto MC', 'Leite Mde F', 'Souza-Fagundes EM', 'Speziali NL', 'Mendes IC', 'Beraldo H']","['Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, 31270-901 Belo Horizonte, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090904,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (2-benzoylpyridine N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Thiosemicarbazones)', '5TWQ1V240M (Palladium)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Models, Molecular', 'Palladium/*chemistry', 'Thiosemicarbazones/chemistry/*pharmacology']",2009/09/24 06:00,2010/01/20 06:00,['2009/09/24 06:00'],"['2009/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/26 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0968-0896(09)00838-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2009.08.063 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2009 Oct 15;17(20):7138-44. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2009.08.063.

Although such viral contaminants can be easily identified with high sensitivity by PCR, it is impossible to screen for all potential contaminants. Therefore, we explored two novel methods to identify viral contaminations in cell lines without prior knowledge of the kind of contaminant. RESULTS: The first hint for the presence of contaminating retroviruses in one of our cell lines was obtained by electron microscopy of exosome-like vesicles released from the supernatants of transfected 293T cells. Random amplification of particle associated RNAs (PAN-PCR) from supernatant of contaminated 293T cells and sequencing of the amplicons revealed several nucleotide sequences showing highest similarity to either murine leukemia virus (MuLV) or squirrel monkey retrovirus (SMRV). Subsequent mass spectrometry analysis confirmed our findings, since we could identify several peptide sequences originating from monkey and murine retroviral proteins. Quantitative PCRs were established for both viruses to test currently cultured cell lines as well as liquid nitrogen frozen cell stocks. Gene fragments for both viruses could be detected in a broad range of permissive cell lines from multiple species. Furthermore, experimental infections of cells negative for these viruses showed that both viruses replicate rapidly to high loads. We decided to further analyze the genomic sequence of the MuLV-like contaminant virus. Surprisingly it was neither identical to MuLV nor to the novel xenotropic MuLV related retrovirus (XMRV) but showed 99% identity to a synthetic retrovirus which was engineered in the 1980s. CONCLUSION: The high degree of nucleotide identity suggests unintended spread of a biosafety level 2 recombinant virus, which could also affect the risk assessment of gene-modified organisms released from contaminated cell cultures. The study further indicates that both mass spectrometry and PAN-PCR are powerful methods to identify viral contaminations in cell lines without prior knowledge of the kind of contaminant. Both methods might be useful tools for testing cell lines before using them for critical purposes.","['Stang, Alexander', 'Petrasch-Parwez, Elisabeth', 'Brandt, Sabine', 'Dermietzel, Rolf', 'Meyer, Helmut E', 'Stuhler, Kai', 'Liffers, Sven-T', 'Uberla, Klaus', 'Grunwald, Thomas']","['Stang A', 'Petrasch-Parwez E', 'Brandt S', 'Dermietzel R', 'Meyer HE', 'Stuhler K', 'Liffers ST', 'Uberla K', 'Grunwald T']","['Department of Molecular and Medical Virology, Ruhr-University Bochum, D-44780 Bochum, Germany. alexander.stang@rub.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090922,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,,IM,"['Betaretrovirus/*growth & development/*isolation & purification', 'Cell Line/*virology', 'Containment of Biohazards', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*growth & development/*isolation & purification', 'Mass Spectrometry/methods', 'Microscopy, Electron/methods', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods']",2009/09/24 06:00,2010/01/14 06:00,['2009/09/24 06:00'],"['2009/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-6-86 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-6-86 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2009 Sep 22;6:86. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-6-86.,PMC2760500,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present a computational method for extracting small or even extremely low-dimensional subspaces for multivariate feature screening and gene expression analysis using sparse optimization techniques. After we transform the feature screening problem into a convex optimization problem, we develop an efficient primal-dual interior-point method expressively for solving large-scale problems.

As per previous reports, there are some differences in clinical features and cytogenetic biomarkers of AML among different ethnic backgrounds. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective study to analyze clinical outcomes and predictive factors of Thai AML patients receiving chemotherapy treatment. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The authors performed a retrospective analysis of 106 adults with newly diagnosed de novo AML at Ramathibodi Hospital between 2003 and 2007. Of 101 patients with non- M3 subtype, the patients received induction and consolidation chemotherapy with anthracyclin plus cytarabine based regimens (3 + 7). All patients achieving complete remission (CR) were treated with intensive chemotherapy using intermediate dose cytarabine plus anthracyclin based protocol. All patients with M3 subtype, the induction chemotherapy consisted of a combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and anthracyclin. All patients achieving complete remission (CR) were treated with three courses of mitoxantrone as consolidation chemotherapy, followed by maintenance chemotherapy with methotrexate, etoposide and ATRA. RESULTS: Of the 106 patients, median age was 43.5 years (15-73 years) and 19 (17.9%) were older than 60 years. Fifty-six patients (52.8%) were female. Common subtypes were M4 (28.3%), M1 (26.4%) and M2 (20.8%). Of the 95 patients who were performed with cytogenetic analysis, 55 (58%) had abnormal karyotype. AML with recurrent cytogenetic translocations, complex chromosome, trisomy 8, polyploidy, del 5q and del 7q were found in 16.8, 6.3, 5.3, 5.3, 2.1 and 3.2%, respectively. Most patients (70.5%) had intermediate-risk cytogenesis. Eighty patients (75.5%) were treated with idarubicin and cytarabine induction regimen. Of the 96 evaluable patients, 60 (62.5%) achieved complete remission (CR), 38 (39.6%) with the first course of chemotherapy. Median time to CR was 54 days (25-168 days). The CR rate was 78.6% for the good-risk cytogenetic group, 67.2% for the intermediate- risk cytogenetic group, and 37.5% for the poor-risk cytogenetic group. Median follow-up time was 10.4 months, 5-year-DFS and 5-year-OS were 41 and 22.2%, respectively. Patients with poor-risk cytogenetic factors had significantly lower CR rate (p = 0.021). The CR status significantly predicted OS (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The overall complete remission rate of Thai AML patients is in 60%. Only a small proportion of the presented patients have long-term DFS and OS, the significant factor for predicting survival of Thai AML patients is the complete remission status. Poor-risk cytogenetic factors are associated with poor treatment outcomes.","['Niparuck, Pimjai', 'Chuncharunee, Suporn', 'Ungkanont, Artit', 'Udomtrupayakul, Umaporn', 'Aungchaisuksiri, Puntep', 'Rerkamnuatchoke, Budsaba', 'Jootar, Saengsuree', 'Atichartakarn, Vichai']","['Niparuck P', 'Chuncharunee S', 'Ungkanont A', 'Udomtrupayakul U', 'Aungchaisuksiri P', 'Rerkamnuatchoke B', 'Jootar S', 'Atichartakarn V']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. niparuckblue@gmail.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Thailand,J Med Assoc Thai,Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet,7507216,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Thailand', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/09/24 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/24 06:00'],"['2009/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Med Assoc Thai. 2009 Sep;92(9):1143-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: The proliferation inhibition rates of THP-1 cells after various treatments were examined by MTT assay. Apoptosis rate was determined with Annexin V- FITC/PI double staining by flow cytometry. The expression and distribution change of the phosphorylation p38MAPK (P-p38MAPK) were detected by immunohistochemical staining. The changes of P-p38 MAPK and Fas proteins were detected by Western blot. RESULT: The proliferations of leukemia cell line THP-1 are inhibited by allicin. MTT assay showed that allicin can inhibit the proliferation of the THP-1 cell, and the inhibition was dependent on both dose and time. The IC50 of 72 hours was 12.8 mg x L(-1). Apoptosis rate detected by Annexin V-FITC/PI was proportional to the concentration of the allicin. After the immunohistochemical staining test, the P-p38MAPK was located in the cell nucleus and plasma, showing deep brown, when adding allicin to THP-1 cell. Western blot test showed that the P-p38MAPK proteins expression was proportional to the concentration of Allicin and was also dose dependent. The levels of P-p38MAPK in negative control group, 1/2 IC50 of 72 hours group and IC50 of 72 hours group were 0.259 8 +/- 0.013 2, 0.61 2 +/- 0.008 3 and 0.505 6 +/- 0.005 5 respectively, and the levels of Fas proteins were 0.287 4 +/- 0.008 9, 0.426 8 +/- 0.007 9 and 0.597 1 +/- 0.010 9 respectively. The difference was statistically significant when compared with the negative control group (P < 0.01).

METHODS: Human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains H37Ra, H37Rv, or Beijing genotype (BJTB), respectively, to construct the infection models. Cell apoptosis was detected using flow cytometry. The distribution of the apoptotic proteins was detected using immunofluorescent staining assays. The cells late apoptosis was detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining assays. The change of cell death was determined by Tyrpan blue staining assays. RESULTS: THP-1 apoptosis was induced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains H37Ra, H37Rv, and BJTB. H37Ra strongly induced THP-1 apoptosis, H37Rv weakly induced THP-1 apoptosis, and BJTB induced THP-1 apoptosis at the lowest level among these three Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. On the contrary, BJTB strongly induced THP-1 death, H37Rv weakly induced THP-1 death, and H37Ra induced THP-1 death at the lowest level.

Retroviral transduction of HMC1.1 and HMC1.2 cell lines with vectors carrying DNA to be transcribed to RNAi against the wild type or mutant c-kit messengers reduced Kit protein levels considerably, decreased cell proliferation, and increased the apoptotic levels five days after retroviral infection.

Currently, we are not able to routinely separate a sufficient quantity of bone marrow CD117+ cells for experimental purposes. AIM: The aim of this study was to establish an immunomagnetic separation method for CD117+ hematopoietic stem cell isolation and to estimate the expression of chosen BCl-2 family protein members in these elements. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 120 samples of human and murine bone marrow were acquired using the magnetic separation system. The cells were stained for CD117, BCl-2, BAX, and CD33 by an indirect fluorescent immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: The flow cytometry analysis showed only 2.6% CD117+ cells from human as well as mouse bone marrow which is insufficient for further experiments. Cytospin was not good for morphologic characterization and immunophenotyping due to the fragility and destruction of the studied cells. Therefore, cell suspension staining was selected and by this method we found CD117 positivity in 70% of the mononuclerar (CD33 positive) elements in the case of chronic myeloid leukaemia. Labelling of the BCl-2 family in this case showed antiapoptotic BCl-2 expression in 80 %, proapoptotic BAX expression in approximately 5%. CONCLUSION: Our results show that CD117 immunomagnetic separation from bone marrow material is not acceptable for experimental purposes. They demonstrate that the only practical useful for the bone marrow cell examination (morphology and immunophenotype) is cell suspension staining which uncovers the distribution of both cytoplasmic proteins and surface antigens of immature blood elements.","['Luzna, Pavla', 'Kylarova, Dana', 'Novak, Martin', 'Lichnovsky, Vaclav']","['Luzna P', 'Kylarova D', 'Novak M', 'Lichnovsky V']","['Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, Olomouc, 775 15, Czech Republic. pavla83@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Czech Republic,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub,"Biomedical papers of the Medical Faculty of the University Palacky, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia",101140142,['EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/*classification', 'Humans', '*Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*analysis']",2009/09/23 06:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/09/23 06:00'],"['2009/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5507/bp.2009.020 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub. 2009 Jun;153(2):121-3. doi: 10.5507/bp.2009.020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: A meta-analysis using SIRs from 18 studies of non-AIDS cancer in HIV-infected individuals. METHODS: SIRs for non-AIDS cancers in HIV-infected individuals and 95% confidence limits (CLs) were abstracted from each study. Random effects meta-analyses were used to estimate summary SIRs. Modifications by gender, AIDS, and HAART era were estimated with meta-regression. RESULTS: Four thousand seven hundred ninety-seven non-AIDS cancers occurred among 625,716 HIV-infected individuals. SIRs for several cancers were elevated. In particular, cancers associated with infections, such as anal (SIR = 28; 95% CL 21 to 35), liver (SIR = 5.6; 95% CL 4.0 to 7.7), and Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR = 11; 95% CL 8.8 to 15) and smoking, such as lung (SIR = 2.6; 95% CL 2.1 to 3.1), kidney (SIR = 1.7; 95% CL 1.3 to 2.2), and laryngeal (SIR = 1.5; 95% CL 1.1 to 2.0). AIDS was associated with greater SIRs for Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, lung, brain, and all non-AIDS cancers combined. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected individuals may be at an increased risk of developing non-AIDS cancers, particularly those associated with infections and smoking. An association with advanced immune suppression was suggested for certain cancers.","['Shiels, Meredith S', 'Cole, Stephen R', 'Kirk, Gregory D', 'Poole, Charles']","['Shiels MS', 'Cole SR', 'Kirk GD', 'Poole C']","['Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA. shielsms@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['P30 AI-50410/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009314-28S3/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009314-23/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI050410-11/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009314/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI050410/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),100892005,['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-HIV Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/*complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/immunology', 'Risk Factors', 'Uganda/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology']",2009/09/23 06:00,2009/12/22 06:00,['2009/09/23 06:00'],"['2009/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/QAI.0b013e3181b327ca [doi]'],ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2009 Dec;52(5):611-22. doi: 10.1097/QAI.0b013e3181b327ca.,PMC2790038,['NIHMS139884'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present review summarizes recent advances in the biology, diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of NPM1-mutated AML. RECENT FINDINGS: Diagnostic criteria of NPM1-mutated AML are discussed in the light of its recent inclusion in the 2008 WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms. We also outline the most recent findings on prognosis and monitoring of minimal residual disease in NPM1-mutated AML and their implications for therapeutic decisions. Moreover, new insights are presented into the molecular mechanisms underlying perturbed nucleophosmin traffic in NPM1-mutated AML, which provides the rationale for the development of targeted therapies.

Hepatosplenic candidiasis, an uncommon form of invasive Candida species infection, was recently suggested to belong to the spectrum of fungus-related IRIS. We report 2 cases of probable hepatosplenic candidiasis according to the guidelines of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the Mycosis Study Group, occurring in pediatric patients with acute leukemia during rapid neutrophil recovery after cytotoxic chemotherapy. In both cases, abdominal computed tomography scan revealed multiple hepatic micronodules, and liver biopsy showed nonspecific granulomatous lesions. Hepatosplenic candidiasis symptoms (fever, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain) resolved within 2 days after adjunction of corticosteroid therapy to antifungal treatment. Inflammatory markers and related radiologic abnormalities decreased or disappeared within 1 month. Recovery of neutrophil count in a context of hepatosplenic candidiasis may result in a heightened inflammatory response.

Major toxicity effects reported are hypersensitivity reactions and dysfunctions of the liver and pancreas. Acute pancreatitis (AP) induced by L-asp has been noted in 2.5% to 16% of the treated patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and outcome of AP in children with ALL treated with L-asp in a tertiary care pediatric hospital. METHODS: From January 1999 to June 2005, the charts of children with ALL admitted for L-asp treatment were reviewed. Data from children who developed AP were analyzed retrospectively. AP was defined as the presence of clinical data (nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain), elevated pancreatic enzymes, and changes in the abdominal ultrasound and/or computed tomography (CT) scan. Clinical and biochemical data, abdominal ultrasound, and CT scan findings, complications, treatment, and outcome were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: During the last 6 years, 266 ALL new cases were started on chemotherapy including L-asp, of which 18 of 266 (6.7%) developed AP. Pancreatic necrosis by CT scan was found in 10 patients, peripancreatic collections and pseudocyst formation were detected in 5 and 3 cases, respectively, and resolved by cystogastrostomy or drainage. Two patients developed chronic pancreatitis and 3 diabetes. There was no relationship between number of doses and pancreatic toxicity. None of the patient died due to pancreatic toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: L-asp is an effective drug to treat ALL, the administration of L-asp requires the monitoring of pancreatic toxicity to detect AP and have treatment initiated as early as possible. Chronic complications after AP occur in almost one third of cases.","['Flores-Calderon, Judith', 'Exiga-Gonzalez, Emma', 'Moran-Villota, Segundo', 'Martin-Trejo, Jorge', 'Yamamoto-Nagano, Alfonso']","['Flores-Calderon J', 'Exiga-Gonzalez E', 'Moran-Villota S', 'Martin-Trejo J', 'Yamamoto-Nagano A']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Hospital de Pediatria, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City, Mexico. judithflores1@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Asparaginase/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Drug Hypersensitivity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Pancreatic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Pancreatitis/*chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/09/23 06:00,2010/01/26 06:00,['2009/09/23 06:00'],"['2009/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181b794e8 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2009 Oct;31(10):790-3. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181b794e8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify, at the submicroscopic level, oncogenic lesions that cooperate with BCR-ABL1 to induce ALL, we performed an investigation of genomic copy number alterations using single nucleotide polymorphism array, genomic polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing of candidate genes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-three patients with de novo adult Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) -positive ALL were enrolled onto institutional (n = 17) or Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Maligne dell'Adulto Working Party delle Leucemia Acute (n = 66) clinical trials. Treatments included tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) alone, conventional chemotherapy, or a combination of TKI and chemotherapy. RESULTS: A 7p12 deletion of IKZF1 (Ikaros) was identified in 52 (63%) of 83 patients. The pattern of deletion varied among different patients, but the two most common deletion types were loss of exons 4 to 7 in 31 (37%) of 83 patients and loss of exons 2 to 7 in 17 (20%) of 83 patients. Disease-free survival (DFS) was shorter in patients with IKZF1 deletion versus patients with IKZF1 wild type (10 v 32 months, respectively; P = .02). Furthermore, a significantly shorter cumulative incidence of relapse was recorded in patients with IKZF1 deletion versus patients with IKZF1 wild type (10.1 v 56.1 months, respectively; P = .001). Multivariate analysis confirmed the negative prognostic impact of IKZF1 deletion on DFS (P = .04). CONCLUSION: We conclude that IKZF1 deletions are likely to be a genomic alteration that significantly affects the prognosis of Ph-positive ALL in adults.","['Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Storlazzi, Clelia Tiziana', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Paoloni, Francesca', 'Cilloni, Daniela', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Vitale, Antonella', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Cimino, Giuseppe', 'Papayannidis, Cristina', 'Paolini, Stefania', 'Elia, Loredana', 'Fazi, Paola', 'Meloni, Giovanna', 'Amadori, Sergio', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Foa, Robin']","['Martinelli G', 'Iacobucci I', 'Storlazzi CT', 'Vignetti M', 'Paoloni F', 'Cilloni D', 'Soverini S', 'Vitale A', 'Chiaretti S', 'Cimino G', 'Papayannidis C', 'Paolini S', 'Elia L', 'Fazi P', 'Meloni G', 'Amadori S', 'Saglio G', 'Pane F', 'Baccarani M', 'Foa R']","['Molecular Biology Unit, Department of Hematology and Oncology L. and A.

Metaphase cytogenetics (MC) detects an abnormal karyotype in only half of patients with AML, however. Single nucleotide polymorphism arrays (SNP-A) can detect acquired somatic uniparental disomy (UPD) and other cryptic defects, even in samples deemed normal by MC. We hypothesized that SNP-A will improve detection of chromosomal defects in AML and that this would enhance the prognostic value of MC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed 250K and 6.0 SNP-A analyses on 140 patients with primary (p) and secondary (s) AML and correlated the results with clinical outcomes and Flt-3/nucleophosmin (NPM-1) status. RESULTS: SNP-A is more sensitive than MC in detecting unbalanced lesions (pAML, 65% v 39%, P = .002; and sAML, 78% v 51%, P = .003). Acquired somatic UPD, not detectable by MC, was common in our AML cohort (29% in pAML and 35% in sAML). Patients with SNP-A lesions including acquired somatic UPD exhibited worse overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in pAML with normal MC and in pAML/sAML with abnormal MC. SNP-A improved the predictive value of Flt-3 internal tandem duplication/NPM-1 status, with inferior survival seen in patients with additional SNP-A defects. Multivariate analyses confirmed the independent predictive value of SNP-A defects for OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.52; 95% CI, 1.29 to 5.22; P = .006) and EFS (HR = 1.72; 95% CI, 1.12 to 3.48; P = .04).

T-cell leukemia 1 (TCL1), the AKT modulator and proto-oncogene, is differentially expressed in CLL and linked to its pathogenesis based on CD5(+) B-cell expansions arising in TCL1-transgenic mice. We studied here the association of TCL1 levels and its intracellular dynamics with the in vitro responses to BCR stimulation in 70 CLL cases. The growth kinetics after BCR engagement correlated strongly with the degree and timing of induced AKT phospho-activation. This signaling intensity was best predicted by TCL1 levels and the kinetics of TCL1-AKT corecruitment to BCR membrane activation complexes, which further included the kinases LYN, SYK, ZAP70, and PKC. High TCL1 levels were also strongly associated with aggressive disease features, such as advanced clinical stage, higher white blood cell counts, and shorter lymphocyte doubling time. Higher TCL1 levels independently predicted an inferior clinical outcome (ie, shorter progression-free survival, P < .001), regardless of therapy regimen, especially for ZAP70(+) tumors. We propose TCL1 as a marker of the BCR-responsive CLL subset identifying poor prognostic cases where targeting BCR-associated kinases may be therapeutically useful.","['Herling, Marco', 'Patel, Kaushali A', 'Weit, Nicole', 'Lilienthal, Nils', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Jones, Dan']","['Herling M', 'Patel KA', 'Weit N', 'Lilienthal N', 'Hallek M', 'Keating MJ', 'Jones D']","['Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas M.

Whilst many authors have focused on the study of miRNA expression in physiological and pathological processes, various technical variables related to miRNA isolation have simultaneously emerged and the stability of the stored miRNA samples has been questioned. A robust method for RNA isolation is essential for reproducible results and miRNAs instability in the stored samples would make for an alarming situation for most expression studies. Here these issues are discussed and we investigate the stability of miRNAs isolated from clinical samples of B lymphocytes (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) by the most commonly utilized method based on a Trizol/TRI-Reagent solution (RNAs stored at -80 degrees C). To assess the stability of miRNAs, a Real Time-PCR analysis was performed for a panel of 29 miRNAs from a freshly isolated RNA sample and after 14 days storage at -80 degrees C. Furthermore, a Real Time-PCR analysis was repeatedly performed for a stored RNA sample over a period of approximately 10 months. We observed high stability of isolated miRNAs and respective cDNAs. The reproducibility and efficiency of the Trizol/TRI-Reagent isolation method was also tested and compared to the mirVana Isolation kit (Ambion) and RNeasy kit (Qiagen). In conclusion, Trizol/TRI-Reagent based isolation is a robust reproducible method, and obtained miRNA samples do not show any tendency to degradation when properly stored and handled.","['Mraz, M', 'Malinova, K', 'Mayer, J', 'Pospisilova, S']","['Mraz M', 'Malinova K', 'Mayer J', 'Pospisilova S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Center of Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy, University Hospital Brno, 625 00 Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090919,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Guanidines)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Solutions)', '0 (trizol)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/chemistry', 'Guanidines/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis', 'MicroRNAs/chemistry/*isolation & purification', 'Phenols/chemistry', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*RNA Stability', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Solutions', 'Specimen Handling']",2009/09/23 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/23 06:00'],"['2009/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(09)01863-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.09.061 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2009 Dec 4;390(1):1-4. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.09.061.

The absolute emergency involves malignant primary orbital tumors, such as rhabdomyosarcoma or secondary malignant tumors (metastatic neuroblastoma, leukemia), involving a vital prognosis requiring prompt diagnosis. Delayed emergencies are usually vascular lesions. Among these lesions, immature orbital hemangioma, with a good prognosis, must be distinguished from orbital adnexal lymphangiomas, which are less frequent but can lead to dramatic cosmetic and functional disorders. In rare cases, they can be responsible for sudden, painful proptosis, due to orbital hemorrhage, with a risk of optic nerve compression, requiring emergency surgical treatment. Neurogenous lesions, either isolated, such as in gliomas, or associated with a systemic disease, such as Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis, threaten the functional prognosis. Diagnosis of pediatric orbital tumors is based on a good clinical examination, precise imaging investigations, and evaluation of the locoregional extension of the tumor. Biopsy is required in emergency situations, when rhabdomyosarcoma is suspected, in order to start the chemotherapy. However, the biopsy can be superfluous, and even useless or dangerous, when clinical and imaging investigations are sufficient to provide a diagnosis of capillary hemangioma, lymphangioma, or metastatic tumor from an abdominal malignancy. Treatment is closely related to the etiopathogenesis of the tumor. The outcomes are vital, functional and cosmetic. They may require orbital surgery (biopsy, tumoral resection, orbital decompression in case of a compressive hemorrhage), systemic corticotherapy (as in immature adnexal hemangioma), radiation, and chemotherapy (rhabdomyosarcoma, secondary malignant tumor). These diseases require a pediatric ophthalmological medical center specializing in orbital surgery, with close collaboration of multiple specialists such as onco-pediatricians and neurosurgeons.","['Morax, S', 'Desjardins, L']","['Morax S', 'Desjardins L']","[""Service d'ophtalmologie et de chirurgie plastique et reconstructive ophtalmologique, Fondation Ophtalmologique A. de Rothschild, Paris, France. vdauvin@fo-rothschild.fr""]",['fre'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20090409,France,J Fr Ophtalmol,Journal francais d'ophtalmologie,7804128,,IM,"['Angiodysplasia/diagnosis/therapy', 'Child', 'Emergencies', 'Humans', 'Lymphangioma/diagnosis/therapy', '*Orbital Neoplasms/diagnosis/therapy', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/diagnosis/therapy']",2009/09/23 06:00,2010/01/27 06:00,['2009/09/23 06:00'],"['2007/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0181-5512(09)00076-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jfo.2008.10.004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Fr Ophtalmol. 2009 May;32(5):357-67. doi: 10.1016/j.jfo.2008.10.004.

In a search for new putative familial breast cancer syndromes we studied Swedish families undergoing genetic counselling during 1992-2000.Four thousand families from counselling clinics in Sweden were eligible for study. Families with breast cancer only were excluded, as were families with mutations in genes already known to be associated with malignant diseases. We identified 803 families with two or more cases of breast cancer and at least one other type of cancer. The observed proportion of different types of non-breast cancer was compared with the percentage distribution of non-breast cancer tumours in Sweden in 1958 and 1999.We found tumours in the colon, ovary, endometrium, pancreas and liver, as well as leukaemia in a significantly larger proportion of the study population than in the general population in both years. These tumours were also seen among families where several members had one additional tumour, suggesting that malignancies at these sites, in combination with breast tumours, could constitute genetic syndromes. Endometrial carcinoma has not previously been described in the context of breast cancer syndromes and the excess of malignancies at this site could not be explained by secondary tumours. Thus, we suggest that endometrial carcinoma and breast cancer constitute a new breast cancer syndrome. Further investigation is warranted to categorize phenotypes of both breast and endometrial tumours in this subgroup.","['von Wachenfeldt, Anna', 'Lindblom, Annika', 'Gronberg, Henrik', 'Einbeigi, Zakaria', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Gardman, Camilla', 'Iselius, Lennart']","['von Wachenfeldt A', 'Lindblom A', 'Gronberg H', 'Einbeigi Z', 'Rosenquist R', 'Gardman C', 'Iselius L']","['Department of Oncology, Karolinska University Hospital, Sodersjukhuset, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden. anna.vonwachenfeldt-vappling@karolinska.se']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20070315,Poland,Hered Cancer Clin Pract,Hereditary cancer in clinical practice,101231179,,,,2007/01/01 00:00,2007/01/01 00:01,['2009/09/23 06:00'],"['2009/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2007/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['1897-4287-5-1-17 [pii]', '10.1186/1897-4287-5-1-17 [doi]']",epublish,Hered Cancer Clin Pract. 2007 Mar 15;5(1):17-24. doi: 10.1186/1897-4287-5-1-17.,PMC3401933,,,,,,,,,,,['South Swedish Oncogenetic Study Group'],,,,,

The MTT results revealed that the ethanolic extracts possessed stronger antiproliferative activities than the corresponding aqueous ones. The bioactive fractions of the ethanolic extracts were mostly found in n-hexane and/or ethyl acetate fractions, which by TLC analysis were shown to contain terpenes and/or phenolic compounds. The ethyl acetate fraction from the ethanolic extract of Elephantopus scaber showed the highest effect with IC50 values of less than 25 microg/mL on three susceptible cell lines, namely, PC-3 (human prostate carcinoma cell), CNE (human nasopharyngeal carcinoma epithelial cell) and HL-60 (human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell). Further isolation and analysis of this fraction led to the identification of three sesquiterpene lactones, two flavonoids and five triterpenes. MTT results showed that the sesquiterpene lactones were the most effective group with IC50 values ranging from 0.9 to 7.5 microM while the flavonoids possessed moderate to strong effect with IC50 values ranging from 17.3 to 42.6 microM. However, the triterpenes displayed weak effect with IC50 values larger than 50 microM. Among the active compounds, deoxyelephantopin, a sesquiterpene lactone, exhibited the strongest effect on the PC-3, CNE and HL-60 cells, with IC50 values of 4.6, 2.6 and 0.9 microM, respectively.

Among the 32 patients with baseline mutation, mutations including M244V, G250E, E255K, M351T, H396R, S417Y, E450K and E459K disappeared in 8 patients and new mutations were detected in 9 patients, all of which were T315I. Among the 23 patients without baseline mutation, 4 patients showed newly developed mutations including T315I, T315I + E459K, M244V and F359V. The T315I was the most frequently detected mutation in imatinib therapy (16%, 9 of 55) as well as in dasatinib or nilotinib therapy (24%, 11 of 44). Patients with imatinib resistant baseline mutations had a higher rate of mutation development during dasatinib or nilotinib treatment compared to patients without baseline mutations (28% vs. 17%).","['Kim, Wan-Seok', 'Kim, Dongho', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Kweon, Il-Young', 'Kim, Soo-Hyun', 'Goh, Hyun-Gyung', 'Park, Sa-Hee', 'Lee, Jeong']","['Kim WS', 'Kim D', 'Kim DW', 'Kweon IY', 'Kim SH', 'Goh HG', 'Park SH', 'Lee J']","['Molecular Genetic Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Philadelphia Chromosome/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Point Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Republic of Korea', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/09/22 06:00,2010/06/29 06:00,['2009/09/22 06:00'],"['2009/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.918 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2010 Jun;28(2):82-8. doi: 10.1002/hon.918.,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism by which kahweol initiates apoptosis remains poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the effect of kahweol on the apoptotic pathway in U937 human promonocytic cells. We show that kahweol induces apoptosis in association with the activation of caspase 3 and cytochrome c release from the mitochondria to the cytosol, as well as down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and XIAP). Kahweol altered the phosphorylation state of members of the MAPKs and Akt. Ectopic expression of Bcl-2 or constitutive active Akt (myr-Akt) in U937 cells attenuates kahweol-induced apoptosis. In addition, we have also shown that JNK and Akt signal pathway plays a crucial role in kahweol-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. Taken together, our results show the activity of kahweol to modulate multiple components in apoptotic response of human leukemia cells and raise the possibility a novel therapeutic strategy in hematological malignancies.","['Oh, Jung Hwa', 'Lee, Jung Tae', 'Yang, Eun Sun', 'Chang, Jong-Soo', 'Lee, Dong Sun', 'Kim, Sang Hyun', 'Choi, Yung Hyun', 'Park, Jong-Wook', 'Kwon, Taeg Kyu']","['Oh JH', 'Lee JT', 'Yang ES', 'Chang JS', 'Lee DS', 'Kim SH', 'Choi YH', 'Park JW', 'Kwon TK']","['Department of Immunology, Keimyung University, Jung-Gu, Taegu, South Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '6894-43-5 (kahweol)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'U937 Cells']",2009/09/22 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/09/22 06:00'],"['2009/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-009-0407-x [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2009 Nov;14(11):1378-86. doi: 10.1007/s10495-009-0407-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism by which this pathway is activated in cells exposed to NO is not known. Here we report that BAX and BAK are activated by NO and that cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria. Cells deficient in Bax and Bak or Caspase-9 are completely protected from NO-induced cell death. The individual loss of the BH3-only proteins, Bim, Bid, Puma, Bad or Noxa, or Bid knockdown in Bim(-/-)/Puma(-/-) MEFs, does not prevent NO-induced cell death. Our data show that the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1 undergoes ASK1-JNK1 mediated degradation upon exposure to NO, and that cells deficient in either Ask1 or Jnk1 are protected against NO-induced cell death. NO can inhibit the mitochondrial electron transport chain resulting in an increase in superoxide generation and peroxynitrite formation. However, scavengers of ROS or peroxynitrite do not prevent NO-induced cell death. Collectively, these data indicate that NO degrades MCL-1 through the ASK1-JNK1 axis to induce BAX/BAK-dependent cell death.","['Snyder, Colleen M', 'Shroff, Emelyn H', 'Liu, Jing', 'Chandel, Navdeep S']","['Snyder CM', 'Shroff EH', 'Liu J', 'Chandel NS']","['Department of Medicine, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['1P01HL071643/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL071643/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '2T32HL076139-06/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL076139/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA123067/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA123067-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090921,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Bak1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Electron Transport Chain Complex Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 5)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (Map3k5 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/*metabolism', 'Electron Transport Chain Complex Proteins/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 5/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8/*metabolism', 'Multigene Family', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitric Oxide/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*metabolism']",2009/09/22 06:00,2010/02/02 06:00,['2009/09/22 06:00'],"['2009/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0007059 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Sep 21;4(9):e7059. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0007059.,PMC2741604,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explored the safety and feasibility of outpatient management of these patients. A total of 100 consecutive patients underwent a matched-related donor myeloablative allogeneic HSCT for a hematologic malignancy at a single institution. Patients were hospitalized briefly for stem-cell infusion and thereafter only for complications more safely managed in the in-patient setting. The median hospital length of stay from the start of the preparative regimen to day +30 and day +100 post-transplant was 12 and 15 days, respectively. Planned hospital discharge occurred in 79 patients after stem cell infusion. Patients were readmitted to hospital at median of day +7 post transplant, with neutropenic fever being the primary cause for readmission. In total, 18 patients required no in-patient care in the first 100 days.

Aberrant expression of Evi-1 has been frequently found in myeloid leukemia, and is associated with a poor patient survival. Recently, we reported candidate target genes of Evi-1 shared in HSCs and leukemic cells using gene expression profiling analysis. In this study, we identified Pbx1, a proto-oncogene in hematopoietic malignancy, as a target gene of Evi-1. Overexpression of Evi-1 increased Pbx1 expression in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. An analysis of the Pbx1 promoter region revealed that Evi-1 upregulates Pbx1 transcription. Furthermore, reduction of Pbx1 levels through RNAi-mediated knockdown significantly inhibited Evi-1-induced transformation. In contrast, knockdown of Pbx1 did not impair bone marrow transformation by E2A/HLF or AML1/ETO, suggesting that Pbx1 is specifically required for the maintenance of bone marrow transformation mediated by Evi-1. These results indicate that Pbx1 is a target gene of Evi-1 involved in Evi-1-mediated leukemogenesis.","['Shimabe, M', 'Goyama, S', 'Watanabe-Okochi, N', 'Yoshimi, A', 'Ichikawa, M', 'Imai, Y', 'Kurokawa, M']","['Shimabe M', 'Goyama S', 'Watanabe-Okochi N', 'Yoshimi A', 'Ichikawa M', 'Imai Y', 'Kurokawa M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate school of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*physiology', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology']",2009/09/22 06:00,2010/01/06 06:00,['2009/09/22 06:00'],"['2009/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2009288 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.288 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2009 Dec 10;28(49):4364-74. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.288.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From January 2005 to June 2008, 48 consecutive patients (male: n=29; median age: 30 years, range 14-51 years) with high-risk acute leukemia underwent allo-SCT following an IDA- or VP16-intensified conditioning regimen. The conditioning regimens were modified BUCY2 (busulfan+cyclophosphamide) consisting of IDA (15 mg/m2 per day, days -12 to -10) or VP16 (25 mg/kg per day, days -3 to -2) and CY/TBI (cyclophosphamide/total body irradiation) intensified with IDA (15 mg/m2 per day, days -6 to -5) or VP16 (25 mg/kg per day, days -3 to -2) for acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, respectively. RESULTS: Between the two groups, no significant differences in terms of baseline characteristics, incidence of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or transplant-related mortality (TRM) (P=0.50) were observed. However, the IDA group demonstrated higher incidences of mucositis and Aspergillus pneumonia (P<0.01 and P=0.03, respectively). For the IDA and VP16 groups, relapse rates were 28% and 50%, respectively (P=0.13). For the same groups, the 2-year probabilities of leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) were 72% versus 51% (P=0.04) and 74% versus 53% (P=0.04), respectively. CONCLUSION: This retrospective analysis suggests that conditioning regimens intensified with IDA can achieve better outcomes than conditioning regimens with VP16 in patients preparing to undergo allo-SCT for high-risk acute leukemia.","['Li, Qiu-bai', 'Li, Lei', 'You, Yong', 'Chen, Zhi-chao', 'Xia, Ling-hui', 'Zou, Ping']","['Li QB', 'Li L', 'You Y', 'Chen ZC', 'Xia LH', 'Zou P']","['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong Medical University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090921,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13909-09-6 (Semustine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'BUCY-2 protocol']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Aspergillus/isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'China', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage', 'Idarubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Mucositis/chemically induced', 'Pneumonia/chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Premedication', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Semustine/administration & dosage', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2009/09/22 06:00,2010/01/29 06:00,['2009/09/22 06:00'],"['2009/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [medline]']","['aps2009132 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2009.132 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2009 Oct;30(10):1471-8. doi: 10.1038/aps.2009.132.

We performed mutation analysis of RUNX2 on four unrelated Chinese individuals with CCD. Three novel distinct mutations were detected in the coding region of RUNX2: two missense and one frameshift. These mutations were exclusively clustered within the Runt domain. One missense mutation converts threonine to isoleucine at codon 200 (T200I). The other one substitutes leucine for arginine at codon 225 (R225L), which affects many family members. The frame-shift mutation (214fs) in exon3 leads to the introduction of a translational stop codon at codon 221, resulting in a truncated RUNX2 protein. The reporter gene assays revealed that all the mutants exhibited significantly reduced transactivation activities on the osteocalcin promoter. Our results provide new genetic evidence that mutations involved in RUNX2 contribute to CCD.

The identification of the binding interactions in the EGFR/ligands and the ABL/ligands complexes can facilitate the structure-based design of new tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We carried out induced-fit docking studies of 18 structurally diverse kinase inhibitors against the EGFR, the active and inactive states of the ABL protein. Our docking data show that the induced-fit docking (IFD) protocol can successfully reproduce the native poses of ligands from different sources. The binding interactions and the docked poses are consistent with the available experimental data. Our results indicate that imatinib is a weak binder to the active state of ABL but a strong binder to EGFR. The increased sensitivity of erlotinib to EGFR might be attributed to Cys797 of EGFR. In addition to Cys797, other important residues for kinase inhibitor design include Thr790, Met793, Lys745 and Asp855 of EGFR; and Thr315, Met318, Asp381 and Glu286 of the ABL.

We report here that OPN gene is transactivated by Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Northern blot showed enhanced OPN gene expression in cells stably expressing Tax. Co-expression of Tax increased the reporter gene expression directed by OPN promoter. Tax-induced OPN activation was abrogated by treatment with LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) or co-transfection with AKT siRNA, suggesting PI3K/AKT pathway is involved in Tax-mediated transactivation. Reporter assay with deletion mutants showed that the 5'-partial sequence between -765 and -660 of the OPN promoter is the region responsive to Tax, and further, disrupting the AP-1 site within this region abolished the OPN induction by Tax, indicating that Tax activation of OPN promoter is likely mediated by AP-1 site. This study suggests that OPN is one of the downstream mediators of aberrantly activated PI3K/AKT signaling by Tax, which may partially contribute to HTLV-1-associated leukemogenesis.","['Zhang, Jing', 'Yamada, Osamu', 'Matsushita, Yoshihisa', 'Chagan-Yasutan, Haorile', 'Hattori, Toshio']","['Zhang J', 'Yamada O', 'Matsushita Y', 'Chagan-Yasutan H', 'Hattori T']","['Research and Development Center, FUSO Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd, Joto-ku, Osaka 536-8523, Japan. j-zhang@fuso-pharm.co.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090919,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Osteopontin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism/physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation']",2009/09/22 06:00,2010/06/09 06:00,['2009/09/22 06:00'],"['2009/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00436-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.08.028 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Jun;34(6):763-8. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.08.028.

Therefore, we have analysed alternative splicing of hMLH1 in a cohort of children with ALL. We show that alternative splicing of hMLH1 is highly variable in normal and leukaemic cells and can occur by exon skipping or by the use of an alternative splice site, both serving to down-regulate the amount of full-length hMLH1 mRNA/protein produced. Aberrant splicing was found in one child with an aggressive leukaemia in which there was a predominant hMLH1Delta6 form and an associated loss of wild-type hMLH1 protein but this was not accompanied by microsatellite instability. Functional analysis of one of the most abundant spliced forms, hMLH1Delta9/10, was shown to have a significant dominant negative effect on the functionality of the MMR pathway but again was similarly expressed in ALL and normal cells.","['Peasland, Amy', 'Matheson, Elizabeth', 'Hall, Andy', 'Irving, Julie']","['Peasland A', 'Matheson E', 'Hall A', 'Irving J']","['Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090919,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (MLH1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutL Protein Homolog 1)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', 'Alternative Splicing/*genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Child', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Humans', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'MutL Protein Homolog 1', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection']",2009/09/22 06:00,2010/03/24 06:00,['2009/09/22 06:00'],"['2009/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/13 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00422-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.08.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Mar;34(3):322-7. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.08.015.

One potential mechanism of defective apoptosis may be irregular cytokine production. The goal of our investigation was to determine in vitro production of relevant cytokines by lymphocytes of B-CLL patients. METHODS: Thirty untreated (stage A) B-CLL patients, as well as 20 stage B and C patients and 30 healthy volunteers as a control group were examined. Interleukin-4 (IL-4), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in supernatants of lymphocyte cultures of all three investigated groups. The method applied for detecting apoptosis was fluorescence microscopic analysis using acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) double staining. RESULTS: Investigation showed that in vitro lymphocyte production of IL-10 and IFN-gamma were significantly decreased in B-CLL patients, whereas there were no statistically significantly differences of IL-4 and TNF-alpha production among the tested groups. Compared with the spontaneous apoptosis observed in control subjects' lymphocytes, B-CLL lymphocytes showed increased percentages of apoptotic cells after incubation for 24h. Interestingly, increased spontaneous apoptosis of B-CLL lymphocytes was followed by decreased IL-10 and IFN-gamma production. Stage of disease did not influence B-CLL lymphocyte spontaneous apoptosis in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: These changes in cytokine production in cultures of B-CLL lymphocytes may be one of the potential mechanisms in the pathogenesis of abnormal apoptosis.","['Djurdjevic, Predrag', 'Zelen, Ivanka', 'Ristic, Petar', 'Baskic, Dejan', 'Popovic, Suzana', 'Arsenijevic, Nebojsa']","['Djurdjevic P', 'Zelen I', 'Ristic P', 'Baskic D', 'Popovic S', 'Arsenijevic N']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kragujevac, Kragujevac, Serbia. zekapeka@ptt.rs']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Arch Med Res,Archives of medical research,9312706,"['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-10/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",2009/09/22 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/22 06:00'],"['2009/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0188-4409(09)00089-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.arcmed.2009.05.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Med Res. 2009 Jul;40(5):357-63. doi: 10.1016/j.arcmed.2009.05.007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The estimation of IO is based primarily on serum ferritin level; however, many confounding factors can result in ferritin overestimation, especially in HSCT recipients. The aim of the present study was to quantify IO after HSCT using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), and to evaluate the impact of IO on hepatic function and infections. In addition, the feasibility of iron depletion was investigated. A total of 102 consecutive allogeneic HSCT recipients admitted to our outpatient department between December 2005, and December 2007, were analyzed. Primary diagnosis included acute leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome in 61% of cases. Assessment of IO after HSCT included serum ferritin; in those with hyperferritinemia (ferritin>1000 ng/mL), liver iron concentration (LIC) was evaluated by SQUID magnetic susceptometry. Iron removal therapy was offered to patients with moderate IO (LIC 1000-2000 microg Fe/g wet weight [ww]) or severe IO (LIC >2,000 microg Fe/g ww). Fifty-seven patients had a ferritin level <1000 ng/mL: the median time between HSCT and assessment of ferritin level was 1006 days (range, 93-5239 days), significantly different from the median time of 183 days (range, 78-2957 days) in the 45 patients with a ferritin level >1000 ng/mL. Out of 42 patients evaluated by SQUID, 29 had moderate to severe IO (median LIC value, 1493 microg Fe/g ww [range, 1030-3253]). In a multivariate analysis, a significant correlation was found between a ferritin level >1000 ng/mL and the presence of at least one abnormal liver function test (LFT) ORo=6.8; 95% CI=2.2-20.6). In addition, the rate of proven/probable invasive fungal disease was significantly higher in the patients with hyperferritinemia (13% vs 0%; P=.006). Nineteen of the 24 patients considered eligible for iron-depletion therapy underwent regular phlebotomy; 13 completed the program in a median of 287 days (range, 92-779 days), reaching the target of a ferritin level<500 ng/mL; LIC was significantly reduced (median, 1419 microg Fe/g ww to 625 microg Fe/g ww; P < .001) in 8 of the 9 patients who were revaluated by SQUID at the end of the iron-depletion program. In conclusion, the measurement of LIC obtained by SQUID documented the presence of moderate/severe IO in 69% of the patients with a high ferritin level. Our data showed that in HSCT recipients, high ferritin level is an independent risk factor for abnormal LFTs, and IO may be considered a potential risk factor for fungal infections. A phlebotomy program may be feasible in two-thirds of the patients who might benefit from iron depletion.","['Busca, Alessandro', 'Falda, Michele', 'Manzini, Paola', ""D'Antico, Sergio"", 'Valfre, Adriano', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Calabrese, Roberto', 'Chiappella, Annalisa', ""D'Ardia, Stefano"", 'Longo, Filomena', 'Piga, Antonio']","['Busca A', 'Falda M', 'Manzini P', ""D'Antico S"", 'Valfre A', 'Locatelli F', 'Calabrese R', 'Chiappella A', ""D'Ardia S"", 'Longo F', 'Piga A']","['Hematology 2 Unit, San Giovanni Battista Hospital and University, Turin, Italy. abusca@molinette.piemonte.it']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20090918,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Electrochemical Techniques/*instrumentation', 'Female', 'Ferritins/blood', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', '*Iron/analysis/blood/metabolism', 'Iron Overload/*diagnosis/epidemiology/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Liver/chemistry/physiopathology', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/complications/epidemiology', 'Opportunistic Infections/complications', '*Phlebotomy', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/09/22 06:00,2010/03/25 06:00,['2009/09/22 06:00'],"['2009/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(09)00419-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.09.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2010 Jan;16(1):115-22. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.09.011.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six consecutive patients (18 females, 8 males; mean age+/-S.D., 46.6+/-21.1 years) who underwent chest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including post-gadolinium 3D-GE sequence for the evaluation of PE (Group A, n=13) and a variety of other disease processes (Group B, n=13) were included in the study. Post-gadolinium 3D-GE MR sequences were retrospectively, independently and blindly evaluated by two reviewers for the image quality of pulmonary arterial vasculature, and findings of PE and other disease processes. Clinical and imaging follow-up data for all patients were obtained. Interobserver agreement was calculated by kappa statistics. RESULTS: All central and lobar pulmonary arteries, 71.4-89.6% of segmental arteries and 46.7-52.7% of subsegmental arterial units in both groups were visualized with sufficient diagnostic image quality on post-gadolinium 3D-GE sequences. PE involving lobar and segmental arteries was diagnosed in two patients in each group. Other disease processes including pneumonia, lung nodules, superior vena cava stenosis, lung metastases, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and aortic aneurysm were detected in 10 of 26 patients. There was good to excellent interobserver agreement (0.73 to 1.00) for all findings. CONCLUSION: Post-gadolinium 3D-GE sequence may be an alternative technique for the visualization of central, lobar and segmental arteries, and may diagnose PE and other pathologies involving the chest in different patient populations.","['Altun, Ersan', 'Heredia, Vasco', 'Pamuklar, Ertan', 'Zapparoli, Mauricio', 'Semelka, Richard C']","['Altun E', 'Heredia V', 'Pamuklar E', 'Zapparoli M', 'Semelka RC']","['Department of Radiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7510, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090919,Netherlands,Magn Reson Imaging,Magnetic resonance imaging,8214883,"['0 (Contrast Media)', 'AU0V1LM3JT (Gadolinium)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Contrast Media/pharmacology', 'Echocardiography/methods', 'Female', '*Gadolinium', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Observer Variation', 'Pulmonary Artery/*diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Pulmonary Embolism/*diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging', 'Retrospective Studies']",2009/09/22 06:00,2010/01/13 06:00,['2009/09/22 06:00'],"['2008/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0730-725X(09)00093-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mri.2009.05.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Magn Reson Imaging. 2009 Nov;27(9):1198-207. doi: 10.1016/j.mri.2009.05.011.

Our aim was to assess whether ischemic preconditioning (IP) reduces I/R injury to livers with chemotherapy-induced pathology. METHODS: We analyzed a series of livers from patients treated with chemotherapy for colorectal cancer who underwent IP (n=30) or not (n=31) before hepatectomy. All but one of the livers exhibited chemotherapy-induced steatosis and/ or peliosis before the I/R insult. RESULTS: Necrosis was less frequent (p=0.038) in livers with IP than in the others. IP had no influence on apoptosis as assessed by terminal transferase uridyl nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay or caspase-3, -8 and -9 expression. IP induced a twofold increase in B-cell leukemia/ lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2; p<0.05), which was localized to hepatocytes of centrolobular and peliotic areas and colocalized with the autophagy protein beclin-1 in livers with IP, suggesting their coordinated role in autophagy. Increased expression of the phosphorylated Bcl-2 was observed in preconditioned livers and was associated with a decreased immunoprecipitation of beclin-1 and the increased expression of light chain 3 type II (LC3-II). The increased number of autophagic vacuoles seen by electron microscopy confirmed an association of autophagy in chemotherapy-injured livers following IP. However, the differences in protein expression were not reflected in postresection liver-injury tests or measure of patient morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: IP is associated with a reduction in necrosis of hepatocytes already damaged by chemotherapy and an activation of autophagy. Bcl-2 and beclin-1 could be major targets in the regulation of cell death during I/R injury.","['Domart, Marie-Charlotte', 'Esposti, Davide Degli', 'Sebagh, Mylene', 'Olaya, Natalia', 'Harper, Francis', 'Pierron, Gerard', 'Franc, Brigitte', 'Tanabe, Kenneth K', 'Debuire, Brigitte', 'Azoulay, Daniel', 'Brenner, Catherine', 'Lemoine, Antoinette']","['Domart MC', 'Esposti DD', 'Sebagh M', 'Olaya N', 'Harper F', 'Pierron G', 'Franc B', 'Tanabe KK', 'Debuire B', 'Azoulay D', 'Brenner C', 'Lemoine A']","['AP-HP, Hopital Paul Brousse, Service de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090814,Netherlands,J Hepatol,Journal of hepatology,8503886,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Autophagy', 'Beclin-1', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Ischemic Preconditioning', 'Liver/*blood supply/injuries/metabolism/*pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/secondary/surgery', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Necrosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reperfusion Injury/prevention & control']",2009/09/22 06:00,2010/02/03 06:00,['2009/09/22 06:00'],"['2009/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/26 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0168-8278(09)00519-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jhep.2009.06.028 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hepatol. 2009 Nov;51(5):881-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jhep.2009.06.028.

METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was queried from 1973 to 2005, excluding recurrences, in patients <20 y. RESULTS: A total of 31,685 cases of pediatric solid malignancies were identified. Overall, 177 patients were diagnosed with a unique second malignancy before the age 20 (0.56%) The mean follow-up was for 8.5 y (2 mo-30.8 y). Mean age at diagnosis of the primary tumor was 7.7 y. The most common primary malignancies were CNS tumors (22.5%), followed by soft tissue sarcoma (15.8%), retinoblastoma (14.1%), and bone tumors (13%). Hematologic malignancies (35.5%) were the most common second malignancies noted in the cohort, followed by bone tumors (18%) and soft tissue sarcomas (15%). Hematologic malignancies had a shorter latency (3.1 y) compared with solid second tumors (11.6 y). The overall 10-y survival for the entire cohort was 41.5%. For most tumor categories, development of a secondary malignancy was associated with lower 5- and 10-y survival than expected. CONCLUSIONS: CNS tumors, retinoblastoma, and soft tissue sarcomas in children are the most common solid primary tumors, with an increased risk of a second malignancy. Leukemia is the most common second malignancy seen in pediatric solid tumors. Second malignancies are associated with significantly reduced survival rates compared with the general childhood cancer population.","['Vasudevan, Vanitha', 'Cheung, Michael C', 'Yang, Relin', 'Zhuge, Ying', 'Fischer, Anne C', 'Koniaris, Leonidas G', 'Sola, Juan E']","['Vasudevan V', 'Cheung MC', 'Yang R', 'Zhuge Y', 'Fischer AC', 'Koniaris LG', 'Sola JE']","['DeWitt Daughtry Family Department of Surgery, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida 33136, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090621,United States,J Surg Res,The Journal of surgical research,0376340,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Neoplasms/mortality', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*mortality', 'Retinoblastoma/mortality', '*SEER Program', 'Sarcoma/mortality', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/mortality', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",2009/09/22 06:00,2010/05/08 06:00,['2009/09/22 06:00'],"['2009/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/11 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-4804(09)00286-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jss.2009.05.030 [doi]']",ppublish,J Surg Res. 2010 May 15;160(2):184-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2009.05.030.

In this study, the underlying molecular mechanisms in vitro and anti-leukemia activity in vivo of ITR-284 were investigated. ITR-284 reduced the cell viability and induced apoptosis in HL-60 and WEHI-3 leukemia cells. Following exposure of cells to 30 nM of ITR-284, there is a time-dependent decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) and an increase in the reactive oxygen species (ROS). ITR-284 treatment also caused a time-dependent increase of Fas/CD95, cytosolic cytochrome c, cytosolic active form of caspase-8/-9/-3, cytosolic Apaf-1 and Bax, and the decrease of Bcl-2. However, the ITR-284-induced caspase-8/-9 and -3 activities can be blocked by pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK). In addition, the anti-leukemia effects of ITR-284 in vivo were further evaluated in BALB/c mice inoculated with WEHI-3 cells. Orally treatment with ITR-284 (2 and 10mg/kg/alternate day for 7 times) increased the survival rate and prevented the loss of body weight in leukemia mice. The enlargement of spleen and infiltration of immature myeloblastic cells into spleen red pulp were significantly reduced in ITR-284-treated mice compared with control mice. Moreover, ITR-284 application can enhance the anti-leukemia effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). These results revealed that ITR-284 acted against both HL-60 and WEHI-3 in vitrovia both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathways, and exhibited an anti-leukemic effect in a WEHI-3 orthotopic mice model of leukemia.","['Wen, Yen-Fang', 'Yang, Jai-Sing', 'Kuo, Sheng-Chu', 'Hwang, Chrong-Shiong', 'Chung, Jing-Gung', 'Wu, Hsi-Chin', 'Huang, Wen-Wen', 'Jhan, Jia-Hua', 'Lin, Chung-Ming', 'Chen, Hui-Jye']","['Wen YF', 'Yang JS', 'Kuo SC', 'Hwang CS', 'Chung JG', 'Wu HC', 'Huang WW', 'Jhan JH', 'Lin CM', 'Chen HJ']","['Medicinal Chemistry Laboratory, Biomedical Engineering Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090916,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0', ""(N-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-4,8-dihydrobenzo(1,2-b,4,5-b')dithiophene-2-carboxamide"", ')', '0 (Thiophenes)']",IM,"['Amides/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Growth Inhibitors/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Thiophenes/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/methods']",2009/09/22 06:00,2009/12/23 06:00,['2009/09/22 06:00'],"['2009/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(09)00765-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2009.09.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2010 Feb 1;79(3):389-98. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2009.09.011.

Although the protein machinery promoting fusion has been characterized extensively, the dynamics of the process are largely unknown. RESULTS: We generated human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) particles pseudotyped with the envelope (Env) protein of ecotropic murine leukemia virus eMLV to study retrovirus entry at the plasma membrane using live-cell microscopy. This Env protein mediates highly efficient pH independent fusion at the cell surface and can be functionally tagged with a fluorescent protein. To detect fusion events, double labeled particles carrying one fluorophor in Env and the other in the matrix (MA) domain of Gag were generated and characterized. Fusion events were defined as loss of Env signal after virus-cell contact. Single particle tracking of >20,000 individual traces in two color channels recorded 28 events of color separation, where particles lost the Env protein, with the MA layer remaining stable at least for a short period. Fourty-five events were detected where both colors were lost simultaneously. Importantly, the first type of event was never observed when particles were pseudotyped with a non-fusogenic Env. CONCLUSION: These results reveal rapid retroviral fusion at the plasma membrane and permit studies of the immediate post-fusion events.","['Koch, Peter', 'Lampe, Marko', 'Godinez, William J', 'Muller, Barbara', 'Rohr, Karl', 'Krausslich, Hans-Georg', 'Lehmann, Maik J']","['Koch P', 'Lampe M', 'Godinez WJ', 'Muller B', 'Rohr K', 'Krausslich HG', 'Lehmann MJ']","['Department of Virology, Universitatsklinikum Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany. peter.koch@med.uni-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090918,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (HIV Antigens)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (p17 protein, Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'HIV Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'HIV-1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Microscopy/*methods', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Staining and Labeling/methods', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Virus Internalization', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/genetics/metabolism']",2009/09/22 06:00,2010/01/14 06:00,['2009/09/22 06:00'],"['2009/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-6-84 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-6-84 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2009 Sep 18;6:84. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-6-84.,PMC2762461,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified a novel biomarker of chemosensitivity based on the induction of DNA damage by the purine nucleoside analogues (PNA) fludarabine and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (CdA). Using genome-wide expression profiling, it was observed that, in chemosensitive samples, PNA predominantly increased the expression of p53-dependent genes, among which PLK2 was the most highly activated at early time points. Conversely, in chemoresistant samples, p53-dependent and PLK2 responses were abolished. Using a quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, we confirmed that PNA dose- and time-dependently increased PLK2 expression in chemosensitive but not chemoresistant B-CLL samples. Analysis of a larger cohort of B-CLL patients showed that cytotoxicity induced by PNA correlated well with PLK2 mRNA induction. Interestingly, we observed that failure to up-regulate PLK2 following PNA and chemoresistance were not strictly correlated with structural alterations in the TP53 gene. In conclusion, we propose that testing PLK2 activation after a 24-h incubation with PNA could be used to investigate the functional integrity of DNA damage-response pathways in B-CLL cells, and predict clinical sensitivity to these drugs.","['de Viron, Emeline', 'Knoops, Laurent', 'Connerotte, Thierry', 'Smal, Caroline', 'Michaux, Lucienne', 'Saussoy, Pascale', 'Vannuffel, Pascal', 'Beert, Eline', 'Vekemans, Marie-Christiane', 'Hermans, Cedric', 'Bontemps, Francoise', 'Van Den Neste, Eric']","['de Viron E', 'Knoops L', 'Connerotte T', 'Smal C', 'Michaux L', 'Saussoy P', 'Vannuffel P', 'Beert E', 'Vekemans MC', 'Hermans C', 'Bontemps F', 'Van Den Neste E']","['De Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090918,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'EC 2.7.11.- (PLK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cladribine/pharmacology', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2009/09/22 06:00,2010/03/27 06:00,['2009/09/22 06:00'],"['2009/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7900 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07900.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Dec;147(5):641-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07900.x.

None of the patients had received pneumococcal vaccination prior to or after therapy for ALL. At 3 and 9 months after completion of chemotherapy, most patients had levels of specific antibodies to pneumococcal antigens below the presumed threshold of protection and significantly lower than those of age-matched unvaccinated healthy controls. In contrast, at 9 months after completion of therapy, only a minority of patients had immunoglobulin concentrations or lymphocyte subset counts below the age-matched reference value. Our data indicate that patients with ALL who are unvaccinated against pneumococci have a selective immunodeficiency with an impaired antibody protection against pneumococci for up to 9 months after completion of therapy. Therefore, effective prevention, including chemoprophylaxis and active immunization, has to be considered in this patient population.","['Lehrnbecher, Thomas', 'Schubert, Ralf', 'Behl, Michael', 'Koenig, Melanie', 'Rose, Markus A', 'Koehl, Ulrike', 'Meisel, Roland', 'Laws, Hans-Jurgen']","['Lehrnbecher T', 'Schubert R', 'Behl M', 'Koenig M', 'Rose MA', 'Koehl U', 'Meisel R', 'Laws HJ']","['Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany. thomas.lehrnbecher@kgu.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20090918,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antibodies, Bacterial/*blood', 'Antigens, Bacterial/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/drug effects/immunology', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",2009/09/22 06:00,2010/03/27 06:00,['2009/09/22 06:00'],"['2009/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7903 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07903.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Dec;147(5):700-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07903.x.

Many recent studies have demonstrated that ATG can also be beneficial in patients with myeloma, lymphoma, leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. This study showed, for the first time, that the cytotoxic effect of ATG can been enhanced by conjugation with saporin-S6, which is one of the most stable and active type-1 ribosome-inactivating proteins. The ATG-saporin-S6 immunotoxin showed a strong cytotoxic effect on five lymphoma- and leukaemia-derived cell lines as well as on activated lymphocytes while sparing non-haematological cell lines. ATG-saporin-S6 induced a time-dependent activation of caspase-3/7 in RAJI cells. The caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk partially rescued the cells that were treated with ATG-saporin-S6, suggesting that multiple cell death pathways, some of which are caspase independent, play a role in ATG-saporin-S6 toxicity.

It is likely that interference with embryonic development plays a role in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Ethanol-induced apoptosis has been suggested as a causal factor in the genesis of FAS. Mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells are pluripotent cells that differentiate in vitro to cell aggregates termed embryoid bodies (EBs), wherein differentiation capacity and gene expression profile are similar to those of the early embryo. METHODS: To investigate the effects of ethanol during differentiation, mES cells were cultured on a gelatin surface in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor which maintains adherent undifferentiated cells or in suspension to promote formation of EBs. All cells were treated (1-6 days) with 80 mM ethanol. The pluripotency and differentiation of mES cells were evaluated by western blotting of stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA-1), transcription factors Oct-3/4, Sox-2, and Nanog, using alkaline phosphatase staining. Apoptosis (early to late stages) was assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using TdT-mediated biotin-dUTP nick-end labelling assay and fluorescein isothiocyanate-Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. RESULTS: Ethanol increased apoptosis during in vitro differentiation of mES cells to EBs, whereas undifferentiated cells were not affected. Ethanol exposure also interfered with pluripotency marker patterns causing an upregulation of SSEA-1 under self-renewal conditions. In EBs, ethanol delayed the downregulation of SSEA-1 and affected the regulation of transcription factors during differentiation. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that ethanol may contribute to the pathogenesis of FAS by triggering apoptotic pathways during differentiation of embryonic stem cells and deregulating early stages of embryogenesis.","['Arzumnayan, Alla', 'Anni, Helen', 'Rubin, Raphael', 'Rubin, Emanuel']","['Arzumnayan A', 'Anni H', 'Rubin R', 'Rubin E']","['Department of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, 1020 Locust Street, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AA016210/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AA009976/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AA01621/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AA054121/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AA015421/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090917,England,Alcohol Clin Exp Res,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",7707242,"['0 (Central Nervous System Depressants)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Central Nervous System Depressants/*pharmacology', 'Culture Media', 'Embryonic Development/drug effects', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Ethanol/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence']",2009/09/22 06:00,2010/02/18 06:00,['2009/09/22 06:00'],"['2009/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['ACER1057 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1530-0277.2009.01057.x [doi]']",ppublish,Alcohol Clin Exp Res. 2009 Dec;33(12):2172-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2009.01057.x.

We aim to determine the HIV seropositivity of lymphoid malignant patients in a tertiary centre in Southern Nigeria. METHOD: The course of disease in 275 patients with lymphoid malignant disorders at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Benin City, Nigeria, was analysed from 1996 to 2006. Blood specimens screened for antibody to HIV infection were confirmed by Western blot and the CD4+ lymphocyte count was measured by flow cytometry technique. RESULTS: A total of 275 patients aged 18-72 years were studied. Of the 275 lymphoid malignancies 11 cases were found to be HIV seropositive giving a seroprevalence of 4%. The most frequent lymphoid malignancy in association with HIV seropositivity was non-hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) with a prevalence of 4.12% over the less frequent lymphoid neoplasms. The overall median CD4+ lymphocyte count was 185 microl with 9 cases seropositive for HIV below 200 microl (P<0.0001).

The ability of molecular genetic methods help to establish submicroscopic classification and minimal residual disease (MRD) follow up, in major percent responsible for relapse. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to detect the frequency of IgH and TCR gene rearrangements and their correlation with clinical parameters. METHODS: Forty-one children with ALL were enrolled in the study group, with initial diagnosis of IgH and TCR gene rearrangements by polimerase chain reaction (PCR). MRD follow-up was performed in induction phase when morphological remission was expected, and after intensive chemiotherapy. RESULTS: In the study group IgH rearrangement was detected in 82.9% of children at the diagnosis, while TCR rearrangement was seen in 56.1%. On induction day 33, clonal IgH rearrangements persisted in 39% and TCR rearrangements in 36.5% of children. CONCLUSION: Molecular analysis of genetic alterations and their correlation with standard prognostic parameters show the importance of risk stratification revision which leads to new therapy intensification approach.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the most potent and a specific regulator of angiogenesis which principally targets endothelial cells and regulates several of their functions, including mitogenesis, permeability and migration. The impact of elevated VEGF expression on the course of chronic myeloid leukaemia is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was the follow-up of VEGF expression during the course of CML. METHODS: We studied VEGF expression of 85 CML patients (median age 50 years, range 16-75 years). At the commencement of the study, 29 patients were in chronic phase (CP), 25 in an accelerated phase (AP), and 31 in the blast crisis (BC). The temporal expression (percentage positivity per 1000 analysed cells) VEGF proteins over the course of CML were studied using the immunohistochemical technique utilizing relevant monoclonal antibodies. It was correlated with the laboratory (Hb, WBC and platelet counts, and the percentage of blasts) and clinical parameters (organomegaly, duration of CP, AP, and BC) of disease progression. RESULTS: The expression ofVEGF protein was most pronounced in AP (ANOVA, p=0.033). The level of VEGF expression correlated inversely with the degree of splenomegaly (Pearson, r=-0.400, p=0.011). High expression of VEGF correlated with a shorter overall survival (log rank, p=0.042). CONCLUSION: Immunohistochemically confirmed significance of the expression of VEGF in dependence of the CML stage could be of clinical importance in deciding on the timing therapy. These data suggest that VEGF plays a role in the biology of CML and that VEGF inhibitors should be investigated in CML.","['Vidovic, Ana', 'Jankovic, Gradimir', 'Tomin, Dragica', 'Perunicic-Jovanovic, Maja', 'Djunic, Irena', 'Djurasinovic, Vladislava', 'Colovic, Milica']","['Vidovic A', 'Jankovic G', 'Tomin D', 'Perunicic-Jovanovic M', 'Djunic I', 'Djurasinovic V', 'Colovic M']",,['srp'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Serbia,Srp Arh Celok Lek,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,0027440,['0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2009/09/22 06:00,2009/12/23 06:00,['2009/09/22 06:00'],"['2009/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2298/sarh0908379v [doi]'],ppublish,Srp Arh Celok Lek. 2009 Jul-Aug;137(7-8):379-83. doi: 10.2298/sarh0908379v.,,,,,,,,,Prognosticki znacaj vaskularnog endotelnog faktora rasta u razvoju hronicne mijeloidne leukemije.,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The recombinated Ad-PTEN gene containing green fluorescent protein gene (Ad-PTEN-GFP) or the empty vector (Ad-GFP) was transfected into K562 cells. The growth of K562 cells was evaluated by MTT assay; the transfection efficiency of Ad-PTEN-GFP, apoptosis rate and proliferation index (PI) were assessed by flow cytometry (FCM). Morphological characteristics of transfected cells under light and transmission electron microscope were applied to demonstrated the apoptosis; DNA ladder and fluorescent staining were also tested; the PTEN, Bcl-2 mRNA levels were detected by real-time fluorescent relative-quantification reverse transcriptional PCR (FQ-PCR); PTEN and Bcl-2 protein levels were detected by Western Blotting; and Caspase-3/7 and -9 protein activity were detected by corresponding kits.

Extramedullary manifestations of a haematological disease in the female genital tract are rare. We present the case of a woman with PMB as the first sign of an acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). An 81-year-old patient presented with PMB. Manual and colposcopic examination raised suspicion of a cervical carcinoma, but histopathology and cervical Pap smear altered the diagnosis to granulocytic sarcoma (GS), an extramedullary manifestation of AML. The patient had a normal blood count 2 weeks prior to the examination, but at the time of presentation her leukocytes had risen to 116000/microl. The patient died 3 days later due to a pulmonary embolism, most probably as a result of leukostasis. In this case, GS of the cervix was the first sign of the AML with simultaneous appearance of leukocytosis and peripheral blasts. PMB was the reason for presentation. GS of the female genital tract is very rare and diagnosis is challenging, especially on the basis of the Pap smear. Abnormal inflammatory cells must be a warning sign and an indication for further examinations. GS as the presenting sign of AML has a poor prognosis with only 6% of patients surviving for more than 2 years.","['Henes, M', 'Nauth, A', 'Staebler, A', 'Becker, S', 'Henes, J C']","['Henes M', 'Nauth A', 'Staebler A', 'Becker S', 'Henes JC']","['Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20090910,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', 'Q08SIO485D (Phenprocoumon)']",IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Anticoagulants/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma/diagnosis', 'Colposcopy', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Phenprocoumon/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Pulmonary Embolism/etiology', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/complications/*diagnosis', 'Thrombophilia/drug therapy', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/complications/*diagnosis', 'Uterine Hemorrhage/*etiology']",2009/09/19 06:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2009/09/19 06:00'],"['2009/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-009-9291-z [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2010 Sep;27(3):815-9. doi: 10.1007/s12032-009-9291-z.

Microculture tetrazolium test, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) cell proliferation assay, caspase 3 activity assay, cell-based nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) phosphorylation measurement by ELISA and real-time RT-PCR were employed to appraise the effects of ATO on metabolic activity, DNA synthesis, induction of programmed cell death and NF-kappaB activation. The suppressive effects of ATO on metabolic potential, cell proliferation and NF-kappaB activation were associated with induction of apoptosis in NB-4 cells. In addition, an expressive enhancement in mRNA levels of p73, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21), tumor protein 53-induced nuclear protein 1 (TP53INP1), WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 2 (WNK2) and lipocalin 2 coupled with a significant reduction in transcriptional levels of NF-kappaB inhibitor beta (IKK2), Nemo, BCL2-like 1 (BCL-X(L)), inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP2), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), survivin, Bcl-2, TIP60, ataxia telangiectasia (ATM), SHP-2 and sirtuin (SIRT1) were observed. Altogether, these issues show for the first time that ATO treatment could trammel cell growth and proliferation as well as induces apoptosis in NB-4 cells through induction of transcriptional levels of p73, TP53INP1, WNK2, lipocalin 2 as well as suppression of NF-kappaB-mediated induction of BCL-X(L), cIAP2, XIAP and survivin. Furthermore, the inductionary effects of ATO on transcriptional stimulation of p73 might be through cramping the NF-kappaB module (through suppression of p65 phosphorylation as well as transcriptional hindering of IKK2, ATM and Nemo) along with diminishing the mRNA expression of TIP60, SHP-2 and SIRT1.","['Momeny, Majid', 'Zakidizaji, Majid', 'Ghasemi, Reza', 'Dehpour, Ahmad R', 'Rahimi-Balaei, Maryam', 'Abdolazimi, Yassan', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Ghaffari, Seyed H']","['Momeny M', 'Zakidizaji M', 'Ghasemi R', 'Dehpour AR', 'Rahimi-Balaei M', 'Abdolazimi Y', 'Ghavamzadeh A', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Ghaffari SH']","['Hematology, Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090910,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (IKBKG protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (LCN2 protein, human)', '0 (Lipocalin-2)', '0 (Lipocalins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (TP53INP1 protein, human)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Lysine Acetyltransferase 5)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (BIRC3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (WNK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Caspase 3/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Lipocalin-2', 'Lipocalins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Lysine Acetyltransferase 5', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Sirtuin 1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Survivin', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'bcl-X Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2009/09/19 06:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2009/09/19 06:00'],"['2009/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-009-9294-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2010 Sep;27(3):833-42. doi: 10.1007/s12032-009-9294-9.

Before engraftment, hemorrhagic cystitis was caused by AdV, which resulted in hydronephrosis, renal failure, and adenoviremia on day 34. Forced diuresis, hemodialysis, withdrawal of cyclosporin A, and administration of gamma-globulin or vidarabine were not effective and the patient died of pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage on day 67. At autopsy, old inflammatory change only was observed in the bladder section. In the lungs and kidneys, granular deposits in the nucleus and a high copy number of AdV-DNA were observed. Molecular diagnosis using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis demonstrated that AdV with the serotype 14 caused the cystitis. However, retrospective genome typing using PCR sequencing revealed the infection of AdV serotype 35 in the kidneys, lungs, and serum. The present case suggested that Adv infection could not be always caused by a single AdV serotype, and suggested that multiple serotype infection was very difficult to treat. It is desired that a consensus regarding the treatment of AdV infections is established.","['Abe, Takashi', 'Furukawa, Tatsuo', 'Masuko, Masayoshi', 'Sugimoto, Atsunori', 'Okazuka, Kiyoshi', 'Honma, Keiichiro', 'Fujimura, Takeo', 'Iguchi, Seitaro', 'Nishi, Shinichi', 'Ueno, Mitsuhiro', 'Nagahashi, Masayuki', 'Watanabe, Gen', 'Ajioka, Yoichi', 'Isahai, Noriatsu', 'Nagai, Koichi', 'Kazuyama, Yukumasa', 'Aizawa, Yosifusa']","['Abe T', 'Furukawa T', 'Masuko M', 'Sugimoto A', 'Okazuka K', 'Honma K', 'Fujimura T', 'Iguchi S', 'Nishi S', 'Ueno M', 'Nagahashi M', 'Watanabe G', 'Ajioka Y', 'Isahai N', 'Nagai K', 'Kazuyama Y', 'Aizawa Y']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Regenerative and Transplant Medicine, Niigata University Graduate School of Medicine and Dental Science, Asahimachi-dori 754, Niigata, 951-8510, Japan. abetaka@med.niigata-u.ac.jp.', 'Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Regenerative and Transplant Medicine, Niigata University Graduate School of Medicine and Dental Science, Asahimachi-dori 754, Niigata, 951-8510, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Regenerative and Transplant Medicine, Niigata University Graduate School of Medicine and Dental Science, Asahimachi-dori 754, Niigata, 951-8510, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Regenerative and Transplant Medicine, Niigata University Graduate School of Medicine and Dental Science, Asahimachi-dori 754, Niigata, 951-8510, Japan.', 'Division of Clinical Nephrology and Rheumatology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medicine and Dental Science, Niigata, Japan.', 'Division of Clinical Nephrology and Rheumatology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medicine and Dental Science, Niigata, Japan.', 'Division of Clinical Nephrology and Rheumatology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medicine and Dental Science, Niigata, Japan.', 'Division of Clinical Nephrology and Rheumatology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medicine and Dental Science, Niigata, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Diagnostic Pathology, Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Diagnostic Pathology, Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Diagnostic Pathology, Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Niigata Prefecture Central Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Niigata Prefecture Central Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Kitazato-Otsuka Biomedical Assay Laboratories Co., LTD, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Regenerative and Transplant Medicine, Niigata University Graduate School of Medicine and Dental Science, Asahimachi-dori 754, Niigata, 951-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090911,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Adenovirus Infections, Human/*etiology', 'Adult', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cystitis/*etiology/pathology/virology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Hemorrhage/*etiology/virology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Urinary Bladder/pathology']",2009/09/19 06:00,2010/04/09 06:00,['2009/09/19 06:00'],"['2009/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-009-0416-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-009-0416-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2009 Oct;90(3):421-425. doi: 10.1007/s12185-009-0416-0.

The cancer stem cell field was led by the discovery of leukemia stem cells (Tan, B.T., Park, C.Y., Ailles, L.E., and Weissman, I.L. (2006) The cancer stem cell hypothesis: a work in progress. Laboratory Investigation. 86, 1203-1207), and within the past few years cancer stem cells have been isolated from a number of solid tumor including those of breast and brain cancer among others (Al-Hajj M., Wicha M.S., Benito-Hernandez A., Morrison, S.J., and Clarke, M.F. (2003) Prospective identification of tumorigenic breast cancer cells. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100, 3983-3988; Singh, S.K., Clarke, I.D., Terasaki, M., Bonn, V.E., Hawkins, C., Squire, J., and Dirks, P.B. (2003) Identification of a Cancer Stem Cell in Human Brain Tumors. Cancer Research. 63, 5821-5828). Cancer stem cells exhibit far different properties than established cells lines such as relative quiescence, multidrug resistance, and multipotency (Clarke, M.F., Dick, J.E., Dirks, P.B., Eaves, C.J., Jamieson, C.H.M., Jones, D.L., Visvader, J., Weissman, I.L., and Wahl, G.M. (2006) Cancer Stem Cells-Perspectives on Current Status and Future Directions: AACR Workshop on Cancer Stem Cells. Cancer Research. 66, 9339-9344). In addition, our laboratory has demonstrated that breast cancer stem cells exhibit a strong metastatic phenotype when passaged in mice. Since stem cells exhibit these somewhat unique properties, it will be important for endocrinologists to evaluate hormonal action in these precursor cells for a more thorough understanding of cancer biology and development of more effective treatment modalities. A relatively easy and low cost method was developed to isolate breast cancer stem cells from primary needle biopsies taken from patients diagnosed with primary invasive ductal carcinoma during the routine care of patients with consent and IRB approval. Fresh needle biopsies (2-3 biopsies at 2 cm in length) were enzymatically dissociated in a collagenase (300 U/ml)/hyaluronidase (100 U/ml) solution followed by sequential filtration. Single cell suspensions were cultured on ultra low attachment plastic flasks in defined medium and formed non-adherent tumorspheres. The tumorspheres exhibited surface marker expression of CD44(+)/CD24(low/-)/ESA(+), previously defined as a ""breast cancer stem cell"" phenotype by Al Hajj et al.

Gelatin scaffolds impregnated with mouse marrow stromal cells (MSCs) transduced with MLV-expressing BMP4, Cox-2, or a control gene were implanted into mouse calvarial defects. Bone regeneration was assessed by X-ray, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and histology. In vitro, Cox-2 or prostanglandin E(2) enhanced synergistically the osteoblastic differentiation action of BMP4 in mouse MSCs. In vivo, implantation of BMP4-expressing MSCs yielded massive bone regeneration in calvarial defects after 2 weeks, but the Cox-2 strategy surprisingly did not promote bone regeneration even after 4 weeks. Staining for alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-expressing osteoblasts was strong throughout the defect of animals receiving BMP2/4-expressing cells, but defects receiving Cox-2-expressing cells displayed weak ALP staining along the edge of original intact bone, indicating that the Cox-2 strategy lacked bone-regeneration effects. The Cox-2 strategy not only lacked bone-regeneration effects but also suppressed the BMP4-induced bone regeneration. In vitro coculture of Cox-2-expressing MSCs with BMP4-expressing MSCs in gelatin scaffolds reduced BMP4 mRNA transcript levels, suggesting that Cox-2 may promote BMP4 gene silencing in BMP4-expressing cells, which may play a role in the suppressive action of Cox-2 on BMP4-mediated bone formation. In summary, the Cox-2 ex vivo gene-transfer strategy not only lacks bone-regeneration effects but also suppresses the bone-regeneration action of BMP4 in healing of calvarial defects.","['Lau, K-H William', 'Gysin, Reinhard', 'Chen, Shin-Tai', 'Wergedal, Jon E', 'Baylink, David J', 'Mohan, Subburaman']","['Lau KH', 'Gysin R', 'Chen ST', 'Wergedal JE', 'Baylink DJ', 'Mohan S']","['Musculoskeletal Disease Center (151), Jerry L.

Sophisticated purification protocols coupled with powerful biological assays permit functional analysis of highly purified cell populations both in vitro and in vivo. However, despite several decades of intensive research, the sheer complexity of the haematopoietic system means that many important questions remain unanswered or even unanswerable with current experimental tools. Scientists have therefore increasingly turned to modelling to tackle complexity at multiple levels ranging from networks of genes to the behaviour of cells and tissues. Early modelling attempts of gene regulatory networks have focused on core regulatory circuits but have more recently been extended to genome-wide datasets such as expression profiling and ChIP-sequencing data. Modelling of haematopoietic cells and tissues has provided insight into the importance of phenotypic heterogeneity for the differentiation of normal progenitor cells as well as a greater understanding of treatment response for particular pathologies such as chronic myeloid leukaemia. Here we will review recent progress in attempts to reconstruct segments of the haematopoietic system. A variety of modelling strategies will be covered from small-scale, protein-DNA or protein-protein interactions to large scale reconstructions. Also discussed will be examples of how stochastic modelling may be applied to multi cell systems such as those seen in normal and malignant haematopoiesis.","['Foster, Samuel D', 'Oram, S Helen', 'Wilson, Nicola K', 'Gottgens, Berthold']","['Foster SD', 'Oram SH', 'Wilson NK', 'Gottgens B']","['Haematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Wellcome Trust/MRC Building, Hills Rd, Cambridge, CB2 0XY.']",['eng'],['G0800784/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090714,England,Mol Biosyst,Molecular bioSystems,101251620,,IM,"['Animals', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic System/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mammals', '*Models, Biological', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2009/09/19 06:00,2010/05/13 06:00,['2009/09/19 06:00'],"['2009/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/B907225j [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biosyst. 2009 Dec;5(12):1413-20. doi: 10.1039/B907225j.

Many infecting viral genomes localize to PML-NBs, leading to speculation that these structures may represent the most efficient subnuclear location for viral replication. Conversely, many viral proteins modify or disrupt PML-NBs, suggesting that viral replication may be more efficient in the absence of these structures. Thus, a debate remains as to whether PML-NBs inhibit or enhance viral replication. Here we review and discuss recent data indicating that for herpesviruses, PML-NB proteins inhibit viral replication in cell types where productive, lytic replication occurs, while at the same time may enhance the establishment of lifelong latent infections in other cell types.","['Saffert, Ryan T', 'Kalejta, Robert F']","['Saffert RT', 'Kalejta RF']","['University of Wisconsin-Madison, Institute for Molecular Virology & McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, Madison, WI, USA Tel.: +1 608 265 5546; ; rtsaffert@wisc.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI074984/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI074984-01A1/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],,England,Future Virol,Future virology,101278124,,,,2008/05/01 00:00,2008/05/01 00:01,['2009/09/19 06:00'],"['2009/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.2217/17460794.3.3.265 [doi]'],ppublish,Future Virol. 2008 May 1;3(3):265-277. doi: 10.2217/17460794.3.3.265.,PMC2744987,['NIHMS119306'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deregulation of E2F1 leads to oncogenic DNA damage and anti-oncogenic apoptosis. The molecular mechanisms by which E2F1 mediates these two processes are poorly understood but are important for understanding cancer progression. During the G1-to-S phase transition, E2F1 associates through a short DHQY sequence with the cell-cycle regulator HCF-1 together with the mixed-lineage leukaemia (MLL) family of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferases. We show here that the DHQY HCF-1-binding sequence permits E2F1 to stimulate both DNA damage and apoptosis, and that HCF-1 and the MLL family of H3K4 methyltransferases have important functions in these processes. Thus, HCF-1 has a broader role in E2F1 function than appreciated earlier. Indeed, sequence changes in the E2F1 HCF-1-binding site can modulate both up and down the ability of E2F1 to induce apoptosis indicating that HCF-1 association with E2F1 is a regulator of E2F1-induced apoptosis.","['Tyagi, Shweta', 'Herr, Winship']","['Tyagi S', 'Herr W']","['Center for Integrative Genomics, University of Lausanne, Genopode, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090917,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (HCFC1 protein, human)', '0 (Host Cell Factor C1)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (WDR5 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis/genetics/*physiology', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA Damage/genetics/*physiology', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Host Cell Factor C1/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",2009/09/19 06:00,2009/11/05 06:00,['2009/09/19 06:00'],"['2009/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['emboj2009258 [pii]', '10.1038/emboj.2009.258 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2009 Oct 21;28(20):3185-95. doi: 10.1038/emboj.2009.258.

Recently, it was claimed that bone marrow cells transdifferentiate, a much desired property as bone marrow cells are abundant and therefore could be used in regenerative medicine to treat incurable chronic diseases. Using a Cre/loxP system, we studied cell fusion after bone marrow transplantation. Fused cells were chiefly Gr-1(+), a myeloid cell marker, and found predominantly in the bone marrow; in parenchymal tissues. Surprisingly, fused cells were most abundant in the kidney, Peyer's patches, and cardiac tissue. In contrast, after cell fusion with embryonic stem cells, bone marrow cells were reprogrammed into new tetraploid pluripotent stem cells that successfully differentiated into beating cardiomyocytes. Together, these data suggest that cell fusion is ubiquitous after cellular transplants and that the subsequent sharing of genetic material between the fusion partners affects cellular survival and function. Fusion between tumor cells and bone marrow cells could have consequences for tumor malignancy.","['Bonde, Sabrina', 'Pedram, Mehrdad', 'Stultz, Ryan', 'Zavazava, Nicholas']","['Bonde S', 'Pedram M', 'Stultz R', 'Zavazava N']","['University of Iowa & VAMC, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL073015/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HLO73015/PHS HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090917,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', '*Cell Fusion', 'Cellular Reprogramming/physiology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Integrases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/physiology', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*physiology']",2009/09/19 06:00,2010/02/26 06:00,['2009/09/19 06:00'],"['2009/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['fj.09-137141 [pii]', '10.1096/fj.09-137141 [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2010 Feb;24(2):364-73. doi: 10.1096/fj.09-137141.

Therefore, we tested different human and murine MSC lines and primary human MSCs for their ability to protect CLL cells from spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis. Our results show that both human and murine MSCs are equally effective in protecting CLL cells from fludarabine-induced apoptosis. This protective effect was sustained over a wide range of CLL-MSC ratios (5:1 to 100:1), and the levels of protection were reproducible in 4 different laboratories. Human and murine MSCs also protected CLL cells from dexamethasone- and cyclophosphamide-induced apoptosis. This protection required cell-cell contact and was virtually absent when CLL cells were separated from the MSCs by micropore filters. Furthermore, MSCs maintained Mcl-1 and protected CLL cells from spontaneous and fludarabine-induced Mcl-1 and PARP cleavage. Collectively, these studies define common denominators for CLL cocultures with MSCs. They also provide a reliable, validated tool for future investigations into the mechanism of MSC-CLL cross talk and for drug testing in a more relevant fashion than the commonly used suspension cultures.","['Kurtova, Antonina V', 'Balakrishnan, Kumudha', 'Chen, Rong', 'Ding, Wei', 'Schnabl, Susanne', 'Quiroga, Maite P', 'Sivina, Mariela', 'Wierda, William G', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Shehata, Medhat', 'Jager, Ulrich', 'Gandhi, Varsha', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Plunkett, William', 'Burger, Jan A']","['Kurtova AV', 'Balakrishnan K', 'Chen R', 'Ding W', 'Schnabl S', 'Quiroga MP', 'Sivina M', 'Wierda WG', 'Estrov Z', 'Keating MJ', 'Shehata M', 'Jager U', 'Gandhi V', 'Kay NE', 'Plunkett W', 'Burger JA']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

In this report, the ability of CD34(+) cells to generate ELC in vivo was examined using an immunodeficient mouse transplant assay system. The Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph(-)) myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are associated with the acquired mutation, JAK2V617F. In order to further examine the ability of cord blood and JAK2V617F positive MPN CD34(+) cells to generate ELC, CD34(+) cells were transplanted into NOD/SCID mice. Cells within the livers and lungs of recipient mice had phenotypic and molecular properties of human ELC as examined using RT-PCR, flow cytometric analysis and fluorescence microscopy. These cells possessed either human wild type JAK2 or JAK2V617F indicating that they were derived from the transplanted human cells and that a fraction of such cells were involved by the malignant process. Furthermore, human CD144(+) cells isolated from the livers of recipient mice formed clusters in vitro composed of ELC, which contained either wild type JAK2 or JAK2V617F suggesting that these cells are derived from either MOMC or EPC that have an extensive proliferative capacity as well as some degree of self renewal capacity. These studies indicate that adult CD34(+) cells can be affected by JAK2V617F and that they can generate ELC which might play a role in the development of thrombosis in patients with MPN.","['Sozer, Selcuk', 'Ishii, Takefumi', 'Fiel, Maria Isabel', 'Wang, Jiapeng', 'Wang, Xiaoli', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Godbold, Jim', 'Xu, Mingjiang', 'Hoffman, Ronald']","['Sozer S', 'Ishii T', 'Fiel MI', 'Wang J', 'Wang X', 'Zhang W', 'Godbold J', 'Xu M', 'Hoffman R']","['Tisch Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],['1P01CA108671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090916,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Endothelial Cells/*enzymology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/genetics', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Lung/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Philadelphia Chromosome']",2009/09/19 06:00,2009/12/29 06:00,['2009/09/19 06:00'],"['2009/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/10 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S1079-9796(09)00166-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2009.08.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2009 Nov-Dec;43(3):304-12. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2009.08.005.

This is generally achieved by national random surveys. Risk-based sample size calculations can reduce both the sample size and the costs for repeated surveys by one-third compared to traditional sample size calculations based on random sampling. In this approach, information from previous surveys can reduce the sample size of a new survey while maintaining its overall level of confidence. Risk-based sample size calculations have only formerly been described for one single survey and not when applied consecutively. Based on the existing deterministic origin of risk-based methods and sample size calculations, we devised a further development of sample size calculation to document freedom from non-highly contagious diseases. We show that for a repeated risk-based sample size calculation not only does the loss of confidence due to the risk of disease import and the risk of undetected disease within the country need to be calculated between the two surveys, but the time value of historical testing information also needs to be considered. As the order of surveys is important, a separate process, capable of calculating the time value of information from all conducted surveys, needs to be incorporated in the sample size calculation. This paper suggests how to use information from previous surveys in a risk-based approach for sample size calculations in consecutive surveys considering the adjusted time value of historical testing information, import risk assessments and the risk of disease spread within the country. Thus, the reduction of confidence between two surveys is adequately estimated. The results of sample size calculations for surveys over various years, under different conditions, show that the risk-based approach, including import risk assessments and adjusted time value of historical testing information, could reduce the sample size of annual surveys by 25% compared to the sample sizes calculated without a risk-based technique. The presented risk-based sample size calculation is appropriate for the requirements of consecutive surveys and outlines how the adjusted time value of historical testing information should be considered in this context. When planning to undertake repeated surveys to document freedom from disease, this method can easily be used to calculate sample sizes and consequently reduce them.","['Schwermer, Heinzpeter', 'Reding, Isabel', 'Hadorn, Daniela C']","['Schwermer H', 'Reding I', 'Hadorn DC']","['Swiss Federal Veterinary Office, Schwarzenburgstrasse 155, CH-3003 Bern, Switzerland. heinzpeter.schwermer@bvet.admin.ch']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090916,Netherlands,Prev Vet Med,Preventive veterinary medicine,8217463,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Female', '*Models, Statistical', '*Risk', 'Switzerland/epidemiology']",2009/09/19 06:00,2010/01/15 06:00,['2009/09/19 06:00'],"['2008/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0167-5877(09)00237-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.prevetmed.2009.08.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Prev Vet Med. 2009 Dec 1;92(4):366-72. doi: 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2009.08.021.

Studies on leukemia have provided examples for their functional implications in cancer development and progression, as well as their relevance for therapeutic targeting. A number of HDIs have been tested in clinical trials and have been proven safe with significant clinical activity. The use of HDIs in association with other molecules, such as classical chemotherapeutic drugs and DNA demethylating agents, has been implied as a promising treatment alternative for leukemia patients in the future. Here we describe the histone deacetylase inhibitors that have been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma.

HTLV-1 Tax1 transformed a T-cell line from interleukin (IL)-2-dependent growth to IL-2-independent growth, with an activity that was much more potent in comparison to HTLV-2 Tax2. This distinction was mediated by at least two Tax1 specific functions, an interaction with host cellular factors through the PDZ domain binding motif (PBM) and the activation of NF-kappa B2 (NF-kappa B2)/p100. RESULTS: Using a series of Tax1 chimeric proteins with Tax2, we found that amino acids 225-232 of Tax1, the Tax1(225-232) region, was essential for the activation of NF-kappa B2 as well as for the high transforming activity. The strict amino acid conservation of Tax1(225-232) among HTLV-1 and simian T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (STLV-1), but not HTLV-2 and STLV-2, indicates that function(s) through the Tax1(225-232) region are biologically significant. Interestingly, another HTLV-1 relative, HTLV-3, has a PBM, but does not conserve the Tax1(225-232) motif in Tax3, thus indicating that these two motifs classify the three HTLVs into the separate groups. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the combinatory functions through Tax1(225-232) and PBM play crucial roles in the distinct biological properties of the three HTLVs, perhaps also including their pathogenesis.","['Shoji, Toshiyuki', 'Higuchi, Masaya', 'Kondo, Rie', 'Takahashi, Masahiko', 'Oie, Masayasu', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Aoyagi, Yutaka', 'Fujii, Masahiro']","['Shoji T', 'Higuchi M', 'Kondo R', 'Takahashi M', 'Oie M', 'Tanaka Y', 'Aoyagi Y', 'Fujii M']","['Division of Virology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 1-757 Asahimachi-Dori, Niigata 951-8510, Japan. shoji-t@med.niigata-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090917,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 2)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/virology', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/biosynthesis', 'Primate T-lymphotropic virus 3/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology']",2009/09/19 06:00,2009/10/17 06:00,['2009/09/19 06:00'],"['2009/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-6-83 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-6-83 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2009 Sep 17;6:83. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-6-83.,PMC2754985,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was designed to demonstrate that we could learn about genes related to a specific mechanism and further use this knowledge to predict outcome in patients - a paradigm shift towards accurate ""mechanism-anchored profiling"". We propose a novel algorithm, PGnet, which predicts a tripartite mechanism-anchored network associated to epigenetic regulation consisting of phenotypes, genes and mechanisms. Genes termed as GEMs in this network meet all of the following criteria: (i) they are co-expressed with genes known to be involved in the biological mechanism of interest, (ii) they are also differentially expressed between distinct phenotypes relevant to the study, and (iii) as a biomodule, genes correlate with both the mechanism and the phenotype. RESULTS: This proof-of-concept study, which focuses on epigenetic mechanisms, was conducted in a well-studied set of 132 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) microarrays annotated with nine distinct phenotypes and three measures of response to therapy. We used established parametric and non parametric statistics to derive the PGnet tripartite network that consisted of 10 phenotypes and 33 significant clusters of GEMs comprising 535 distinct genes. The significance of PGnet was estimated from empirical p-values, and a robust subnetwork derived from ALL outcome data was produced by repeated random sampling. The evaluation of derived robust network to predict outcome (relapse of ALL) was significant (p = 3%), using one hundred three-fold cross-validations and the shrunken centroids classifier. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first method predicting co-expression networks of genes associated with epigenetic mechanisms and to demonstrate its inherent capability to predict therapeutic outcome. This PGnet approach can be applied to any regulatory mechanisms including transcriptional or microRNA regulation in order to derive predictive molecular profiles that are mechanistically anchored.

Thus, several computational methods have been proposed to prioritize candidate disease genes by integrating different data types, including sequence information, biomedical literature, and pathway information. Recently, molecular interaction networks have been incorporated to predict disease genes, but most of those methods do not utilize invaluable disease-specific information available in mRNA expression profiles of patient samples. RESULTS: Through the integration of protein-protein interaction networks and gene expression profiles of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, we identified subnetworks of interacting proteins dysregulated in AML and characterized known mutation genes causally implicated to AML embedded in the subnetworks. The analysis shows that the set of extracted subnetworks is a reservoir rich in AML genes reflecting key leukemogenic processes such as myeloid differentiation. CONCLUSION: We showed that the integrative approach both utilizing gene expression profiles and molecular networks could identify AML causing genes most of which were not detectable with gene expression analysis alone due to the minor changes in mRNA level.","['Lee, Eunjung', 'Jung, Hyunchul', 'Radivojac, Predrag', 'Kim, Jong-Won', 'Lee, Doheon']","['Lee E', 'Jung H', 'Radivojac P', 'Kim JW', 'Lee D']","['Department of Bio and Brain Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon 305-701, South Korea. ejlee@biosoft.kaist.ac.kr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090917,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Computational Biology/*methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",2009/09/26 06:00,2010/01/19 06:00,['2009/09/19 06:00'],"['2009/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-10-S9-S2 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-10-S9-S2 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2009 Sep 17;10 Suppl 9:S2. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-10-S9-S2.,PMC2745689,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rates of morbidity associated with anesthesia in hyperleukocytotic patients have not been previously described. This retrospective study describes the perioperative morbidity and mortality of children who present acutely with hyperleukocytosis. METHODS: All patients under 17 years of age with leukemia complicated by hyperleukocytosis and who received general anesthesia as part of their acute care at the Children's Hospital in Westmead from July 1999 to June 2008 were included. Data describing perioperative adverse events within 48 h of anesthesia were collected using a systematic chart review. RESULTS: Over the 8- year period, 60 children were admitted with hyperleukocytosis related to a new diagnosis of leukemia. Fifty-two children had general anesthesia within 48 h of their admission. Eleven children required two separate general anesthetics within this same time frame. Two deaths were recorded within 48 h of anesthesia; one child died from neurological complications of her disease, and the second died from multi-organ failure. Three children had serious respiratory adverse events requiring postanesthesia intensive care. Thirteen children had notable but less serious adverse events. These were typically respiratory in nature and required supplemental oxygen for more than 2 h after anesthesia. CONCLUSION: Children with leukemia-related hyperleukocytosis often require general anesthesia at the time of presentation and are at significant perioperative risk. Respiratory adverse events are very common and mandate close postanesthesia care.","['Fong, Clement', 'Fung, Winnie', 'McDonald, Jane', 'Dalla-Pozza, Luce', 'De Lima, Jonathan']","['Fong C', 'Fung W', 'McDonald J', 'Dalla-Pozza L', 'De Lima J']","['Westmead Hospital, Westmead, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090914,France,Paediatr Anaesth,Paediatric anaesthesia,9206575,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anesthesia, General/*adverse effects/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Leukocytosis/*complications/mortality', 'Postanesthesia Nursing/methods', '*Postoperative Complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Surgical Procedures, Operative', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/09/19 06:00,2010/03/06 06:00,['2009/09/19 06:00'],"['2009/09/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['PAN3142 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1460-9592.2009.03142.x [doi]']",ppublish,Paediatr Anaesth. 2009 Dec;19(12):1191-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1460-9592.2009.03142.x.

Additional names have subsequently been introduced to describe specific variants of HES, such as the myeloid variant and the lymphoid variant, or to indicate idiopathic HES, for which the cause of the eosinophilia is completely unknown. Molecular analysis led to the identification of the clonal origin of several subgroups of HES, clearly establishing these diseases as true leukemias. These cases of hypereosinophilia are now referred to as 'myeloid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGF receptor A and B (PDGFRA and PDGFRB), or FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1)'. In cases for which clonality is clear, but no PDGFRA, PDGFRB or FGFR1 rearrangement could be demonstrated, the term 'chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified' is preferred. Most importantly, patients with rearrangements of PDGFRA or PDGFRB can be efficiently treated with the kinase inhibitor imatinib. Additional potent kinase inhibitors have been identified, also including inhibitors that target FGFR1 and imatinib-resistant variants of PDGFRalpha. For treatment of unexplained hypereosinophilia and 'chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified; different therapeutic strategies are currently under investigation and promising results have been obtained using humanized anti-IL-5 antibodies.

Acute myeloid leukemias with mutated NPM1 have distinct characteristics, including a significant association with a normal karyotype, involvement of different hematopoietic lineages, a specific gene-expression profile and clinically, a better response to induction therapy and a favorable prognosis. NPMc+ maintains the capacity of wild-type NPM to interact with a variety of cellular proteins, and impairs their activity by delocalizing them to the cytoplasm.

Complementary therapies are pleasant, inexpensive, nonpharmacologic and effective. For patients with leukemia, the complementary therapies that are always appropriate include mind-body interventions, such as self-hypnosis, meditation, guided imagery and breath awareness. Massage and reflexology (foot massage) decrease symptoms with effects lasting at least 2 days following treatment. Acupuncture is very beneficial for symptom management without adverse consequences.

Flow cytometry (FC)-based RD detection is easy to perform, but interpretation requires expert analysis due to individual differences among patients. PROCEDURE: We focused at the design of standardized and reproducible RD monitoring in ALL. RD was investigated by a uniform gating strategy, which was designed internationally and tested in one center by Ig/TCR rearrangements. RESULTS: For each gate, positivity cutoff value was assigned using quantification of non-leukemic background. Comparing to Ig/TCR at 0.1% level, 80 of 103 specimens were correctly diagnosed by FC. The predictive value of FC RD at day 15 was then analyzed. In B lineage ALL, day 15 FC significantly correlated with Ig/TCR results at day 33 and/or week 12 (P < 0.01). No significant correlation was found in T lineage ALL. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, FC with preset uniform gating at day 15 predicts PCR-detectable MRD in B precursor ALL.

In some cases, two or more affected members have been identified in the same family. To date, mutations in two genes have been directly implicated: the hematopoietic transcription factors RUNX1 (runt-related transcription factor 1) and CEBPA (CCATT-box enhancer binding protein alpha). However, there are also other familial cases of MDS/AML where the genetic basis remains unknown. Both MDS, and to a lesser extent AML, have been observed in cases of the bone marrow failure syndrome dyskeratosis congenita, in which telomerase mutations have been identified. Recently, an increased incidence of telomerase reverse transcriptase mutations has been reported in a series of de novo AML. We have now identified novel mutations in the telomerase RNA (TERC) or telomerase reverse transcriptase component (TERT) within 4 of 20 families presenting with familial MDS/AML. Functional analysis has demonstrated that all mutations adversely impact on telomerase activity in vitro, and affected individuals have short telomeres. These families, in conjunction with a review of previously published cases, help to further define the pathological role of telomerase mutations in MDS/AML and have implications for the biology, treatment and screening regimen of de novo cases.","['Kirwan, Michael', 'Vulliamy, Tom', 'Marrone, Anna', 'Walne, Amanda J', 'Beswick, Richard', 'Hillmen, Peter', 'Kelly, Richard', 'Stewart, Andrew', 'Bowen, David', 'Schonland, Stefan O', 'Whittle, Annika Maria', 'McVerry, Anthony', 'Gilleece, Maria', 'Dokal, Inderjeet']","['Kirwan M', 'Vulliamy T', 'Marrone A', 'Walne AJ', 'Beswick R', 'Hillmen P', 'Kelly R', 'Stewart A', 'Bowen D', 'Schonland SO', 'Whittle AM', 'McVerry A', 'Gilleece M', 'Dokal I']","[""Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, Barts and The London Children's Hospital, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['G0400534/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hum Mutat,Human mutation,9215429,"['0 (telomerase RNA)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Pedigree', 'RNA/*genetics', 'Telomerase/*genetics']",2009/09/18 06:00,2010/02/26 06:00,['2009/09/18 06:00'],"['2009/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/humu.21115 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mutat. 2009 Nov;30(11):1567-73. doi: 10.1002/humu.21115.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we identified a novel fusion between RUNX1 and LPXN from an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient with t(11;21)(q12;q22). This translocation generated four RUNX1/LPXN and one LPXN/RUNX1 chimeric transcripts. Two representative RUNX1/LPXN fusion proteins, RL and RLs, were both found to localize in the nucleus and could bring the CBFB protein into the nucleus like the wild-type RUNX1. Both fusion proteins inhibit the ability of RUNX1 to transactivate the CSF1R promoter, probably through competition for its target sequences. Unlike RL and RLs, the LPXN/RUNX1 fusion protein LR was found to localize in the cytoplasm. Thus, we believe it has little impact on the transcriptional activity of RUNX1. We also found that fusion proteins RL, RLs, LR, and wild-type LPXN could confer NIH3T3 cells with malignant transformation characteristics such as more rapid growth, the ability to form colonies in soft agar, and the ability to form solid tumors in the subcutaneous tissue of the BALB/c nude mice. Taken together, our data indicated that the RUNX1/LPXN and LPXN/RUNX1 fusion proteins may play important roles in leukemogenesis and that deregulation of cell adhesion pathways may be pathogenetically important in AML. Our study also suggests that LPXN may play an important role in carcinogenesis.","['Dai, Hai-Ping', 'Xue, Yong-Quan', 'Zhou, Jian-Wei', 'Li, Ai-Ping', 'Wu, Ya-Fang', 'Pan, Jin-Lan', 'Wang, Yong', 'Zhang, Jun']","['Dai HP', 'Xue YQ', 'Zhou JW', 'Li AP', 'Wu YF', 'Pan JL', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang J']","[""Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Ministry of Health, Suzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (LPXN protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2009/09/18 06:00,2009/12/23 06:00,['2009/09/18 06:00'],"['2009/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20704 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2009 Dec;48(12):1027-36. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20704.,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Over the years, the biological understanding of this neoplasm has largely increased. Gene expression profiling has allowed to identify specific signatures for the different ALL subsets and permitted the identification of pathways deregulated by a given lesion. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs, which play a pivotal role in several cellular functions. In this study, we investigated miRNAs expression profiles in a series of adult ALL cases by microarray analysis. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering largely recapitulated ALL subgroups. Furthermore, we identified miR-148, miR-151, and miR-424 as discriminative of T-lineage versus B-lineage ALL; ANOVA highlighted a set of six miRNAs-namely miR-425-5p, miR-191, miR-146b, miR-128, miR-629, and miR-126-that can discriminate B-lineage ALL subgroups harboring specific molecular lesions. These results were confirmed and extended by quantitative-PCR on a further cohort of cases. Finally, we used Pearson correlation analysis to combine miRNA and gene expression profiles. The distribution of correlation coefficients generated by comparing the expression of every miRNA/gene pair in our data set shows enrichment of both positively and negatively correlated pairs over background distributions obtained using randomized data. Moreover, a clear enrichment for predicted miRNA:target pairs is observed at negative correlation coefficient intervals. Signal-to-noise ratio highlighted several miRNA/gene pairs with a possible role in the disease. In fact, gene set enrichment analysis of genes composing the selected miRNA/gene pairs displays over-representation of functional categories related to cancer and cell-cycle regulation.","['Fulci, Valerio', 'Colombo, Teresa', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Messina, Monica', 'Citarella, Franca', 'Tavolaro, Simona', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Foa, Robin', 'Macino, Giuseppe']","['Fulci V', 'Colombo T', 'Chiaretti S', 'Messina M', 'Citarella F', 'Tavolaro S', 'Guarini A', 'Foa R', 'Macino G']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Sezione di Genetica Molecolare, ""Sapienza"" Universita di Roma, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cluster Analysis', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Young Adult']",2009/09/18 06:00,2009/12/23 06:00,['2009/09/18 06:00'],"['2009/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20709 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2009 Dec;48(12):1069-82. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20709.,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

A skin biopsy was suggestive of malignant lymphoma of the skin. INVESTIGATIONS: The peripheral blood count showed mild pancytopenia and 12 % blasts. Additional immunohistochemistry of the skin specimen as well as cytologic and flow cytometric examination of the bone marrow revealed an immature cell population expressing CD4 and CD56 which infiltrated both the dermis and, with an infiltration grade of about 85 %, the bone marrow. DIAGNOSIS: Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (formerly known as blastic NK cell lymphoma). TREATMENT AND COURSE: After the first course of induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin and cytarabin, both the rash and the hematologic findings of bone marrow and peripheral blood showed a complete remission. CONCLUSION: The blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is a rare, aggressive hematopoietic neoplasm most likely related to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Since cutaneous involvement is regularly present at diagnosis, the differential diagnosis of unexplained skin lesions should include this disease entity, especially if peripheral blood abnormalities are present. Despite the initial response to cytostatic therapy being mostly excellent, the prognosis is poor. Hence, treatment as high-risk AML seems advisable.","['Loffler, H', 'Kosely, F', 'Ho, A D', 'Kramer, A']","['Loffler H', 'Kosely F', 'Ho AD', 'Kramer A']","['Klinische Kooperationseinheit Molekulare Hamatologie/Onkologie, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Im Neuenheimer Feld 581, 69120 Heidelberg.']",['ger'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20090916,Germany,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),0006723,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Exanthema', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Pancytopenia', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/classification/*diagnosis/drug therapy']",2009/09/18 06:00,2009/09/29 06:00,['2009/09/18 06:00'],"['2009/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0029-1237532 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 2009 Sep;134(39):1927-30. doi: 10.1055/s-0029-1237532.

Although treatment is directed to underlying cause in secondary PRCA treatment, optimal treatment in patients with CMML and PRCA is unknown, because only four case reports are available. In addition, the effect of hypomethylating agents can be detrimental due to myelosuppression, at least in the early phase of treatment. Bone marrow examination of a 66-year-old woman with severe anemia revealed PRCA and was suspicious for CMML. There was no HLA-matched sibling for bone marrow transplantation. The patient received immunosuppressive therapy with steroids and cyclosporine with temporary response in anemia; however, progressed to acute leukemia over 8 months and died. Immunosuppressive therapy in patients with CMML and PRCA should be cautiously used because it may accelerate acute leukemia transformation.","['Tanna, Saloni', 'Ustun, Celalettin']","['Tanna S', 'Ustun C']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, 1120 15th Street, BAA-5407, Augusta, GA, 30912, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, 1120 15th Street, BAA-5407, Augusta, GA, 30912, USA.

In the present study, we have demonstrated that theanine suppressed the in vitro and ex vivo growth of human non-small cell lung cancer A549 and leukemia K562 cell lines in dose- and time-dependant manners. In addition, theanine displayed the inhibitory effect on the migration of A549 cells. More importantly, theanine enhanced the anticancer activity of anticancer agents such as trichostatin A (the histone deacetylase inhibitor), berbamine and norcantharidin (the anticancer drugs in China) by strongly reducing the viability and/or migration rate in A549 cells. In addition, theanine significantly suppressed A549 cell invasion. Suppression of A549 cell migration may be one of the important mechanisms of action of theanine against the A549 cell invasion. Our present results suggest that theanine may have the wide therapeutic and/or adjuvant therapeutic application in the treatment of human lung cancer and leukemia.","['Liu, Qian', 'Duan, Huiying', 'Luan, Jinling', 'Yagasaki, Kazumi', 'Zhang, Guoying']","['Liu Q', 'Duan H', 'Luan J', 'Yagasaki K', 'Zhang G']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Yantai University, No. 30, Qing Quan Lu, Lai Shan Qu, 264005, Yantai, Shandong, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090917,United States,Cytotechnology,Cytotechnology,8807027,,,,2009/09/18 06:00,2009/09/18 06:01,['2009/09/18 06:00'],"['2009/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10616-009-9223-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cytotechnology. 2009 Apr;59(3):211-7. doi: 10.1007/s10616-009-9223-y.

To date, no polymorphisms of PRDM16 gene in bovine had been reported. Herein, PCR-SSCP and DNA sequencing methods were employed to screen the genetic variation within PRDM16 gene in 1031 Chinese indigenous bovine. The results revealed two novel silent mutations: XM_001788152: m.1641T>C (547aa), 1881G>A (627aa). Hence, we described the PvuII and HaeIII forced PCR-RFLP methods for detecting these mutations, respectively. In the forced PCR-RFLP analysis with PvuII, the frequencies of bovine PRDM16-C allele varied from 0.044 to 0.506 in four Chinese native breeds. In the forced PCR-RFLP analysis with HaeIII, the frequencies of bovine PRDM16-G allele were 0.474, 0.494, 0.576 and 0.906 for Jiaxian (JX), Nanyang (NY), Qinchuan (QC) and Chinese Holstein (CH) population. Significant statistical differences between genotypic frequencies implied that both of the polymorphic loci were significantly associated with cattle breeds by the chi square test (chi2 = 190.058, P < 0.001 and chi2 = 118.239, P < 0.001 for PvuII; chi2 = 209.842, P < 0.001 and chi2 = 108.711, P < 0.001 for HaeIII). The associations of the PvuII and HaeIII forced PCR-RFLPs of bovine PRDM16 loci with growth traits were analyzed in Nanyang breed.

METHODS: Data from the Black Women's Health Study, a prospective cohort study of African American women, were used to assess breast cancer risk in relation to family history of cancer. Since 1995, participants have completed biennial postal questionnaires on health status, risk factors, and family history of cancer. Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for family history of breast and other types of cancer. RESULTS: Among 57,364 participants who were cancer-free at baseline, 1,306 incident breast cancer cases occurred during 12 years of follow-up. The IRR for a first-degree family history of breast cancer relative to no family history was 1.78 (95% CI 1.55-2.06). IRRs varied by the age at diagnosis, from 1.60 (>or=age 55) to 2.76 (<age 35). Results were consistent across subtypes of breast tumor defined by estrogen and progesterone receptor status. Breast cancer risk was also associated with family history of colon cancer (IRR 1.35, 95% CI 1.12-1.63) and possibly with family history of leukemia (IRR 1.42, 95% CI 0.82-2.46). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate a strong familial relationship for breast cancer in African American women. The associations with family history of colon cancer and leukemia warrant further investigation.","['Palmer, Julie R', 'Boggs, Deborah A', 'Adams-Campbell, Lucile L', 'Rosenberg, Lynn']","['Palmer JR', 'Boggs DA', 'Adams-Campbell LL', 'Rosenberg L']","['Slone Epidemiology Center, Boston University, 1010 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA 02215, USA. jpalmer@slone.bu.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 CA058420/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA058420-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA58420/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,"['0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'African Americans', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Receptors, Estrogen/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Progesterone/biosynthesis', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2009/09/18 06:00,2010/01/09 06:00,['2009/09/18 06:00'],"['2009/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-009-9425-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2009 Nov;20(9):1733-7. doi: 10.1007/s10552-009-9425-9.,PMC2794688,['NIHMS157283'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SDS is clinically characterized by pancreatic insufficiency, skeletal abnormalities and bone marrow dysfunction. The hematologic abnormalities include neutropenia, neutrophil chemotaxis defects, and an increased risk of developing Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Although several studies have suggested that SBDS as a protein plays a role in ribosome processing/maturation, its impact on human neutrophil development and function remains to be clarified. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We observed that SBDS RNA and protein are expressed in the human myeloid leukemia PLB-985 cell line and in human hematopoietic progenitor cells by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. SBDS expression is downregulated during neutrophil differentiation. Additionally, we observed that the differentiation and proliferation capacity of SDS-patient bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells in a liquid differentiation system was reduced as compared to control cultures. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that SBDS co-localizes with the mitotic spindle and in vitro binding studies reveal a direct interaction of SBDS with microtubules. In interphase cells a perinuclear enrichment of SBDS protein which co-localized with the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) was observed. Also, we observed that transiently expressed SDS patient-derived SBDS-K62 or SBDS-C84 mutant proteins could co-localize with the MTOC and mitotic spindle. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: SBDS co-localizes with the mitotic spindle, suggesting a role for SBDS in the cell division process, which corresponds to the decreased proliferation capacity of SDS-patient bone marrow CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells in our culture system and also to the neutropenia in SDS patients. A role in chromosome missegregation has not been clarified, since similar spatial and time-dependent localization is observed when patient-derived SBDS mutant proteins are studied. Thus, the increased risk of myeloid malignancy in SDS remains unexplained.","['Orelio, Claudia', 'Verkuijlen, Paul', 'Geissler, Judy', 'van den Berg, Timo K', 'Kuijpers, Taco W']","['Orelio C', 'Verkuijlen P', 'Geissler J', 'van den Berg TK', 'Kuijpers TW']","['Sanquin Research and Landsteiner Laboratory, Department of Blood Cell Research, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. orelio.c@hsleiden.nl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090917,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (SBDS protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematologic Diseases/immunology/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Microtubules/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Proteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Ribosomes/metabolism', 'Spindle Apparatus/*metabolism', 'Syndrome']",2009/09/18 06:00,2010/02/02 06:00,['2009/09/18 06:00'],"['2009/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0007084 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Sep 17;4(9):e7084. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0007084.,PMC2738965,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HDACi, such as SAHA/Vorinostat, Trichostatin A, and MS-275 were found to induce apoptosis of leukemic blasts through activation of the death receptor pathway and transcriptional induction of the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-related pro-apoptotic family members, TRAIL and FasL. The impact of HDACi on TNF-related costimulatory molecules such as 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL/TNFSF9) is however not known. Following exposure to SAHA/Vorinostat, Trichostatin A, and MS-275, transcript levels were determined by real time PCR in Jurkat, Raji and U937 cells. Treatment with HDACi up-regulated TNFSF9 gene expression in the three leukemia cell lines, yet to different extend and with distinct kinetics, which did not require de novo protein synthesis and was not associated with DNAse I hypersensitive chromatin remodeling. Transcriptional activity of TNFSF9 promoter-luciferase constructs was induced up to 12 fold by HDACi, and implication of Sp1/Sp3 transcription factors binding to functional GC-box elements was evidenced by reporter gene assays, site-directed mutagenesis, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Functionality of modulated target genes was assessed in allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction experiments. MS-275- and to a lesser extent Trichostatin A- and SAHA-treated Raji cells significantly up regulated T lymphocytes proliferation which was reduced by about 50% by a 4-1BB blocking recombinant protein, while MS-275- but neither Trichostatin A- nor SAHA-treated cells up-regulated IFNgamma secretion by T lymphocytes. Our results identify 4-1BBL/4-1BB as a downstream target of HDACi, especially of MS-275 anti-leukemia action in vitro.

However, how normal B-cell precursors acquire the genetic changes that lead to transformation has not yet been completely defined. We investigated the expression of the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and its role in clinical outcome in 61 adult BCR-ABL1-positive ALL patients. AID expression was detected in 36 patients (59%); it correlated with the BCR-ABL1 transcript levels and disappeared after treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Different AID splice variants were identified: full-length isoform; AIDDeltaE4a, with a 30-bp deletion of exon 4; AIDDeltaE4, with the exon 4 deletion; AIDins3, with the retention of intron 3; AIDDeltaE3-E4 isoform without deaminase activity. AID-FL predominantly showed cytoplasmic localization, as did the AID-DeltaE4a and AID-DeltaE3E4 variants, whereas the C-terminal-truncated AID-DeltaE4 showed a slightly increased nuclear localization pattern. AID expression correlated with a higher number of copy number alterations identified in genome-wide analysis using a single-nucleotide polymorphism array. However, the expression of AID at diagnosis was not associated with a worse prognosis. In conclusion, BCR-ABL1-positive ALL cells aberrantly express different isoforms of AID that may act as mutators outside the immunoglobulin (Ig) gene loci in promoting genetic instability.","['Iacobucci, I', 'Lonetti, A', 'Messa, F', 'Ferrari, A', 'Cilloni, D', 'Soverini, S', 'Paoloni, F', 'Arruga, F', 'Ottaviani, E', 'Chiaretti, S', 'Messina, M', 'Vignetti, M', 'Papayannidis, C', 'Vitale, A', 'Pane, F', 'Piccaluga, P P', 'Paolini, S', 'Berton, G', 'Baruzzi, A', 'Saglio, G', 'Baccarani, M', 'Foa, R', 'Martinelli, G']","['Iacobucci I', 'Lonetti A', 'Messa F', 'Ferrari A', 'Cilloni D', 'Soverini S', 'Paoloni F', 'Arruga F', 'Ottaviani E', 'Chiaretti S', 'Messina M', 'Vignetti M', 'Papayannidis C', 'Vitale A', 'Pane F', 'Piccaluga PP', 'Paolini S', 'Berton G', 'Baruzzi A', 'Saglio G', 'Baccarani M', 'Foa R', 'Martinelli G']","['Department of Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology, L and A Seragnoli S Orsola Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, Bologna 9-40138, Italy. giovanni.martinelli2@unibo.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090917,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*genetics/physiology', 'DNA Breaks, Single-Stranded', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis/genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",2009/09/18 06:00,2010/01/28 06:00,['2009/09/18 06:00'],"['2009/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009197 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.197 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Jan;24(1):66-73. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.197.

Herein we investigate this stereotypy in 2662 patients with CLL, the largest series yet, using purpose-built bioinformatics methods based on sequence pattern discovery. Besides improving the identification of 'stereotyped' cases, we demonstrate that CLL actually consists of two different categories, based on the BCR repertoire, with important biological and ontogenetic differences. The first ( approximately 30% of cases) shows a very restricted repertoire and is characterized by BCR stereotypy (clustered cases), whereas the second includes cases with heterogeneous BCRs (nonclustered cases). Eleven major CLL clusters were identified with antigen-binding sites defined by just a few critically positioned residues, regardless of the actual immunoglobulin (IG) variable gene used. This situation is closely reminiscent of the receptors expressed by cells participating in innate immune responses. On these grounds, we argue that whereas CLL cases with heterogeneous BCRs likely derive from the conventional B-cell pool, cases with stereotyped BCRs could derive from progenitor cells evolutionarily adapted to particular antigenic challenges, perhaps intermediate between a true innate immune system and the conventional adaptive B-cell immune system, functionally similar to what has been suggested previously for mouse B1 cells.","['Darzentas, N', 'Hadzidimitriou, A', 'Murray, F', 'Hatzi, K', 'Josefsson, P', 'Laoutaris, N', 'Moreno, C', 'Anagnostopoulos, A', 'Jurlander, J', 'Tsaftaris, A', 'Chiorazzi, N', 'Belessi, C', 'Ghia, P', 'Rosenquist, R', 'Davi, F', 'Stamatopoulos, K']","['Darzentas N', 'Hadzidimitriou A', 'Murray F', 'Hatzi K', 'Josefsson P', 'Laoutaris N', 'Moreno C', 'Anagnostopoulos A', 'Jurlander J', 'Tsaftaris A', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Belessi C', 'Ghia P', 'Rosenquist R', 'Davi F', 'Stamatopoulos K']","['Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Institute of Agrobiotechnology, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090917,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/chemistry/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis/*physiology']",2009/09/18 06:00,2010/01/28 06:00,['2009/09/18 06:00'],"['2009/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009186 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.186 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Jan;24(1):125-32. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.186.

The present study investigates how angiotensin II activates RhoA. METHODS AND RESULTS: Adenoviral vectors were used to manipulate the expression of regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain containing Rho-specific guanine exchange factors (RhoGEFs) and proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2), a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, in primary rat vascular smooth muscle cells. As an evidence of RhoA activation, RhoA translocation and MYPT1 (the regulatory subunit of myosin light chain phosphatase) phosphorylation were analyzed by Western blot. Results showed that overexpression of PDZ-RhoGEF, but not p115-RhoGEF or leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG), enhanced RhoA activation by angiotensin II. Knockdown of PDZ-RhoGEF decreased RhoA activation by angiotensin II. PDZ-RhoGEF was phosphorylated and activated by PYK2 in vitro, and knockdown of PDZ-RhoGEF reduced RhoA activation by constitutively active PYK2, indicating that PDZ-RhoGEF links PYK2 to RhoA. Knockdown of PYK2 or PDZ-RhoGEF markedly decreased RhoA activation by A23187, a Ca(2+) ionophore, demonstrating that PYK2/PDZ-RhoGEF couples RhoA activation to Ca(2+).

When bone marrow cells or thymocytes transduced with a vector encoding the constitutively activated intracellular domain of Notch1 (ICN1) are expanded ex vivo under conditions that support T-cell development, cultured progenitors rapidly induce CD4+/CD8+ T-ALLs after infusion into healthy syngeneic mice. Under these conditions, enforced ICN1 expression also drives formation of T-ALLs in unconditioned CD-1 nude mice, bypassing any requirements for thymic maturation. Retention of Arf had relatively modest activity in suppressing the formation of T-ALLs arising from bone marrow-derived ICN1+ progenitors in which the locus is epigenetically silenced, and all resulting Arf (+/+) tumors failed to express the p19(Arf) protein. In striking contrast, retention of Arf in thymocyte-derived ICN1+ donor cells significantly delayed disease onset and suppressed the penetrance of T-ALL. Use of cultured thymocyte-derived donor cells expressing a functionally null Arf-GFP knock-in allele confirmed that ICN1 signaling can induce Arf expression in vivo. Arf activation by ICN1 in T cells thereby provides stage-specific tumor suppression but also a strong selective pressure for deletion of the locus in T-ALL.","['Volanakis, Emmanuel J', 'Williams, Richard T', 'Sherr, Charles J']","['Volanakis EJ', 'Williams RT', 'Sherr CJ']","[""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['T32 CA070089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'CA070089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090916,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cdkn2a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transfection']",2009/09/18 06:00,2009/12/23 06:00,['2009/09/18 06:00'],"['2009/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38927-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-07-233346 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Nov 12;114(20):4451-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-07-233346.

While Stat3 activation in POMC neurons is required for POMC expression, the role of elevated basal Stat3 activation as present in the development of obesity has not been directly addressed. Here, we have generated and characterized mice expressing a constitutively active version of Stat3 (Stat3-C) in POMC neurons (Stat3-C(POMC) mice). On normal chow diet, these animals develop obesity as a result of hyperphagia and decreased POMC expression accompanied by central leptin and insulin resistance. This unexpected finding coincides with POMC-cell-specific, Stat3-mediated upregulation of SOCS3 expression inhibiting both leptin and insulin signaling as insulin-stimulated PIP(3) (phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5 triphosphate) formation and protein kinase B (AKT) activation in POMC neurons as well as with the fact that insulin's ability to hyperpolarize POMC neurons is largely reduced in POMC cells of Stat3-C(POMC) mice. These data indicate that constitutive Stat3 activation is not sufficient to promote POMC expression but requires simultaneous PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-dependent release of FOXO1 repression. In contrast, upon exposure to a high-fat diet, food intake and body weight were unaltered in Stat3-C(POMC) mice compared with control mice. Taken together, these experiments directly demonstrate that enhanced basal Stat3 activation in POMC neurons as present in control mice upon high-fat feeding contributes to the development of hypothalamic leptin and insulin resistance.","['Ernst, Marianne B', 'Wunderlich, Claudia M', 'Hess, Simon', 'Paehler, Moritz', 'Mesaros, Andrea', 'Koralov, Sergei B', 'Kleinridders, Andre', 'Husch, Andreas', 'Munzberg, Heike', 'Hampel, Brigitte', 'Alber, Jens', 'Kloppenburg, Peter', 'Bruning, Jens C', 'Wunderlich, F Thomas']","['Ernst MB', 'Wunderlich CM', 'Hess S', 'Paehler M', 'Mesaros A', 'Koralov SB', 'Kleinridders A', 'Husch A', 'Munzberg H', 'Hampel B', 'Alber J', 'Kloppenburg P', 'Bruning JC', 'Wunderlich FT']","['Institute for Genetics, University of Cologne, Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), Center of Molecular Medicine Cologne, D-50674 Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Agouti-Related Protein)', '0 (Agrp protein, mouse)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neuropeptide Y)', '0 (STT3-A protein, mouse)', '0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",IM,"['Agouti-Related Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Body Composition/genetics', 'Body Weight/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Eating/genetics', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Feedback/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Glucose Tolerance Test', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics', 'Hypothalamus/pathology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Insulin/*metabolism', 'Insulin Resistance/genetics', 'Leptin/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neural Inhibition/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Neurons/*physiology', 'Neuropeptide Y/genetics/metabolism', 'Obesity/genetics/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques/methods', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2009/09/18 06:00,2009/10/03 06:00,['2009/09/18 06:00'],"['2009/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/03 06:00 [medline]']","['29/37/11582 [pii]', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5712-08.2009 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2009 Sep 16;29(37):11582-93. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5712-08.2009.,PMC6665760,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) complements MC by the ability to evaluate large numbers of both interphase and metaphase nuclei. However, clinically practical FISH strategies are limited to detection of known lesions. Single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A)-based karyotyping can reveal unbalanced defects with superior resolution over MC and FISH and identify segmental uniparental disomy (UPD) undetectable by either method. Using a standardized approach, we focused our investigation on detection of -5/del(5q), -7/del(7q), trisomy 8 and del(20q) in patients with MDS (N=52), MDS/myeloproliferative overlap syndromes (N=7) and acute myeloid leukemia (N=15) using MC, FISH and SNP-A karyotyping. The detection rate for del(5q) was 30, 32 and 32% by MC, FISH, and SNP-A, respectively. No single method detected all defects, and detection rates improved when all methods were used. The rate for detection of del(5q) increased incrementally to 35% (MC+FISH), 38% (MC+SNP-A), 38% (FISH+SNP-A) and 39% (all three methods). Similar findings were observed for -7/del(7q), trisomy 8 and -20/del(20q). We conclude that MC, FISH and SNP-A are complementary techniques that, when applied and interpreted together, can improve the diagnostic yield for identifying genetic lesions in MDS and contribute to the better description of abnormal karyotypes.","['Makishima, Hideki', 'Rataul, Manjot', 'Gondek, Lukasz P', 'Huh, Jungwon', 'Cook, James R', 'Theil, Karl S', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Kuczkowski, Elizabeth', ""O'Keefe, Christine"", 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Makishima H', 'Rataul M', 'Gondek LP', 'Huh J', 'Cook JR', 'Theil KS', 'Sekeres MA', 'Kuczkowski E', ""O'Keefe C"", 'Maciejewski JP']","['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL082983-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 HL077522/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 RR019391/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 RR019397/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL082983/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 HL077522-05/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 RR019397-05S1/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR019391/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090915,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping/methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monosomy/diagnosis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Trisomy/diagnosis', 'Young Adult']",2009/09/18 06:00,2010/03/27 06:00,['2009/09/18 06:00'],"['2009/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/15 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00428-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.08.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Apr;34(4):447-53. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.08.023.

Various biological factors relating to the host's immune system or tumor cells have been suggested to reduce the efficacy of anti-CD20 therapy in B-cell malignancies. In this study, we characterized the in vitro anti-lymphoma activity of anti-CD20 antibodies having a novel engineered heavy chain with enhanced complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Anti-CD20 antibodies having a variant heavy constant region of mixed IgG1/IgG3 isotype, which have previously been found to enhance CDC, were investigated for their in vitro CDC against lymphoma cells and whole blood B-cell depletion activity. Use of the variant constant region greatly increased the CDC of an anti-CD20 antibody having variable regions identical to those of rituximab to the level shown by an IgG1 antibody of ofatumumab. Although the whole blood assay showed different cytotoxicity patterns among individual blood donors, the CDC-enhancing variant of rituximab showed higher activity than the parent IgG1 and consistently showed maximized activity when further combined with antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)-enhancing modification by fucose removal from Fc-linked oligosaccharides. In addition, the rituximab variant showed potent CDC against transfectant cells with lower CD20 expression and chronic lymphocytic leukemia-derived cell lines with higher complement regulatory proteins. These findings suggest that CDC enhancement, both alone and in combination with ADCC enhancement, increases the anti-lymphoma activity of anti-CD20 antibodies irrespective of individual differences in effector functions, and renders current anti-CD20 therapy capable of overcoming the potential resistance mechanisms.","['Natsume, Akito', 'Shimizu-Yokoyama, Yukiko', 'Satoh, Mitsuo', 'Shitara, Kenya', 'Niwa, Rinpei']","['Natsume A', 'Shimizu-Yokoyama Y', 'Satoh M', 'Shitara K', 'Niwa R']","['Antibody Research Laboratories, Research Division, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co, Ltd, Machida-shi, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090825,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'CHO Cells', 'Complement Activation/*drug effects', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Protein Engineering', 'Rituximab']",2009/09/18 06:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2009/09/18 06:00'],"['2009/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['CAS1327 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01327.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2009 Dec;100(12):2411-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01327.x.

Chronic free fatty acids (FFA) exposure impairs pancreatic beta-cell function and induces beta-cell apoptosis. This study is to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We exposed INS-1E pancreatic beta-cell line to palmitate or oleate, and measured the glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). The effect of FFA on sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c lipogenic pathway, and expression of genes involved in beta-cell functions, including AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase), UCP-2 (uncoupling protein-2), IRS-2 (insulin receptor substrate-2), PDX-1 (pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1), GLUT-2 (glucose transporter-2) and B cell lymphoma/leukaemia-2 (Bcl-2) were investigated. Apoptosis of these exposed cells was determined by MitoCapture, Annexin V-Cy3 or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. Cell lipid accumulation was measured by oil red O staining or TG extraction. Also SREBP-1c expression knockdown were used. RESULTS: FFA treatment resulted in SREBP-1c overexpression, impaired GSIS, lipid accumulation, apoptosis of INS-1E cells. In addition, the expression of lipogenic genes and UCP-2 were upregulated, but AMPK, IRS-2, PDX-1, GLUT-2 and Bcl-2 were downregulated in the exposed cells. However, these lipotoxic effects of FFA were largely prevented by induction of a SREBP-1c small interfering RNA. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a strong correlation between FFA treatment and SREBP-1c activation in INS-1E cells.

Rituximab (RTX), a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20 on B lymphocytes and widely used in other indolent B-cell neoplasms is less efficacious in CLL, possibly because of associated complement deficiencies. Initial in vitro and in vivo observations support the central role of complement in rituximab-mediated loss of CD20(+) cells in CLL. In an open trial conducted in outpatient hematology clinics in Israel and Greece, we examined whether providing complement by concurrent administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) would enhance the effect of RTX in CLL. Five patients with severe treatment-resistant CLL were included in the trial. All had been previously treated with fludarabine, and three also failed treatment with RTX. Each patient was treated with two units of FFP followed with RTX 375 mg/m(2) as a single agent, repeated every 1-2 weeks as needed. A rapid and dramatic clinical and laboratory response was achieved in all patients. Lymphocyte counts dropped markedly followed by shrinkage of lymph nodes and spleen and improvement of the anemia and thrombocytopenia. This could be maintained over 8 months (median) with additional cycles if necessary. Treatment was well tolerated in all cases. In conclusion, adding FFP to RTX may provide a useful therapeutic option in patients with advanced CLL resistant to treatment. Further studies are needed to confirm and study the efficacy of the FFP/RTX combination in advanced CLL, establish the mechanisms, and possibly extend its use to other B-cell-dependent pathologies, such as treatment-refractory autoimmune diseases.","['Klepfish, Abraham', 'Gilles, Lugassy', 'Ioannis, Kotsianidis', 'Rachmilewitz, Eliezer A', 'Schattner, Ami']","['Klepfish A', 'Gilles L', 'Ioannis K', 'Rachmilewitz EA', 'Schattner A']","['Blood Bank and Hematology Department, Wolfson Medical Center, Holon, Israel. klepfish@zahav.net.il']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Blood Transfusion/*methods', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymph Nodes/drug effects/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Plasma', 'Rituximab', 'Spleen/drug effects/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/09/18 06:00,2009/10/30 06:00,['2009/09/18 06:00'],"['2009/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['NYAS4803 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04803.x [doi]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2009 Sep;1173:865-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04803.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2010 Aug;1204:198.

For example, they influence cell cycle entry, expression of co-receptors, and CD20. Rituximab (RTX), for which CD20 molecule is the target, proved to be less efficient in CLL than in lymphoma. This is accounted for by a lower CD20 level in the former than in the latter B lymphocytes. CD20 transcription is mediated by four transcription factors, of which only purine-rich box-1 (PU.1) is reduced in CLL. We thus examined the effects of LPS, CpG, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-alpha, interleukin (IL)-3, IL-4, IL-21, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (CSF), and granulocyte-CSF on the transcription of PU.1, and the subsequent expression of CD20. It appeared that CpG was unique in that it raised the membrane expression of CD20 on malignant B cells, owing to a PU.1 independent increase in its gene transcription. Moreover, RTX-induced complement-mediated lysis was also ameliorated. Thus, CpG accelerates the transcription of CD20 independently of PU.1, and thereby improves the efficacy of RTX in CLL.","['Mankai, Amani', 'Buhe, Virginie', 'Hammadi, Mariam', 'Youinou, Pierre', 'Ghedira, Ibtissem', 'Berthou, Christian', 'Bordron, Anne']","['Mankai A', 'Buhe V', 'Hammadi M', 'Youinou P', 'Ghedira I', 'Berthou C', 'Bordron A']","['EA2216 Immunology and Pathology IFR148, Universite de Bretagne Occidentale and Universite Europeenne de Bretagne, Brest, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CPG-oligonucleotide)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rituximab', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2009/09/18 06:00,2009/10/30 06:00,['2009/09/18 06:00'],"['2009/09/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['NYAS4614 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04614.x [doi]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2009 Sep;1173:721-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04614.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, many of these mediators have been identified, often from studies in experimental animals. Furthermore, their expression patterns at the embryo-maternal interface in women have been characterized and provide clues to their potential actions. What has been missing in most cases is any experimental demonstration of their function. Proteases, cytokines and chemokines are among the molecules identified at the embryo-maternal interface. Functional studies of the protease, proprotein convertase (PC)6, the gp130 cytokines, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin (IL)11 and the chemokines, CX3CL1 and CCL14 demonstrate potential actions within the uterine cavity. These actions include: enhancing blastocyst development, modifying adhesive properties of the blastocyst and the uterine epithelial surface, and providing chemotactic guidance to the blastocyst.

T-bet is the master regulator of the T-helper (Th)1 cell response regulating interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) production and also plays a central role in the T-cell independent Th1-like B-cell response. Here, we demonstrate by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis that neoplastic cells from the peripheral blood of five patients with HCL showed an enhanced expression of IFN-gamma after stimulation. Additionally, a comparison with 55 healthy individuals revealed a significant elevation of IFN-gamma in the sera of patients with HCL. Based on our recent findings that a non-neoplastic B-cell subset, the monocytoid B-cells, are T-bet positive and produce IFN-gamma, we propose that monocytoid and hairy B-cells have a similar function and that the T-bet-IFN-gamma axis is involved in the pathogenesis of HCL.","['Johrens, Korinna', 'Moos, Verena', 'Schneider, Thomas', 'Anagnostopoulos, Ioannis']","['Johrens K', 'Moos V', 'Schneider T', 'Anagnostopoulos I']","['Consultation and Reference Center for Hematopathology, Institute of Pathology, Charite - University Medicine Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, 12203 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enterotoxins)', '0 (Integrin alpha Chains)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', '0 (T-box transcription factor TBX21)', '0 (alpha E integrins)', '39424-53-8 (enterotoxin B, staphylococcal)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Enterotoxins/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Integrin alpha Chains/analysis', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis/blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*blood/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/blood/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'T-Box Domain Proteins/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",2009/09/17 06:00,2010/03/30 06:00,['2009/09/17 06:00'],"['2009/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['914996393 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190903161042 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Oct;50(10):1687-92. doi: 10.1080/10428190903161042.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However a significant proportion of CLL patients display immune abnormalities suggestive of aberrant cytokine secretion and/or response. In contrast to B lymphocytes, T cells of B-CLL patients characterise with the increased production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and this cytokine has been indicated to prevent malignant cells from entering apoptosis including the slowly expanding population of CD5+ B cells that characterizes chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The aim of the present study was to assess whether functionally relevant interferon-gamma gene (IFNG) polymorphism (+847 A/T) contributes to the pathogenesis of B-CLL. In total 110 individuals was investigates, including 61 CLL patients and 50 healthy individuals. The presence of the IFNG AA genotype was found to be associated with susceptibility to CLL (23/61 vs. 7/50, p < 0.005, for patients and controls, respectively). This results suggest that individuals rather prone to the lower level of IFN-gamma production (associated with the presence of the A allele) appear to be more susceptible to this malignant disease.","['Urbanowicz, Iwona', 'Mazur, Grzegorz', 'Stacherzak-Pawlik, Jolanta', 'Bogunia-Kubik, Katarzyna', 'Wrobel, Tomasz', 'Wozniak, Mieczyslaw', 'Kuliczkowski, Kazimierz']","['Urbanowicz I', 'Mazur G', 'Stacherzak-Pawlik J', 'Bogunia-Kubik K', 'Wrobel T', 'Wozniak M', 'Kuliczkowski K']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Wroclaw Medical University, Pasteur 2 Str, 50-367, Wroclaw, Poland.

BRE enhances tumor growth in vivo and is up-regulated in hepatocellular and esophageal carcinomas. BRE also regulates the ubiquitination of the DNA repair complex BRCC, and the synthesis of steroid hormones. Here, we examined BRE-mRNA in cells after treatments with UV and ionizing radiation (IR). UV and IR treatment alone suppressed BRE-mRNA levels by more than 90% at 24 h, while hydroxyurea, fluorodeoxyuridine, aphidicolin, known inhibitors of S-phase DNA synthesis, had no significant effect. BRE protein expression was unaltered in cells treated with TNF-alpha, Interleukin-1 and Dexamethasone, while a threefold increase was observed following chorionic gonadotropin exposure. Although BRE plays a regulatory role in many different pathways, yet its expression is apparently under very stringent control.","['Chan, John Yeuk-Hon', 'Li, Li', 'Miao, Ji', 'Cai, Dong-Qing', 'Lee, Kenneth Ka-Ho', 'Chui, Yiu-Loon']","['Chan JY', 'Li L', 'Miao J', 'Cai DQ', 'Lee KK', 'Chui YL']","['Key Joint CUHK-JiNan University Laboratories for Regenerative Medicine, Ministry of Education, JiNan University, Guang Zhou, Guang Dong, China. chanjyh01@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,"['0 (BABAM2 protein, human)', '0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '134-46-3 (Fluorodeoxyuridylate)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Ligases)', 'EC 6.5.1.1 (DNA Ligase ATP)', 'I9N81SC5HD (monodansylcadaverine)', 'L90BEN6OLL (Cadaverine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Aphidicolin/pharmacology', 'Biological Factors/*pharmacology', 'Cadaverine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin/pharmacology', 'DNA Ligase ATP', 'DNA Ligases/genetics/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Fluorodeoxyuridylate/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Stress, Physiological/*drug effects/*genetics/radiation effects', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2009/09/17 06:00,2010/03/11 06:00,['2009/09/17 06:00'],"['2009/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11033-009-9796-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2010 Jan;37(1):363-8. doi: 10.1007/s11033-009-9796-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is mostly seen in elderly patients presenting as de novo asthma, eosinophilia, and vasculitic organ involvement. In childhood, CSS is extremely rare. The course of pediatric CSS is usually severe and often lethal. We present a case of a 13-year-old girl with a short history of asthma, marked eosinophilia, and multiorgan involvement.

We reviewed the quality and comparability of the data from three (of four) studies. METHODS: Through site visits, discussions with the investigators and reading study reports, we reviewed and audited the methods used for selecting cases and controls, for estimating individual exposures and for analysing and interpreting the data. Case-control comparisons of exposures were examined using customized graphs. RESULTS: We found that there were no issues of subject selection, methods or general data quality that were likely to have distorted their internal comparisons; we could not check in detail whether the metric for exposure assessments was the same across the studies; the exposure assessments for the Australian study required the least backward estimation, and the Canadian, which also had fewest cases, the most; evidence of an increased risk at higher exposures in Australia was convincing. CONCLUSIONS: The findings are consistent with some effect of benzene at higher lifetime exposures. A proposed pooled analysis should improve quantification of any exposure-response relationship.","['Miller, B G', 'Fransman, W', 'Heederik, D', 'Hurley, J F', 'Kromhout, H', 'Fitzsimons, E']","['Miller BG', 'Fransman W', 'Heederik D', 'Hurley JF', 'Kromhout H', 'Fitzsimons E']","['Institute of Occupational Medicine, Research Avenue North, Riccarton, Edinburgh, EH14 4AP, UK. brian.miller@iom-world.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090916,Germany,Int Arch Occup Environ Health,International archives of occupational and environmental health,7512134,"['0 (Petroleum)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Benzene/*toxicity', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Extraction and Processing Industry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Occupational Exposure/*analysis', '*Petroleum', 'Research Design']",2009/09/17 06:00,2010/03/24 06:00,['2009/09/17 06:00'],"['2008/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00420-009-0463-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Arch Occup Environ Health. 2010 Jan;83(1):69-76. doi: 10.1007/s00420-009-0463-0.

In this long-term investigation, the risk of malignant diseases following intravenous (224)Ra treatment for AS was assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective long-term study, 1,471 patients with AS who were treated with (224)Ra between 1948 and 1975 have been followed together with a control group of 1,324 AS patients treated neither with radioactive drugs nor with X-rays. Standardized questionnaires to evaluate the patients' health status were used. Observed numbers of malignant diseases were compared with those of the control group as well as with expected numbers for a normal population. RESULTS: After 26 years of follow-up, causes of death have been certified for 1,006 patients of the exposure group (control group: 1,072 patients). Significantly increased rates of myeloid leukemia (12 cases observed vs. 2.9 expected; p < 0.001), kidney cancer (18 vs. 9.1; p < 0.01), thyroid cancer (4 vs. 1.2; p = 0.03) and borderline significantly increased rates of cancer of female genital organs (10 vs. 5.6; p = 0.06) were found in the exposure group in contrast to no significant increases of these diseases in the control group. Rates of pulmonary and gastrointestinal malignancies were not increased. Lymphatic leukemia (exposure group: 8 vs. 2.7; p < 0.01; control group: 7 vs. 3; p = 0.03) was significantly elevated due to a high rate of chronic lymphatic leukemia in both, the exposure as well as the control group. CONCLUSION: Treatment of AS with (224)Ra led to increased incidences of myeloid leukemia and malignancies of kidneys, thyroid and female genital organs. Although this kind of therapy is now abandoned, there is a need for close follow-up of patients who received it.","['Schulte, Tobias L', 'Nekolla, Elke A', 'Wick, Roland R']","['Schulte TL', 'Nekolla EA', 'Wick RR']","['Klinik und Poliklinik fur Allgemeine Orthopadie und Tumororthopadie, Universitatsklinikum Munster, Albert-Schweitzer-Strasse 33, Munster, Germany. schultet@mednet.uni-muenster.de']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20090912,Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

Recent studies have shown that multiple types of cancers show decreased expression of PML protein, though the mechanisms leading to this down-regulation are unknown. Decreased expression of PML can result in loss of cell cycle control and prevention of apoptosis and is likely a key event in the promotion of oncogenesis. Many of these effects are due to changes in the transcriptional profile of the cell as a result of decreased size and number of PML nuclear bodies. Several mouse studies confirm the contribution of PML to oncogenesis and cancer progression. It is important to not only further define a role for PML as a tumor suppressor, but also to begin to develop strategies to target PML therapeutically.","['Reineke, Erin L', 'Kao, Hung-Ying']","['Reineke EL', 'Kao HY']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and the Comprehensive Cancer Center of CWRU. 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 DK078965/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK078965-01A2/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],,Greece,Cancer Ther,Cancer therapy,101174596,,,,2009/09/17 06:00,2009/09/17 06:01,['2009/09/17 06:00'],"['2009/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/17 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Cancer Ther. 2009 Sep 1;7(A):219-226.,PMC2743178,['NIHMS115742'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the incidence of FN. Recent research and meta-analyses confirm that prophylactic fluoroquinolones decrease FN and infection-related mortality in patients with acute leukaemia and those receiving high-dose chemotherapy. Fluoroquinolone prophylaxis also lowers the incidence of FN and all-cause mortality following the first cycle of myelosuppressive chemotherapy for solid tumours. Levofloxacin has been the agent studied most thoroughly in this context. Although there is no convincing evidence that colonisation of individuals with resistant organisms due to antibiotic prophylaxis increases FN or mortality, such concerns must be taken seriously and the use of prophylaxis should be limited responsibly for patients with the greatest chance of benefit. Fluoroquinolone prophylaxis is well tolerated and cost-effective and should be offered to patients receiving chemotherapy for haematological malignancies and high-dose chemotherapy for solid tumours in which prolonged (>7 days) neutropenia is expected. It should also be considered for those receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours and lymphomas during the first cycle of chemotherapy when grade 4 neutropenia is anticipated.","['Cullen, M', 'Baijal, S']","['Cullen M', 'Baijal S']","['University Hospital Birmingham Cancer Centre, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TH, UK. michael.cullen@uhb.nhs.uk']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Fever/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Neutropenia/*prevention & control']",2009/09/17 06:00,2009/11/11 06:00,['2009/09/17 06:00'],"['2009/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['6605270 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6605270 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2009 Sep;101 Suppl 1:S11-4. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605270.,PMC2752225,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We studied incidence of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and MCC from the files of the Finnish Cancer Registry and the largest hospital of Finland, Helsinki University Central Hospital, from 1979 to 2006. Presence of MCPyV DNA in MCCs was investigated by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: We identified 4164 patients diagnosed with CLL and 172 diagnosed with MCC. Six patients diagnosed with both diseases were found; CLL was the first diagnosis in four cases and MCC in two. The standardised incidence ratio (SIR) for CLL after the diagnosis of MCC was highly elevated, 17.9 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.2-64.6; P<0.001), and the SIR for MCC after the diagnosis of CLL was also elevated, 15.7 (3.2-46.0, P<0.01). Merkel-cell polyomavirus DNA was present in all five MCCs with tumour tissue available for analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that patients diagnosed with CLL have a substantially increased risk for MCC, and vice versa. Merkel-cell polyomavirus DNA is frequently present in MCCs that occur in CLL patients. Immunosuppression related with CLL and viral infection might explain the association between CLL and MCC.","['Koljonen, V', 'Kukko, H', 'Pukkala, E', 'Sankila, R', 'Bohling, T', 'Tukiainen, E', 'Sihto, H', 'Joensuu, H']","['Koljonen V', 'Kukko H', 'Pukkala E', 'Sankila R', 'Bohling T', 'Tukiainen E', 'Sihto H', 'Joensuu H']","['Department of Plastic Surgery, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland. virve.koljonen@hus.fi']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090915,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Merkel Cell/*etiology/virology', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications', 'Male', 'Merkel Cells/*virology', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polyomavirus/*isolation & purification']",2009/09/17 06:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/09/17 06:00'],"['2009/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['6605306 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6605306 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2009 Oct 20;101(8):1444-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605306.

It is important to determine the predictive factors of response and survival in diseases treated with chemotherapy. METHODS: Twenty-nine patients who had been diagnosed of MDS/AML and had undergone chemotherapy between April 2001 and March 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 29 patients, 21 patients had an abnormal karyotype. Among them, 13 had complex type abnormalities and/or monosomy 7. Twenty-four patients were administered a low-dose AraC containing regimen and 5 received an AML-like regimen as the initial chemotherapy. The responses were CR4/PR2/NR23. The response rate (RR) in the patients with a normal karyotype was significantly better than in those with an abnormal karyotype (62.5% vs. 4.8%, p=0.003).

Subtype classification can be also achieved through gene expression profiling. However, how to apply such classifiers to a single patient and correctly diagnose the disease subtype in an independent patient group has not been addressed. Furthermore, the underlying regulatory mechanisms responsible for the subtype-specific gene expression patterns are still largely unknown. Here, by combining 3 published microarray datasets on 535 mostly white children's samples and generating a new dataset on 100 Chinese children's ALL samples, we were able to (1) identify a 62-gene classifier with 97.6% accuracy from the white children's samples and validated it on the completely independent set of 100 Chinese samples, and (2) uncover potential regulatory networks of ALL subtypes. The classifier we identified was, thus far, the only one that could be applied directly to a single sample and that sustained validation in a large independent patient group. Our results also suggest that the etiology of ALL is largely the same among different ethnic groups, and that the transcription factor hubs in the predicted regulatory network might play important roles in regulating gene expression and development of ALL.","['Li, Zhigang', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Wu, Minyuan', 'Zhu, Shanshan', 'Gao, Chao', 'Sun, Lin', 'Zhang, Ruidong', 'Qiao, Nan', 'Xue, Huiling', 'Hu, Yamei', 'Bao, Shilai', 'Zheng, Huyong', 'Han, Jing-Dong J']","['Li Z', 'Zhang W', 'Wu M', 'Zhu S', 'Gao C', 'Sun L', 'Zhang R', 'Qiao N', 'Xue H', 'Hu Y', 'Bao S', 'Zheng H', 'Han JD']","[""Beijing Children's Hospital of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090915,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Child', 'Data Mining', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/*genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/09/17 06:00,2009/12/23 06:00,['2009/09/17 06:00'],"['2009/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38931-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-04-218123 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Nov 12;114(20):4486-93. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-04-218123.

We examined leukemia cell turnover in Emu-TCL1 transgenic (TCL1-Tg) mice, which develop a CLL-like disease at 8 to 12 months of age. We found that leukemia cells in these mice not only had higher proportions of proliferating cells but also apoptotic cells than did nonleukemic lymphocytes. We crossed TCL1-Tg with BAFF-Tg mice, which express high levels of CD257. TCL1 x BAFF-Tg mice developed CLL-like disease at a significantly younger age and had more rapid disease progression and shorter survival than TCL1-Tg mice. Leukemia cells of TCL1 x BAFF-Tg mice had similar proportions of proliferating cells, but fewer proportions of dying cells, than did the CLL cells of TCL1-Tg mice. Moreover, leukemia cells from either TCL1 x BAFF-Tg or TCL1-Tg mice produced more aggressive disease when transferred into BAFF-Tg mice than into wild-type (WT) mice. Neutralization of CD257 resulted in rapid reduction in circulating leukemia cells. These results indicate that the leukemia cells of TCL1-Tg mice undergo high levels of spontaneous apoptosis that is offset by relatively high rates of leukemia cell proliferation, which might allow for acquisition of mutations that contribute to disease evolution.","['Enzler, Thomas', 'Kater, Arnon P', 'Zhang, Weizhou', 'Widhopf, George F 2nd', 'Chuang, Han-Yu', 'Lee, Jason', 'Avery, Esther', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Karin, Michael', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Enzler T', 'Kater AP', 'Zhang W', 'Widhopf GF 2nd', 'Chuang HY', 'Lee J', 'Avery E', 'Croce CM', 'Karin M', 'Kipps TJ']","['Moores Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090915,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'B-Cell Activating Factor/immunology/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Progression', 'Flow Cytometry', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics']",2009/09/17 06:00,2009/12/23 06:00,['2009/09/17 06:00'],"['2009/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38929-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-06-230169 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Nov 12;114(20):4469-76. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-06-230169.

Humans with cancer often have increased levels of cell-free circulating DNA in their plasma, which has shown promise for diagnosis, prognosis and detection of residual disease. We hypothesized that dogs with cancer have increased circulating DNA compared with healthy dogs or dogs with non-neoplastic diseases. Plasma DNA was measured in 40 healthy dogs, 20 dogs with non-neoplastic diseases and 80 dogs with cancer. The reference interval for plasma DNA in healthy dogs was 1-15 ng mL(-1). Dogs with lymphoma and lymphoid leukaemia had significantly higher concentrations (range: 0-91 ng mL(-1), P < 0.0001). Antigen receptor rearrangement assays suggest that plasma DNA had the same clonality as the primary lymphoid tumours. Dogs with lymphoid neoplasia and plasma DNA >25 ng mL(-1) had shorter remission times than those with < 25 ng mL(-1) (P = 0.0116). In contrast to humans, where increased plasma DNA is seen in many diseases, dogs with nonlymphoid malignancies and non-neoplastic diseases had plasma DNA concentrations similar to healthy dogs. This study shows that a portion of dogs with lymphoid neoplasia have increased tumour-derived plasma DNA, which serves as a negative prognostic indicator.","['Schaefer, D M W', 'Forman, M A', 'Kisseberth, W C', 'Lehman, A M', 'Kelbick, N T', 'Harper, P', 'Rush, L J']","['Schaefer DM', 'Forman MA', 'Kisseberth WC', 'Lehman AM', 'Kelbick NT', 'Harper P', 'Rush LJ']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Vet Comp Oncol,Veterinary and comparative oncology,101185242,,,,2007/09/01 00:00,2007/09/01 00:01,['2009/09/17 06:00'],"['2009/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2007/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/01 00:01 [medline]']","['VCO122 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1476-5829.2007.00122.x [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Comp Oncol. 2007 Sep;5(3):145-55. doi: 10.1111/j.1476-5829.2007.00122.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As for aneuploidy itself, the role of CIN in the evolution and progression of malignancy is a matter still open to debate. We investigated numerical as well as structural CIN in primary CD34-positive cells by determining the cell-to-cell variability of the chromosome content using fluorescence-in situ-hybridization (FISH). Thereby, CIN was measured in 65 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and control subjects. Among MDS patients, a subgroup with elevated levels of CIN was identified. At a median follow-up of 17.2 months, all patients within this 'high CIN' subgroup had died or progressed to AML, while 80% of MDS patients with normal CIN levels had stable disease (P < 0.001). Notably, there was no statistically significant difference between 'normal CIN' and 'high CIN' MDS patients regarding established risk factors. Hence, elevated CIN levels were associated with poor outcome, and our method provided additional prognostic information beyond conventional cytogenetics. Furthermore, in all three MDS patients for whom serial measurements were available, development of AML was preceded by increasing CIN levels. In conclusion, elevated CIN levels may be valuable as an early indicator of poor prognosis in MDS, hence corroborating the concept of CIN as a driving force in tumour progression.","['Heilig, Christoph E', 'Loffler, Harald', 'Mahlknecht, Ulrich', 'Janssen, Johannes W G', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Jauch, Anna', 'Kramer, Alwin']","['Heilig CE', 'Loffler H', 'Mahlknecht U', 'Janssen JW', 'Ho AD', 'Jauch A', 'Kramer A']","['Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology/Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090914,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosomal Instability/*genetics', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/09/17 06:00,2010/09/16 06:00,['2009/09/17 06:00'],"['2009/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JCMM905 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00905.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2010 Apr;14(4):895-902. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00905.x.

For this purpose, 10 bitches identified as being at the time of implantation or early placentation by means of ultrasonography before ovariohysterectomy (days 20-35, n = 10) provided tissues for comparison to tissue collected in a previous study and identified as early pregnant (n = 10) or non-pregnant (n = 4) by embryo flushing after ovariohysterectomy (days 10-12 after mating; Schafer-Somi et al. 2008). Uterine tissue was excised from the middle of the left horn from early pregnant and non-pregnant animals, including from interplacental and placentation sites. The following genes were investigated: CD-4, -8; cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, -2; granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF); hepatocyte growth factor (HGF); insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, -2; transforming growth factor (TGF) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha; interferon (IFN)-gamma; interleukin (IL)-1beta, -2, -4, -6, -8, -10, -12; leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and leptin. Gene expression for CD-8, COX-1, TGF-beta, HGF, IGF-1, IL-2, -4,-10, IFN-gamma and LIF were detected in the pre-implantation uterus, and all except IL-2 and -10 were still detectable during the implantation and placentation stage. During implantation, mRNA for IGF-2 and GM-CSF were additionally detected. The dioestrous uterus differed from the pregnant uterus because of the absence of CD-8, IL-4 and IFN-gamma and the expression of CD-4, TNF-alpha and IL-6. The results suggest that IL-4, IFN-gamma, CD-8, GM-CSF and IGF-2 are regulated in a pregnancy-specific manner and that GM-CSF and IGF-2 probably have growth supporting and immune modulating functions during implantation of the canine embryo.","['Beceriklisoy, H B', 'Schafer-Somi, S', 'Kucukaslan, I', 'Agaoglu, R', 'Gultiken, N', 'Ay, S S', 'Kaya, D', 'Aslan, S']","['Beceriklisoy HB', 'Schafer-Somi S', 'Kucukaslan I', 'Agaoglu R', 'Gultiken N', 'Ay SS', 'Kaya D', 'Aslan S']","['Clinic for Obstetrics and Reproductive Diseases, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Adnan Menderes, Aydin (Tr).']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Reprod Domest Anim,Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene,9015668,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Prostaglandins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dogs/*physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Placenta/*metabolism', 'Placentation/physiology', 'Pregnancy', '*Pregnancy, Animal', 'Prostaglandins/*biosynthesis']",2009/09/17 06:00,2010/03/17 06:00,['2009/09/17 06:00'],"['2009/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['RDA1443 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1439-0531.2009.01443.x [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Domest Anim. 2009 Jul;44 Suppl 2:115-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1439-0531.2009.01443.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim was to study whether a relation existed between the likely biological effectiveness of progesterone (P(4)) and the change in the uterine expression of LIF mRNA during pregnancy, as has been described in primates. For this purpose, 20 pregnant bitches were ovariohysterectomized after being allotted to three groups according to gestational age (pre-implantation: days 10 to 12, n = 7; peri-implantation: days 18 to 25, n = 7; post-placentation: days 28 to 45, n = 7). Tissue samples were obtained from the uterine tubes, one uterine horn (including placentation sites and interplacental sites in bitches that had already implanted) and the corpus uteri, stored at -80 degrees C, and then analysed by qualitative and quantitative PCR for PR and LIF mRNA expression. From the pre-implantation to the placentation stage, a decrease in the relative expression of PR mRNA in uterine tissue was obvious and significant when expressed relative to beta-actin (11.2 +/- 6.8 vs 2.7 +/- 1.9; p < 0.05). However, over the same period, the relative expression of LIF mRNA increased (10.1 +/- 16.1 vs 50.0 +/- 32.3; p < 0.05). In addition, PR mRNA went from being detectable to no longer detectable in the uterine tube, and no longer detectable in interplacental-site uterine tissue. We conclude that LIF is important for the establishment of canine pregnancy; that decreased uterine PR mRNA expression may contribute to the increase in uterine LIF mRNA; and, that the ability of the embryo to preserve PR mRNA expression at implantation and placentation sites while expression is lost in the remainder of the uterus represent an effect important to the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. We additionally propose that canine embryo secretory proteins have a regulatory effect on both PR and LIF before as well as at and after implantation.","['Schafer-Somi, S', 'Klein, D', 'Beceriklisoy, H B', 'Sabitzer, S', 'Ay, S S', 'Agaoglu, A R', 'Kucukaslan, I', 'Kaya, D', 'Aksoy, O A', 'Aslan, S']","['Schafer-Somi S', 'Klein D', 'Beceriklisoy HB', 'Sabitzer S', 'Ay SS', 'Agaoglu AR', 'Kucukaslan I', 'Kaya D', 'Aksoy OA', 'Aslan S']","['Centre for Artificial Insemination and Embryo Transfer, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.

These chaperones thereby prevent the formation of protein aggregates. HSPs are often overexpressed in human malignancies, including AML. HSP90 is the main chaperon required for the stabilization of multiple oncogenic kinases involved in the development of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). HSP90 client proteins are involved in the regulation of apoptosis, proliferation, autophagy and cell cycle progression; several of these proteins are in addition considered as possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of AML. HSP90 inhibition thereby offers the possibility to modulate several intracellular regulatory pathways through targeting of a single molecule. Several direct inhibitors of HSP90 have been developed, and they are classified into four groups: benzoquinon ansamycines and their derivatives, radicicol and its derivates, small synthetic inhibitors and a final group of other inhibitors. The HSP90 activity is regulated by posttranscriptional modulation; HSP90 inhibition can thereby be indirectly achieved through increased acetylation caused by histone deacetylase inhibitors. Many of these agents have entered phase I/II clinical trials, and the results from these initial studies have documented that HSP90 inhibition can mediate antileukemic effects in vivo. However, one would expect immunosuppressive side effects because HSP90 inhibitors have both direct and indirect inhibitory effects on T cell activation. Thus, future clinical studies are needed to clarify the efficiency and toxicity of HSP90 inhibitors in the treatment of human AML, including studies where HSP90 inhibitors are combined with conventional chemotherapy.","['Reikvam, H', 'Ersvaer, E', 'Bruserud, O']","['Reikvam H', 'Ersvaer E', 'Bruserud O']","['Institute of Internal Medicine, University of Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Drugs, Investigational)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Autophagy/physiology', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drugs, Investigational/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immune System/physiology', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism']",2009/09/17 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/17 06:00'],"['2009/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2174/156800909789271486 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2009 Sep;9(6):761-76. doi: 10.2174/156800909789271486.,,,,153,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These aberrations, which result in abnormally structured genomes, became a hallmark of cancer. Many studies provide evidence for the connection between chromosomal alterations and aberrant genes involved in the carcinogenesis process. An important problem in the analysis of cancer genomes is inferring the history of events leading to the observed aberrations. Cancer genomes are usually described in the form of karyotypes, which present the global changes in the genomes' structure. In this study, we propose a mathematical framework for analyzing chromosomal aberrations in cancer karyotypes. We introduce the problem of sorting karyotypes by elementary operations, which seeks a shortest sequence of elementary chromosomal events transforming a normal karyotype into a given (abnormal) cancerous karyotype. Under certain assumptions, we prove a lower bound for the elementary distance, and present a polynomial-time 3-approximation algorithm for the problem. We applied our algorithm to karyotypes from the Mitelman database, which records cancer karyotypes reported in the scientific literature. Approximately 94% of the karyotypes in the database, totaling 58,464 karyotypes, supported our assumptions, and each of them was subjected to our algorithm. Remarkably, even though the algorithm is only guaranteed to generate a 3-approximation, it produced a sequence whose length matched the lower bound (and hence optimal) in 99.9% of the tested karyotypes.","['Ozery-Flato, Michal', 'Shamir, Ron']","['Ozery-Flato M', 'Shamir R']","['The Blavatnik School of Computer Science, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel. ozery@post.tau.ac.il']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Comput Biol,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology,9433358,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', '*Karyotyping', '*Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasms/*genetics']",2009/09/17 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/17 06:00'],"['2009/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/cmb.2009.0083 [doi]'],ppublish,J Comput Biol. 2009 Oct;16(10):1445-60. doi: 10.1089/cmb.2009.0083.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with 1 reduced phosphorylation of EGFR and Akt, as well as ERK in Ca9-22 cells. Moreover, 1-treatment inhibited constitutive activation of STAT3 and STAT5 in a time-dependent manner. Up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins including Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), and myeloid cell leukemia-1(Mcl-1) were also found in cells treated with 1. In addition, 1-treatment disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) and resulted in release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and activation of both caspases-9 and -3. AG1478, a specific pharmacological inhibitor of EGFR activation, mimics the cytotoxic effects of 1. Taken together, these results showed that 1 causes significant induction of apoptosis in Ca9-22 cells via abolition of the EGFR-mediated survival pathway of these cells. Thus, cardiotoxin III appears to be a potential therapeutic agent for killing oral squamous carcinoma Ca9-22 cells.","['Chien, Ching-Ming', 'Lin, Kuei-Li', 'Su, Jung-Chen', 'Chang, Long-Sen', 'Lin, Shinne-Ren']","['Chien CM', 'Lin KL', 'Su JC', 'Chang LS', 'Lin SR']","['Faculty of Medicinal and Applied Chemistry, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Nat Prod,Journal of natural products,7906882,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cobra Cardiotoxin Proteins)', '0 (Elapid Venoms)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (cardiotoxin III, Naja naja atra)', '170449-18-0 (RTKI cpd)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*drug therapy', 'Cobra Cardiotoxin Proteins/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Elapid Venoms/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'ErbB Receptors/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/*drug effects', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/drug effects', 'Quinazolines', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology']",2009/09/17 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/17 06:00'],"['2009/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/np900010g [doi]'],ppublish,J Nat Prod. 2009 Oct;72(10):1735-40. doi: 10.1021/np900010g.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Classical staging sytems by Rai and Binet, while readily available and useful for initial assessment of prognosis, are not able to determine individual patient's ongoing clinical course of CLL at the time of diagnosis, especially in early stages. Therefore, newer biological prognostic parameters are currently being clinically evaluated. Mutational status of variable region of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (IgVH), cytogenetic aberrations, and both intracellular ZAP-70 and surface CD38 expression are recognized as parameters with established prognostic value. Molecules regulating the process of angiogenesis are also considered as promising markers.

The aim of this study is to extend these observations to a self-protein and clinically relevant tumor antigen associated with most types of adult leukemia: Wilms tumor gene 1 (WT1). We demonstrate that an E. coli coexpressing LLO and WT1 is capable of inducing a strong antitumor effect against WT1-expressing tumors in vivo through its ability to induce cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and inhibit the function of Foxp3 T-regulatory cells. Furthermore, we have characterized the immunodominant epitope involved in this effect (NAPYLPSCL) and demonstrated that coinjection of NAPYLPSCL with E. coli-LLO resulted in an antitumor effect largely equivalent to that obtained with E. coli-LLO/WT1. Our data demonstrate that the results obtained with a clinically irrelevant model tumor antigen remain valid with a ""real"" tumor antigen and that the adjuvant properties of the E. coli-LLO vaccine can be exploited in conjunction with peptides. The results obtained in this study will facilitate the translation of this work to human studies by combining antigenic motifs relevant to specific human leukocyte antigen haplotypes with the adjuvant effect of E. coli-LLO.","['Dai, Ming-Shen', 'Nitcheu-Tefit, Josianne', 'Alcock, Sally', 'Ramirez-Jimenez, Francisco', 'Chao, Tsu-Yi', 'Baril, Patrick', 'Rocha, Marian', 'Brett, Sara J', 'Stauss, Hans J', 'Vassaux, Georges']","['Dai MS', 'Nitcheu-Tefit J', 'Alcock S', 'Ramirez-Jimenez F', 'Chao TY', 'Baril P', 'Rocha M', 'Brett SJ', 'Stauss HJ', 'Vassaux G']","[""Centre for Molecular Oncology, Institute of Cancer, Queen Mary's School of Medicine, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['G0700149/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0900950/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G9721629/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hemolysin Proteins)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', 'R06ZRQ1YX9 (hlyA protein, Listeria monocytogenes)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Toxins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', '*Cancer Vaccines', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Escherichia coli/genetics/*immunology', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Hemolysin Proteins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulins/blood', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Engineering', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'WT1 Proteins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism']",2009/09/16 06:00,2010/06/24 06:00,['2009/09/16 06:00'],"['2009/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CJI.0b013e3181aee259 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother. 2009 Oct;32(8):845-55. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0b013e3181aee259.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to the well-known influence of FLT3, NPM1, and CEBPA mutations, high transcript levels of the ERG, BAALC, and MN1 genes have been associated with inferior outcomes, but the relative importance of these risk markers remains to be defined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed ERG, BAALC, and MN1 expression levels in a cohort of 210 patients with CN-AML who received intensive chemotherapy. Expression levels of ERG, BAALC, and MN1 were determined in bone marrow samples by using oligonucleotide microarrays. RESULTS: High transcript levels of ERG, BAALC, and MN1 were predictors for inferior overall survival (OS) and a lower rate of complete remissions (CRs). There were significant positive correlations between the expression levels of all three genes. ERG expression levels predicted OS in elderly patients (ie, age 60 years or older) with CN-AML (P = .006) as well as in younger patients (P = .013). In multivariate analyses, high ERG expression was independently associated with a lower CR rate (P = .013), shorter event-free survival (P = .008), and shorter OS (P = .005). Patients who had low ERG levels and absent FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) had a 5-year OS of 44%, and patients who had high ERG expression and FLT3 ITD had a 5-year OS of only 5%. CONCLUSION: We analyzed a comprehensive set of molecular risk factors in a large, homogeneous CN-AML patient cohort. In this study, high ERG expression levels emerged as a strong negative prognostic factor and provided prognostic information in addition to established molecular markers.","['Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Dufour, Annika', 'Benthaus, Tobias', 'Hummel, Manuela', 'Sauerland, Maria-Cristina', 'Heinecke, Achim', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Wormann, Bernhard', 'Mansmann, Ulrich', 'Braess, Jan', 'Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Buske, Christian', 'Bohlander, Stefan K']","['Metzeler KH', 'Dufour A', 'Benthaus T', 'Hummel M', 'Sauerland MC', 'Heinecke A', 'Berdel WE', 'Buchner T', 'Wormann B', 'Mansmann U', 'Braess J', 'Spiekermann K', 'Hiddemann W', 'Buske C', 'Bohlander SK']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Institute for Medical Informatics, Biometry, and Epidemiology, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians Universitat, Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090914,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (BAALC protein, human)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (MN1 protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics', 'Young Adult']",2009/09/16 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/16 06:00'],"['2009/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.20.5328 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.20.5328 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Oct 20;27(30):5031-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.20.5328.

It remains to be established whether relapse risk can be better predicted through assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD). One proposed marker is the Wilms tumor gene WT1, which is overexpressed in most patients with AML, thus providing a putative target for immunotherapy, although in the absence of a standardized assay, its utility for MRD monitoring remains controversial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine published and in-house real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction WT1 assays were systematically evaluated within the European LeukemiaNet; the best-performing assay was applied to diagnostic AML samples (n = 620), follow-up samples from 129 patients treated with intensive combination chemotherapy, and 204 normal peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) controls. RESULTS: Considering relative levels of expression detected in normal PB and BM, WT1 was sufficiently overexpressed to discriminate > or = 2-log reduction in transcripts in 46% and 13% of AML patients, according to the respective follow-up sample source. In this informative group, greater WT1 transcript reduction after induction predicted reduced relapse risk (hazard ratio, 0.54 per log reduction; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.83; P = .004) that remained significant when adjusted for age, WBC count, and cytogenetics. Failure to reduce WT1 transcripts below the threshold limits defined in normal controls by the end of consolidation also predicted increased relapse risk (P = .004). CONCLUSION: Application of a standardized WT1 assay provides independent prognostic information in AML, lending support to incorporation of early assessment of MRD to develop more robust risk scores, to enhance risk stratification, and to identify patients who may benefit from allogeneic transplantation.","['Cilloni, Daniela', 'Renneville, Aline', 'Hermitte, Fabienne', 'Hills, Robert K', 'Daly, Sarah', 'Jovanovic, Jelena V', 'Gottardi, Enrico', 'Fava, Milena', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Weiss, Tamara', 'Izzo, Barbara', 'Nomdedeu, Josep', 'van der Heijden, Adrian', 'van der Reijden, Bert A', 'Jansen, Joop H', 'van der Velden, Vincent H J', 'Ommen, Hans', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Grimwade, David']","['Cilloni D', 'Renneville A', 'Hermitte F', 'Hills RK', 'Daly S', 'Jovanovic JV', 'Gottardi E', 'Fava M', 'Schnittger S', 'Weiss T', 'Izzo B', 'Nomdedeu J', 'van der Heijden A', 'van der Reijden BA', 'Jansen JH', 'van der Velden VH', 'Ommen H', 'Preudhomme C', 'Saglio G', 'Grimwade D']","['Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090914,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*genetics', 'Prognosis', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",2009/09/16 06:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/09/16 06:00'],"['2009/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.22.4865 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.22.4865 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Nov 1;27(31):5195-201. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.22.4865.

The incidence of these events is greatly variable and is influenced by many factors, including the type of disease, the type of chemotherapy, and the use of a central venous device. As in solid tumors, a number of clinical risk factors have been identified and contribute to the increasing thrombotic rate in hematologic malignancies. Biologic properties of the tumor cells can influence the hypercoagulable state of patients with these malignancies by several mechanisms. Of interest, oncogenes responsible for neoplastic transformation in leukemia also may be involved in clotting activation. Epidemiologic data allow an estimate of the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in acute leukemia, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma (MM). In this review, we focus on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and VTE management in these three hematologic malignancies. No recommendation for routine thromboprophylaxis in these conditions, with the exception of MM, is available.

A distinguishing feature of these proteins is the presence of a 130-amino-acid methyltransferase domain (SET), which catalyzes the methylation of histones. It is still not clear how SET proteins distinguish gene expression states, how they are targeted, or what regulates their substrate specificity. Many SET domain-containing proteins show robust activity on core histones but relatively weak activity on intact nucleosomes, their physiological substrate. Here, we examined the binding of two SET domain-containing proteins, ALL1 and SET7, to chromatin substrates. The SET domains from these proteins bind and methylate intact nucleosomes poorly but can recognize disrupted nucleosomal structures associated with transcribed chromatin. Interestingly, the remodeling of dinucleosomes by the ISWI class of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes stimulated the binding of SET domains to chromatin and the methylation of H3 within the nucleosome. Unexpectedly, dinucleosomes remodeled by SWI/SNF were poor substrates. Thus, SET domains can distinguish nucleosomes altered by these two classes of remodeling enzymes. Our study reveals novel insights into the mechanism of how SET domains recognize different chromatin states and specify histone methylation at active loci.","['Krajewski, Wladyslaw A', 'Reese, Joseph C']","['Krajewski WA', 'Reese JC']","['Institute of Developmental Biology, Moscow 117334, Russian Federation. wkrajewski@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['06-0466/AICR_/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090914,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (ISWI protein)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (SETD7 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Chickens', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Nucleosomes/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2009/09/16 06:00,2010/02/18 06:00,['2009/09/16 06:00'],"['2009/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00775-09 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00775-09 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2010 Feb;30(3):552-64. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00775-09.

However, determination of relative importance of potential predictors and validating the fitted models for their stability, predictive accuracy and generalizability are often overlooked or not done thoroughly. METHODS: Using a case study aimed at predicting children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who are at low risk of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), we propose and compare two strategies, bootstrapping and random split of data, for ordering potential predictors according to their relative importance with respect to model stability and generalizability. We also propose an approach based on relative increase in percentage of explained variation and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for developing models where variables from our ordered list enter the model according to their importance. An additional data set aimed at identifying predictors of prostate cancer penetration is also used for illustrative purposes. RESULTS: Age is chosen to be the most important predictor of TLS. It is selected 100% of the time using the bootstrapping approach. Using the random split method, it is selected 99% of the time in the training data and is significant (at 5% level) 98% of the time in the validation data set. This indicates that age is a stable predictor of TLS with good generalizability. The second most important variable is white blood cell count (WBC). Our methods also identified an important predictor of TLS that was otherwise omitted if relying on any of the automated model selection procedures alone. A group at low risk of TLS consists of children younger than 10 years of age, without T-cell immunophenotype, whose baseline WBC is < 20 x 10(9)/L and palpable spleen is < 2 cm. For the prostate cancer data set, the Gleason score and digital rectal exam are identified to be the most important indicators of whether tumor has penetrated the prostate capsule. CONCLUSION: Our model selection procedures based on bootstrap re-sampling and repeated random split techniques can be used to assess the strength of evidence that a variable is truly an independent and reproducible predictor. Our methods, therefore, can be used for developing stable and reproducible models with good performances. Moreover, our methods can serve as a good tool for validating a predictive model. Previous biological and clinical studies support the findings based on our selection and validation strategies. However, extensive simulations may be required to assess the performance of our methods under different scenarios as well as check their sensitivity to a random fluctuation in the data.","['Beyene, Joseph', 'Atenafu, Eshetu G', 'Hamid, Jemila S', 'To, Teresa', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Beyene J', 'Atenafu EG', 'Hamid JS', 'To T', 'Sung L']","['Child Heath Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. joseph@utstat.toronto.edu']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20090914,England,BMC Med Res Methodol,BMC medical research methodology,100968545,,IM,"['Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Models, Statistical', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'ROC Curve', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Assessment/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/*epidemiology/etiology']",2009/09/16 06:00,2010/02/25 06:00,['2009/09/16 06:00'],"['2008/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2288-9-64 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2288-9-64 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Res Methodol. 2009 Sep 14;9:64. doi: 10.1186/1471-2288-9-64.,PMC2761416,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test this hypothesis, we utilized a long-term primary culture system from bone biopsies that reliably generates a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC). Co-culture of MSC with CLL B-cells protected the latter from both spontaneous apoptosis and drug-induced apoptosis. The CD38 expression in previously CD38 positive CLL B-cells was up-regulated with MSC co-culture. Upregulation of CD71, CD25, CD69 and CD70 in CLL B-cells was found in the co-culture.

Its potential anti-cancer activity was surmised because its expression is inversely correlated with the cell proliferation status. Indeed adenoviral delivery of this gene proved to be efficient in killing several cancer cell lines and great strides have been made concerning its molecular ways of action. Later it was shown that mda7 encoded a secreted cytokine which belongs to the IL-10, class-II family of cytokines. We recently found that this molecule exerted apoptotic activity on stimulating but not on resting lymphocytes from a B cell leukaemia. This activity is distinct from that of intracellular MDA-7, and may pave the way for using the cytokine in cancers provided that they express the IL-24 Receptors; in this respect, melanomas are insensitive to the recombinant cytokine due to the lack of IL-24 receptors at their surface. In contrast to its anti-cancer activity, the immunological role of IL-24 is still unclear, with differences between mice and human. If however it is demonstrated that IL-24 can inhibit the function of STAT3 in normal lymphocytes as it is the case in leukemic cells, and given that STAT3 is needed for the differentiation of several lymphocyte subsets, this will give us hints as to the potential role of this cytokine in the immune system.","['Dalloul, Ali', 'Sainz-Perez, Alexander']","['Dalloul A', 'Sainz-Perez A']","['Laboratory of cell therapy and University of Nancy - Medical school, Vandoeuvre les Nancy, France. a.dalloul@chu-nancy.fr']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United Arab Emirates,Endocr Metab Immune Disord Drug Targets,"Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",101269157,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (interleukin-24)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/genetics', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/genetics/*immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Melanoma/immunology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/immunology']",2009/09/16 06:00,2010/06/15 06:00,['2009/09/16 06:00'],"['2008/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['EMID-DT-ABS-12 [pii]', '10.2174/187153009789839200 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocr Metab Immune Disord Drug Targets. 2009 Dec;9(4):353-60. doi: 10.2174/187153009789839200.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this latter respect, here, we focus the attention on four of these molecules, specifically leptin, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). These cytokines present similar three-dimensional fold structure, interact with related class-I receptors, which are expressed in the same regions (i.e., hypothalamus), and activate similar intracellular pathways. Leptin and CNTF share functional similarities, by acting at hypothalamic and pituitary levels, and their receptors are colocalized in the arcuate and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. For both these molecules, no effect on GnRH migration has been described. LIF has also been shown to affect gonadotropin secretion and here we present the novel observation that it is also able to stimulate GnRH secretion in vitro. Moreover, in the mouse, LIF is prenatally expressed in nasal regions where GnRH neurons originate and start their migration, and in vitro it stimulates intrinsic cell motility and directional migration. The role of the prototypical cytokine, IL-6, on the GnRH-LH axis is not fully clear and additional information seem necessary to better clarify this aspect. In conclusion, the data here discussed suggest that this family of cytokines appears to participate to the complex control of the reproductive function by affecting the development and function of the hypothalamus-pituitary system at different ontogenic times and anatomical sites.","['Dozio, E', 'Ruscica, M', 'Galliera, E', 'Corsi, M M', 'Magni, P']","['Dozio E', 'Ruscica M', 'Galliera E', 'Corsi MM', 'Magni P']","[""Department of Human Morphology and Biomedical Sciences Citta' Studi, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Protein Pept Sci,Current protein & peptide science,100960529,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '33515-09-2 (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leptin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neurosecretory Systems/metabolism/*physiology', 'Reproduction/genetics/physiology']",2009/09/16 06:00,2010/03/06 06:00,['2009/09/16 06:00'],"['2009/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['CPPS-21 [pii]', '10.2174/138920309789630561 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Protein Pept Sci. 2009 Dec;10(6):577-84. doi: 10.2174/138920309789630561.,,,,88,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The traditional derivation and culture of mESCs have been based on the use of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) treated with exogenous leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). However, the rapid senescence of MEFs, coupled with the high cost of LIF, has significantly hampered the widespread use of mESCs in stem cell research. Thus, we present a novel exogenous LIF-free culture system for general mESCs applications, comprising fibroblast-like cells derived from the rabbit spleen (RSFs). We demonstrated that mESCs cultured on RSFs (mESCs-RSFs) maintained all mESC features after prolonged LIF-free culture, including alkaline phosphatase, cell surface markers (SSEA-1), molecular markers (OCT-4, NANOG, TERT, REX-1), karyotype, and pluripotency. The high expression level of both LIF and WNT3A in the RSFs may account for their ability to maintain mESCs without exogenous LIF.

One of the main problems in the area is that conventional estimates of the variances that are required in the t-statistic and other statistics are unreliable owing to the small number of replications. Various methods have been proposed in the literature to overcome this lack of degrees of freedom problem. In this context, it is commonly observed that the variance increases proportionally with the intensity level, which has led many researchers to assume that the variance is a function of the mean. Here we concentrate on estimation of the variance as a function of an unknown mean in two models: the constant coefficient of variation model and the quadratic variance-mean model. Because the means are unknown and estimated with few degrees of freedom, naive methods that use the sample mean in place of the true mean are generally biased because of the errors-in-variables phenomenon. We propose three methods for overcoming this bias. The first two are variations on the theme of the so-called heteroscedastic simulation-extrapolation estimator, modified to estimate the variance function consistently. The third class of estimators is entirely different, being based on semiparametric information calculations. Simulations show the power of our methods and their lack of bias compared with the naive method that ignores the measurement error. The methodology is illustrated by using microarray data from leukaemia patients.","['Wang, Yuedong', 'Ma, Yanyuan', 'Carroll, Raymond J']","['Wang Y', 'Ma Y', 'Carroll RJ']","['University of California, Santa Barbara, USA.']",['eng'],"['U01 CA057030/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA057030/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA104620/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA057030/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA057030-21/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],,England,J R Stat Soc Series B Stat Methodol,"Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

Bone marrow studies have shown that this residual disease resides within the stem cell compartment. Quiescence of leukemic stem cells has been suggested as a mechanism conferring insensitivity to imatinib, and exposure to the Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF), together with imatinib, has led to a significant reduction in leukemic stem cells in vitro. In this paper, we design a novel mathematical model of stem cell quiescence to investigate the treatment response to imatinib and G-CSF. We find that the addition of G-CSF to an imatinib treatment protocol leads to observable effects only if the majority of leukemic stem cells are quiescent; otherwise it does not modulate the leukemic cell burden. The latter scenario is in agreement with clinical findings in a pilot study administering imatinib continuously or intermittently, with or without G-CSF (GIMI trial). Furthermore, our model predicts that the addition of G-CSF leads to a higher risk of resistance since it increases the production of cycling leukemic stem cells. Although the pilot study did not include enough patients to draw any conclusion with statistical significance, there were more cases of progression in the experimental arms as compared to continuous imatinib. Our results suggest that the additional use of G-CSF may be detrimental to patients in the clinic.","['Foo, Jasmine', 'Drummond, Mark W', 'Clarkson, Bayard', 'Holyoake, Tessa', 'Michor, Franziska']","['Foo J', 'Drummond MW', 'Clarkson B', 'Holyoake T', 'Michor F']","['Computational Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, United States of America.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090911,United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Computer Simulation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*pathology', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage']",2009/09/15 06:00,2009/11/13 06:00,['2009/09/15 06:00'],"['2009/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000503 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2009 Sep;5(9):e1000503. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000503.

A small set of miRNAs is differentially expressed in hematopoietic cells and seemingly has an important role in granulopoiesis and lineage differentiation. In this study, we analysed, using a quantitative real-time PCR approach, the expression of 12 granulocytic differentiation signature miRNAs in a cohort of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients. We found nine miRNAs overexpressed and three miRNAs (miR-107, -342 and let-7c) downregulated in APL blasts as compared with normal promyelocytes differentiated in vitro from CD34+ progenitors. Patients successfully treated with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy showed downregulation of miR-181b and upregulation of miR-15b, -16, -107, -223, -342 and let-7c. We further investigated whether the APL-associated oncogene, promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML)/retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha), might be involved in the transcriptional repression of miR-107, -342 and let-7c. We found that PML/RARalpha binds the regulatory sequences of the intragenic miR-342 and let-7c. In addition, we observed, in response to ATRA, the release of PML/RARalpha paralleled by their transcriptional activation, together with their host genes, EVL and C21orf34alpha.

To overcome these problems, we established a human tumor-bearing mouse model, using NOD/Shi-scid, IL-2Rgamma(null) (NOG) mice as recipients, in which autologous human immune cells are engrafted and mediate ADCC but in which endogenous murine cells are unable to mediate ADCC. In the present study, we used NOG mice bearing primary adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) cells and a therapeutic chimeric anti-CCR4 mAb, the Fc region of which is defucosylated to enhance ADCC. We report significant antitumor activity in vivo associated with robust ADCC mediated by autologous effector cells from the same patients. The present study is the first to report a mouse model in which a potent antitumor effect of the therapeutic mAb against primary tumor cells is mediated by autologous human immune cells. Human autologous ADCC in mice in vivo was confirmed by the depletion of human immune cells before ATLL PBMC inoculation. In addition, NOG mice bearing primary ATLL cells presented features identical with patients with ATLL. In conclusion, this approach makes it possible to model the human immune system active in Ab-based immunotherapy in vivo, and thus to perform more appropriate preclinical evaluations of novel therapeutic mAb. Furthermore, the potent ADCC mediated by defucosylated anti-CCR4 mAb, observed here in vivo in humanized mice, will be exploited in clinical trials in the near future.","['Ito, Asahi', 'Ishida, Takashi', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Sato, Fumihiko', 'Mori, Fumiko', 'Yano, Hiroki', 'Inagaki, Atsushi', 'Suzuki, Susumu', 'Takino, Hisashi', 'Ri, Masaki', 'Kusumoto, Shigeru', 'Komatsu, Hirokazu', 'Iida, Shinsuke', 'Inagaki, Hiroshi', 'Ueda, Ryuzo']","['Ito A', 'Ishida T', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Sato F', 'Mori F', 'Yano H', 'Inagaki A', 'Suzuki S', 'Takino H', 'Ri M', 'Kusumoto S', 'Komatsu H', 'Iida S', 'Inagaki H', 'Ueda R']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Immunology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Aichi 467-8601, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090911,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)', '28RYY2IV3F (Fucose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fucose/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/blood/*deficiency/*genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/pathology/transplantation', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Receptors, CCR4/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/09/15 06:00,2009/11/17 06:00,['2009/09/15 06:00'],"['2009/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.0900699 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0900699 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2009 Oct 1;183(7):4782-91. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0900699.

The adjuvant effect of IgE was shown to result from eosinophil-dependent priming of the T cell-mediated adaptive immune response. The protective effect is likely to be mediated by the interaction of tumor cell-bound IgE with receptors, which then trigger the release of mediators, recruitment of effector cells, cell killing and tumor Ag cross-priming. It was therefore of utmost importance to demonstrate the strict dependence of the protective effect on IgE receptor activation. First, the protective effect of IgE was confirmed in a BALB/c tumor model, in which IgE-loaded modified VV Ankara-infected tumor cells proved to be an effective cellular vaccine. However, the protective effect was lost in Fc(epsilon)RIalpha(-/-) (but not in CD23(-/-)) knockout mice, showing the IgE-Fc(epsilo)nRI interaction to be essential. Moreover, human IgE (not effective in BALB/c mice) had a protective effect in the humanized knockin mouse (Fc(epsilon)RIalpha(-/-) hFc(epsilon)RIalpha(+)). This finding suggests that the adjuvant effect of IgE could be exploited for human therapeutics.","['Nigro, Elisa A', 'Brini, Anna T', 'Soprana, Elisa', 'Ambrosi, Alessandro', 'Dombrowicz, David', 'Siccardi, Antonio G', 'Vangelista, Luca']","['Nigro EA', 'Brini AT', 'Soprana E', 'Ambrosi A', 'Dombrowicz D', 'Siccardi AG', 'Vangelista L']","['Department of Biology and Genetics, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090911,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Adjuvants, Immunologic/metabolism/*physiology/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Cancer Vaccines/administration & dosage/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/administration & dosage/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gene Knock-In Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism/*physiology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/deficiency/genetics/*physiology']",2009/09/15 06:00,2009/11/17 06:00,['2009/09/15 06:00'],"['2009/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.0900842 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0900842 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2009 Oct 1;183(7):4530-6. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0900842.

Currently, no effective antiretroviral treatment options are available to restrict the development of diseases associated with the virus. In this work, we investigated the activity of pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP) on HTLV-I, when expressed from a proviral clone in 293T cells or in an HTLV-I immortalized cell line. PAP is a plant-derived N-glycosidase that exhibits antiviral activity against a number of viruses; however, its mode of action has not been clearly defined. Here, we describe the mechanism by which PAP inhibited production of HTLV-I. We show that PAP depurinated nucleotides within the gag open reading frame and suppressed the synthesis of viral proteins in part by decreasing the translational efficiency of HTLV-I gag/pol mRNA. Observed reduction in levels of viral mRNAs were not due to enhanced degradation; rather, decreased amounts of viral transactivator protein, Tax, led to feed-back inhibition of transcription from the viral promoter. Therefore, PAP efficiently suppressed HTLV-I gene expression at both translational and transcriptional levels, resulting in substantially diminished virus production. Significantly, no changes in viability or rates of cellular transcription or translation were observed in cells expressing PAP, indicating that this protein was not toxic. Antiviral activity, together with the absence of cytotoxicity, supports further investigation of this enzyme as a novel therapeutic agent against the progression of HTLV-I infection.","['Mansouri, Sheila', 'Choudhary, Gunjan', 'Sarzala, Paulina M', 'Ratner, Lee', 'Hudak, Katalin A']","['Mansouri S', 'Choudhary G', 'Sarzala PM', 'Ratner L', 'Hudak KA']","['Department of Biology, York University, Toronto, Ontario M3J 1P3, Canada.']",['eng'],"['P50 CA094056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA109678/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA109678 (/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA10073/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA10521/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA063417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA94056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090911,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (pokeweed antiviral protein)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*drug effects', 'HTLV-I Infections/drug therapy/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Phytolacca americana/*chemistry', 'Plant Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1/*pharmacology']",2009/09/15 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/15 06:00'],"['2009/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)38044-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.046235 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Nov 6;284(45):31453-62. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.046235.

These interactions are mediated by a short helical motif, the BH3 domain, on the BH3-only protein, which inserts into a hydrophobic groove on the pro-survival molecule. To identify novel peptidic ligands that bind Mcl-1, a pro-survival protein relative of Bcl-2, both human and mouse Mcl-1 were screened against large randomized phage-displayed peptide libraries. We identified a number of 16-mer peptides with sub-micromolar affinity that were highly selective for Mcl-1, as well as being somewhat selective for the species of Mcl-1 (human or mouse) against which the library was panned. Interestingly, these sequences all strongly resembled natural BH3 domain sequences. By switching residues within the best of the human Mcl-1-binding sequences, or extending beyond the core sequence identified, we were able to alter the pro-survival protein interaction profile of this peptide such that it now bound all members tightly and was a potent killer when introduced into cells. Introduction of an amide lock constraint within this sequence also increased its helicity and binding to pro-survival proteins.

In this study, we examined the expression pattern of the other 13 known septin genes in altogether 67 cases of myeloid neoplasia, including three patients with the MLL-SEPT2 fusion gene, four with MLL-SEPT6 fusion, and three patients with the MLL-SEPT9 fusion gene. When compared with normal controls, a statistically significant down-regulation was observed for the expression of both MLL (6.4-fold; p=0.008) and SEPT6 (1.7-fold; p=0.002) in MLL-SEPT6 leukemia. Significant down-regulation of MLL was also found in MLL-MLLT3 leukemias. In addition, there was a trend for SEPT9 down-regulation in MLL-SEPT9 leukemias (4.6-fold; p=0.077). Using hierarchical clustering analysis to compare acute myeloid leukemia genetic subgroups based on their similarity of septin expression changes, we found that MLL-SEPT2 and MLL-SEPT6 neoplasias cluster together apart from the remaining subgroups and that PML-RARA leukemia presents under-expression of most septin family genes.","['Santos, Joana', 'Cerveira, Nuno', 'Bizarro, Susana', 'Ribeiro, Franclim R', 'Correia, Cecilia', 'Torres, Lurdes', 'Lisboa, Susana', 'Vieira, Joana', 'Mariz, Jose M', 'Norton, Lucilia', 'Snijder, Simone', 'Mellink, Clemens H', 'Buijs, Arjan', 'Shih, Lee-Yung', 'Strehl, Sabine', 'Micci, Francesca', 'Heim, Sverre', 'Teixeira, Manuel R']","['Santos J', 'Cerveira N', 'Bizarro S', 'Ribeiro FR', 'Correia C', 'Torres L', 'Lisboa S', 'Vieira J', 'Mariz JM', 'Norton L', 'Snijder S', 'Mellink CH', 'Buijs A', 'Shih LY', 'Strehl S', 'Micci F', 'Heim S', 'Teixeira MR']","['Department of Genetics, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090912,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (MLL-SEPT6 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*genetics', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Young Adult']",2009/09/15 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/09/15 06:00'],"['2009/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/11 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00425-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.08.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 May;34(5):615-21. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.08.018.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have analyzed the expression of p16INK4a in bone marrow mononuclear cells or CD34(+) cells from 53 patients with MDS, 12 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 11 healthy controls. Additionally, We have assessed quantitatively senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) staining on bone marrow mononuclear cells from MDS and AML patients, HL60 and SHI-1 leukemia cell lines, and healthy control cells. RESULTS: An upregulated expression of senescence-associated molecular marker p16INK4a was found in MDS compared with healthy controls, while a lower expression of p16INK4a was observed in AML compared with healthy controls. International Prognostic Scoring System score was negatively correlated with the percentage of p16INK4a-positive cells. The SA-beta-gal activity measured by mean percentage of positive cells was significantly higher in MDS cases when compared with controls. Meanwhile, percentage of SA-beta-gal-positive cells was also remarkably higher in dysplastic cells of MDS when compared to nondysplastic cells from MDS.

By subcellular proteome analysis, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) was identified as being significantly down-regulated in NSC606985-treated leukemic NB4 cells. HnRNP K, a docking protein for DNA, RNA, and transcriptional or translational molecules, is implicated in a host of processes involving the regulation of gene expression. However, the molecular mechanisms of hnRNP K reduction and its roles during apoptosis are still not understood. In the present study, we found that, following the appearance of the DeltaPKC-delta, hnRNP K protein was significantly down-regulated in NSC606985, doxorubicin, arsenic trioxide and ultraviolet-induced apoptosis. We further provided evidence that DeltaPKC-delta mediated the down-regulation of hnRNP K protein during apoptosis: PKC-delta inhibitor could rescue the reduction of hnRNP K; hnRNP K failed to be decreased in PKC-delta-deficient apoptotic KG1a cells; conditional induction of DeltaPKC-delta in U937T cells directly down-regulated hnRNP K protein. Moreover, the proteasome inhibitor also inhibited the down-regulation of hnRNP K protein by apoptosis inducer and the conditional expression of DeltaPKC-delta. More intriguingly, the suppression of hnRNP K with siRNA transfection significantly induced apoptosis. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that proteolytically activated PKC-delta down-regulates hnRNP K protein in a proteasome-dependent manner, which plays an important role in apoptosis induction.","['Gao, Feng-Hou', 'Wu, Ying-Li', 'Zhao, Meng', 'Liu, Chuan-Xu', 'Wang, Li-Shun', 'Chen, Guo-Qiang']","['Gao FH', 'Wu YL', 'Zhao M', 'Liu CX', 'Wang LS', 'Chen GQ']","[""No.3 People's Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090910,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein K)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein K/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Kinase C-delta/*physiology']",2009/09/15 06:00,2010/01/20 06:00,['2009/09/15 06:00'],"['2008/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/01 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(09)00382-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.09.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2009 Nov 15;315(19):3250-8. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.09.005.

In both myeloid and lymphoid cells, accumulating data attribute to the multidomain protein Vav1 a functional relevance in the control of gene expression, by direct interaction with chromatin remodeling and/or transcriptional proteins. The present study provides evidence that, in the APL-derived NB4 cell line, Vav1 and the transcription factor PU.1 cooperate in regulating the ATRA-induced CD11b expression. Both chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) indicate that Vav1 and PU.1 are recruited to CD11b promoter. Even if the two proteins may participate in diverse protein/DNA complexes, the amounts of complexes including PU.1 seem to be dependent on the interaction of this transcription factor with tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav1. The reported data suggest that the ATRA-induced increase of Vav1 expression and tyrosine phosphorylation may be involved in recruiting PU.1 to its consensus sequence on the CD11b promoter and, ultimately, in regulating CD11b expression during the late stages of neutrophil differentiation of APL-derived promyelocytes.","['Brugnoli, Federica', 'Lambertini, Elisabetta', 'Varin-Blank, Nadine', 'Piva, Roberta', 'Marchisio, Marco', 'Grassilli, Silvia', 'Miscia, Sebastiano', 'Capitani, Silvano', 'Bertagnolo, Valeria']","['Brugnoli F', 'Lambertini E', 'Varin-Blank N', 'Piva R', 'Marchisio M', 'Grassilli S', 'Miscia S', 'Capitani S', 'Bertagnolo V']","['Signal Transduction Unit-Laboratory of Cell Biology, Section of Human Anatomy, Department of Morphology and Embryology, University of Ferrara, 44100 Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090910,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (ITGAM protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (VAV1 protein, human)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', ""6KS3LS0D4F (3,3',4,5'-tetrahydroxystilbene)"", '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)']",IM,"['CD11b Antigen/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/physiology', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Neutrophils/cytology/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*physiology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects/physiology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Stilbenes/pharmacology', 'Syk Kinase', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2009/09/15 06:00,2010/01/14 06:00,['2009/09/15 06:00'],"['2009/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/03 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(09)00381-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.09.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2010 Jan 1;316(1):38-47. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.09.004.

We aimed to confirm the results of the most effective DCOG ALL protocol for non-high-risk (NHR) patients to date (ALL-6), compare results with ALL-7 and ALL-8, and study prognostic factors in a non-randomised setting. METHODS: From Jan 1, 1997, until Nov 1, 2004, patients with ALL were treated according to the ALL-9 protocol in eight Dutch academic centres with their affiliated peripheral hospitals. Patients were stratified into NHR and high risk (HR) groups. HR criteria were white-blood-cell count of 50,000 cells per microL or more, T-cell phenotype, mediastinal mass, CNS or testicular involvement, and Philadelphia chromosome or MLL rearrangement; patients who did not fulfil these criteria were deemed to be NHR. The NHR group was treated with a three-drug induction (dexamethasone, vincristine, and asparaginase) for 6 weeks, medium-dose methotrexate for 3 weeks, then maintenance therapy. HR patients received a four-drug induction (as for the NHR patients plus daunorubicin) for 6 weeks, high-dose methotrexate for 8 weeks, and two intensification courses before receiving maintenance therapy. Triple intrathecal medication was given 13 times in NHR patients, 15 times in HR patients (17 times for patients with initial CNS involvement). No patient received cranial irradiation. Maintenance therapy was given until 109 weeks for all patients and consisted of mercaptopurine and methotrexate for 5 weeks, alternated with dexamethasone and vincristine for 2 weeks. Kaplan-Meier analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis with event-free survival as the primary endpoint. This trial is registered at trialregister.nl, number NTR460/SNWLK-ALL-9. FINDINGS: 859 patients were recruited to the study. Complete remission was achieved in 592 (98.5%) of the 601 patients in the NHR group and 250 (96.9%) of the 258 in the HR group. Five patients in the NHR group and four in the HR group died during induction. Median follow-up for patients alive was 72.2 (range 4.8-132.7) months as of August, 2008. 5-year event-free survival was 81% (SE 1%) in all patients: 84% (2%) in NHR patients, and 72% (3%) in HR patients. Isolated CNS relapses occurred in 22 (2.6%) of 842 patients. In a multivariate analysis, DNA index was the strongest predictor of outcome (<1.16 vs >or=1.16; relative risk 0.42, 95% CI 0.22-0.78), followed by age (1-9 vs >or=10 years; 2.23, 1.60-3.11) and white-blood-cell count (<50,000 vs >or=50,000 cells per microL; 1.60, 1.13-2.26). INTERPRETATION: The overall results of the dexamethasone-based DCOG ALL-9 protocol are better than those of our previous Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster-based protocols ALL-7 and ALL-8. The results for NHR patients were achieved with high cumulative doses of dexamethasone and vincristine, but without the use of anthracyclines, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, or cranial irradiation, therefore minimising the risk of side-effects.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1991 to 1998, 785 patients were randomized. The HD-CPB and ID-CPB arms were balanced regarding patient characteristics. The HD-CPB and ID-CPB arms were compared on the probability of RT initiation, interruption, modification, or incompleteness. The impact of clinical variables and interactions between variables were also assessed. RESULTS: Radiotherapy was initiated in 82% (325 of 394) of HD-CPB vs. 92% (360 of 391) of ID-CPB patients (p = 0.001). On multivariate analyses, RT was less likely given to patients who were randomized to HD treatment (odds ratio [OR] = 0 .38, p < 0.001), older (p = 0.005), African American (p = 0.003), postmastectomy (p = 0.02), or estrogen receptor positive (p = 0.03). High-dose treatment had a higher rate of RT interruption (21% vs. 12%, p = 0.001, OR = 2.05), modification (29% vs. 14%, p = 0.001, OR = 2.46), and early termination of RT (9% vs. 2%, p = 0.0001, OR = 5.35), compared with ID. CONCLUSION: Treatment arm significantly related to initiation, interruption, modification, and early termination of RT. Patients randomized to HD-CPB were less likely to initiate RT, and of those who did, they were more likely to have RT interrupted, modified, and terminated earlier than those randomized to ID-CPB. The observed lower incidence of RT usage in African Americans vs. non-African Americans warrants further study.","['Marks, Lawrence B', 'Cirrincione, Constance', 'Fitzgerald, Thomas J', 'Laurie, Frances', 'Glicksman, Arvin S', 'Vredenburgh, James', 'Prosnitz, Leonard R', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Crump, Michael', 'Richardson, Paul G', 'Schuster, Michael W', 'Ma, Jinli', 'Peterson, Bercedis L', 'Norton, Larry', 'Seagren, Steven', 'Henderson, I Craig', 'Hurd, David D', 'Peters, William P']","['Marks LB', 'Cirrincione C', 'Fitzgerald TJ', 'Laurie F', 'Glicksman AS', 'Vredenburgh J', 'Prosnitz LR', 'Shpall EJ', 'Crump M', 'Richardson PG', 'Schuster MW', 'Ma J', 'Peterson BL', 'Norton L', 'Seagren S', 'Henderson IC', 'Hurd DD', 'Peters WP']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7512, USA. marks@med.unc.edu']",['eng'],"['CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA029511/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA14028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77202/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42777/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA047577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA032291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077202/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA003927-42/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA014028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA29511/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA042777/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946-18/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA003927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090909,United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'CAF protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/ethnology/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Canada', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Radiotherapy Dosage']",2009/09/15 06:00,2010/04/15 06:00,['2009/09/15 06:00'],"['2008/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/03 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0360-3016(09)00575-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.04.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Apr;76(5):1305-13. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.04.013.

To determine if LtxA could be used as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of WBC diseases, we tested the in vitro and in vivo anti-leukemia activity of the toxin. LtxA kills human malignant WBC lines and primary leukemia cells from acute myeloid leukemia patients, but healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are relatively resistant to LtxA-mediated cytotoxicity. Levels of LFA-1 on cell lines correlated with killing by LtxA and the toxin preferentially killed cells expressing the activated form of LFA-1. In a SCID mouse model for human leukemia, LtxA had potent therapeutic value resulting in long-term survival in LtxA-treated mice. Intravenous infusion of LtxA into a rhesus macaque resulted in a drop in WBC counts at early times post-infusion; however, red blood cells, platelets, hemoglobin and blood chemistry values remained unaffected. Thus, LtxA may be an effective and safe novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of hematologic malignancies.","['Kachlany, Scott C', 'Schwartz, Amy B', 'Balashova, Nataliya V', 'Hioe, Catarina E', 'Tuen, Michael', 'Le, Amy', 'Kaur, Manpreet', 'Mei, Yongyi', 'Rao, Jia']","['Kachlany SC', 'Schwartz AB', 'Balashova NV', 'Hioe CE', 'Tuen M', 'Le A', 'Kaur M', 'Mei Y', 'Rao J']","['Department of Oral Biology, New Jersey Dental School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark, NJ 07103, USA. kachlasc@umdnj.edu']",['eng'],"['RR020141-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE016133-05/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 DE017828/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE16133/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', '1F32DE017828-01/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE016133/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'C06 RR020141/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'C06 RR015459/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P51 RR000167/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'RR15459-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090910,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Hemolysin Proteins)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (lktA protein, bacteria)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bacterial Proteins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Bacterial Toxins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hemolysin Proteins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Leukocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*metabolism', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Protein Binding', 'Substrate Specificity']",2009/09/15 06:00,2010/06/09 06:00,['2009/09/15 06:00'],"['2009/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/17 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00429-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.08.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Jun;34(6):777-85. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.08.022.

This study sought to determine the annual long-term mortality rates of allogeneic and autologous HCT recipients who had survived 5 years or more disease-free posttransplant and calculate their relative survival rates. Patients were included if they had a first allogeneic or syngeneic HCT for acute leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), or autologous HCT for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or lymphoma in Australia or New Zealand between 1992 and 2001, recorded on the Australasian Bone Marrow Transplant Recipient Registry (ABMTRR) database, and were known to have survived, disease free, 5 years or more posttransplant. The annual mortality rates of 5-year transplant survivors were compared to standard Australian and New Zealand populations using relative survival. A total of 1461 HCT survivors (688 postallograft, 773 postautograft) were included in this study. The 10-year survival probability for 5-year allograft survivors was slightly higher than that of 5-year autologous survivors (93.4% versus 89.6%, P=.06). The relative survival of both allogeneic and autologous 5-year survivors was never <97% of that of the general population. However, it was statistically significantly lower than expected in the sixth to ninth years posttransplant, with no obvious pattern of either improvement or deterioration from 6 to 10 years posttransplant. This study indicates that annual relative survival rates of long-term survivors of allogeneic HCT performed in Australia and New Zealand for acute lymophoblastic leukemkia (ALL), AML, CML, and MDS are slightly, but significantly lower than population rates in the 6th to 10th years posttransplant. Annual relative survival rates of long-term survivors of autologous HCT performed in Australia and New Zealand for AML and lymphomas are also slightly lower than population rates up to the 10th year posttransplant. Late deaths from transplant and disease-related causes are unusual, but continue to occur for many years post-HCT.","['Nivison-Smith, Ian', 'Simpson, Judy M', 'Dodds, Anthony J', 'Ma, David D F', 'Szer, Jeff', 'Bradstock, Kenneth F']","['Nivison-Smith I', 'Simpson JM', 'Dodds AJ', 'Ma DD', 'Szer J', 'Bradstock KF']","['ABMTRR, Darlinghurst NSW, Australia. inivisonsmith@stvincents.com.au']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090803,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Australia', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*mortality/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'New Zealand', '*Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2009/09/15 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/15 06:00'],"['2009/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(09)00298-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.06.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2009 Oct;15(10):1323-30. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.06.014.

We performed a retrospective analysis on 45 patients aged 21 to 73 years (median 51 years) with de novo AML who underwent APBSCT stratified by age, complete remission status, and cytogenetic risk. The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) for all patients was 33.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20.1%-53.7%) and overall survival (OS) was 43.6% (CI, 29.2%-62.8%).

The DFS and OS of these patients are comparable to the historic survival of those who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation when adjusted by age. In addition, there was no treatment-related mortality (TRM).

METHODS: The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2009), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (from 1970 to January 2009), MEDLINE (from 1978 to October 2008), EMBASE (from 1950 to March 2009), Chinese Biological Medical Literature Database (from 1978 to December 2008), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI, from 1994 to December 2008), and China Medical Academic Conference Database (from 1994 to December 2008) were electronically searched. We also searched the Meta-Register of controlled trials, Conference Proceedings of American Society of Hematology (from 1946 to December 2008) and Conference Proceedings of American Society of Clinical Oncology (from 1946 to December 2008) on the internet for grey literature. The related journals in the library of Third Military Medical University were hand-searched. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ATO in treatment of APL were included. We adopted complete remission, overall survival rate, disease free survival rate, time to complete remission, relapse rate, mortality and adverse reactions as outcome indicators. Data were entered and analyzed with the Cochrane review manager software 5.0 (RevMan 5.0). RESULTS: After merger of the included trials, five eligible RCTs with 328 cases were included. All the RCTs focused on the comparison of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) plus ATO regimen with ATRA monotherapy. Meta-analysis showed that the effect indexes for time to complete remission, two-year disease free survival rate, relapse rate, incidence of edema and incidence rate of QT interval prolongation were -1.20 [-1.68, -0.72], 8.64 [1.66,45.00], 0.21 [0.09,0.47], 4.16 [1.46,11.79] and 22.10 [2.75,177.49], respectively. The influences on other outcome indicators such as complete remission and leukocytosis were statistically non-significant. CONCLUSION: ATO can prolong disease free survival and reduce the time to complete remission and relapse rate of newly diagnosed APL patients, and increase the incidence of edema and prolongation of corrected QT interval during the treatment. Due to limitation of the included trials, this conclusion needs to be validated by further studies.","['Xu, Shuang-nian', 'Chen, Jie-ping', 'Liu, Jian-ping', 'Xia, Yun']","['Xu SN', 'Chen JP', 'Liu JP', 'Xia Y']","['Center for Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.']",['chi'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,China,Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Xue Bao,Zhong xi yi jie he xue bao = Journal of Chinese integrative medicine,101199657,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use']",2009/09/15 06:00,2016/02/14 06:00,['2009/09/15 06:00'],"['2009/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['jcim20090901 [pii]', '10.3736/jcim20090901 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Xue Bao. 2009 Sep;7(9):801-8. doi: 10.3736/jcim20090901.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Novel anti-leukaemic compounds comprised of chloro-amino-phenyl naphthoquinones with substitutions on the benzoic ring were developed. Structure-activity relationship studies indicated that the analogue with both methyl and amine substitutions (named TW-92) was the most efficient in killing leukaemic cells. Treatment of U-937 promonocytic cells with TW-92 induced apoptotic or necrotic cell death, dependent on incubation and dose conditions. TW-92 induced rapid phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38(MAPK)) and of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2). The generation of apoptosis was preceded by intracellular H(2)O(2) accumulation accompanied by glutathione depletion, the former inhibited by di-phenyl-iodonium (DPI), an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase. TW-92 induced swelling of isolated rat liver mitochondria, indicative of a direct effect on mitochondria. Apoptosis in intact cells was accompanied by a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release and caspase activation. In addition, the level of Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic regulatory protein, was down-regulated, whereas the expression of the pro-apoptotic BAX was elevated. Finally, TW-92 exerted strong pro-apoptotic and necrotic effects in primary acute myeloid leukaemia samples when given in submicromolar concentrations. Together, these findings demonstrate that TW-92 may provide an effective anti-leukaemic strategy.","['Hallak, Maher', 'Win, Thida', 'Shpilberg, Ofer', 'Bittner, Shmuel', 'Granot, Yosef', 'Levy, Itai', 'Nathan, Ilana']","['Hallak M', 'Win T', 'Shpilberg O', 'Bittner S', 'Granot Y', 'Levy I', 'Nathan I']","['Institute of Haematology, Soroka University Medical Centre, Beer-Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090831,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (2-chloro-3-(3-amino-4-methyl-phenylamino)-1,4-naphthoquinone)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Naphthoquinones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'U937 Cells', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2009/09/15 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2009/09/15 06:00'],"['2009/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7867 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07867.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Nov;147(4):459-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07867.x.

No patient died from treatment-related complications. The most common adverse events were febrile neutropenia, mucositis and reversible liver toxicity; no case of liver veno-occlusive disease was reported. The overall remission rate was 56%: 13 patients (52%) achieved complete remission (CR) and one (4%) CR without platelet recovery (CRp). In seven of the 13 (54%) patients achieving CR, remissions were of sufficient duration to allow patients to receive allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

The pharmacodynamic activity of Hsp90 inhibitors in the clinic is currently assessed by Hsp70 induction in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using Western blot analysis, a method that is laborious, semiquantitative and difficult to implement in the clinic. Since Hsp70 was reported to be secreted by tumour cells and elevated in sera of cancer patients, serum Hsp70 has been evaluated as a potentially more robust, easily and reproducibly measured biomarker of Hsp90 inhibition as an alternative to cytosolic Hsp70. A highly sensitive and specific electrochemiluminescent ELISA was developed to measure serum Hsp70 and employed to evaluate Hsp70 levels in both ex vivo and xenograft samples. In ex vivo studies, maximal secretion of Hsp70 by tumour cells was observed between 48 and 72 h after exposure to Hsp90 inhibitors. In in vivo studies a 3-4-fold increase in serum Hsp70 was observed following treatment with BIIB021 in tumour-bearing mice. Strikingly, secreted Hsp70 was detectable in mice transplanted with human tumours but not in naive mice indicating a direct origination from the transplanted tumours. Analysis of clinical samples revealed low baseline levels (2 - 15 ng ml(-1)) of Hsp70 in the serum of cancer patients and normal donors. Together these findings in laboratory studies and archived cancer patient sera suggest that serum Hsp70 could be a novel biomarker to assess reliably the pharmacological effects of Hsp90 inhibitors in clinical trials, especially under conditions where collection of tumour biopsies is not feasible.","['Dakappagari, Naveen', 'Neely, Laura', 'Tangri, Shabnam', 'Lundgren, Karen', 'Hipolito, Lori', 'Estrellado, Annalee', 'Burrows, Francis', 'Zhang, Hong']","['Dakappagari N', 'Neely L', 'Tangri S', 'Lundgren K', 'Hipolito L', 'Estrellado A', 'Burrows F', 'Zhang H']","['Department of Clinical Sciences, Biogen Idec, San Diego, CA 92122, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Biomarkers,"Biomarkers : biochemical indicators of exposure, response, and susceptibility to chemicals",9606000,"['0 (6-chloro-9-(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethylpyridin-2-ylmethyl)-9H-purin-2-ylamine)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Pyridines)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*blood', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Pharmacokinetics', 'Pyridines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2009/09/15 06:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2009/09/15 06:00'],"['2009/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/13547500903261347 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomarkers. 2010 Feb;15(1):31-8. doi: 10.3109/13547500903261347.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These gammadelta+ T cells were V81+CD3+CD4-CD8-CD69+HLADR+ and are cytotoxic to K562 cells. METHODS: In order to determine whether the anti-alphabeta TCD regimen was associated with these findings, we compared the reconstitution of gammadelta+ T cells from patients who received TCD PMRD grafts using the anti-TCRc4 MAb TIOB9-1A31 (previously reported) with similar patients who received grafts using the anti-CD3 MAb OKT3. RESULTS: Increased cytotoxic Vdelta1+ T cells were seen in 10 of 43 T10B9 TCD patients compared to 7 of 100 in the OKT3 TCD group (23% versus 7%, p = 0.010). T10B9 patients with increased gammadelta+ T cells also exhibited a higher range of increased gammadelta+ T cells and the length of time the gammadelta+ T cells remained high was longer when compared to OKT3 patients. Patients with increased gammadelta+ T cells whose grafts were T-cell depleted with T10B9 showed a significant decrease in relapse (p = 0.038). Similar rates and reduction in relapse were seen in OKT3 TCD patients, although significance was not reached due to the small number of patients with increased gammadelta+ T cells. Estimated 3 year disease-free survival was significantly improved in T10B9 patients with increased gammadelta+ T cells (0.79 versus 0.31, p = 0.009), a trend also seen in OKT3 patients (p = 0.091). DISCUSSION: These observations indicate that Vdelta1+CD4-CD8-cytotoxic T cells are associated with lower relapse rates and improved survival, and thus may have a role in a graft-versus-leukemia effect.","['Lamb, L S Jr', 'Gee, A P', 'Hazlett, L J', 'Musk, P', 'Parrish, R S', ""O'Hanlon, T P"", 'Geier, S S', 'Folk, R S', 'Harris, W G', 'McPherson, K', 'Lee, C', 'Henslee-Downey, P J']","['Lamb LS Jr', 'Gee AP', 'Hazlett LJ', 'Musk P', 'Parrish RS', ""O'Hanlon TP"", 'Geier SS', 'Folk RS', 'Harris WG', 'McPherson K', 'Lee C', 'Henslee-Downey PJ']","['Division of Transplantation Medicine, Palmetto Richland Memorial Hospital, Center for Cancer Treatment and Research, University of South Carolina School of Medicine, Columbia, South Carolina 29203, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Transfusion/methods', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Young Adult']",1999/01/01 00:00,2009/10/24 06:00,['2009/09/15 06:00'],"['2009/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '1999/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S1465-3249(99)70003-4 [pii]', '10.1080/0032472031000141295 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 1999;1(1):7-19. doi: 10.1080/0032472031000141295.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cytotherapy. 1999;1(4):360'],,,,

It is also the purpose to propose a limited sampling strategy (LSS) for the estimation of the time above the threshold (0.2 micromol.L(-1)). A total 82 patients with lymphoid malignancy were involved in the study. A pharmacokinetic model was developed using nonlinear mixed-effect model. The influence of demographic characteristics, biological factors, and concurrent administration were investigated. The final predictive performance was validated by bootstrap and cross-validation. Bayesian estimation was evaluated. The pharmacokinetics of HD-MTX was described by a two-compartment model. The pharmacokinetic parameters and the inter-individual variability were as follows: the clearance CL, 7.45 L.h(-1) (inter-individual variability 50.6%), the volume of the central and peripheral compartment V(1), 25.9 L (22.5%), V(2), 9.23 L (97.8%), respectively, and the intercompartmental clearance Q, 0.333 L.h(-1) (70.4%). The influence of serum creatinine on CL and weight on V(1) was retained in the final model. The protocol involved one sampling time at 44 h after the start of the infusion, allowing one to predict the time at which the MTX concentration reached the expected threshold (0.2 micromol.L(-1)). Serum creatinine and weight showed significant influence on methotrexate CL and V(1), respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The incidence of cancer during 2002 was calculated on the basis of the information available from the National Cancer Incidence Database. Crude and age-standardized rates were calculated by gender for 18 age groups (0 approximately 4, 5 approximately 9, 10 approximately 14, every five years, 85 years and over). RESULTS: The overall crude incidence rates (CRs) were 269.2 and 212.8 per 100,000 for males and females, and the overall age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) were 287.8 and 172.9 per 100,000, respectively. Among males, the five leading primary cancer sites were stomach (CR 62.4, ASR 65.7), lung (CR 45.4, ASR 51.0), liver (CR 43.2, ASR 43.7), colon and rectum (CR 30.7, ASR 32.7), and prostate (CR 8.0, ASR 9.6). Among females, the most common cancer sites were breast (CR 33.1, ASR 26.9), followed by stomach (CR 32.8, ASR 26.0), colon and rectum (CR 23.1, ASR 18.5), thyroid (CR 19.1, ASR 15.7), and uterine cervix (CR 18.2, ASR 14.7). In the 0~14 age group, leukemia was the most common cancer for both genders. For males, stomach cancer was the most common cancer in the 15 approximately 64 age-group, but lung cancer was more frequent in men 65 or older. For females, thyroid cancer among the 15 approximately 34 age-group, breast cancer among 35 approximately 64 age-group and stomach cancer in women 65 years or older were the most common forms of cancer for each age group. The quality indices for the percentage of deaths, by death certificate only, were 4.7% for males and 4.5% for females. CONCLUSIONS: Since the National Cancer Incidence Database was started, the annual percent change of cancer cases increased by 4.8% (4.1% for males, 5.7% for females) during 1999 approximately 2002. This value reflects the increase in prostate cancer for males and breast and thyroid cancer in females during 2002. The timely reporting of improved quality of cancer registration is needed for evidence-based decisions regarding cancer control in Korea.","['Shin, Hai-Rim', 'Jung, Kyu-Won', 'Won, Young-Joo', 'Kong, Hyun-Joo', 'Yim, Seon-Hee', 'Sung, Joohon', 'Seo, Sun-Won', 'Kim, Ki-Young', 'Lee, Sang-Yi', 'Kong, In-Sik', 'Hwang, In Kyoung', 'Lee, Choong Won', 'Woo, Ze-Hong', 'Lee, Tae-Yong', 'Choi, Jin-Su', 'Yoo, Cheol-In', 'Bae, Jong-Myon', 'Yoo, Keun-Young']","['Shin HR', 'Jung KW', 'Won YJ', 'Kong HJ', 'Yim SH', 'Sung J', 'Seo SW', 'Kim KY', 'Lee SY', 'Kong IS', 'Hwang IK', 'Lee CW', 'Woo ZH', 'Lee TY', 'Choi JS', 'Yoo CI', 'Bae JM', 'Yoo KY']","['Korea Central Cancer Registry, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea. hrshin@ncc.re.kr']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20071231,Korea (South),Cancer Res Treat,Cancer research and treatment,101155137,,,,2007/12/01 00:00,2007/12/01 00:01,['2009/09/12 06:00'],"['2007/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2007/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.4143/crt.2007.39.4.139 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Res Treat. 2007 Dec;39(4):139-49. doi: 10.4143/crt.2007.39.4.139.

The data consist of sequences of indicators for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and involve three nested levels of repetition: chromosomes for a given patient, regions within chromosomes, and SNPs nested within regions. We propose to analyze these data using a semiparametric model for multi-level repeated binary data. At the top level of the hierarchy we assume a sampling model for the observed binary LOH sequences that arises from a partial exchangeability argument. This implies a mixture of Markov chains model. The mixture is defined with respect to the Markov transition probabilities. We assume a nonparametric prior for the random mixing measure. The resulting model takes the form of a semiparametric random effects model with the matrix of transition probabilities being the random effects. The model includes appropriate dependence assumptions for the two remaining levels of the hierarchy, i.e., for regions within chromosomes and for chromosomes within patient. We use the model to identify regions of increased LOH in a dataset coming from a study of treatment-related leukemia in children with an initial cancer diagnostic. The model successfully identifies the desired regions and performs well compared to other available alternatives.","['Quintana, Fernando A', 'Muller, Peter', 'Rosner, Gary L', 'Relling, Mary V']","['Quintana FA', 'Muller P', 'Rosner GL', 'Relling MV']","['Departamento de Estadistica, Facultad de Matematicas, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Casilla 306, Correo 22, Santiago, CHILE.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA075981/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA075981-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM061393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM061393-09/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J R Stat Soc Ser C Appl Stat,"Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

The aim of this study was to determine the optimal dose of CI and the appropriate length of cell culture required for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and to evaluate the limitations associated with CI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To generate leukemic DCs, leukemic cells (4x10(6) cells) from six AML patients were cultured with various concentrations of CI and/or IL-4 for 1, 2 or 3 days. RESULTS: Potent leukemic DCs were successfully generated from all AML patients, with an average number of 1.2x10(6) cells produced in the presence of CI (270 ng/ml) for 2 days. Several surface molecules were clearly upregulated in AML cells supplemented with CI and IL-4, but not CD11c. Leukemic DCs cultured with CI had a higher allogeneic T cell stimulatory capacity than untreated AML cells, but the addition of IL-4 did not augment the MLR activity of these cells. AML cells cultured with CI in the presence or absence of IL-4 showed increased levels of apoptosis in comparison to primary cultures of AML cells. CONCLUSION: Although CI appears to be advantageous in terms of time and cost effectiveness, the results of the present study suggest that the marked induction of apoptosis by CI limits its application to the generation of DCs from AML cells.","['Nguyen Pham, Thanh-Nhan', 'Choi, Bo-Hwa', 'Kang, Hyun-Kyu', 'Jin, Chun-Chi', 'Minh, Nguyen Hoang Tuyet', 'Kim, Sang-Ki', 'Nam, Jong-Hee', 'Yang, Deok-Hwan', 'Kim, Yeo-Kyeoung', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon', 'Chung, Ik-Joo', 'Lee, Je-Jung']","['Nguyen Pham TN', 'Choi BH', 'Kang HK', 'Jin CC', 'Minh NH', 'Kim SK', 'Nam JH', 'Yang DH', 'Kim YK', 'Kim HJ', 'Chung IJ', 'Lee JJ']","['Clinical Vaccine R&D Center, Chonnam National University, Hwasun, Jeollanado, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20071231,Korea (South),Cancer Res Treat,Cancer research and treatment,101155137,,,,2007/12/01 00:00,2007/12/01 00:01,['2009/09/12 06:00'],"['2007/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2007/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.4143/crt.2007.39.4.175 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Res Treat. 2007 Dec;39(4):175-80. doi: 10.4143/crt.2007.39.4.175.

We showed here that high levels of SnoN exert anti-oncogenic activity by inducing senescence. SnoN interacts with the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein and is recruited to the PML nuclear bodies where it stabilizes p53, leading to premature senescence. Furthermore, overexpression of SnoN inhibits oncogenic transformation induced by Ras and Myc in vitro and significantly blocks papilloma development in vivo in a carcinogen-induced skin tumourigenesis model. The few papillomas that were developed displayed high levels of senescence and spontaneously regressed.

It has become the best curable subtype of acute leukemias in adults due to the inclusion of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in the treatment. Despite the efficacy of ATRA, chemotherapy must be added in APL patients in order to maintain durable complete remission. However, chemotherapy administration is inevitably related to many complications, including the risk of secondary malignancies. T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) is an infrequent disease that belongs to the group of highly aggressive lymphomas. CASE REPORT: The authors describe the case of a 25-year-old woman who was treated for APL in 2002 and developed precursor T-LBL 5 years later. CONCLUSION: Several cases of secondary acute lymphoblastic leukemias in 'cured' APL patients have been described, but probably no patient with secondary precursor T-LBL. Secondary malignancy has become one of the topics discussed (not only) in APL patients. It is apparently related to the excellent treatment outcomes and long-term survival. Better tailored treatment based on relevant prognostic factors allowing chemotherapy reduction or omission in some patients is needed.","['Szotkowski, Tomas', 'Jarosova, Marie', 'Faber, Edgar', 'Hubacek, Jaromir', 'Hlusi, Antonin', 'Papajik, Tomas', 'Pikalova, Zuzana', 'Kucerova, Ladislava', 'Holzerova, Milena', 'Budikova, Miroslava', 'Buriankova, Eva', 'Plachy, Radek', 'Potomkova, Jarmila', 'Klusova, Natalie', 'Szotkowska, Romana', 'Indrak, Karel']","['Szotkowski T', 'Jarosova M', 'Faber E', 'Hubacek J', 'Hlusi A', 'Papajik T', 'Pikalova Z', 'Kucerova L', 'Holzerova M', 'Budikova M', 'Buriankova E', 'Plachy R', 'Potomkova J', 'Klusova N', 'Szotkowska R', 'Indrak K']","['Department of Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic. tszotkowski@seznam.cz']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090723,Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*complications/*therapy', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*etiology/prevention & control']",2009/09/12 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/12 06:00'],"['2009/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['000226584 [pii]', '10.1159/000226584 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2009 Sep;32(8-9):513-5. doi: 10.1159/000226584.

In this study, we describe the characteristics of patients with hematological malignancies who were evaluated for suspected infection. This study was also conducted to assess the isolation rate of bacterial and fungal causative agents in febrile neutropenic attacks. METHOD: The study was conducted at Pamukkale University Hospital, Turkey. In order to identify the characteristics of patients with hematological malignancies in the presence/suspicion of any accompanying infectious disease, patients' charts with hematological malignancies were reviewed for signs/symptoms of any infection between October 1, 2001, and May 31, 2005, retrospectively. RESULTS: Overall, 90 infectious episodes occurred in 59 patients. The most common underlying diseases were acute myelogenous leukemia (61.0%) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (15.3%). The absolute neutrophil count was lower than 100/mm(3) in 33 (36.7%) episodes. Microbiologically and clinically documented infections and fever of unknown origin were observed in 35.6%, 28.9%, and 35.6% of the participants, respectively. Bloodstream infections and pneumonia were detected in 21.1% and 18.9% of episodes, respectively. Gram negative organisms were most common (58.4%), followed by gram positive cocci. A combination of third generation cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside were used in 44.4% of episodes initially. Fever resolved in 24.4% of episodes using the initial therapy. The mortality rate was 15.6%. CONCLUSION: These results showed that infections with gram-negative bacteria continue to predominate in febrile neutopenic episodes in our center.","['Sacar, Suzan', 'Hacioglu, Sibel Kabukcu', 'Keskin, Ali', 'Turgut, Huseyin']","['Sacar S', 'Hacioglu SK', 'Keskin A', 'Turgut H']","['Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Pamukkale University Faculty of Medicine, Kinikli, Denizli, Turkey. suzansacar@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20081001,Italy,J Infect Dev Ctries,Journal of infection in developing countries,101305410,,IM,"['*Academic Medical Centers', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Fever/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Gram-Negative Aerobic Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/epidemiology/etiology/physiopathology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/epidemiology/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Turkey/epidemiology']",2008/01/01 00:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/12 06:00'],"['2007/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3855/jidc.197 [doi]'],epublish,J Infect Dev Ctries. 2008 Oct 1;2(5):359-63. doi: 10.3855/jidc.197.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conditional disruption of postnatal Nanos2 depleted spermatogonial stem cell reserves, whereas mouse testes in which Nanos2 had been overexpressed accumulated spermatogonia with undifferentiated, stem cell-like properties. Thus, NANOS2 is a key stem cell regulator that is expressed in self-renewing spermatogonial stem cells and maintains the stem cell state during murine spermatogenesis.","['Sada, Aiko', 'Suzuki, Atsushi', 'Suzuki, Hitomi', 'Saga, Yumiko']","['Sada A', 'Suzuki A', 'Suzuki H', 'Saga Y']","['Department of Genetics, SOKENDAI, 1111 Yata, Mishima, Shizuoka 411-8540, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Gfra1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nanos2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nanos3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Neurog3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Spermatogenesis', 'Spermatogonia/*cytology/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Testis/cytology/metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers']",2009/09/12 06:00,2009/09/24 06:00,['2009/09/12 06:00'],"['2009/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['325/5946/1394 [pii]', '10.1126/science.1172645 [doi]']",ppublish,Science. 2009 Sep 11;325(5946):1394-8. doi: 10.1126/science.1172645.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most patients were seeking relapsed/refractory trials, representing a poor-prognosis population. VH4-34, a gene commonly used in autoimmune disorders, was observed in 8 (40%) HCLv and 6 (10%) classic (P = .004) HCL patients. Compared with 71 VH4-34(-) rearrangements, 14 VH4-34(+) rearrangements were more frequently (P < .001) unmutated, defined as greater than 98% homologous to germline sequence. VH4-34(+) patients had greater white blood cell counts at diagnosis (P = .002), lower response rate (P < .001) and progression-free survival (P = .007) after initial cladribine, and shorter overall survival from diagnosis (P < .001). Response and survival were more closely related to VH4-34 status than to whether or not patients had HCLv. VH4-34(+) HCL is an important disorder that only partly overlaps with the previously described HCLv.

These transcripts are degraded by the nonsense-mediated decay pathway and have a very short half-life. We used a microarray technique to screen for genes that up-regulate their RNA signal upon nonsense-mediated decay pathway blockade in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) specimens and identified an E-cadherin transcript with PTC. Sequencing revealed an aberrant E-cadherin transcript lacking exon 11, resulting in a frameshift and PTC. The aberrant E-cadherin transcript was also identified in normal B cells, but occurred at a much lower level compared with CLL cells. In CLL specimens, E-cadherin expression was depressed more than 50% in 62% cases (relative to normal B cells). By real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, the relative amounts of wild-type transcript inversely correlated with amounts of aberrant transcript (P = .018). Ectopic expression of E-cadherin in CLL specimens containing high amounts of aberrant transcript resulted in down-regulation of the wnt-beta-catenin pathway reporter, a pathway known to be up-regulated in CLL. Our data point to a novel mechanism of E-cadherin gene inactivation, with CLL cells displaying a higher proportion of aberrant nonfunctional transcripts and resulting up-regulation of the wnt-beta-catenin pathway.","['Sharma, Sanjai', 'Lichtenstein, Alan']","['Sharma S', 'Lichtenstein A']","['Division of Hematology Oncology, University of California-West Los Angeles Veterans Administration Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90073, USA. sasharma@mednet.ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 CA096920/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA111448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA111448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA96920/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090910,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Codon, Nonsense)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (RNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (UPF1 protein, human)', 'X8D5EPO80M (Emetine)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cadherins/*genetics', 'Codon, Nonsense', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Emetine/pharmacology', 'Frameshift Mutation', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA Helicases', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Wnt Proteins/metabolism', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",2009/09/12 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/12 06:00'],"['2009/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38983-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-03-206482 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Nov 5;114(19):4179-85. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-03-206482.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small regulatory ncRNAs, are involved in the pathogenesis of all types of human cancers, including leukemias, mainly via dysregulation of expression of cancer genes. Increasing evidence shows that miRNAs can work as tumor suppressors (inhibiting malignant potential) or oncogenes (activating malignant potential). Researchers first identified this new paradigm of molecular oncology in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Understanding the roles of miRNAs and other ncRNAs in leukemic cells is not only uncovering a new layer of gene regulation but also providing new markers for improved diagnosis and prognosis, as well as novel therapeutic options for CLL patients. Herein we focus on the roles of miRNAs and ultraconserved ncRNA genes in CLL, highlighting what is already known about their function, proposing a novel model of CLL predisposition and progression, and describing the challenges for the near future.","['Calin, George A', 'Croce, Carlo M']","['Calin GA', 'Croce CM']","['Departments of Experimental Therapeutics and Cancer Genetics, The University of Texas M.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: By linking of The Cancer Register of Norway and The Norwegian Arthroplasty Register we obtained information on cancer diagnoses (type, date of diagnosis), total hip arthroplasties and date of death for all patients living in Norway. This includes 741,901 patients categorized into three groups: 652,197 patients with at least one cancer diagnosis but no hip arthroplasties, 72,469 patients with at least one hip arthroplasty but no cancer diagnosis and 17,235 patients who have at least one cancer diagnosis and at least one hip arthroplasty. Within this latter group, 8563 individuals had been diagnosed with cancer prior to a total hip arthroplasty. Statistical methods applied in this study were Cox interval censored regression models and standardized incidence ratios (SIR). RESULTS: Cancer patients had a slightly increased risk of receiving a total hip arthroplasty compared to the Norwegian population (SIR=1.15 (95% CI, 1.12-1.17)). For primary tumours located cranially to the pelvic area there was no significant increase in risk for hip arthroplasty. An exception was breast cancer (SIR=1.13 (95% CI 1.08-1.18)). Cancer located in the pelvic region (SIR=1.20 (95% CI 1.16-1.24)), malignant lymphoma (SIR=1.30 (95% CI 1.15-1.46)) and leukaemia (SIR=1.17 (95% CI 1.01-1.34)) had an increased risk for receiving a total hip arthroplasty.

We identified three bands of increasing distance from the MWI, up to a radius of 5 km and used the residence as surrogate marker of the exposure. Residential history for Modena's population was reconstructed and residents were associated to the most appropriate census unit. Age-standardized incidence ratios (ASR) and standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were estimated for all cancers and selected sites. Variations in cancer incidence were investigated using space and space-time scan statistic. Deprivation index was taken into account as potential confounding factor. During the 15-year study period, 16,443 new cases of cancer were diagnosed among residents in Modena. The space-time clustering test identified three significant clusters but their shapes were not associable to the MWI exposition. The purely spatial analysis not showed statistically significant clusters. The SIR computed for all cancers and selected sites did not show any excess of risk in the area closest to the plant. Higher SIR for leukaemia was found in the second band from MWI (2-3.5 km) for females (SIR, age and DI adjusted: 1.35, 95%CI: 1.01-1.79) and for both sexes (SIR, age and DI adjusted: 1.28, 95%CI: 1.03-1.57), but not a spatial trend was observed, thus excluding a possible link with MWI.

Considering the high relapse rates posttransplant in these selected patients, several studies evaluated posttransplant use of the TKI imatinib. Although the number of studies are still limited, and data have to be confirmed by additional studies, safety of imatinib even within the first months after SCT seems to be acceptable. Imatinib was shown to be effective in patients with molecular or hematologic relapse of chronic or accelerated phase posttransplant (CP, AP), whereas outcomes in blast phase were more unfavorable. The compound further seemed beneficial for prophylactic use in patients who achieved complete remission posttransplant. The combination of imatinib with donor lymphocytes did not result in increased toxicity or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). First studies suggest that second-generation TKIs such as dasatinib or nilotinib are manageable posttransplant with acceptable toxicity as well. In conclusion, TKIs of the first- and second-generation are promising options for the posttransplant period of patients with CML, but algorithms for dosage, intervals from SCT, duration of application, and the combination with donor lymphocytes still have to be developed.","['Klyuchnikov, Evgeny', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Wiedemann, Bettina', 'Zander, Axel Rolf', 'Bacher, Ulrike']","['Klyuchnikov E', 'Kroger N', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Wiedemann B', 'Zander AR', 'Bacher U']","['Interdisciplinary Clinic for Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090908,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Stem Cell Transplantation']",2009/09/12 06:00,2010/05/29 06:00,['2009/09/12 06:00'],"['2009/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(09)00400-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.08.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2010 Mar;16(3):301-10. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.08.019.

We analyzed the outcome and prognostic factors of 49 adults with high-risk acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) receiving single-unit CBT from unrelated donors after myeloablative (MA) conditioning at a single institution. Conditioning regimens were based on the combination of thiotepa, busulfan (Bu), cyclophospamide (Cy), or fludarabine (Flu), and antithymocyte globulin (ATG). Cumulative incidence of myeloid and platelet engraftment was 96% and 73% at a median time of 20 and 62 days, respectively. Engraftment was significantly faster for patients receiving higher doses of CD34(+) cells. Confidence Interval of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute GVHD (aGVHD) grade II-IV, III-IV, and extensive chronic GVHD (cGVHD) were 26%, 15%, and 30%, respectively. Leukemia-free survival (LFS), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), and relapse at 2 years were 42%, 39%, and 19%, respectively. Low number of total nucleated cells (TNC) had a negative impact on NRM and LFS. Patients transplanted in first complete remission (CR1) receiving TNC above 2 x 10(7)/kg had a 4-year LFS of 75%.

Small-molecule c-MPL agonists have recently been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of thrombocytopenia. However, their effects on HSCs have not yet been explored. In this study, we evaluated the effects of NR-101, a novel small-molecule c-MPL agonist, on the ex vivo expansion of human cord blood (hCB) HSCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: hCB CD34(+) or CD34(+)CD38(-) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were cultured for 7 days in the presence of thrombopoietin (TPO) or NR-101, and then subjected to flow cytometric analyses, colony-forming cell assays, and severe combined immunodeficiency-repopulating cell assays. RESULTS: During a 7-day culture of CD34(+) or CD34(+)CD38(-) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, NR-101 efficiently increased their numbers, with a greater than twofold increase compared to TPO, although its effect on megakaryocytopoiesis was comparable to that of TPO. Correspondingly, severe combined immunodeficiency-repopulating cells were increased 2.9-fold during a 7-day culture with NR-101 compared to freshly isolated CD34(+) cells, and 2.3-fold compared to that with TPO. Of note, NR-101 persistently activated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 but not signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. Furthermore, NR-101 induced a long-term accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha protein and enhanced activation of its downstream target genes. CONCLUSION: This is the first time that a small-molecule c-MPL agonist has been demonstrated to promote net expansion of HSCs. NR-101 is more efficient in ex vivo expansion of HSCs than TPO. NR-101 could be a useful tool for the therapeutic manipulation of human HSCs.","['Nishino, Taito', 'Miyaji, Katsuaki', 'Ishiwata, Norihisa', 'Arai, Kazutaka', 'Yui, Makiko', 'Asai, Yasuyuki', 'Nakauchi, Hiromitsu', 'Iwama, Atsushi']","['Nishino T', 'Miyaji K', 'Ishiwata N', 'Arai K', 'Yui M', 'Asai Y', 'Nakauchi H', 'Iwama A']","['Research Promotion and Coordination Department, Nissan Chemical Industries, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090908,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (CSF2RB protein, human)', '0 (Cytokine Receptor Common beta Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Hypoxia/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor/cytology/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/transplantation', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Cytokine Receptor Common beta Subunit/genetics/physiology', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/*agonists/genetics/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thrombopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Thrombopoietin/pharmacology']",2009/09/12 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/12 06:00'],"['2009/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00360-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2009.09.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Nov;37(11):1364-1377.e4. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2009.09.001.

(H/K)Ras are further shown to be more efficaciously glucosylated by TcsL than Rac1 in rat basophilic leukemia cells as well as in a cell-free system.","['Huelsenbeck, Stefanie C', 'Klose, Ilona', 'Reichenbach, Maria', 'Huelsenbeck, Johannes', 'Genth, Harald']","['Huelsenbeck SC', 'Klose I', 'Reichenbach M', 'Huelsenbeck J', 'Genth H']","['Institut fur Toxikologie, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, D-30625 Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090908,England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (lethal toxin LT, Clostridium sordellii)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Apoptosis', 'Bacterial Toxins/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Glycosylation', 'Rats', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/immunology/*metabolism', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",2009/09/12 06:00,2009/11/17 06:00,['2009/09/12 06:00'],"['2009/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-5793(09)00690-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.febslet.2009.09.006 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2009 Oct 6;583(19):3133-9. doi: 10.1016/j.febslet.2009.09.006.

METHODS: twenty four patients with diagnosis AML was carried out. Clinical, laboratory survey results and treatment response were studied. Nineteen patients had primary form and five secondary, attended during a period of eight years. The diagnosis was established by a highly clinical suspicious, with immunophenotype cytometry flow or/and bone biopsy with immunohistochemistry study which proves definitely AML. RESULTS: Fourteen were women, the median age was 43 years, 18 were treated with antineoplasic agents, ten obtained response, six complete and four partial. The response may improve with schemes with high dose of cytosine arabinoside. CONCLUSIONS: our results with the treatment showed that 27 % patients are alive under maintenance treatment long 18 months.

In first clinical trials, side effects of dasatinib, 140 mg daily, were reported to be mild and tolerable. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the side effect profile in 16 patients with imatinib-resistant CML who received 140 mg dasatinib daily in our center. RESULTS: Dasatinib produced substantial and sometimes severe or even life-threatening side effects with > or = 10% body weight loss (6/16 patients), pleural effusions grade II or higher (12/16) and infectious complications (12/16), including atypical infections not seen in imatinib-treated patients. One patient developed Epstein-Barr-Virus-positive mucosal leucoplakia, one died from pneumonia caused by pneumocystis carinii and three patients developed a skin-cancer. Most events were recorded within the first 2 years of therapy, only skin tumours developed after the second year. In ex vivo experiments performed in dasatinib-treated patients, transient suppression of IgE-dependent activation of blood basophils and TcR-dependent activation of T-lymphocytes was found. Moreover, in drug-binding studies, dasatinib was found to bind to several key kinase-targets of the immune system including Lyn and Btk, in mast cell, basophil, B-cell and T-cell lines. CONCLUSION: Dasatinib acts not only anti-neoplastic in CML but may also act as an immunosuppressive agent when applied at 140 mg daily, and produces frequent pleural effusions and weight loss in advanced CML.","['Sillaber, C', 'Herrmann, H', 'Bennett, K', 'Rix, U', 'Baumgartner, C', 'Bohm, A', 'Herndlhofer, S', 'Tschachler, E', 'Superti-Furga, G', 'Jager, U', 'Valent, P']","['Sillaber C', 'Herrmann H', 'Bennett K', 'Rix U', 'Baumgartner C', 'Bohm A', 'Herndlhofer S', 'Tschachler E', 'Superti-Furga G', 'Jager U', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090909,England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/drug effects/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Basophils/drug effects/immunology', 'Dasatinib', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/blood/drug effects', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proteome/analysis', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/*adverse effects']",2009/09/12 06:00,2010/05/13 06:00,['2009/09/12 06:00'],"['2009/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['ECI2206 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2362.2009.02206.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 2009 Dec;39(12):1098-109. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2362.2009.02206.x.

We hypothesized that the addition of sirolimus to a tacrolimus/methotrexate graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimen would decrease relapse after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and initiated a phase I/II study to demonstrate safety, feasibility, and efficacy. The study cohort included 18 patients in high-risk (HR) first complete remission (CR1), 16 in HR CR2, 17 in intermediate risk (IR) CR2, and 12 in CR3+. The 2-year event-free survival (EFS) of the cohort was 66% (standard error 6.4). EFS of risk groups was 74%, 81%, 44% and 46% for CR1, IR CR2, HR CR2 and CR3+ patients respectively, and did not differ by stem cell source. Cumulative incidence of acute GVHD grade II-IV and III-IV was 38% and 21% respectively, while the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 32%. Cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality and relapse was 10% and 25% respectively. Significant toxicities included veno-occlusive disease [seven patients (11%)], transplant-associated microangiopathy (three patients), and idiopathic pneumonitis (one patient). In summary, sirolimus-based GVHD prophylaxis can be given safely in this population and early survival results are promising. A phase III trial to test whether sirolimus decreases relapse and improves outcome after transplantation for ALL is ongoing.","['Pulsipher, Michael A', 'Wall, Donna A', 'Grimley, Michael', 'Goyal, Rakesh K', 'Boucher, Kenneth M', 'Hankins, Patricia', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'Bunin, Nancy']","['Pulsipher MA', 'Wall DA', 'Grimley M', 'Goyal RK', 'Boucher KM', 'Hankins P', 'Grupp SA', 'Bunin N']","[""Division of Hematology/Blood and Marrow Transplant, Primary Children's Medical Center, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT 84132-2408, USA. michael.pulsipher@hsc.utah.edu""]",['eng'],"['R01 CA116660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA102646/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA116660-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA102646-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA102646/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA1116660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090910,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Sirolimus/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Tacrolimus/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/09/12 06:00,2010/03/27 06:00,['2009/09/12 06:00'],"['2009/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7889 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07889.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Dec;147(5):691-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07889.x.

Because of their discovery, microRNAs have been associated with almost every normal cell function, including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Several lines of evidence suggest that they have an important role in normal hematopoiesis as exemplified by the role of mir-155 and mir-150 in the differentiation of B and T lymphocytes, the suppressive role of mir-221 and mir-222 in erythroid differentiation, the inhibitory effect of mir-181 on hematopoietic differentiation and the induction of myeloid differentiation by mir-223. Moreover, they play a role both as oncogenes, probably by a variety of mechanisms, namely through elimination of tumor suppressor proteins, or as tumor suppressor genes by targeting oncogenic mRNAs. Their aberrant expression has been associated with solid tumors and hematopoietic malignancies as suggested by the frequent deletion of mir-15a and mir-16-1 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the increased levels of mir-155 in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and the increased levels of mir-181 in acute myeloid leukemia M1 and M2. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge on the role of microRNAs in normal hematopoiesis and hematopoietic malignancies and, moreover, to highlight their role as potential therapeutic tools.","['Vasilatou, Diamantina', 'Papageorgiou, Sotirios', 'Pappa, Vassiliki', 'Papageorgiou, Efstathios', 'Dervenoulas, John']","['Vasilatou D', 'Papageorgiou S', 'Pappa V', 'Papageorgiou E', 'Dervenoulas J']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, University of Athens, University General Hospital ""Attikon"", Haidari, Greece.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090910,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Invertebrates/genetics', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oncogenes', 'RNA, Neoplasm/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",2009/09/12 06:00,2010/05/15 06:00,['2009/09/12 06:00'],"['2009/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1348 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01348.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 Jan 1;84(1):1-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01348.x.

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), sTfR is not reliable for screening for ID as the latter is strongly dependent on tumor burden. METHODS: We investigated whether the influence of the tumor load can be excluded or minimized using the sTfR/log ferritin ratio (TfR-F-Index) and the C-reactive protein (CRP)-adjusted TfR-F-Index in 87 patients with CLL. sTfR was measured nephelometrically (normal: 0.81-1.75 mg/L). A cut-off value of 1.5 for the TfR-F-Index and 0.8 for the CRP-adjusted TfR-F-Index, in patients with a CRP >5 mg/L, was used. RESULTS: All Binet A patients had normal sTfR values (1.34+/-0.2 mg/L), TfR-F-Index (0.67+/-0.2) and a CRP-adjusted TfR-F-Index. In Binet B and C, sTfR and the TfR-F-Index were significantly increased compared to Binet A patients (p<0.0001). The differences between Binet B and C were not significant. sTfR was increased in 85%, TfR-F-Index in 46% and the CRP-adjusted TfR-F-Index in 54% of the Binet B patients, in Binet C patients, 80%, 50% and 60% showed increases, respectively. sTfR and the TfR-F-Index decreased or even normalized following successful treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to sTfR, the TfR-F-Index is strongly associated with tumor burden in patients with CLL.

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of 5a guided the development of ethyl 2-amino-6-(3',5'-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-(2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4H-chromene-3-carboxyla te (5q, CXL017), a compound with low micromolar cytotoxicity against a wide-range of hematologic and solid tumor cells. More excitingly, our studies of 5q in camptothecin (CCRF-CEM/C2) and mitoxantrone (HL-60/MX2) resistant cancer cells highlight its ability to selectively kill drug-resistant cells over parent cancer cells. 5q inhibits tumor cell growth through the induction of apoptosis, with detailed mechanism of its selectivity toward drug-resistant cancer cells under investigation. These results suggest that 5q is a promising candidate for treatment of cancers with multiple drug resistance.","['Das, Sonia G', 'Doshi, Jignesh M', 'Tian, Defeng', 'Addo, Sadiya N', 'Srinivasan, Balasubramanian', 'Hermanson, David L', 'Xing, Chengguo']","['Das SG', 'Doshi JM', 'Tian D', 'Addo SN', 'Srinivasan B', 'Hermanson DL', 'Xing C']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",['eng'],['R01CA114294/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (ethyl', '2-amino-6-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-(2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate', ')', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzopyrans/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Mitoxantrone/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2009/09/12 06:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/09/12 06:00'],"['2009/09/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/jm9005059 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2009 Oct 8;52(19):5937-49. doi: 10.1021/jm9005059.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of donor and recipient characteristics on hematopoietic recovery in pediatric patients following unmanipulated haploidentical transplantation. METHODS: Factors correlating with hematopoietic recovery in 133 pediatric patients after unmanipulated haploidentical transplantation were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: All patients reached an absolute neutrophil count of 500/microl in a median of 12 days (range, 9-49 days). One hundred thirty-three patients reached an untransfused platelet count of more than 20,000/microl in a median of 15 days (range, 7-180 days). Univariate analysis showed five factors associated with platelet engraftment. These were time to transplantation after diagnosis (P = 0.072), infused nuclear cells/kg of recipient weight (P = 0.028), CD3+ cells/kg of recipient weight (P = 0.082), CD4+ cells/kg of recipient weight (P = 0.083), and CD34+ cells/kg of recipient weight (P = 0.012). Multivariate analysis showed that infused CD34+ cells/kg of recipient weight (CD34+ cells more than 2.42 x 10(6)/kg vs. less than or equal to 2.42 x 10(6)/kg, HR = 1.733; 95% CI 1.222-2.549; P = 0.002) were significantly associated with an increased risk of platelet engraftment. Patients receiving a CD34+ cell dose more than 2.42 x 10(6)/kg had a short time [12 days (range, 7-176 days)] to achieve an untransfused platelet engraftment, compared to 18 days (range, 7-180 days) in patients receiving a lower dose (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that low number of CD34+ cells in allografts is a critical factor associated with delayed platelet engraftment after unmanipulated haploidentical transplantation in pediatric patients.","['Chang, Ying-Jun', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Liu, Dai-Hong', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Han, Wei', 'Chen, Yu-Hong', 'Wang, Yu', 'Chen, Huan', 'Wang, Jing-Zhi', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Zhao, Xiang-Yu', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Chang YJ', 'Xu LP', 'Liu DH', 'Liu KY', 'Han W', 'Chen YH', 'Wang Y', 'Chen H', 'Wang JZ', 'Zhang XH', 'Zhao XY', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Antigens, CD34', 'Blood Platelets/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Haplotypes', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/09/11 06:00,2009/10/14 06:00,['2009/09/11 06:00'],"['2009/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22159 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Dec;53(6):1100-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22159.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was designed to compare the rates of CR, disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS) and toxicity of therapy with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) for remission induction and/or maintenance compared to conventional chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated APL. PROCEDURE: Fifty-three patients who were documented to have the t(15;17) translocation were able to be evaluated for toxicity of treatment, outcome of induction, and survival. RESULTS: The overall CR rate was 81%. The estimated 5-year DFS from time of CR was 41% for all patients. The estimated 5-year OS for all patients from entry into the study was 69%. The 5-year DFS from time of CR for patients who were randomized to ATRA for induction or maintenance or both was 48% compared to 0% for patients who never received ATRA (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The most important finding of our study is that a significant DFS advantage exists for children with APL who received ATRA during induction or maintenance or both compared to children who received no ATRA. Furthermore, remissions in these children appear durable as the OS rates are stable at 10 years.","['Gregory, John', 'Kim, Haesook', 'Alonzo, Todd', 'Gerbing, Rob', 'Woods, William', 'Weinstein, Howard', 'Shepherd, Lois', 'Schiffer, Charles', 'Appelbaum, Frederick', 'Willman, Cheryl', 'Wiernik, Peter', 'Rowe, Jacob', 'Tallman, Martin', 'Feusner, James']","['Gregory J', 'Kim H', 'Alonzo T', 'Gerbing R', 'Woods W', 'Weinstein H', 'Shepherd L', 'Schiffer C', 'Appelbaum F', 'Willman C', 'Wiernik P', 'Rowe J', 'Tallman M', 'Feusner J']","['Morristown Memorial Hospital, Morristown, New Jersey 07962, USA. john.gregoryjr@atlantichealth.org']",['eng'],"['U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage/toxicity']",2009/09/11 06:00,2009/10/14 06:00,['2009/09/11 06:00'],"['2009/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22165 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Dec;53(6):1005-10. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22165.,PMC3508725,['NIHMS183904'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nutlin-3a is a recently developed small molecule that targets Mdm2, a critical negative regulator of p53, and disrupts the p53-Mdm2 interaction resulting in p53 stabilization and activation. We show that nutlin-3a activates p53 in ALK+ ALCL cells carrying a wild type (wt) or mutated but partially functional p53 gene resulting in p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Cell-cycle arrest was associated with upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. Nutlin-3a-induced apoptotic cell death was accompanied by Bax and Puma upregulation, downregulation of Bcl-xl, survivin, and caspase-3 cleavage, and this was reduced when p53-dependent transactivation activity was inhibited by pifithrin-alpha, or when pifithrin-mu was used to inhibit direct p53 targeting of mitochondria. Nutlin-3a sensitized the activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in wt-p53 ALK+ ALCL cells, in part, through upregulation of DR-5 and downregulation of c-Flip(S/L), and was synergistic with TRAIL in cell death induction. In addition, nutlin-3a treatment enhanced doxorubicin cytotoxicity against ALK+ ALCL cells harbouring mt p53, and this was associated with p73 upregulation. These data suggest that disruption of the p53-mdm2 interaction by nutlin-3a offers a novel therapeutic approach for ALK+ ALCL patients.","['Drakos, E', 'Atsaves, V', 'Schlette, E', 'Li, J', 'Papanastasi, I', 'Rassidakis, G Z', 'Medeiros, L J']","['Drakos E', 'Atsaves V', 'Schlette E', 'Li J', 'Papanastasi I', 'Rassidakis GZ', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090910,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/*drug therapy/genetics', '*Mutation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism']",2009/09/11 06:00,2010/01/15 06:00,['2009/09/11 06:00'],"['2009/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009180 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.180 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Dec;23(12):2290-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.180.

All three drugs were administered for five consecutive days in induction and four consecutive days in consolidation, for a maximum of eight cycles. A total of 25 patients (20 ALL and 5 AML) were enrolled in five cohorts. An MTD was not reached. The RP2Ds of clofarabine, cyclophosphamide and etoposide were 40, 440 and 100 mg/m(2)/day, respectively. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 10 patients (ALL: nine; AML: one), and CR without platelet recovery in six patients (ALL: two; AML: four) for an overall response rate of 64% (ALL: 55%; AML: 100%). Of the 16 responders, 9 patients proceeded to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In conclusion, the combination of clofarabine, etoposide and cyclophosphamide was well tolerated and effective in pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia. Of note, the phase II portion of the trial was amended after the occurrence of unexpected hepatotoxicity. The ongoing phase II study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of this regimen in ALL patients.","['Hijiya, N', 'Gaynon, P', 'Barry, E', 'Silverman, L', 'Thomson, B', 'Chu, R', 'Cooper, T', 'Kadota, R', 'Rytting, M', 'Steinherz, P', 'Shen, V', 'Jeha, S', 'Abichandani, R', 'Carroll, W L']","['Hijiya N', 'Gaynon P', 'Barry E', 'Silverman L', 'Thomson B', 'Chu R', 'Cooper T', 'Kadota R', 'Rytting M', 'Steinherz P', 'Shen V', 'Jeha S', 'Abichandani R', 'Carroll WL']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Children's Memorial Hospital/Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 2300 Children's Plaza, Chicago, IL 60614-3394, USA. nhijiya@childrensmemorial.org""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090910,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adenine Nucleotides/*administration & dosage', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Arabinonucleosides/*administration & dosage', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clofarabine', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/*administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/complications/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/drug therapy', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy/adverse effects/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/09/11 06:00,2010/01/15 06:00,['2009/09/11 06:00'],"['2009/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009185 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.185 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Dec;23(12):2259-64. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.185.

The first-in-class proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, was initially approved for treatment of patients in the relapsed/refractory setting as a single agent, and was recently shown to induce even greater benefits as part of rationally designed combinations that overcome chemoresistance. Modulation of proteasome function is also a rational approach to achieve chemosensitization to other antimyeloma agents, and bortezomib has now been incorporated into the front-line setting. Bortezomib-based induction regimens are able to achieve higher overall response rates and response qualities than was the case with prior standards of care, and unlike these older approaches, maintain efficacy in patients with clinically and molecularly defined high-risk disease. Second-generation proteasome inhibitors with novel properties, such as NPI-0052 and carfilzomib, are entering the clinical arena, and showing evidence of antimyeloma activity. In this spotlight review, we provide an overview of the current state of the art use of bortezomib and other proteasome inhibitors against multiple myeloma, and highlight areas for future study that will further optimize our ability to benefit patients with this disease.","['Shah, J J', 'Orlowski, R Z']","['Shah JJ', 'Orlowski RZ']","['The University of Texas M.

The goals of this study were to assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ASP and to mathematically model the dynamics between ASP and asparagine (ASN) in relapsed ALL. Forty children were randomized to receive either native or polyethylene glycolated (PEG) Escherichia coli ASP during reinduction therapy. Serial plasma ASP and ASN, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ASN, and serum anti-ASP antibody samples were collected. The ASP clearance was higher (P = 0.001) for native vs. PEG ASP. Patients with antibodies to PEG ASP had faster PEG ASP clearance (P = 0.004) than did antibody-negative patients. Patients who were positive for antibodies had higher CSF ASN concentrations than did those who were negative (P = 0.04). The modeling suggests that by modifying dosages, comparable ASN depletion is achievable with both preparations. At relapse, there were significant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences attributable to ASP preparation and antibody status.","['Panetta, J C', 'Gajjar, A', 'Hijiya, N', 'Hak, L J', 'Cheng, C', 'Liu, W', 'Pui, C H', 'Relling, M V']","['Panetta JC', 'Gajjar A', 'Hijiya N', 'Hak LJ', 'Cheng C', 'Liu W', 'Pui CH', 'Relling MV']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.""]",['eng'],"['R01 CA051001-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765-31/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA051001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090909,United States,Clin Pharmacol Ther,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,0372741,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antibodies/blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/immunology/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Asparagine/blood/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Computer Simulation', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology/genetics', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Failure']",2009/09/11 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/11 06:00'],"['2009/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['clpt2009162 [pii]', '10.1038/clpt.2009.162 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2009 Dec;86(6):651-8. doi: 10.1038/clpt.2009.162.

The Danish study estimated a relative risk (RR) = 1.56 (95% CI, 1.05-2.30) for a cumulative exposure of 1,000 Bq m-3 y. For an exposure duration of 10 y their RR corresponds to a radon concentration of 100 Bq m-3. There are two dose pathways of interest where alpha particles could damage potential stem cells for ALL. One is the alpha dose to bone marrow, and two is the dose to bronchial mucosa where an abundance of circulating lymphocytes is found. Compared with an exposure of about 1 mSv y-1 from natural external background, radon and decay products contribute an additional 10 to 60% to the bone marrow equivalent dose. The other pathway for exposure of T (or B) lymphocytes is within the tracheobronchial epithelium (BE). Inhaled radon decay products deposit on the relatively small area of airway surfaces and deliver a significant dose to the nearby basal or mucous cells implicated in human lung cancer. Lymphocytes are co-located with basal cells and are half as abundant. Using a 10-y exposure to 100 Bq m-3, our dose estimates suggest that the equivalent dose to these lymphocytes could approach 1 Sv. The relatively high dose estimate to lymphocytes circulating through the BE, potential precursor cells for ALL, provides a dose pathway for an association.","['Harley, Naomi H', 'Robbins, Edith S']","['Harley NH', 'Robbins ES']","['Department of Environmental Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, 550 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016, USA. naomi.harley@nyumc.org']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Radioactive)', 'Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants, Radioactive', 'Bone Marrow/radiation effects', 'Bronchi/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Epithelium/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Lung/radiation effects', 'Lymph Nodes/radiation effects', 'Lymphocytes/radiation effects', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Phagocytosis/radiation effects', 'Radiometry', 'Radon/*analysis', 'Risk']",2009/09/11 06:00,2009/09/29 06:00,['2009/09/11 06:00'],"['2009/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/HP.0b013e3181ad8018 [doi]', '00004032-200910000-00007 [pii]']",ppublish,Health Phys. 2009 Oct;97(4):343-7. doi: 10.1097/HP.0b013e3181ad8018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latter is a source of exposure to contact current in bathing children that has been proposed to explain the reported association between power-frequency magnetic fields and childhood leukemia. These quantities were measured each minute in a sample of 15 single-detached residences in San Jose, CA. Generally, Bavg, VW-E, and Vbath were positively correlated with each other within residences, and displayed similar diurnal patterns. Weekday and weekend patterns displayed qualitative differences that reflect the more scheduled workday for weekdays, and a less structured pattern for weekends. When pooled with two prior measurement studies, positive associations across residences between Bavg and both VW-E and Vbath were observed. Home designs over the past 30-40 years have lead to a decreasing prevalence of Vbath as conductive drains have been swapped out for non-conductive materials. Nonetheless, the observed relationships within and across residences indicate that contact current has the characteristics of a factor that could explain the association of magnetic fields with childhood leukemia.","['Kavet, Robert', 'Hooper, H Christopher']","['Kavet R', 'Hooper HC']","['Electric Power Research Institute, P.O.

Human cell lines used to transiently or stably express single transporters [HeLa, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293] and leukemia cell lines used to study drug resistance by ATP-binding cassette transporters (HL-60, K562) were investigated and compared with organotypic cell lines (HepG2, Saos-2, Caco-2, and Caco-2 TC7). For gene expression studies, real-time polymerase chain reaction was used, whereas monospecific polyclonal antibodies were generated and used to investigate protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Thirty-six transporters were studied for gene expression, and nine were studied for protein expression. The antibodies were validated using expression patterns in human tissues. Finally, the function of one ubiquitously expressed transporter, MCT1/SLC16A1, was investigated using [(14)C]lactic acid as a substrate. In general, the adherent cell lines (HeLa, HEK293) displayed low transporter expression, and the expression patterns were barely affected by transfection. The leukemia cell lines (K562, HL-60) and Saos-2 also had low endogenous transporter expression, whereas the organotypic cell lines (HepG2 and Caco-2) showed higher expression of some transporters. Comparison of gene and protein expression profiles gave poor correlations, but better agreement was obtained for antibodies with a good validation score, indicating that antibody quality was a significant variable. It is noteworthy that the monocarboxylic acid-transporting protein MCT1 was significantly expressed in all and was functional in most of the cell lines, indicating that MCT1 may be a confounding factor when the transport of small anionic drugs is investigated.","['Ahlin, Gustav', 'Hilgendorf, Constanze', 'Karlsson, Johan', 'Szigyarto, Cristina Al-Khalili', 'Uhlen, Mathias', 'Artursson, Per']","['Ahlin G', 'Hilgendorf C', 'Karlsson J', 'Szigyarto CA', 'Uhlen M', 'Artursson P']","['Department of Pharmacy, Uppsala University, SE-751 23 Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090909,United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters)', '0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)', '0 (Symporters)', '0 (monocarboxylate transport protein 1)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Drug Discovery/*methods', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters/metabolism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations/*metabolism', '*Proteomics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Symporters/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2009/09/11 06:00,2010/01/27 06:00,['2009/09/11 06:00'],"['2009/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['dmd.109.028654 [pii]', '10.1124/dmd.109.028654 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 2009 Dec;37(12):2275-83. doi: 10.1124/dmd.109.028654.

We have cloned LTR sequences from two HERV families, HERV-H and HERV-L, differing widely in their activity and tissue specificity into a murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based promoter conversion vector (ProCon). Various human cell lines were infected with the HERV-MLV hybrid vectors, and cell type-specific expression of the reporter gene was compared with the promoter specificity of the corresponding HERV LTRs in transient-transfection assays. Transcription start site analysis of HERV-MLV hybrid vectors revealed preferential use of the HERV promoter initiation site.

Darunavir is the most recently licensed protease inhibitor and we sought to investigate the ability of transport inhibitors to influence its intracellular accumulation in lymphocytes from healthy volunteers. METHODS: The intracellular accumulation of radiolabelled darunavir was assessed using CEM cells and ABCB1-overexpressing CEM(VBL) cells. Apical and basolateral transport of radiolabelled darunavir through MDCKII monolayers was also studied. Finally the ability of known inhibitors to influence intracellular accumulation of darunavir in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was investigated. RESULTS: CEM(VBL) cells (1.4 +/- 0.6, P < 0.001, 95% CI for the difference = 0.46, 0.80, n= 7) had significantly lower accumulation of darunavir compared with CEM cells (5.6 +/- 0.7, n= 7) and this was reversed by addition of tariquidar (30 nm, 4.6 +/- 0.8, P < 0.001, 95% CI =-0.64, -0.41, n= 4). In MDCKII-ABCBI cells, transport from the basal to the apical compartment was observed and this was also reversible with the addition of tariquidar. In PBMCs, dipyridamole (6.9 +/- 1.3, P < 0.01, 95% CI for the difference =-1.16, -0.30, (n= 8) significantly increased whilst montelukast (5.7 +/- 1.0, P < 0.01, 95% CI for the difference = 0.16, 0.79, n= 8) significantly decreased the intracellular accumulation of darunavir when compared with control (6.2 +/- 1.1, n= 8).

It is approved for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and is undergoing Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. The exact mechanism by which alemtuzumab mediates its biological effects in vivo is not clearly defined and mechanism of action studies have been hampered by the lack of cross-reactivity between human and mouse CD52. To address this issue, a transgenic mouse expressing human CD52 (hCD52) was created. Transgenic mice did not display any phenotypic abnormalities and were able to mount normal immune responses. The tissue distribution of hCD52 and the level of expression by various immune cell populations were comparable to those seen in humans. Treatment with alemtuzumab replicated the transient increase in serum cytokines and depletion of peripheral blood lymphocytes observed in humans. Lymphocyte depletion was not as profound in lymphoid organs, providing a possible explanation for the relatively low incidence of infection in alemtuzumab-treated patients. Interestingly, both lymphocyte depletion and cytokine induction by alemtuzumab were largely independent of complement and appeared to be mediated by neutrophils and natural killer cells because removal of these populations with antibodies to Gr-1 or asialo-GM-1, respectively, strongly inhibited the activity of alemtuzumab whereas removal of complement by treatment with cobra venom factor had no impact. The hCD52 transgenic mouse appears to be a useful model and has provided evidence for the previously uncharacterized involvement of neutrophils in the activity of alemtuzumab.","['Hu, Yanping', 'Turner, Michael J', 'Shields, Jacqueline', 'Gale, Matthew S', 'Hutto, Elizabeth', 'Roberts, Bruce L', 'Siders, William M', 'Kaplan, Johanne M']","['Hu Y', 'Turner MJ', 'Shields J', 'Gale MS', 'Hutto E', 'Roberts BL', 'Siders WM', 'Kaplan JM']","['Genzyme Corporation, Framingham, MA 01701, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/immunology', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*immunology', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/blood', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/*methods', 'Lymphoid Tissue/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Models, Animal', 'Neutrophils/immunology', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Tissue Distribution']",2009/09/11 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/11 06:00'],"['2009/09/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['IMM3115 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2567.2009.03115.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunology. 2009 Oct;128(2):260-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2567.2009.03115.x.,PMC2767316,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of action by which HHT exerts its antitumor activity is through inhibition of protein synthesis and promotion of apoptosis. In the 1990s, HHT proved to be significantly active as salvage therapy for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) after failure on interferon-alpha therapy. However, the remarkable success of imatinib mesylate in the treatment of CML relegated HHT to oblivion. The development of omacetaxine mepesuccinate, a subcutaneously bioavailable semisynthetic form of HHT, and its activity in imatinib-resistant CML has established this agent for the second time as a valuable option in the management of this disease. Preliminary results appear to support the use of this agent for patients who have imatinib-resistant CML, including those who carry the tyrosine kinase inhibitor-insensitive mutation that exchanges the amino acids threonine and isoleucine at position 315 (the T315I mutation). In this article, the authors discuss the current data on omacetaxine and the prospects of this agent to be integrated into the state-of-the-art treatment algorithms for CML.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Kantarjian H', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Its elevated expression has been correlated with malignant transformation and poor cancer prognosis. Cancer cells exhibit increased resistance to complement-dependent cytotoxicity, partly due to their capacity to eliminate the complement membrane attack complex (MAC) from their cell surface. As we have previously reported, mortalin and the complement membrane attack complexes are released in membrane vesicles from complement attacked cells. As shown here, knock down of mortalin with specific siRNA reduces MAC elimination and enhances cell sensitivity to MAC-induced cell death. Similar results were obtained with MKT-077, a cationic rhodacyanine dye that inhibits mortalin. Treatment of human erythroleukemia K562 and colorectal carcinoma HCT116 cells with MKT-077 sensitizes them to cell death mediated by MAC but not by streptolysin O. Pre-treatment of cells with MKT-077 also reduces the extent of MAC-mortalin vesiculation following a sublytic complement attack. In the presence of MKT-077, the direct binding of mortalin to complement C9, the major MAC component, is inhibited. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a known mortalin client protein. The effect of MKT-077 on complement-mediated lysis of HCT116 p53(+/+) and p53(-/-) cells was found to be independent on the presence of p53. Our results also demonstrate that recombinant human mortain inhibits complement-mediated hemolysis of rabbit erythrocytes as well as zinc-induced C9 polymerization. We conclude that mortalin supports cancer cell resistance to complement-dependent cytotoxicity and propose consideration of mortalin as a novel target for cancer adjuvant immunotherapy.","['Pilzer, David', 'Saar, Moran', 'Koya, Keizo', 'Fishelson, Zvi']","['Pilzer D', 'Saar M', 'Koya K', 'Fishelson Z']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Complement C9)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Streptolysins)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (mortalin)', '0 (streptolysin O)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '8PF5ZXI0JE (MKT 077)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Complement C9/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hemolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', '*RNA Interference', 'Rabbits', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Streptolysins/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology']",2009/09/10 06:00,2010/02/26 06:00,['2009/09/10 06:00'],"['2009/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24888 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2010 Mar 15;126(6):1428-35. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24888.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary end point was met: the complete response (CR) rate, defined as complete or nodular partial response, was significantly greater with OBL-FC than with FC (17% v 7%; P = .025). Among patients with CR, response duration was significantly longer with OBL-FC than with FC (median not reached; > 36 months v 22 months; P = .03). Maximum benefit with OBL-FC, including a four-fold increase in CR rate and a survival benefit with 3 years of follow-up (hazard ratio, 0.53; P = .05), was observed in patients with fludarabine-sensitive disease. We evaluated long-term survival and poststudy CLL therapy among all randomly assigned patients. METHODS: Poststudy CLL treatment information was collected. Patients were observed for survival for up to 5 years from the date of random assignment. RESULTS: Poststudy CLL treatment was balanced between arms. Intent-to-treat analysis of 5-year survival showed no significant between-treatment difference (hazard ratio, 0.87; P = .34). Among the greater than 40% of patients with complete or partial remission, a significant 5-year survival benefit was observed with OBL-FC (hazard ratio, 0.60; P = .038). Among patients with fludarabine-sensitive disease who had previously demonstrated maximum benefit with OBL-FC, the previously observed survival benefit improved: a 50% reduction in the risk of death was observed (P = .004). CONCLUSION: In relapsed/refractory CLL, OBL combined with FC offers patients who achieve complete or partial remission, as well as those who have fludarabine-sensitive disease, a significant survival benefit.","[""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Moore, Joseph O', 'Boyd, Thomas E', 'Larratt, Loree M', 'Skotnicki, Aleksander B', 'Koziner, Benjamin', 'Chanan-Khan, Asher A', 'Seymour, John F', 'Gribben, John', 'Itri, Loretta M', 'Rai, Kanti R']","[""O'Brien S"", 'Moore JO', 'Boyd TE', 'Larratt LM', 'Skotnicki AB', 'Koziner B', 'Chanan-Khan AA', 'Seymour JF', 'Gribben J', 'Itri LM', 'Rai KR']","['Division of Hematology, The University of Texas M.

Prevailing paradigms attribute this association to the induction of oncogenic mutations, as the incidence of oncogenic events is thought to limit initiation and progression of cancers. On the other hand, random mutagenic and genotoxic effects of irradiation are likely to alter progenitor cell populations and the microenvironment, thus altering the selective effects of oncogenic mutations. Using competitive bone marrow transplantation experiments in mice, we show that ionizing irradiation leads to a persistent decline in the numbers and fitness of hematopoietic stem cells, in part resulting from persistent induction of reactive oxygen species. Previous irradiation dramatically alters the selective effects of some oncogenic mutations, substantially inhibiting clonal expansion and leukemogenesis driven by Bcr-Abl or activated N-Ras oncogenes but enhancing the selection for and leukemogenesis driven by the activated Notch1 mutant ICN. Irradiation-dependent selection for ICN expression occurs in a hematopoietic stem cell-enriched pool, which should facilitate the accumulation of additional oncogenic events at a committed T-progenitor stage critical for formation of T-lymphocytic leukemia stem cells. Enhancement of ICN-driven selection and leukemogenesis by previous irradiation is in part non-cell autonomous, as partial restoration of normal hematopoiesis can reverse these effects of irradiation. These studies show that irradiation substantially alters the adaptive landscape in hematopoietic progenitors and suggest that the causal link between irradiation and carcinogenesis might involve increased selection for particular oncogenic mutations.","['Marusyk, Andriy', 'Casas-Selves, Matias', 'Henry, Curtis J', 'Zaberezhnyy, Vadym', 'Klawitter, Jelena', 'Christians, Uwe', 'DeGregori, James']","['Marusyk A', 'Casas-Selves M', 'Henry CJ', 'Zaberezhnyy V', 'Klawitter J', 'Christians U', 'DeGregori J']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01-CA109657/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109657-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109657/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109657-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007405/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109657-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090908,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)'],IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Damage', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology/*radiation effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Mutation', 'Oncogenes/*radiation effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2009/09/10 06:00,2009/10/08 06:00,['2009/09/10 06:00'],"['2009/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-0604 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0604 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Sep 15;69(18):7262-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0604.

To target this population, we investigated the mechanism of action of BMS-214662, developed as a farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI) and unique in inducing apoptosis in these cells. By contrast, a related congener and equally effective FTI, BMS-225975 does not induce apoptosis, indicating a novel mechanism of action. BMS-214662 significantly and selectively induced apoptosis in primitive CD34(+)38(-) CML compared with normal cells. Apoptosis proceeded via the intrinsic pathway: Bax conformational changes, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, generation of reactive oxygen species, release of cytochrome c, and caspase-9/3 activation were noted. Up-regulation of protein kinase Cbeta (PKCbeta), down-regulation of E2F1, and phosphorylation of cyclin A-associated cyclin-dependent kinase 2 preceded these changes. Cotreatment of CML CD34(+) and CD34(+)38(-) cells with PKC modulators, bryostatin-1, or hispidin markedly decreased these early events and the subsequent apoptosis. None of these events was elicited by BMS-214662 in normal CD34(+) cells or by BMS-225975 in CML CD34(+) cells. These data suggest that BMS-214662 selectively elicits a latent apoptotic pathway in CML stem cells that is initiated by up-regulation of PKCbeta and mediated by Bax activation, providing a molecular framework for development of novel therapeutics.","['Pellicano, Francesca', 'Copland, Mhairi', 'Jorgensen, Heather G', 'Mountford, Joanne', 'Leber, Brian', 'Holyoake, Tessa L']","['Pellicano F', 'Copland M', 'Jorgensen HG', 'Mountford J', 'Leber B', 'Holyoake TL']","[""Department of Medicine, Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Medical Faculty, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['G84/6317/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'SCD/04/CSO_/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090908,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '12794-10-4 (Benzodiazepines)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'L2U9GFD244', '(7-cyano-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1-(1H-imidazol-4-ylmethyl)-3-(phenylmethyl)-4-(2-thie', 'nylsulfonyl)-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzodiazepines/*pharmacology', 'Bryostatins/pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cyclin A/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/metabolism', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Farnesyltranstransferase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C beta', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2009/09/10 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/10 06:00'],"['2009/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38984-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-05-219550 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Nov 5;114(19):4186-96. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-05-219550.

Mouse natural killer (NK) cells usually die within 24 hours once isolated ex vivo. Exogenous cytokines such as interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-15 are required to maintain the survival and activity of mouse NK cells cultured in vitro. Whether and how ECM molecules such as fibronectin can support the survival of NK cells remain unknown. We demonstrate that fibronectin, just like IL-15, can maintain survival of mouse NK cells in vitro. Furthermore, we show that fibronectin binds to the CD11b on NK cells, and then CD11b recruits and activates Src. Src can directly interact with beta-catenin and trigger nuclear translocation of beta-catenin. The activation of beta-catenin promotes extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, resulting in the increased expression of antiapoptotic protein B-cell leukemia 2 (Bcl-2), which may contribute to the maintenance of NK-cell survival. Consistently, fibronectin cannot maintain the survival of CD11b(-) NK cells and beta-catenin-deficient NK cells in vitro, and the number of NK cells is dramatically decreased in the beta-catenin-deficient mice. Therefore, fibronectin can maintain survival of mouse NK cells by activating ERK and up-regulating Bcl-2 expression via CD11b/Src/beta-catenin pathway.","['Zhang, Ting', 'Liu, Shuxun', 'Yang, Pengyuan', 'Han, Chaofeng', 'Wang, Jianli', 'Liu, Juan', 'Han, Yanmei', 'Yu, Yizhi', 'Cao, Xuetao']","['Zhang T', 'Liu S', 'Yang P', 'Han C', 'Wang J', 'Liu J', 'Han Y', 'Yu Y', 'Cao X']","[""Institute of Immunology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310058, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090908,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CD11b Antigen/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Female', 'Fibronectins/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'beta Catenin/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",2009/09/10 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/10 06:00'],"['2009/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38972-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-05-219881 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Nov 5;114(19):4081-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-05-219881.

As a test of this hypothesis, we evaluated the methylation status of eight genes (MINT1, 2, 31, MLH1, p16, p14, MGMT, and ESR1), as well as BRAF and KRAS mutations, in 57 multiple colorectal neoplasias (M-CRN) and compared these to 69 solitary colorectal cancers (S-CRC). There were no significant differences in methylation between M-CRNs and S-CRCs except for p14 and MGMT that was significantly higher in M-CRNs than S-CRCs (16.1% versus 9.3%; 26.5% versus 17.3%, respectively; P < 0.05). We found significant (P < 0.05) correlations for MINT1 (r = 0.8), p16 (r = 0.8), MLH1 (r = 0.9), and MGMT (r = 0.6) methylation between tumors pairs of the same site (proximal/proximal and distal/distal). KRAS showed no concordance in mutations. BRAF mutation showed concordance in proximal site pairs but was discordant in different site pairs. Histologically, eight of 10 paired cancers with similar locations were concordant for a cribriform glandular configuration. We conclude that synchronous colorectal tumors of the same site are highly concordant for methylation of multiple genes, BRAF mutations, and a cribriform glandular configuration, all consistent with a patient-specific predisposition to particular subtypes of colorectal cancers.

Antiapoptotic Bcl-2 is frequently overexpressed in refractory prostate cancer and increased following standard hormonal therapy and chemotherapy; however, the rationally designed Bcl-2 antagonist, ABT-737, has not shown single agent apoptosis-promoting activity against human prostate cancer cell lines. This is likely due to the coordinate expression of antiapoptotic, Bcl-2-related Mcl-1 that is not targeted by ABT-737. We developed a mouse model for prostate cancer in which apoptosis resistance and tumorigenesis were conferred by Bcl-2 expression. Combining ABT-737 with agents that target Mcl-1 sensitized prostate cancer cell lines with an apoptotic block to cell death in vitro. In mice in vivo, ABT-737 showed single agent efficacy in prostate tumor allografts in which tumor cells are under hypoxic stress. In human prostate cancer tissue, examined using a novel tumor explant system designated Tumor Tissue Assessment for Response to Chemotherapy, combination chemotherapy promoted efficient apoptosis.

MYB mRNA is expressed at high levels in, and is required for the proliferation of, most human myeloid and acute lymphoid leukemias. Recently, chromosomal translocation and genomic duplications of c-MYB have been identified in human T-cell acute leukemia. The present work focuses on the effects of mutations in different domains of the murine c-Myb protein on its transforming ability as defined by suppression of myelomonocytic differentiation and continued proliferation. Using both a novel myeloid cell line-based assay and a primary hematopoietic cell assay, we have shown that mutation of single residues in the transactivation domain important for CBP/p300 binding leads to complete loss of transforming ability. We also simultaneously mutated residues in the DNA-binding domain and the negative regulatory domain of the protein. These double mutants, but not the corresponding single mutants, show a complete loss of transforming activity. Surprisingly, these double mutants show severely impaired transactivation and are also defective for CBP/p300 binding. Our results imply that multiple Myb domains influence its interaction with CBP/p300, highlight the importance of this interaction for myeloid transformation, and suggest an approach for molecular targeting of Myb in leukemia.","['Pattabiraman, Diwakar R', 'Sun, Jane', 'Dowhan, Dennis H', 'Ishii, Shunsuke', 'Gonda, Thomas J']","['Pattabiraman DR', 'Sun J', 'Dowhan DH', 'Ishii S', 'Gonda TJ']","['University of Queensland Diamantina Institute for Cancer, Immunology and Metabolic Medicine, Queensland 4102, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090908,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Growth Processes/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mutagenesis', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/09/10 06:00,2010/01/15 06:00,['2009/09/10 06:00'],"['2009/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-09-0070 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-09-0070 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2009 Sep;7(9):1477-86. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-09-0070.

This is also reflected by the frequent loss of the INK4A locus in acute lymphoblastic T-cell leukemia. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells designed to conditionally express p16(INK4A) arrest in the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle and show increased sensitivity to glucocorticoid- and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 6-induced apoptosis. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanism for increased death sensitivity, we interfered with specific steps of apoptosis signaling by expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. We found that alterations in cell death susceptibility resulted from changes in the composition of pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins, i.e. repression of MCL1, BCL2, and PMAIP1/Noxa and the induction of pro-apoptotic BBC3/Puma. Interference with Puma induction by short hairpin RNA technology or retroviral expression of MCL1 or BCL2 significantly reduced both glucocorticoid- and FAS-induced cell death in p16(INK4A)-reconstituted leukemia cells. These results suggest that Puma, in concert with MCL1 and BCL2 repression, critically mediates p16(INK4A)-induced death sensitization and that in human T-cell leukemia the deletion of p16(INK4A) confers apoptosis resistance by shifting the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins toward apoptosis protection.","['Obexer, Petra', 'Hagenbuchner, Judith', 'Rupp, Martina', 'Salvador, Christina', 'Holzner, Markus', 'Deutsch, Martin', 'Porto, Verena', 'Kofler, Reinhard', 'Unterkircher, Thomas', 'Ausserlechner, Michael J']","['Obexer P', 'Hagenbuchner J', 'Rupp M', 'Salvador C', 'Holzner M', 'Deutsch M', 'Porto V', 'Kofler R', 'Unterkircher T', 'Ausserlechner MJ']","['Tyrolean Cancer Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics IV, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck 6020, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090908,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics/*metabolism', '*Down-Regulation', 'Fas Ligand Protein/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glucocorticoids/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/09/10 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/10 06:00'],"['2009/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)37996-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.051441 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Nov 6;284(45):30933-40. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.051441.

We recently reported that in primary B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemic (B-CLL) cells, apoptosis could be induced by stimulating the cAMP signaling pathway with a phosphodiesterase4 (PDE4) inhibitor alone; while in contrast, in the CEM T leukemic cell line, PDE4 inhibitors alone were ineffective, and concurrent stimulation of adenylyl cyclase was required to see effects [Tiwari et al. (2005)]. We report here that in the CEM and Jurkat T leukemic cell lines, the most abundantly expressed PDEs are PDE3B, PDE4A, PDE4D, PDE7A, and PDE8A. Selective inhibition of PDE3, PDE4 or PDE7 alone produces little effect on cell viability, but inhibition of all three of these PDEs together dramatically enhances glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in CEM cells, and overcomes glucocorticoid resistance in a glucocorticoid-resistant CEM cell line. These studies indicate that for some leukemic cell types, a desired therapeutic effect may be achieved by inhibiting more than one form of PDE.","['Dong, Hongli', 'Zitt, Christof', 'Auriga, Cornelia', 'Hatzelmann, Armin', 'Epstein, Paul M']","['Dong H', 'Zitt C', 'Auriga C', 'Hatzelmann A', 'Epstein PM']","['Signal Transduction Laboratory, Department of Cell Biology, University of Connecticut Health Center, 263 Farmington Ave., Farmington, CT 06030-6125, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090906,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase 3 Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase 4 Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 3)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 7)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 3/physiology', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4/physiology', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 7/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/physiology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/*enzymology', '*Phosphodiesterase 3 Inhibitors', '*Phosphodiesterase 4 Inhibitors', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/09/10 06:00,2009/12/23 06:00,['2009/09/10 06:00'],"['2009/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(09)00734-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2009.09.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2010 Feb 1;79(3):321-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2009.09.001.

METHODS: cDNA encoding human c-Kit extracellular domain was constructed into a procaryotic expression vector pQE30 and the correctness of the reconstructed plasmid pQE30-KitD4-5 was verified by sequencing. The plasmid was transformed into E.coli M15 strain. Recombinant 6 x His pQE30-KitD4-5 was expressed after induction by IPTG for 4 h. Then SDS-PAGE results suggested that the products mainly formed inclusion bodies. The fusion protein was further purified with Ni-NTA-His affinity chromatography and then used to immunize BALB/c mice. The hybridomas were achieved by fusing the immunized spleen cells with the Sp2/0 myeloma cell line. The positive clones were screened by FCM with CHO-hKit cells. Hybidoma clones secreting anti-c-Kit antibodies were further subcloned and investigated for their biological activities by Western blot, rapid isotyping analysis and FCM. RESULTS: Recombinant human c-Kit fusion proteins were in vitro expressed and purified to be used as immunogen. One stable hybridoma cell line, which continuously secrets specific anti-c-Kit monoclonal antibody ((SRJ1)) was established. The biological activity studies showed that the monoclonal antibody recognized the natural c-Kit expressed on the Kasumi leukemia cell line, but failed to bind to the normal human peripheral blood cells. Interestingly, this monoclonal antibody failed to recognize a subpopulation of Kasumi cells that is reactive with the commercial anti-c-Kit mAb Ab81 suggesting that the c-Kit expressed by this subpopulation contains some sequencial and/or structural aberrations that are distinguishable by mAb SRJ1. CONCLUSION: With an immunization procedure using purified recombinant human c-Kit fusion proteins. a hybridoma cell line continuously and stably secreting anti-c-Kit monoclonal antibody has been established. The monoclonal antibody SRJ1 specifically recognizes human c-Kit expressed on the leukemia cells, and may provide a novel approach to analyze the possible structural variations of c-Kit expressed by different cells.","['Liu, Hong-chen', 'Mao, Chao-ming', 'Su, Xiao-yu', 'Ruan, Zheng', 'Ding, Qiu-lan', 'Wang, Xue-feng', 'Wang, Hong-li', 'Xi, Xiao-dong']","['Liu HC', 'Mao CM', 'Su XY', 'Ruan Z', 'Ding QL', 'Wang XF', 'Wang HL', 'Xi XD']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China. liuhcsky@163.com']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi,Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,101139110,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Blotting, Western', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Plasmids', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*biosynthesis']",2009/09/10 06:00,2010/03/03 06:00,['2009/09/10 06:00'],"['2009/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/03 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Jul;25(7):619-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gab/DOS proteins integrate and amplify signals from a wide variety of sources including growth factor, cytokine and antigen receptors as well as cell adhesion molecules. They also contribute to signal diversification by channelling the information from activated receptors into signalling pathways with distinct biological functions. Recent approaches in protein biochemistry and systems biology have revealed that Gab proteins are subject to complex regulation by feed-forward and feedback phosphorylation events as well as protein-protein interactions. Thus, Gab/DOS docking proteins are at the centre of entire signalling subsystems and fulfil an important if not essential role in many physiological processes. Furthermore, aberrant signalling by Gab proteins has been increasingly linked to human diseases from various forms of neoplasia to Alzheimer's disease.In this review, we provide a detailed overview of the structure, effector functions, regulation and evolution of the Gab/DOS family. We also summarize recent findings implicating Gab proteins, in particular the Gab2 isoform, in leukaemia, solid tumours and other human diseases.","['Wohrle, Franziska U', 'Daly, Roger J', 'Brummer, Tilman']","['Wohrle FU', 'Daly RJ', 'Brummer T']","['Centre for Biological Systems Analysis (ZBSA), Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Germany. tilman.brummer@zbsa.de.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090908,England,Cell Commun Signal,Cell communication and signaling : CCS,101170464,,,,2009/09/10 06:00,2009/09/10 06:01,['2009/09/10 06:00'],"['2009/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/10 06:01 [medline]']","['1478-811X-7-22 [pii]', '10.1186/1478-811X-7-22 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Commun Signal. 2009 Sep 8;7:22. doi: 10.1186/1478-811X-7-22.,PMC2747914,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concomitant use of agents that modulate and complement stress-signalling pathways activated by chemotherapeutic agents may then enhance the immunogenicity of cancer cells, increase their susceptibility to T cell-mediated controls and lead to higher clinical remission rates. Consistent with this hypothesis, the microtubule inhibitor, vincristine, caused chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells to die rapidly, without increasing their immunogenicity. Protein kinase C (PKC) agonists (such as bryostatin) delayed the death of vincristine-treated CLL cells and made them highly immunogenic, with increased stimulatory abilities in mixed lymphocyte responses, production of proinflammatory cytokines, expression of co-stimulatory molecules and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signalling pathways. This phenotype was similar to the result of activating CLL cells through Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which communicate 'danger' signals from infectious pathogens. Use of PKC agonists and microtubule inhibitors to mimic TLR-signalling, and increase the immunogenicity of CLL cells, has implications for the design of chemo-immunotherapeutic strategies.","['Shaha, S P', 'Tomic, J', 'Shi, Y', 'Pham, T', 'Mero, P', 'White, D', 'He, L', 'Baryza, J L', 'Wender, P A', 'Booth, J W', 'Spaner, D E']","['Shaha SP', 'Tomic J', 'Shi Y', 'Pham T', 'Mero P', 'White D', 'He L', 'Baryza JL', 'Wender PA', 'Booth JW', 'Spaner DE']","['Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Research Institute, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA031845/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA031845/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31845/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090717,England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Enzyme Activators)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Bryostatins/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials, Phase IV as Topic/methods', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Activators/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Microtubules/*drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/pharmacology', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tubulin Modulators/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",2009/09/10 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/10 06:00'],"['2009/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['CEI4003 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.04003.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2009 Nov;158(2):186-98. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.04003.x.

Moreover, increased interleukin (IL)-17 concentrations accompanied the increased Th17 cell frequencies in these patients. These results suggest that Th17 cells may play a role in the pathogenesis of AML. Secondly, we found that the increased Th17 cell frequencies were reduced when patients achieved complete remission after chemotherapy, suggesting that measurement of Th17 cell frequencies may have clinical value in the evaluation of therapeutic effect. In addition, we found that IL-6 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 concentrations increased in the untreated patients and that IL-6 concentrations showed a positive correlation with the frequencies of Th17 cells, suggesting that IL-6 may play an important role in Th17 cell differentiation in patients with AML.","['Wu, C', 'Wang, S', 'Wang, F', 'Chen, Q', 'Peng, S', 'Zhang, Y', 'Qian, J', 'Jin, J', 'Xu, H']","['Wu C', 'Wang S', 'Wang F', 'Chen Q', 'Peng S', 'Zhang Y', 'Qian J', 'Jin J', 'Xu H']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital, Zhenjiang, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090811,England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-17/*blood', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/drug effects/*immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/blood']",2009/09/10 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/10 06:00'],"['2009/09/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['CEI4011 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.04011.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2009 Nov;158(2):199-204. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.04011.x.

As such, assessing the risk of late effects and complications are increasingly becoming more important. The degree of risk of late effects may be influenced by various treatment-related factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Singapore Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (SGCCSS) consists of all individuals who survived at least 2 or more years after treatment for cancer diagnosed during childhood or adolescence. Phase I of SG-CCSS is the identification of all eligible patients between 1981 and 2005. RESULTS: There were a total of 1440 patients registered in the Singapore Childhood Cancer Registry. Among these, 704 (48.9%) patients were from the KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) and 626 (43.5%) were from the National University Hospital (NUH). Of all the registered patients, the most common cancer in childhood was leukaemia [42.6% (n = 613)] and the second most common was brain tumour [14.9% (n = 215)]. A total of 1043 (72.4%) patients were surviving, of whom 839 (80.4%) were long-term survivors. Haematological malignancies were found in 492 (58.6%) survivors whilst 347 (41.4%) were diagnosed with various solid tumours. Among leukaemic patients (n = 613), 65.6% (n = 402) were long-term survivors. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (n = 484) had the highest percentage of [80.9% (n = 392)] of surviving patients, of whom 73.4% were long term-survivors. For brain tumour (n = 215), there were 95 (44.2%) long-term survivors. CONCLUSION: Preliminary analysis revealed that 58.3% of patients were long-term survivors. Our hope is to tailor all future therapy for childhood cancers, optimising cure rates whilst minimising long-term side-effects.","['Aung, LeLe', 'Khyne, ToeToe', 'Yeoh, Allen E J', 'Quah, Thuan Chong', 'Tan, Ah Moy']","['Aung L', 'Khyne T', 'Yeoh AE', 'Quah TC', 'Tan AM']","['Division of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, National University of Singapore/National University Hospital, Singapore. paev2@nus.edu.sg']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Singapore,Ann Acad Med Singap,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",7503289,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cooperative Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/mortality', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Singapore/epidemiology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",2009/09/09 06:00,2010/09/30 06:00,['2009/09/09 06:00'],"['2009/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ann Acad Med Singap. 2009 Aug;38(8):684-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the expression of HDACs in human hematopoietic cells and their functions during hematopoiesis. The expression of HDACs was very low in hematopoietic progenitor cells, which was accompanied by histone hyperacetylation. HDACs were detectable in more differentiated progenitors and erythroid precursors but down-regulated in mature myeloid cells especially granulocytes. In contrast, acute myeloid leukemias showed HDAC overexpression and histone hypoacetylation. Transcription of the HDAC1 gene was repressed by CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins during myeloid differentiation, and activated by GATA-1 during erythro-megakaryocytic differentiation. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of HDAC1 enhanced myeloid differentiation in immature hematopoietic cell lines and perturbed erythroid differentiation in progenitor cells. Myeloid but not erythro-megakaryocytic differentiation was blocked in mice transplanted with HDAC1-overexpressing hematopoietic progenitor cells. These findings suggest that HDAC is not merely an auxiliary factor of genetic elements but plays a direct role in the cell fate decision of hematopoietic progenitors.","['Wada, Taeko', 'Kikuchi, Jiro', 'Nishimura, Noriko', 'Shimizu, Rumi', 'Kitamura, Toshio', 'Furukawa, Yusuke']","['Wada T', 'Kikuchi J', 'Nishimura N', 'Shimizu R', 'Kitamura T', 'Furukawa Y']","['Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi 329-0498, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090907,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CCAAT-Binding Factor)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'CCAAT-Binding Factor/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Histone Deacetylase 1/analysis/*genetics/physiology', 'Histone Deacetylases/analysis/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2009/09/09 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/09 06:00'],"['2009/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)38121-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.042242 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Oct 30;284(44):30673-83. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.042242.

In order to clinically interpret these parameters, normal reference values should be set, estimating age- and gender-related variations. This research aimed to: (1) characterize lymphocyte subpopulations in Andalusian horse, and (2) evaluate age and gender-related variations of lymphocyte subsets. Jugular blood samples were obtained from 159 animals, 77 males and 82 females, belonging to four age groups-1: 1-2 years (N=39; 21 males and 18 females), 2: 2-3 years (N=38; 16 males and 22 females), 3: 3-4 years (N=41; 19 males and 22 females) and 4: 4-7 years (N=41; 21 males and 20 females). T lymphocytes subsets were quantified by flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies specific for CD2, CD4 and CD8 cell markers. B and NK cell counts were estimated by using a mathematical formula. No variations were found in T, B lymphocytes and NK cells between males and females. Animals of group 1 and 2 had a higher number of CD2, T, CD4+, CD8+, B lymphocytes and NK cells than animals of groups 3 and 4. The percentage of CD2 in group 1 was significantly lower than in group 4. The percentage of T and CD4+ lymphocytes in the group 1 were significantly higher than groups 2 and 3, respectively. Whereas the percentage of B cells calculated by flow cytometry was significantly lower in group 2 compared to group 4, the percentage of B cells calculated by a mathematical formula was higher in group 1. NK cells percentage was significantly lower in group 3 and 4 than in younger animals. In conclusion, in Andalusian horse, gender does not influence absolute numbers and percentages of T, B and NK. There is an age-related decline in absolute number of CD2, T, CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and NK cells, with increasing percentage of CD2, T, CD4+ and B lymphocytes, and a decrease in NK with no differences in CD4/CD8 ratio. The decline of lymphocyte population numbers with age is a natural process in many animal species, and could be the origin for immune dysfunction observed in geriatric individuals.","['Satue, K', 'Hernandez, A', 'Lorente, C', ""O'Connor, J E""]","['Satue K', 'Hernandez A', 'Lorente C', ""O'Connor JE""]","['Department of Medicine and Surgery, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Cardenal Herrera-CEU University, Valencia, Spain. ksatue@uch.ceu.es']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090822,Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aging/immunology', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Horses/*immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/classification/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Male', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Spain', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology']",2009/09/09 06:00,2010/04/17 06:00,['2009/09/09 06:00'],"['2008/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/10 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-2427(09)00284-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.08.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 2010 Feb 15;133(2-4):219-27. doi: 10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.08.013.

We carried out a study of efficacy of antifungal drugs to prevent breakthrough invasive aspergillosis by reviewing the medical records of all consecutive patients who received EAFT from November 2005 to February 2006. Patients' characteristics and the type, dose and duration of antifungal therapy were recorded. Breakthrough invasive fungal infections were documented according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) definition. Fifty-six episodes of persistent fever with neutropenia requiring EAFT were recorded among 49 patients. All patients received high-dose chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia (51%), acute lymphoid leukaemia (12%), lymphoma (14%) or other haematologic conditions (22%). Fourteen (29%) and five (10%) patients were allogeneic and autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, respectively. Caspofungin was prescribed initially in 40 episodes (71%), amphotericin B (AmB) desoxycholate and liposomal AmB being prescribed in six (10%) and ten (18%) episodes, respectively. Six patients were switched from liposomal AmB to caspofungin because of adverse events. The median duration of antifungal therapy was 9 days. During follow-up, six patients (12%) were diagnosed with invasive aspergillosis after a median of 8 days (range 3-16 days) of EAFT. Invasive aspergillosis breakthrough occurred in 6/46 (13%) caspofungin recipients and in 0/16 (0%) AmB recipients (OR 3.1, p 0.32).

Donor CD4+, CD8+ and natural killer (NK) cells have been reported to mediate graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) effects, using Fas-dependent killing and perforin degranulation to eradicate malignant cells. Cytokines, such as interleukin-2, interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha potentiate the GVL effect. Post-transplant adoptive therapy of cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) against leukaemia-specific antigens, minor histocompatibility antigens, or T-cell receptor genes may constitute successful approaches to induce anti-tumour effects. Clinically, a significant GVL effect is induced by chronic rather than acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). An anti-tumour effect has also been reported for myeloma, lymphoma and solid tumours. Reduced intensity conditioning enables HSCT in older and disabled patients and relies on the graft-versus-tumour effect. Donor lymphocyte infusions promote the GVL effect and can be given as escalating doses with response monitored by minimal residual disease. A high CD34+ cell dose of peripheral blood stem cells increases GVL. There is a balance between effective immunosuppression, low incidence of GVHD and relapse. For instance, T-cell depletion of the graft increases the risk of relapse. This paper reviews the current knowledge in graft-versus-cancer effects. Future directions, such as immunotherapy using leukaemia-specific CTLs, allo-depleted T-cells and suicide gene manipulated T-cells, are presented.","['Ringden, Olle', 'Karlsson, Helen', 'Olsson, Richard', 'Omazic, Brigitta', 'Uhlin, Michael']","['Ringden O', 'Karlsson H', 'Olsson R', 'Omazic B', 'Uhlin M']","['Centre for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation and Division of Clinical Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.

METHODS: 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and flow cytometry assays were performed to evaluate the effects of ursolic acid on the growth and apoptosis of HT-29 cells. Western blot analysis was applied to investigate the inhibitory effects of ursolic acid on the phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), and the activity of B cell leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), B cell leukemia-xL (Bcl-xL), caspase-3, and caspase-9. RESULTS: Ursolic acid inhibited the growth of HT-29 cells in dose- and time-dependent manners. The median inhibition concentration (IC50) values for 24, 48, and 72 h treatment were 26, 20, and 18 micromol/L, respectively. The apoptotic rates of 10, 20, and 40 micromol/L ursolic acid treatments for 24 h were 5.74%, 14.49%, and 33.05%, and for 48 h were 9%, 21.39%, and 40.49%, respectively. Ursolic acid suppressed the phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK, which is well correlated with its growth inhibitory effect. 10, 20, and 40 micromol/L ursolic acid significantly inhibited the proliferation of EGF-stimulated HT-29 cells (P<0.05). Cell proliferation was most significantly inhibited when treated with 10 and 20 micromol/L ursolic acid combined with 200 nmol/L AG 1478 or 10 micromol/L U0126 (P<0.01). Besides, it also down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and activated caspase-3 and caspase-9. CONCLUSION: Ursolic acid induces apoptosis in HT-29 cells by suppressing the EGFR/MAPK pathway, suggesting that it may be a potent agent for the treatment of colorectal cancer.","['Shan, Jian-zhen', 'Xuan, Yan-yan', 'Zheng, Shu', 'Dong, Qi', 'Zhang, Su-zhan']","['Shan JZ', 'Xuan YY', 'Zheng S', 'Dong Q', 'Zhang SZ']","['Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310009, China. zhang1873@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,J Zhejiang Univ Sci B,Journal of Zhejiang University.

Older chemotherapy drugs such as the anthracyclins and new targeted therapies, mainly trastuzumab, have been implicated in causing clinically significant cardiac dysfunction, which may be irreversible for many patients. The advent of a new category of drugs, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors has revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors and renal cancer, while their indications include a variety of other types of tumors. METHODS: Assessment of the incidence and severity of cardiac toxicity caused by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors and discussion on the molecular mechanisms and mode of diagnosis based on recent clinical trials. Review of related literature. RESULTS: Cardiac toxicity can be caused by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib mesylate, dasatinib, nilotinib, sunitinib, sorafenib and lapatinib, while gefitinib and erlotinib have not been related to toxic effect on the heart. Although targeted therapies are considered less toxic and better tolerated by patients compared with classic chemotherapy drugs, certain complications can be very serious and as these agents have been in use for a limited period of time, the exact profile of side effects will be better defined in the years to come. Cardiac toxicity may range from asymptomatic subclinical abnormalities such as electrocardiographic changes and left ventricular ejection fraction decline to life threatening events like congestive heart failure and acute coronary syndromes.

The ALT phenotype, relatively common in certain sarcomas and germ cell tumors, is very rare in carcinomas. In this study we describe evidence for the ALT phenotype in molecular subclasses of breast carcinoma, specifically a subset of cancers with HER-2 overexpression. Tissue microarrays were created from 71 invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast categorized into subclasses, and telomere lengths were directly assessed using fluorescence in situ hybridization with combined promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein immunofluorescence. The ALT phenotype was identified in 3 of 21 HER-2-positive cases, but in none of the other 50 cases (P=0.023). This is the first direct observation of this mechanism of telomere maintenance in breast carcinoma unrelated to Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The correlation of the ALT phenotype with HER-2 positivity, both of which involve abnormal DNA amplification, suggests a possible common underlying mechanism. This telomere phenotype confers a poor prognosis in some cancers; two of the three cases in our study showed rapid tumor progression, possibly suggesting that it may adversely affect outcome in breast carcinoma as well. As cancers using the ALT pathway are predicted to be resistant to therapies based on telomerase inhibition, these results may have therapeutic consequences.","['Subhawong, Andrea Proctor', 'Heaphy, Christopher M', 'Argani, Pedram', 'Konishi, Yuko', 'Kouprina, Nina', 'Nassar, Hind', 'Vang, Russell', 'Meeker, Alan K']","['Subhawong AP', 'Heaphy CM', 'Argani P', 'Konishi Y', 'Kouprina N', 'Nassar H', 'Vang R', 'Meeker AK']","['Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['P50 CA088843/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20090904,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/*genetics/metabolism', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Amplification/genetics', 'Gene Dosage/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Progesterone/metabolism', 'Telomere/*genetics/metabolism']",2009/09/08 06:00,2010/02/20 06:00,['2009/09/08 06:00'],"['2009/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol2009125 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2009.125 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2009 Nov;22(11):1423-31. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2009.125.

Overexpression of a ubiquitin-resistant Mcl-1 mutant in Huh-7 cells attenuated palmitate-mediated Mcl-1 loss and lipoapoptosis; conversely, short hairpin RNA-targeted knockdown of Mcl-1 sensitized these cells to lipoapoptosis. Palmitate-induced Mcl-1 degradation was attenuated by the novel protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor rottlerin. Of the two human novel PKC isozymes, PKCdelta and PKC, only activation of PKC was observed by phospho-immunoblot analysis. As compared with Jurkat cells, a smaller PKC polypeptide and mRNA were expressed in hepatocytes consistent with an alternative splice variant. Short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of PKC reduced Mcl-1 degradation and lipoapoptosis. Likewise, genetic deletion of Pkc also attenuated Mcl-1 degradation and cytotoxicity by palmitate in primary hepatocytes. During treatment with palmitate, rottlerin inhibited phosphorylation of Mcl-1 at Ser(159), a phosphorylation site previously implicated in Mcl-1 turnover. Consistent with these results, an Mcl-1 S159A mutant was resistant to degradation and improved cell survival during palmitate treatment. Collectively, these results implicate PKC-dependent destabilization of Mcl-1 as a mechanism contributing to hepatocyte lipoapoptosis.","['Masuoka, Howard C', 'Mott, Justin', 'Bronk, Steven F', 'Werneburg, Nathan W', 'Akazawa, Yuko', 'Kaufmann, Scott H', 'Gores, Gregory J']","['Masuoka HC', 'Mott J', 'Bronk SF', 'Werneburg NW', 'Akazawa Y', 'Kaufmann SH', 'Gores GJ']","['Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 DK041876/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 DK079875/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK41876/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P309K 84567/PHS HHS/United States', 'P30 DK084567/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA069008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 DK79875/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 07198/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01 CA69008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090905,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Palmitates)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Stearates)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fatty Acids/*pharmacology', 'Hepatocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Palmitates/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Stearates/pharmacology']",2009/09/08 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/08 06:00'],"['2009/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)38058-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.039545 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Oct 30;284(44):30039-48. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.039545.

It is classified in the World Health Organization myeloproliferative-myelodysplastic overlap category. JAK2(V617F) mutation can be found in a large percentage of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. AIMS: To investigate the association between JAK2(V617F) mutation and clinical, haematological and bone marrow histological features in CMML and to verify whether the mutation is associated with the myeloproliferative type of the disease. METHODS: 78 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed CMML from 2004 to 2008 were included in the study. JAK2(V617F) mutation was assessed using direct sequencing of exon 14 or by allele-specific PCR from total peripheral blood or bone marrow samples. RESULTS: JAK2(V617F) mutation was identified in eight cases (10.2%). All patients with the mutation presented with splenomegaly and had a significantly higher haemoglobin level and neutrophil count than patients without the mutation. All bone marrow biopsies of JAK2(V617F)-mutated CMML showed increased erythropoiesis, a marked myeloid and megakaryocytic hyperplasia with occasionally clustered megakaryocytes, and a mild or moderate (grade 1 or 2) fibrosis; six cases showed an increased number of dilated sinusoids and reactive lymphoid nodules. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that JAK2(V617F) mutation is associated with clinical and morphological features of the myeloproliferative type of CMML. Therefore, JAK2 mutation analysis together with bone marrow morphology could help in a more appropriate classification of the disease.","['Pich, A', 'Riera, L', 'Sismondi, F', 'Godio, L', 'Davico Bonino, L', 'Marmont, F', 'Francia di Celle, P']","['Pich A', 'Riera L', 'Sismondi F', 'Godio L', 'Davico Bonino L', 'Marmont F', 'Francia di Celle P']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, Section of Pathology, University of Turin, Turin, Italy. achille.pich@unito.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Platelet Count']",2009/09/08 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/08 06:00'],"['2009/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['62/9/798 [pii]', '10.1136/jcp.2009.065904 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2009 Sep;62(9):798-801. doi: 10.1136/jcp.2009.065904.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proto-oncogene c-Cbl negatively regulates Kit and Flt3 by its E3 ligase activity and acts as a scaffold. We recently identified the first c-Cbl mutation in human disease in an acute myeloid leukemia patient, called Cbl-R420Q. Here we analyzed the role of Cbl mutants on Kit-mediated transformation. Coexpression of Cbl-R420Q or Cbl-70Z with Kit induced cytokine-independent proliferation, survival, and clonogenic growth. Primary murine bone marrow retrovirally transduced with c-Cbl mutants and transplanted into mice led to a generalized mastocytosis, a myeloproliferative disease, and myeloid leukemia. Overexpression of these Cbl mutants inhibited stem cell factor (SCF)-induced ubiquitination and internalization of Kit. Both Cbl mutants enhanced the basal activation of Akt and prolonged the ligand-dependent activation. Importantly, transformation was observed also with kinase-dead forms of Kit and Flt3 in the presence of Cbl-70Z, but not in the absence of Kit or Flt3, suggesting a mechanism dependent on receptor tyrosine kinases, but independent of their kinase activity. Instead, transformation depends on the Src family kinase Fyn, as c-Cbl coimmunoprecipitated with Fyn and inhibition abolished transformation. These findings may explain primary resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeted at receptor tyrosine kinases.","['Bandi, Srinivasa Rao', 'Brandts, Christian', 'Rensinghoff, Marion', 'Grundler, Rebekka', 'Tickenbrock, Lara', 'Kohler, Gabriele', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Sargin, Bulent']","['Bandi SR', 'Brandts C', 'Rensinghoff M', 'Grundler R', 'Tickenbrock L', 'Kohler G', 'Duyster J', 'Berdel WE', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Serve H', 'Sargin B']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology and the Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090904,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Cbl protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Mastocytosis/etiology/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/etiology/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Ubiquitination']",2009/09/08 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/08 06:00'],"['2009/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38985-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-12-190934 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Nov 5;114(19):4197-208. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-12-190934.

We hypothesized that Pim kinase inhibition would affect B-cell survival. Identified from a screen of imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine compounds, SGI-1776 inhibits Pim-1, Pim-2, and Pim-3. Treatment of CLL cells with SGI-1776 results in a concentration-dependent induction of apoptosis. To elucidate its mechanism of action, we evaluated the effect of SGI-1776 on Pim kinase function. Unlike in replicating cells, phosphorylation of traditional Pim-1 kinase targets, phospho-Bad (Ser112) and histone H3 (Ser10), and cell-cycle proteins were unaffected by SGI-1776, suggesting an alternative mechanism in CLL. Protein levels of total c-Myc as well as phospho-c-Myc(Ser62), a Pim-1 target site, were decreased after SGI-1776 treatment. Levels of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), XIAP, and proapoptotic Bak and Bax were unchanged; however, a significant reduction in Mcl-1 was observed that was not caused by caspase-mediated cleavage of Mcl-1 protein. The mechanism of decline in Mcl-1 was at the RNA level and was correlated with inhibition of global RNA synthesis. Consistent with a decline in new RNA synthesis, MCL-1 transcript levels were decreased after treatment with SGI-1776. These data suggest that SGI-1776 induces apoptosis in CLL and that the mechanism involves Mcl-1 reduction.","['Chen, Lisa S', 'Redkar, Sanjeev', 'Bearss, David', 'Wierda, William G', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Chen LS', 'Redkar S', 'Bearss D', 'Wierda WG', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, University of Texas M.

We searched for additional genomic abnormalities in this acute myeloid leukemia subtype by performing single nucleotide polymorphism genomic arrays (SNP-chip) analysis on 48 newly diagnosed cases. Thirty-two patients (67%) had a normal genome by SNP-chip analysis (Group A), and 16 patients (33%) had one or more genomic abnormalities including copy number changes or copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity (Group B). Two samples had copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 6p including the PIM1 gene; and one of these cases had E135K mutation of Pim1. Interestingly, 38% of Group B and only 13% of Group A samples had a KIT-D816 mutation, suggesting that genomic alterations are often associated with a KIT-D816 mutation. Importantly, prognostic analysis revealed that overall survival and event-free survival of individuals in Group B were significantly worse than those in Group A.","['Akagi, Tadayuki', 'Shih, Lee-Yung', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Gerss, Joachim', 'Moore, Stephen R', 'Schreck, Rhona', 'Kawamata, Norihiko', 'Liang, Der-Cherng', 'Sanada, Masashi', 'Nannya, Yasuhito', 'Deneberg, Stefan', 'Zachariadis, Vasilios', 'Nordgren, Ann', 'Song, Jee Hoon', 'Dugas, Martin', 'Lehmann, Soren', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Akagi T', 'Shih LY', 'Ogawa S', 'Gerss J', 'Moore SR', 'Schreck R', 'Kawamata N', 'Liang DC', 'Sanada M', 'Nannya Y', 'Deneberg S', 'Zachariadis V', 'Nordgren A', 'Song JH', 'Dugas M', 'Lehmann S', 'Koeffler HP']","['Department of Stem Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takara-machi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan. tadayuki@staff.kanazawa-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Loss of Heterozygosity/genetics', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Survival Rate', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/09/08 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/08 06:00'],"['2009/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['94/9/1301 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.005744 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Sep;94(9):1301-6. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.005744.,PMC2738725,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted this study to investigate the mechanism of action of lenalidomide and the basis for its unique toxicities in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia were treated with lenalidomide 20 mg (n=10) or 10 mg (n=8) daily for 3 weeks on a 6-week cycle. Correlative studies assessed expression of co-stimulatory molecules on tumor cells, T-cell activation, cytokine levels, and changes in lymphocyte subsets. RESULTS: Lenalidomide upregulated the co-stimulatory molecule CD80 on chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma cells but not on normal peripheral blood B cells in vitro. T-cell activation was apparent in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, weak in mantle cell lymphoma, but absent in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and correlated with the upregulation of CD80 on B cells. Strong CD80 upregulation and T-cell activation predicted more severe side effects, manifesting in 83% of patients as a cytokine release syndrome within 8-72 h after the first dose of lenalidomide. Serum levels of various cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, increased during treatment. CD80 upregulation on tumor cells correlated with rapid clearance of leukemic cells from the peripheral blood. In contrast, neither the severity of the cytokine release syndrome nor the degree of T-cell activation in vitro correlated with clinical response. CONCLUSIONS: Upregulation of CD80 on tumor cells and T-cell activation correlate with unique toxicities of lenalidomide in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, T-cell activation appears to be dispensable for the drug's anti-tumor effects. This provides a rationale for combinations of lenalidomide with fludarabine or alemtuzumab.","['Aue, Georg', 'Njuguna, Ndegwa', 'Tian, Xin', 'Soto, Susan', 'Hughes, Thomas', 'Vire, Berengere', 'Keyvanfar, Keyvan', 'Gibellini, Federica', 'Valdez, Janet', 'Boss, Carol', 'Samsel, Leigh', 'McCoy, J Philip Jr', 'Wilson, Wyndham H', 'Pittaluga, Stefania', 'Wiestner, Adrian']","['Aue G', 'Njuguna N', 'Tian X', 'Soto S', 'Hughes T', 'Vire B', 'Keyvanfar K', 'Gibellini F', 'Valdez J', 'Boss C', 'Samsel L', 'McCoy JP Jr', 'Wilson WH', 'Pittaluga S', 'Wiestner A']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute/NIH, 10 Center Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892-1202, USA.']",['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Cytokines)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'B7-1 Antigen/*biosynthesis', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Syndrome', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Time Factors', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",2009/09/08 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/08 06:00'],"['2009/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['94/9/1266 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.005835 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Sep;94(9):1266-73. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.005835.,PMC2738719,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, to date, clinical trials have not shown a survival benefit. DESIGN AND METHODS: Using population-based data from Sweden, we assessed variations in survival among all chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients (n=11,179) reported from 1973-2003. Relative survival ratios were computed as measures of patient survival. RESULTS: Overall we found significantly improved (p<0.0001) 5-, 10-, and 20-year relative survival ratio for the entire cohort during the study period. Improved 5- and 10-year relative survival ratio was found for all age-groups (p<0.0001) and both sexes. Compared to females, however, males had a significantly inferior survival in all age groups and calendar periods (p<0.0001). Younger chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients had a superior survival compared to older chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, in all calendar periods (p<0.0001). Five-year relative survival ratio has not improved in the youngest chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients since the 1980s; however, older patients have had a continuous improvement in 5 year-relative survival ratio. CONCLUSIONS: The observed improvements are likely due to improved therapeutic developments and supportive care. Our findings suggest that elderly chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients might benefit more from the recently introduced drugs in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Future clinical trials are needed to better define underlying mechanisms of observed heterogeneity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia survival by age and sex, and evaluate the role of newer chronic lymphocytic leukemia therapy in the elderly.","['Kristinsson, Sigurdur Y', 'Dickman, Paul W', 'Wilson, Wyndham H', 'Caporaso, Neil', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus', 'Landgren, Ola']","['Kristinsson SY', 'Dickman PW', 'Wilson WH', 'Caporaso N', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Landgren O']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. sigurdur.kristinsson@karolins-ka.se']",['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2009/09/08 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/08 06:00'],"['2009/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['94/9/1259 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.007849 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Sep;94(9):1259-65. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.007849.,PMC2738718,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A major obstacle to successful treatment is cellular Bu-resistance. To investigate the possible contribution of DNA hypermethylation to Bu-resistance, we examined the cytotoxic activity of combined 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) and Bu. Exposure of Bu-resistant B5/Bu250(6) ML cells to 0.5 microM DAC resulted in G2-arrest and apoptosis. The observed G2-arrest was associated with hypomethylation and subsequent expression of epigenetically controlled genes including p16(INK4A), activation of the p53 pathway, and phosphorylation of CDC2. The DAC-mediated apoptosis was partly due to hypomethylation and up-regulation of XAF1, which resulted in down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2. The pro-apoptotic PUMA and BNIP3 proteins were up-regulated while pro-survival STAT3 and c-MYC were suppressed. Combination of 0.05 microM DAC and 5 microg/ml Bu resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity, which was associated with PARP1 cleavage and activation of caspases 3 and 8, suggesting induction of an apoptotic response. P53 inhibition in B5/Bu250(6) cells using pifithrin-alpha alleviated these effects, suggesting a role for p53 therein; this observation was supported by the relative resistance of p53-null K562 cells to [DAC+Bu] combinations and by the effects of an anti-p53 shRNA on the OCI-AML3 cell line. We conclude that the synergistic effects of [DAC+Bu] are p53-dependent and involve cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction and down-regulation of pro-survival genes. Our results suggest that, depending on tumor p53 status, incorporation of DAC might synergistically improve the cytoreductive efficacy of Bu-based pretransplant regimen in patients with ML.","['Valdez, Benigno C', 'Li, Yang', 'Murray, David', 'Corn, Paul', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Andersson, Borje S']","['Valdez BC', 'Li Y', 'Murray D', 'Corn P', 'Champlin RE', 'Andersson BS']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. bvaldez@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164-16/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672-289015/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090903,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Blotting, Western', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/genetics', 'Genes, cdc/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2009/09/08 06:00,2010/03/24 06:00,['2009/09/08 06:00'],"['2009/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/11 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00417-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.08.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Mar;34(3):364-72. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.08.014.

Whereas calotropin possesses cytotoxicity against several cancer cells, the mechanisms of action remain unclear. We set out to evaluate the cytotoxic mechanism of calotropin on human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells. Calotropin inhibited the growth of K562 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner by G(2)/M phase arrest. It upregulated the expression of p27 leading to this arrest by downregulating the G2/M regulatory proteins, cyclins A and B, and by upregulating the cdk inhibitor, p27. Furthermore, it downregulated anti-apoptotic signaling (XIAP and survivin) and survival pathways (p-Akt and NFkappaB), leading to caspase-3 activation which resulted in the induction of apoptosis. In all, calotropin exerted its anticancer activity on K562 cells by modulating the pro-survival signaling that leads to induction of apoptosis.","['Wang, Shih-Chung', 'Lu, Mei-Chin', 'Chen, Hsiu-Lin', 'Tseng, Hsing-I', 'Ke, Yu-Yuan', 'Wu, Yang-Chang', 'Yang, Pei-Yu']","['Wang SC', 'Lu MC', 'Chen HL', 'Tseng HI', 'Ke YY', 'Wu YC', 'Yang PY']","['Department of Pediatrics, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua 500, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090902,England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Cardenolides)', '3XK21U1BZS (calotropin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', '*Asclepias', 'Cardenolides/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells']",2009/09/08 06:00,2010/01/20 06:00,['2009/09/08 06:00'],"['2008/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S1065-6995(09)00189-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellbi.2009.08.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2009 Dec;33(12):1230-6. doi: 10.1016/j.cellbi.2009.08.013.

Expression levels of the DC maturation markers HLA-DR, CD86, CD83 and CD11c were studied using flow cytometry after 24 and 48 h exposure to the model compound nickel sulphate (100 and 300 microM). No maturation of MUTZ-3 DC was observed, whereas significantly upregulated expression levels of CD83 and CD86 were noticed in CD34-DC after 24h treatment with 300 microM nickel sulphate compared to control cells. Differential expression of the cytokine genes IL1beta, IL6, IL8, CCL2, CCL3, CCL3L1, CCL4 was analyzed using real-time RT-PCR after 6, 10 and 24h of nickel sulphate exposure. In response to 100 microM nickel sulphate MUTZ-3 DC revealed slightly upregulated mRNA levels after 24h, whereas 300 microM induced transcription of CCL3, CCL3L1 and IL8 significantly after 6 or 10h. These cytokine data correspond to the previously observed effects of 100 microM nickel sulphate in CD34-DC. Our findings underline the stimulatory capacity of nickel sulphate in MUTZ-3 DC with regard to cytokine mRNA induction, but not surface marker expression. Compared to CD34-DC, however, the studied endpoint markers seemed to be less inducible, making the MUTZ-3 DC model in its presented form less suitable for in vitro testing of sensitization. Further assessment of MUTZ-3 DC using other differentiation protocols and an extended set of chemicals will be required to reveal whether this cell line may be a valid alternative model system to primary CD34-DC.","['Nelissen, Inge', 'Selderslaghs, Ingrid', 'Heuvel, Rosette Van Den', 'Witters, Hilda', 'Verheyen, Geert R', 'Schoeters, Greet']","['Nelissen I', 'Selderslaghs I', 'Heuvel RV', 'Witters H', 'Verheyen GR', 'Schoeters G']","['Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO NV), Environmental Risk and Health, BE-2400 Mol, Belgium. inge.nelissen@vito.be']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090902,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)', '4FLT4T3WUN (nickel sulfate)', '7OV03QG267 (Nickel)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'Dendritic Cells/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Nickel/*toxicity', 'Phenotype']",2009/09/08 06:00,2010/01/21 06:00,['2009/09/08 06:00'],"['2008/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/25 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0887-2333(09)00237-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2009.08.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2009 Dec;23(8):1477-81. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2009.08.022.

An increase in DOX induced antitumor activity by cucurbitacin E in vivo has been reported previously. This paper attempts to clarify the mechanism of cucurbitacin E induced increments in the antitumor activity of DOX. MK-571, a multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP) inhibitor, significantly suppressed DOX efflux from M5076 ovarian sarcoma cells. The combination of cucurbitacin E with MK-571 also inhibited DOX efflux, whereas the efficacy was the same in each treatment. Namely, the inhibition of DOX efflux by cucurbitacin E was expected to be related to MRP. In contrast, it appeared that the effect of cucurbitacin E on DOX permeability did not relate to P-gp. The cucurbitacin E co-treatment significantly increased DOX concentration in the tumor within a short time after DOX administration, whereas the same treatment decreased the DOX concentration in normal tissues. The different effects of cucurbitacin E between tumor and normal tissues was speculated to be related to differences in DOX transport system on cell membrane. In DOX therapy, cucurbitacin E co-treatment was expected to increase DOX induced antitumor activity without an increase in adverse reactions due to DOX.","['Sadzuka, Yasuyuki', 'Hatakeyama, Haruna', 'Sonobe, Takashi']","['Sadzuka Y', 'Hatakeyama H', 'Sonobe T']","['School of Pharmacy, Iwate Medical University, Shiwa-gun, Iwate 028-3694, Japan. ysadzuka@iwate-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20090902,Netherlands,Int J Pharm,International journal of pharmaceutics,7804127,"['0 (Propionates)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '5Q9O54P0H7 (verlukast)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'V8A45XYI21 (cucurbitacin E)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Propionates/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Sarcoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Triterpenes/*administration & dosage/*metabolism']",2009/09/08 06:00,2010/07/30 06:00,['2009/09/08 06:00'],"['2009/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-5173(09)00607-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijpharm.2009.08.040 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Pharm. 2010 Jan 4;383(1-2):186-91. doi: 10.1016/j.ijpharm.2009.08.040.

These are especially useful to rationalize how external perturbations propagate through the expression of genes. To address this issue in the case of drug resistance, we constructed biological association networks of genes differentially expressed in cell lines resistant to methotrexate (MTX). METHODS: Seven cell lines representative of different types of cancer, including colon cancer (HT29 and Caco2), breast cancer (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468), pancreatic cancer (MIA PaCa-2), erythroblastic leukemia (K562) and osteosarcoma (Saos-2), were used. The differential expression pattern between sensitive and MTX-resistant cells was determined by whole human genome microarrays and analyzed with the GeneSpring GX software package. Genes deregulated in common between the different cancer cell lines served to generate biological association networks using the Pathway Architect software. RESULTS: Dikkopf homolog-1 (DKK1) is a highly interconnected node in the network generated with genes in common between the two colon cancer cell lines, and functional validations of this target using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) showed a chemosensitization toward MTX. Members of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A (UGT1A) family formed a network of genes differentially expressed in the two breast cancer cell lines. siRNA treatment against UGT1A also showed an increase in MTX sensitivity. Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (EEF1A1) was overexpressed among the pancreatic cancer, leukemia and osteosarcoma cell lines, and siRNA treatment against EEF1A1 produced a chemosensitization toward MTX. CONCLUSIONS: Biological association networks identified DKK1, UGT1As and EEF1A1 as important gene nodes in MTX-resistance. Treatments using siRNA technology against these three genes showed chemosensitization toward MTX.","['Selga, Elisabet', 'Oleaga, Carlota', 'Ramirez, Sara', 'de Almagro, M Cristina', 'Noe, Veronique', 'Ciudad, Carlos J']","['Selga E', 'Oleaga C', 'Ramirez S', 'de Almagro MC', 'Noe V', 'Ciudad CJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Pharmacy, University of Barcelona, Diagonal Avenue, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain. eliselga@ub.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090904,England,Genome Med,Genome medicine,101475844,,,,2009/09/08 06:00,2009/09/08 06:01,['2009/09/08 06:00'],"['2009/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/08 06:01 [medline]']","['gm83 [pii]', '10.1186/gm83 [doi]']",epublish,Genome Med. 2009 Sep 4;1(9):83. doi: 10.1186/gm83.,PMC2768990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated our 44 patients using CCG 7921 POG 9351 INT 0133, the therapeutic protocol of the North American cooperative Children's Oncology Group.The median of the follow up was 5.5 years (2-11 years). RESULTS: 40 patients went into complete remission. 19 patients suffered relapses. Of these, 17 patients died - 15 progressed, 1 died due to treatment-related toxicity, 1 died due to secondary acute myeloid leukaemia. As a whole, the patients had a 5-year overall survival rate (OS) of 58.4% and a 5-year event free survival rate (EFS) of 46.7%. The patients with localised extremity osteosarcoma (n = 40) had a 5-year EFS rate of 51%.

METHODS: Immunofluorescence method was used to detect the distribution of WAVE1 and MMP-2 in the cells. K562 cells were transfected with pcDNA3. 1-WAVE1 reconstructed plasmid or with specific siRNA to WAVE1 gene. The invasion ability of K562 cells was examined by Transwell assay. The expression level of WAVE1 and MMP-2 in K562 cells was assayed by real-time PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: (1) WAVE1 and MMP-2 mainly expressed and co-localized in the cell membrane; (2) 24 h and 48 h after transfected with pcDNA3. 1-WAVE1, the MMP-2 mRNA level in K562 cells increased by 295% and 198% while its protein increased by 80% and 23% respectively as compared with control K562 cells. At the same time point after transfected with specific siRNA, the MMP-2 mRNA level decreased by 81% and 28%, and its protein decreased by 36% and 53% respectively as compared with control. (3) The invasion ability of K562 cells was enhanced after transfected with pcDNA3. 1-WAVE1 and depressed after transfected with the specific siRNA.

Therefore, we aimed at characterizing the pharmacokinetics for daunorubicin in infants and examined their relationship to age, body weight, and body surface area. PROCEDURE: Leukemia patients treated according to the Interfant 99 protocol received 30 mg/m(2) daunorubicin, with dose reduction to 3/4 for patients 6-12 months old and 2/3 for patients <6 months, respectively. Plasma samples from 21 patients (aged 0.05-1.88 years) were collected and analyzed for daunorubicin and daunorubicinol. Samples from 12 children (age 1.6-18.8 years), who received daunorubicin in an earlier investigation, were used for pharmacokinetic model building using the software NONMEM. RESULTS: Plasma concentration time profiles could be described using a two compartment model. Daunorubicin clearance was 43.9 L hr(-1) m(-2) +/- 65% and central volume of distribution 16.4 L m(-2) +/- 46%, whereas apparent clearance of daunorubicinol was 19.1 L hr(-1) m(-2) +/- 32% and apparent volume of distribution 228 L m(-2) +/- 80% (mean +/- interindividual variability). No age-dependency in any of the BSA-normalized pharmacokinetic parameters was observed. Consequently, due to the empirical dose reduction in infants the overall exposure to daunorubicinol in infants was smaller than would be expected from older children. Patients aged <6 months experienced more infections in the induction phase than the group aged 6-12 months at diagnosis. Other toxicities were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: We observed no indication of an age-dependency in the pharmacokinetics of daunorubicin.

Since the introduction of imatinib into the treatment of this disease, the role of allogeneic HCT is more uncertain. PROCEDURE: We investigated the impact of remission status, graft source, and imatinib use on transplant outcomes for 37 children with Ph+ ALL who received an allogeneic HCT at the University of Minnesota between 1990 and 2006. The median age at HCT was 7.47 (range; 1.4-16.4) years. Thirteen patients received imatinib therapy pre- and/or post-HCT (imatinib group) and 24 patients, received either no imatinib (n = 23) or only post-HCT relapse (n = 1) (non-imatinib group). RESULTS: There was no difference in disease-free survival (DFS) or relapse between the imatinib and non-imatinib groups at 3 years (62%/15% vs. 53%/26%; P = 0.99; 0.81, respectively). There was no significant difference in transplant outcomes between matched related donor or unrelated donor (umbilical cord blood or matched unrelated marrow) recipients whereas patients receiving allogeneic HCT in first remission (CR1) had superior DFS and less relapse compared to patients transplanted in >or=CR2 (71%/16% vs. 29%/36%; P = 0.01; P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Based on this retrospective analysis at a single institution, the use of imatinib either pre- and/or post-transplant does not appear to significantly impact outcomes for children with Ph+ ALL and allogeneic HCT with the best available donor should be encouraged in CR1.","['Burke, Michael J', 'Cao, Qing', 'Trotz, Barb', 'Weigel, Brenda', 'Kumar, Ashish', 'Smith, Angela', 'Verneris, Michael R']","['Burke MJ', 'Cao Q', 'Trotz B', 'Weigel B', 'Kumar A', 'Smith A', 'Verneris MR']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA. burke283@umn.edu']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/statistics & numerical data', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Postoperative Complications/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/09/05 06:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/09/05 06:00'],"['2009/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22263 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Dec 15;53(7):1289-94. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22263.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequently, the incidence of other cancers gradually increased while that of leukemia decreased. We examined the long-term clinical outcome of gastric cancer and second primary cancer in atomic bomb survivors. METHODS: Results of surgical treatment of gastric cancer were reviewed in 231 atomic bomb survivors and 759 control patients between 1995 and 2006. RESULTS: Long-term prognosis of gastric cancer in atomic bomb survivors was significantly poorer than that in control patients (P < 0.05). In a multivariate analysis, age, depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastases, and curability were found to be significant and independent prognostic factors for gastric cancer. The incidence of second primary cancer after gastric cancer was significantly higher in survivors than in control patients (P < 0.01), because the number of elderly patients in the survivors was higher. CONCLUSIONS: Gastric cancer in survivors had a significantly poorer prognosis. Although the frequency of second primary cancer after gastric cancer in survivors was higher than that in control patients, it did not influence the prognosis.","['Yamamoto, Manabu', 'Matsuyama, Ayumi', 'Kameyama, Toshifumi', 'Okamoto, Masahiro', 'Okazaki, Jin', 'Utsunomiya, Tohru', 'Tsutsui, Shinichi', 'Ishida, Teruyoshi']","['Yamamoto M', 'Matsuyama A', 'Kameyama T', 'Okamoto M', 'Okazaki J', 'Utsunomiya T', 'Tsutsui S', 'Ishida T']","['Department of Surgery, Hiroshima Atomic Bomb Survivors Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan. mayama@hiroshima-med.jrc.or.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Surg Oncol,Journal of surgical oncology,0222643,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma/mortality/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology', '*Nuclear Weapons', 'Prognosis', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*mortality/pathology', '*Survivors']",2009/09/05 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/05 06:00'],"['2009/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jso.21399 [doi]'],ppublish,J Surg Oncol. 2009 Dec 1;100(7):594-7. doi: 10.1002/jso.21399.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a recent study suggests that mda-7/IL-24 promotes the survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia B-cells. In this study, we showed that mda-7/IL-24 was constitutively expressed in leukemia cell lines and primary acute myeloid leukemia samples. Using a conditionally replicating adenovirus expressing mda-7/IL-24 (ZD55-IL-24), we showed that enforced expression of mda-7/IL-24 in leukemia cells induced autophagy, which was triggered by the upregulation of Beclin-1. Immunofluorescence and coimmunoprecipitation studies suggested that mda-7/IL-24 protein interacts with Beclin-1. Class III PI3K/Beclin-1 complex was shown involved in the mda-7/IL-24-induced autophagy. Moreover, autophagy inhibition by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, resulted in a reduced Beclin-1 expression and autophagosome formation associated with significantly enhanced cell death. Importantly, the combination of ZD55-IL-24 with wortmannin elicited a strongly enhanced antileukemia efficacy in established leukemia xenografts. These results suggest that mda-7/IL-24-induced autophagy in leukemia cells may provide survival advantage and mda-7/IL-24 combined with agents that disrupt autophagy is a promising new strategy for the treatment of leukemia.","['Yang, C', 'Tong, Y', 'Ni, W', 'Liu, J', 'Xu, W', 'Li, L', 'Liu, X', 'Meng, H', 'Qian, W']","['Yang C', 'Tong Y', 'Ni W', 'Liu J', 'Xu W', 'Li L', 'Liu X', 'Meng H', 'Qian W']","['Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Key Laboratory of Combined Multi-Organ Transplantation, Ministry of Public Health, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090904,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (interleukin-24)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Androstadienes/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Autophagy/genetics/*physiology', 'Beclin-1', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Interleukins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Wortmannin']",2009/09/05 06:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2009/09/05 06:00'],"['2009/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['cgt200957 [pii]', '10.1038/cgt.2009.57 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2010 Feb;17(2):109-19. doi: 10.1038/cgt.2009.57.

The objectives of the current work were to use a pharmacokinetic model to refine the trough levels obtained at different sampling times and to propose a therapeutic drug monitoring algorithm and an acceptable sampling time window for imatinib trough sampling. METHODS: The pharmacokinetics of IM in patients (pts) with CML were characterized based on historical data from a Phase III study. In the elimination phase the concentration of IM (C(t)) follows a mono-exponential decline, and the standardized trough concentration (C(min,std) = C(tau)) can be described by a simple algorithm C(min,std) = C(t)* exp(k(e) x Delta t), where Delta t = t - tau, and tau is 24 hours for qd or 12 hours for bid dosing and k(e) is the elimination rate constant. The percent deviation of C(t) from C(min,std) was simulated for different Delta t and k(e) values to define a sampling time window Delta t, within which the percent deviation is <20%. RESULTS: Simulation analysis shows that C(t) is largely dependent on Delta t and k(e). The percent deviation of C(t) at 3 hours before or after tau from C(min,std) will be 7.1%, 13.1%, and 23.4% for pts with low, typical, and high k(e) values, 0.023/hour, 0.041/hour, and 0.070/hour, respectively. However, if a correction is made for C(t) by the algorithm using the typical k(e) value of 0.041 per hour, the percent deviation at 3 hours will be reduced to 5.3%, 0%, and 9.1% for pts with low, typical, and high k(e) values, respectively. Even if the sampling window is extended to +/-6 hours, the corresponding percent deviation will still be reasonable: 10.2%, 0%, and 19.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: By using the algorithm, the pharmacokinetic sampling window can be extended to a wider window to make the trough sampling easy to implement in the clinical setting, provided that the sampling time and dosing time are accurately recorded.","['Wang, Yanfeng', 'Chia, Yen Lin', 'Nedelman, Jerry', 'Schran, Horst', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier', 'Molimard, Mathieu']","['Wang Y', 'Chia YL', 'Nedelman J', 'Schran H', 'Mahon FX', 'Molimard M']","['Clinical Pharmacology Oncology, , Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Florham Park, New Jersey 07932, USA. yanfeng.wang@novartis.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Benzamides', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2009/09/05 06:00,2010/01/19 06:00,['2009/09/05 06:00'],"['2009/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/FTD.0b013e3181b2c8cf [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2009 Oct;31(5):579-84. doi: 10.1097/FTD.0b013e3181b2c8cf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequent chromosome analysis of his blood lymphocytes revealed a constitutional karyotype 46,XY,t(6;9) (p12;p24) that has not been previously reported. Seeking for gene disruption correlated with the B-CLL we precisely mapped both breakpoints by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with chromosome-specific bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones and their long-range polymerase chain reaction (LRPCR) subfragments. An 11-kb LRPCR subfragment derived from RP11-399A15 was found to span the breakpoint at 6p12.1. FISH analysis with a 12-kb LRPCR fragment derived from RP11-147I11 which overlaps with RP11-110M16 as well as with a cDNA for DMRT2 (doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 2) maps the 9p24.3 breakpoint maximum 10 kb upstream from DMRT2. In silico analysis of the transcripts within the vicinity of the breakpoints revealed that the translocation does not disrupt any known genes but could affect the putative DMRT2 promoter.

We also implicate distinctive regulatory elements that promote the splicing of exon 1A to the distal 3' ss and exon 1B to the proximal 3' ss in murine erythroleukemia cells. A hybrid minigene driven by cytomegalovirus promoter mimicked 1B-promoter-driven splicing patterns but differed from 1A-promoter-driven splicing patterns, suggesting that promoter identity affects exon 2'/2 splicing. Furthermore, splicing factor SF2/ASF ultraviolet (UV) cross-linked to the exon 2'/2 junction CAGAGAA, a sequence that overlaps the distal U2AF(35)-binding 3' ss. Consequently, depletion of SF2/ASF allowed exon 1B to splice to the distal 3' ss but had no effect on exon 1A splicing.

Since viruses use cellular RNA binding proteins for viral RNA processing, it is presumable that the splicing of cellular pre-mRNAs is affected by viral infection. Here, we showed that herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) modifies the expression of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) isoforms by altering pre-mRNA splicing. Using a newly developed virus-sensitive splicing reporter, we identified the viral protein ICP27 as an alternative splicing regulator of PML isoforms. ICP27 was found to bind preferentially to PML pre-mRNA and directly inhibit the removal of PML intron 7a in vitro. Moreover, we demonstrated that ICP27 functions as a splicing silencer at the 3' splice site of the PML intron 7a. The switching of PML isoform from PML-II to PML-V as induced by ICP27 affected HSV-2 replication, suggesting that the viral protein modulates the splicing code of cellular pre-mRNA(s) governing virus propagation.","['Nojima, Takayuki', 'Oshiro-Ideue, Takako', 'Nakanoya, Hiroto', 'Kawamura, Hidenobu', 'Morimoto, Tomomi', 'Kawaguchi, Yasushi', 'Kataoka, Naoyuki', 'Hagiwara, Masatoshi']","['Nojima T', 'Oshiro-Ideue T', 'Nakanoya H', 'Kawamura H', 'Morimoto T', 'Kawaguchi Y', 'Kataoka N', 'Hagiwara M']","['Department of Functional Genomics, Laboratory of Gene Expression, School of Biomedical Science, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090903,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA Precursors)', '0 (RNA Splice Sites)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Herpesvirus 2, Human', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA/metabolism', 'RNA Precursors/metabolism', 'RNA Splice Sites', '*RNA Splicing', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/09/05 06:00,2009/12/22 06:00,['2009/09/05 06:00'],"['2009/09/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['gkp633 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkp633 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Oct;37(19):6515-27. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkp633.

This study investigated how outcome metrics and baseline creatinine affect trial outcome. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A one-compartment pharmacokinetic model of creatinine change resulting from a decrease in GFR was applied to a population of 10,000 simulated virtual inpatients. Treatment was simulated as an amelioration of GFR decrease by a specified percentage, the treatment efficacy, in 50%. Three categorical and two continuous outcome metrics were calculated and compared. Outcomes were compared for measured and estimated baseline creatinine levels that were back-calculated assuming a GFR of 100 or 75 ml/min. RESULTS: The continuous metrics, the average value of creatinine and the average value of creatinine relative to baseline decreased approximately linearly with increase in treatment efficacy. The categorical metrics displayed a sigmoidal decrease and erroneously suggested perfect treatment when GFR decrease was ameliorated by only 60 to 80%. Using an estimate of baseline creatinine increased the number of patients who were classified as having AKI. CONCLUSIONS: When used to determine clinical trial outcome, continuous metrics correctly detected the extent of intervention. At low treatment efficacy, categorical metrics underestimated and at high treatment efficacy overestimated the effect of treatment. These effects were exaggerated when the population contained a high proportion of patients with more severe AKI. An estimated baseline creatinine level will overestimate AKI prevalence compared with a measured baseline value. Clinical trials of AKI should use a continuous outcome metric and a measured baseline and report baseline median and interquartile range.","['Pickering, John W', 'Frampton, Christopher M', 'Endre, Zoltan H']","['Pickering JW', 'Frampton CM', 'Endre ZH']","['Christchurch Kidney Research Group, Department of Medicine, University of Otago-Christchurch, P.O.

As is the case with most erythroid leukaemias, the patient had a very aggressive clinical course and died shortly after diagnosis. It is believed that this is the first reported case of systemic mastocytosis with erythroid leukaemia where the KIT(D816V+) mutation was detected in all three cell types. Molecular findings provide evidence for derivation of these seemingly morphologically distinct lesions from the same clonal precursor cell.

These were mostly breast and colon cancer, or colon polyposis patients in whom mutation analyses of the BRCA1, BRCA2, MLH1, MSH2, APC or TP53 genes did not detect a pathogenic germline mutation. Heteroduplex analysis and direct sequencing were used for mutation screening. Mutation-specific methods were designed for frequency determination of novel variants in the general population. No deleterious nonsense or frameshift germline mutations were detected. Several missense single-nucleotide substitutions were found, including two novel missense variants, c.83C>T (p.Thr28Ile) in exon 1 in a 42-year-old breast cancer patient and c.1558C>T (p.Pro520Ser) in exon 6 in a 32-year-old colon cancer patient, that were not detected in 100 and 214 non-cancer persons, respectively.

Although it is generally well tolerated, some patients require temporary drug discontinuation and permanent dose reduction because of haematological or non-haematological toxicities. Whether or not reduced doses are effective as the standard dose in inducing and/or maintaining complete cytogenetic and molecular response is not clear. We report the outcome of 45 CML patients in early (17) and late (28) chronic phase (CP) in whom, within a series of 250 patients treated with imatinib, reduced the dose of the drug after experiencing adverse events. Median time interval between the start of therapy and dose reduction was 58 days, whereas median administered dose was 300 mg/day. At 6 months from reduction, major cytogenetic responses (MCRs) were observed in 67% of patients, with 58% being complete cytogenetic remission (CCR), and complete molecular response (CMR) were obtained in 18% of patients. At 12 months, all patients who had obtained MCR reached CCR: this was significantly higher in low risk patients (87%) versus non-low risk patients (66 and 46%), and in early phase (82%) versus late phase (53.5%). CMR and major molecular response (MMR) were detected in 20 and 22% of patients, respectively.

We analysed the biopsy results for diagnostic yield, factors affecting diagnostic yield and effect on treatment. Of 213 procedures, 191 (89.7%) yielded sufficient material for pathologic analysis; 130 (60%) yielded specific diagnoses, while 61 (28.6%) yielded nonspecific benign diagnoses. Lesions larger than 1 cm, cavitary lesions and lung masses were more likely to yield a specific diagnosis than were lesions smaller than 1 cm, lung nodules and consolidations. The most common specific diagnoses were malignancy (62.8%) and infection (34.3%). The latter was more common in patients with leukaemia, cavitary lung lesions or consolidations, active underlying malignancy, neutropenia, respiratory signs and symptoms and/or fever, bone marrow transplant recipients, and in patients receiving chemotherapy. Lung lesions discovered upon follow-up imaging in patients who did not have any respiratory signs/symptoms or fever were mostly malignant. Therapeutic changes were more likely after a specific diagnosis than after a nonspecific diagnosis or a nondiagnostic biopsy (88.4% vs. 18.1%; p < 0.0001).

These cases are currently diagnosed as chronic eosinophilic leukaemia (CEL). In this paper, we screened 77 patients to estimate the frequency of FIP1L1-PDGFRA transcript among patients with unexplained, long-term hypereosinophilia exceeding 1.5 x 10(9)/L and to analyse the clinical and serological features in F/P+ CEL population. The FIP1L1-PDGFRA chimeric protein was detectable in 16 (14 males and 2 females) out of 77 examined HES patients (20%) by RT-PCR. Two patients suffered from cough at diagnosis. Three out of 16 (18%) patients had no organ involvements, in 5-one organ was affected and in the remaining eight cases-at least two. Eosinophilic organ damage/dysfunction identified splenomegaly in the majority of studied patients. We compared clinical and serological features between CEL F/P+ (n = 16) and HES (n = 61) patients. F/P+ cases had significantly increased WBC and absolute eosinophil count (AEC) at diagnosis (p = 0.008 and 0.02), whereas platelet count was decreased in this population (p = 0.03). Serum B12 and tryptase levels were increased (p = 0.002 and 0.004) in CEL F/P+ patients when compared to HES cases whereas serum IL-5 levels were significantly increased in the latter group (p = 0.01). Male gender and splenomegaly occurred more frequent in CEL F/P+ population (p = 0.002 and 0.0007, respectively). Additionally, patients with F/P+ CEL (n = 16) were compared with F/P- CEL (n = 8). The latter group, was significantly older, had lower AEC and higher platelet count. In conclusion, significant clinical symptoms are infrequent present and splenomegaly remains the most common organ involvement in patients with CEL expressing F/P fusion transcript.

That the cells grew well in the normal medium (RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mM l-glutamine) as the parental cells also suggests that these cells contain functional mitochondria and mtDNA molecules. Further experiments showed that the cells cultured in the medium with pyruvate and uridine rather rapidly and strongly adhered on the culture flask walls while the cells cultured in the medium without pyruvate and uridine either floated or only very loosely covered the culture flask walls. Ultrastructural examination showed that the floating cells, which were often found in the culture without pyruvate and uridine, were rather similar to monocytes in nature, like the original U937 cells, while the attached larger cells appearing earlier in the culture with pyruvate and uridine demonstrated macrophage differentiation, indicating a differentiation effect of pyruvate and uridine on the cells.","['Liu, Yishan', 'Geng, Li', 'Suo, Zhenhe']","['Liu Y', 'Geng L', 'Suo Z']","['Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Ultrastruct Pathol,Ultrastructural pathology,8002867,"['8558G7RUTR (Pyruvic Acid)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/*drug effects/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Mitochondria/ultrastructure', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pyruvic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Uridine/*pharmacology']",2009/09/04 06:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/09/04 06:00'],"['2009/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['914188857 [pii]', '10.1080/01913120902889187 [doi]']",ppublish,Ultrastruct Pathol. 2009 Jul-Aug;33(4):160-4. doi: 10.1080/01913120902889187.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twelve BM samples from hospital control (HC) patients with no signs of hematological malignancy were studied using five 8-color monoclonal antibody combinations detecting subsets of CD34+ cells.

Several subsets of CD34+ precursor cells were found to be present at very low frequencies (<10(-4)) in BM and/or HSC-B collections. All six HSC-B collections from AML patients showed MRD by 8-color technique and only three by previously applied 3-color method. The 8-color technique showed promising results in efficient detection of different CD34+ subpopulations of HSC-B and in MRD quantification.

Place of death, medications used at end of life (EOL), and discussions prior to death are examined. METHODS: Data were obtained from a retrospective review of medical charts from 103 adolescents who died of cancer between 2000 and 2005. RESULTS: Adolescents with leukemia/lymphoma were relatively more likely to die in an intensive care unit (p = 0.028) where cause of death was more likely to be treatment-related (p < 0.001), and EOL discussions more likely to occur in the last 7 days of life (p = 0.002). Anxiolytic use was significantly higher during late adolescence (p = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents have unique developmental needs that should be considered at EOL.

ZAP70 status was determined by immunoblotting. RESULTS: Of all analyzed transporters, MDR1, MDR2, MRP1, MRP4, MRP5, and MRP7 were expressed at a significantly higher level in B lymphocytes when compared with other hematopoietic cells in peripheral blood. A subgroup of 41 CLL patient samples showed similar or higher expression of these genes than control B cells, and CLL cells exhibited high expression when compared with multiple lymphoma cell lines. No significant correlation between ZAP70 expression and ABC transporter expression was observed.

The 5 year overall-survival was better than other patients with ALL (p = 0.06, by logrank test). Significantly longer SPI in these patients underscores the need for prompt and early investigations to rule out ALL in patients of JRA with atypical features and pointers of ALL.

The bone marrow (BM) is a dynamic network of growth factors, cytokines and stromal cells, providing a permissive environment for leukemogenesis and progression. Both BM stroma and leukemic blasts promote angiogenesis, which is increased in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. Growth factors like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor and angiopoietins are the main proangiogenic mediators in acute leukemia. Autocrine proleukemic loops have been described for VEGF and angiopoietin in hematopoietic cells. Interactions of stromal cells and extracellular matrix with leukemic blasts can also generate antiapoptotic signals that contribute to neoplastic progression and persistence of treatment-resistant minimal residual disease. High expression of CXC chemokine ligand 4 (CXCR4) by leukemic blasts and activation of the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis is involved in leukemia progression and disruption of normal hematopoiesis. Leukemia-associated bone microenvironment markers could be used as prognostic or predictive indicators of disease progression and/or treatment outcome. Studies related to bone microenvironment would likely provide a better understanding of the treatment resistance associated with leukemia therapy and design of new treatments.","['Ayala, F', 'Dewar, R', 'Kieran, M', 'Kalluri, R']","['Ayala F', 'Dewar R', 'Kieran M', 'Kalluri R']","['Division of Matrix Biology, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, 3 Blackfan Circle, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['DK61688/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK55001/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AA013913/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK061688/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK062987/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA125550/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA125550/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK055001/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK62987/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AA13913/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090903,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/chemistry/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/*pathology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/etiology/pathology']",2009/09/04 06:00,2010/01/15 06:00,['2009/09/04 06:00'],"['2009/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009175 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.175 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Dec;23(12):2233-41. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.175.

Nf1 encodes neurofibromin, a GTPase-activating protein that terminates Ras signalling by stimulating hydrolysis of Ras-GTP. We compared the effects of inhibitors of MEK in a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) initiated by inactivating Nf1 in mouse bone marrow and in acute myeloid leukaemias (AMLs) in which cooperating mutations were induced by retroviral insertional mutagenesis. Here we show that MEK inhibitors are ineffective in MPD, but induce objective regression of many Nf1-deficient AMLs. Drug resistance developed because of outgrowth of AML clones that were present before treatment. We cloned clone-specific retroviral integrations to identify candidate resistance genes including Rasgrp1, Rasgrp4 and Mapk14, which encodes p38alpha. Functional analysis implicated increased RasGRP1 levels and reduced p38 kinase activity in resistance to MEK inhibitors. This approach represents a robust strategy for identifying genes and pathways that modulate how primary cancer cells respond to targeted therapeutics and for probing mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance.","['Lauchle, Jennifer O', 'Kim, Doris', 'Le, Doan T', 'Akagi, Keiko', 'Crone, Michael', 'Krisman, Kimberly', 'Warner, Kegan', 'Bonifas, Jeannette M', 'Li, Qing', 'Coakley, Kristen M', 'Diaz-Flores, Ernesto', 'Gorman, Matthew', 'Przybranowski, Sally', 'Tran, Mary', 'Kogan, Scott C', 'Roose, Jeroen P', 'Copeland, Neal G', 'Jenkins, Nancy A', 'Parada, Luis', 'Wolff, Linda', 'Sebolt-Leopold, Judith', 'Shannon, Kevin']","['Lauchle JO', 'Kim D', 'Le DT', 'Akagi K', 'Crone M', 'Krisman K', 'Warner K', 'Bonifas JM', 'Li Q', 'Coakley KM', 'Diaz-Flores E', 'Gorman M', 'Przybranowski S', 'Tran M', 'Kogan SC', 'Roose JP', 'Copeland NG', 'Jenkins NA', 'Parada L', 'Wolff L', 'Sebolt-Leopold J', 'Shannon K']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.']",['eng'],"['U01 CA084221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA72614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA119105-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32HD044331/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA084221-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA119105-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA072614-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA84221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA084221-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA119105-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA072614-12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA072614-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009043/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA084221-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09043/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA072614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA084221-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA084221-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA119105-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HD044331/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA128583/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA119105/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090902,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (2-(2-chloro-4-iodophenylamino)-N-cyclopropylmethoxy-3,4-difluorobenzamide)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Rasgrp1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Genes, ras', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'ras Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/09/04 06:00,2009/10/14 06:00,['2009/09/04 06:00'],"['2009/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['nature08279 [pii]', '10.1038/nature08279 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2009 Sep 17;461(7262):411-4. doi: 10.1038/nature08279.

Apoptosis is triggered when a peptide containing a BH3 motif or a small molecule BH3 peptidomimetic, such as ABT 737, binds to the relevant Bcl-2 family members. ABT-737 is an antagonist of Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), and Bcl-w but not of Mcl-1. Here we describe new structures of mutant BH3 peptides bound to Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1. These structures suggested a rationale for the failure of ABT-737 to bind Mcl-1, but a designed variant of ABT-737 failed to acquire binding affinity for Mcl-1. Rather, it was selective for Bcl-x(L), a result attributable in part to significant backbone refolding and movements of helical segments in its ligand binding site. To date there are few reported crystal structures of organic ligands in complex with their pro-survival protein targets. Our structure of this new organic ligand provided insights into the structural transitions that occur within the BH3 binding groove, highlighting significant differences in the structural properties of members of the Bcl-2 pro-survival protein family. Such differences are likely to influence and be important in the quest for compounds capable of selectively antagonizing the different family members.","['Lee, Erinna F', 'Czabotar, Peter E', 'Yang, Hong', 'Sleebs, Brad E', 'Lessene, Guillaume', 'Colman, Peter M', 'Smith, Brian J', 'Fairlie, W Douglas']","['Lee EF', 'Czabotar PE', 'Yang H', 'Sleebs BE', 'Lessene G', 'Colman PM', 'Smith BJ', 'Fairlie WD']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090902,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments/*chemistry/genetics', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/chemistry/metabolism']",2009/09/04 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/04 06:00'],"['2009/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)38105-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.040725 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Oct 30;284(44):30508-17. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.040725.

The viral protein p12 previously has been characterized to interfere with major histocompatibility complex class, ICAM-1, and ICAM-2 expression, and it activates STAT5. Using a previously established T-cell line immortalized with an HTLV-1 molecular clone deleted for p12, we assessed the role of p12 in regulating cellular growth and virus transmission. These cells were complemented for p12 expression by the transduction of a lentivirus vector expressing p12. We report that p12 conferred a selective growth advantage in vitro and increased the colony formation of human T cells in soft-agar assays. Consistently with previous studies, p12- and p12+ cell lines produced similar amounts of virus particles released into the supernatant of cultured cells, although we found that p12 expression greatly enhanced virus transmission. Moreover, we found that interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulation also increased HTLV-1 transmission whether p12 was expressed or not, and inversely, that the inhibition of Jak signaling significantly reduced HTLV-1 transmission. Intriguingly, IL-2/Jak signaling was not associated with changes in viral gene expression, viral RNA encapsidation, the maturation of the virus particle, cell-cell adherence, or Gag polarization and virological synapse formation.

This restriction is accompanied by hypermutations in the retroviral genome that are attributable to the cytidine deaminase activity of the APOBEC3 proteins. Studies of nucleotide sequence diversity among endogenous gammaretroviruses suggest that the evolution of endogenous retroelements could have been shaped by the mutagenic cytidine deaminase activity of APOBEC3. In mice, however, APOBEC3 appears to restrict exogenous murine retroviruses in the absence of detectable levels of deamination. AKV is an endogenous retrovirus that is involved in causing a high incidence of thymic lymphoma in AKR mice. A comparative analysis of several mouse strains revealed a relatively low level of APOBEC3 expression in AKR mice. Here we show that endogenous mouse APOBEC3 restricts AKV infection and that this restriction likely reflects polymorphisms affecting APOBEC3 abundance rather than differences in the APOBEC3 isoforms expressed. We also observe that restriction of AKV by APOBEC3 is accompanied by G-->A hypermutations in the viral genome. Our findings demonstrate that APOBEC3 acts as a restriction factor in rodents affecting the strain tropism of AKV, and they provide good support for the proposal that APOBEC3-mediated hypermutation contributed to the evolution of endogenous rodent retroviral genomes.","['Langlois, Marc-Andre', 'Kemmerich, Kristin', 'Rada, Cristina', 'Neuberger, Michael S']","['Langlois MA', 'Kemmerich K', 'Rada C', 'Neuberger MS']","['Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Hills Road, Cambridge, United Kingdom CB2 0QH. langlois@uottawa.ca']",['eng'],"['MC_U105178806/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090902,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['EC 3.5.4.5 (Apobec3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Rats', 'Retroviridae Infections/virology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein', 'Tumor Virus Infections/virology']",2009/09/04 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/04 06:00'],"['2009/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01430-09 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01430-09 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2009 Nov;83(22):11550-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01430-09.

Most new genes arise from existing genes through duplication or recombination. The origin of new genes from noncoding DNA is extremely rare, and very few eukaryotic examples are known. We present evidence for the de novo origin of at least three human protein-coding genes since the divergence with chimp. Each of these genes has no protein-coding homologs in any other genome, but is supported by evidence from expression and, importantly, proteomics data. The absence of these genes in chimp and macaque cannot be explained by sequencing gaps or annotation error. High-quality sequence data indicate that these loci are noncoding DNA in other primates. Furthermore, chimp, gorilla, gibbon, and macaque share the same disabling sequence difference, supporting the inference that the ancestral sequence was noncoding over the alternative possibility of parallel gene inactivation in multiple primate lineages. The genes are not well characterized, but interestingly, one of them was first identified as an up-regulated gene in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This is the first evidence for entirely novel human-specific protein-coding genes originating from ancestrally noncoding sequences. We estimate that 0.075% of human genes may have originated through this mechanism leading to a total expectation of 18 such cases in a genome of 24,000 protein-coding genes.","['Knowles, David G', 'McLysaght, Aoife']","['Knowles DG', 'McLysaght A']","['Smurfit Institute of Genetics, University of Dublin, Trinity College, Ireland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090902,United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,"['0 (DNA, Intergenic)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Intergenic/analysis/genetics', 'Databases, Genetic', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Genes/physiology', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/physiology', 'Pan troglodytes/genetics', 'Phylogeny', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",2009/09/04 06:00,2009/12/18 06:00,['2009/09/04 06:00'],"['2009/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['gr.095026.109 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.095026.109 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2009 Oct;19(10):1752-9. doi: 10.1101/gr.095026.109.

METHODS: A total of 113 cases of de nove adult AML-M(5) were examined genetically and immunologically using G-banding technique, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) and flow cytometry immunophenotyping, and the results were analyzed in relation to their clinical data. RESULTS: Of the 113 cases, the expression rates of CD56 and CD11b was 28.32% and 73.45%, respectively. The CD56(+) patients had high CD11b expression, and the expression levels of CD11b and CD56 were positively correlated (P<0.05). The incidence of karyotypic abnormalities was 48.57% (55 cases) in these patients, including 25 (22.12%) with 11q23 aberrations. Twenty-five cases were positive for MLL gene abnormalities as found by I-FISH analysis. Compared with the patients positive for both CD56 and CD11b, those negative for both CD56 and CD11b showed increased peripheral blood white blood cell (WBC) count and also increased blast and progenitor cells in the bone marrow (P<0.05); the former patients often had karyotypic abnormalities, commonly involving 11q23 aberrations (P<0.05), whereas the latter patients presented more likely with extramedullary infiltration and refractory leukemia (P<0.01) with lowered complete remission rate and shortened median survival time (P<0.01). CD56-positive patients were more likely to have karyotypic abnormalities and refractory leukemia than CD11b-postive patients (P<0.05), but the peripheral blood WBC counts, bone marrow blast and progenitor cells, extramedullary infiltration, complete remission rate or median survival time showed no significant differences between them (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: AML-M(5) patients with CD56 positivity and high expression of CD11b often have aberrant karyotypes, commonly involving 11q23/MLL gene abnormality.

The family medical history is a ""genomic tool"" capturing interactions of genetic susceptibility, shared environment and common behaviours. METHODS: A cohort of 66 consecutives patients with CLL (probands) was studied in a medical oncology practice (W.W.) from 1981 until 2005. A German version of the NCI medical history questionnaire for cancer aetiology was used. Familial clustering analysis was done by comparing the proportion of specific tumours in the first degree relatives of the CLL practice cohort with corresponding proportions of population-based cancer registry data. RESULTS: 18 (41%) male and 5 (23%) female CLL probands had multiple malignancies, e.g. 2 meningiomas, 7 and 19 years after diagnosis of CLL. 46 (12%) first degree relatives had malignancies with an excess of CLL. Other conspicuous familial associations are CLL with malignancies of the upper GI tract (oesophagus, stomach) and of the nervous system. CONCLUSION: 1. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia clusters in some families like any other disease. Predisposition genes should be searched. 2. Cancer prevention and early detection should be continued in CLL patients because of their longevity and high risk for multiple malignancies. 3. The overrepresentation of upper GI malignancies in first degree relatives of CLL patients calls for targeted oesophago-gastroscopy screening studies.","['Weber, Walter', 'Maurer, Patrick F', 'Estoppey, Jacqueline', 'Zwahlen, Marcel']","['Weber W', 'Maurer PF', 'Estoppey J', 'Zwahlen M']","['Clinical Cancer Etiology Unit, Heuberg 16, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20071215,Poland,Hered Cancer Clin Pract,Hereditary cancer in clinical practice,101231179,,,,2007/01/01 00:00,2007/01/01 00:01,['2009/09/04 06:00'],"['2007/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2007/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['1897-4287-5-4-210 [pii]', '10.1186/1897-4287-5-4-210 [doi]']",epublish,Hered Cancer Clin Pract. 2007 Dec 15;5(4):210-2. doi: 10.1186/1897-4287-5-4-210.,PMC2736981,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Odds ratios (ORs) were adjusted for gender, age, race, calendar year and number of physician claims.

It has been shown that alternative splicing of its gene (PAX5) produces several distinct transcripts that modify the amino acid sequence of the putative Pax5 proteins. Subsequent studies have attempted to correlate the expression of PAX5 isoforms with certain B-cell lymphomas, the conclusions of which suggest that altered isoform expression is involved in lymphomagenesis. However, in the absence of definitive data for PAX5 isoform expression patterns in normal B cells it is difficult to confirm whether aberrant isoform expression can indeed be correlated with disease. Using a high-resolution method of analysis of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction products, we sought to analyse the expression of the different PAX5 isoforms in normal B-cells as well as a number of B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cases. It was found that multiple PAX5 isoforms were expressed in both normal and malignant B cells. Immunodetection and polysomal RNA analyses also confirmed that the different PAX5 mRNAs were translated into their corresponding proteins. No consistent deregulation of PAX5 isoform expression was observed in B-cell lymphomas, but rather, complex isoform expression patterns were found in normal B cell as well as B-cell lymphoma and CLL cases.","['Arseneau, Jean-Rene', 'Laflamme, Mark', 'Lewis, Stephen M', 'Maicas, Emmanuel', 'Ouellette, Rodney J']","['Arseneau JR', 'Laflamme M', 'Lewis SM', 'Maicas E', 'Ouellette RJ']","['Atlantic Cancer Research Institute, Moncton, NB, Canada.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090901,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques/methods', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/09/04 06:00,2010/02/24 06:00,['2009/09/04 06:00'],"['2009/09/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7859 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07859.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Nov;147(3):328-38. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07859.x.

Aberrant expression of myeloid antigens was found in 14% of cases. The expression of Bcl-2 was associated with shorter survival (p = 0.009). A significant correlation between expression of myeloid antigens (MY) and survival and complete remission duration was found. The mean survival was 656 + 301 days for MY+ cases and 1009 +/- 230 days for MY- patients (p < 0.0001). Expression of Bcl-2 in combination to myeloid antigens was associated with a poorer outcome.

Two mouse (BALB/c) bcr-abl-transformed cell lines, B210 and 12B1, which both expressed p210bcr-abl and were oncogenic for syngeneic animals but differed in some other respects, were used as a model system. In the first series of experiments, plasmids carrying either the complete bcr-abl fusion gene or a fragment thereof coding for a 25-amino acid-long junction zone (bcr-abl25aa) linked with genes coding for a variety of immunostimulatory factors were used as the DNA vaccines. A plasmid carrying the complete bcr-abl gene was capable of inducing protection against challenge with either B210 or 12B1 cells. However, the DNA vaccines based on the gene fragment coding for p25aabcr-abl did not induce significant protection. To localize the immunizing epitopes on the p210bcr-abl protein, the whole fusion gene was split into nine overlapping fragments and these, individually or in various combinations, were used for immunization. Although none of the vaccines based on any single fragment provided potent protection, some combinations of these fragment-based vaccines were capable of eliciting protection comparable to that seen after immunization with the whole-gene vaccine. Surprisingly, a mixture of six fragment-vaccines was more immunogenic than the complete set of fragment DNA vaccines. To analyze this phenomenon, the three fragments missing from the hexavaccine were either individually or in various combinations mixed with the hexavaccine. The results obtained suggested that the product of the fragment coding for 197 amino acids forming the N-terminal of the BCR protein was involved in the decreased immunogenicity. However, further experiments are needed to clarify the point. Additional experiments revealed that all the important epitopes were located in the ABL portion of the p210bcr-abl protein. The livers, spleens and bone marrows of the successfully immunized animals were tested for the presence of bcr-abl-positive cells by RT-PCR. The results were negative, this suggesting that these animals were free of any residual disease.","['Lucansky, Vincent', 'Sobotkova, Eva', 'Tachezy, Ruth', 'Duskova, Martina', 'Vonka, Vladimir']","['Lucansky V', 'Sobotkova E', 'Tachezy R', 'Duskova M', 'Vonka V']","['Department of Experimental Virology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cancer Vaccines/genetics/*immunology', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*immunology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/immunology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Vaccines, DNA/genetics/*immunology']",2009/09/03 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/03 09:00'],"['2009/09/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo_00000408 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2009 Oct;35(4):941-51. doi: 10.3892/ijo_00000408.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notably, extracts of A. platyphilla, A. fruticosa, A. siamensis, A. guatemalensis and A. wilkesiana have been recently shown to have antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects. In the study presented here we investigated the anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activities of A. alopecuroidea, which is endemic in parts of Central America and is traditionally used by the Mopan- and Itza-Maya in the form of decoctions to treat skin conditions, and as a tea to treat stomach and urinary complaints. We demonstrate here that extracts of A. alopecuroidea can inhibit TNFalpha-induced E-selectin production, providing a mechanistic validation of its traditional use against inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, a fraction of A. alopecuroidea root extracts purified by solid phase extraction and separated by HPLC displayed strong cell cycle inhibitory activity by down-regulating and inactivating two proto-oncogenes (cyclin D1 and Cdc25A), and simultaneously inducing cyclin A, thereby disturbing orchestrated cell cycle arrest, and thus (presumably) triggering caspase 3-dependent apoptosis. The results of this study indicate that there are high prospects for purifying an active principle from A. alopecuroidea for further in vivo and preclinical studies.","['Madlener, Sibylle', 'Svacinova, Jana', 'Kitner, Miloslav', 'Kopecky, Jiri', 'Eytner, Ruth', 'Lackner, Andreas', 'Vo, Than Phuong Nha', 'Frisch, Richard', 'Grusch, Michael', 'De Martin, Rainer', 'Dolezal, Karel', 'Strnad, Miroslav', 'Krupitza, Georg']","['Madlener S', 'Svacinova J', 'Kitner M', 'Kopecky J', 'Eytner R', 'Lackner A', 'Vo TP', 'Frisch R', 'Grusch M', 'De Martin R', 'Dolezal K', 'Strnad M', 'Krupitza G']","['Institute of Clinical Pathology, Medical University of Vienna, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Checkpoint Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (CDC25A protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (cdc25 Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/drug effects', 'Cyclin A/metabolism', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'E-Selectin/metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/*drug effects/immunology', '*Euphorbiaceae/chemistry', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inflorescence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Plant Leaves', 'Plant Shoots', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'cdc25 Phosphatases/metabolism']",2009/09/03 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/03 09:00'],"['2009/09/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo_00000403 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2009 Oct;35(4):881-91. doi: 10.3892/ijo_00000403.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Schisandrin C induced G1 arrest was correlated with down-regulation of cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 4 and E2Fs expression, inhibition of phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRB), and up-regulation of the Cdk inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1). In addition, schisandrin C-induced apoptosis was associated with down-regulation of expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, proteolytic activation of caspase-3 and -9, and a concomitant degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Furthermore, schisandrin C-induced apoptosis was significantly inhibited by a caspase-3 specific inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk, indicating an important role for caspase-3 in the schisandrin C mechanism.

The RHAMM (CD168) gene, earlier identified by our group as an immunogenic antigen in acute and chronic leukemia, also showed highly significant overexpression in CaP metastases compared with localized disease and benign prostatic hyperplasia. At the protein level, RHAMM was highest in metastatic tissue samples and significantly higher in neoplastic localized disease compared with benign tissue. High RHAMM expression was associated with clinical parameters known to be linked to better clinical outcome. Patients with high RHAMM expression in the primaries had a significantly lower risk of biochemical failure. The number of viable cells in cell cultures was reduced in blocking experiments using hormone-sensitive and hormone-insensitive metastatic CaP cell lines. Acknowledging the proven immunogenic effects of RHAMM in leukemia, this antigen is intriguing as a therapeutic target in far-advanced CaP.","['Gust, Kilian M', 'Hofer, Matthias D', 'Perner, Sven R', 'Kim, Robert', 'Chinnaiyan, Arul M', 'Varambally, Sooryanarayana', 'Moller, Peter', 'Rinnab, Ludwig', 'Rubin, Mark A', 'Greiner, Jochen', 'Schmitt, Michael', 'Kuefer, Rainer', 'Ringhoffer, Mark']","['Gust KM', 'Hofer MD', 'Perner SR', 'Kim R', 'Chinnaiyan AM', 'Varambally S', 'Moller P', 'Rinnab L', 'Rubin MA', 'Greiner J', 'Schmitt M', 'Kuefer R', 'Ringhoffer M']","['Department of Urology, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Databases, Factual', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prostate/metabolism/pathology', 'Prostatic Hyperplasia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/09/03 06:00,2009/11/11 06:00,['2009/09/03 09:00'],"['2009/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1593/neo.09694 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 2009 Sep;11(9):956-63. doi: 10.1593/neo.09694.,PMC2735808,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we show that the BH3 mimetic obatoclax potently overcomes resistance of melanoma cells to apoptosis induced by ER stress. Obatoclax, as a single agent at nanomolar concentrations, was relatively ineffective in the induction of apoptosis in melanoma cells, but treatment with obatoclax at these concentrations in combination with the ER stress inducer tunicamycin (TM) or thapsigargin markedly enhanced apoptotic cell death. This was primarily because of the inhibition of Mcl-1 by obatoclax, in that cotreatment with TM and another BH3 mimetic ABT737, which does not antagonize Mcl-1, caused only minimal increases in apoptosis. Moreover, overexpression of Mcl-1 inhibited apoptosis to greater degrees than overexpression of Bcl-2. In addition to direct inhibition of Mcl-1 by obatoclax, the combination of obatoclax and TM caused strong up-regulation of the BH3-only protein Noxa. Small RNA interference knockdown of Noxa partially inhibited apoptosis induced by cotreatment with obatoclax and TM. Similarly, knockdown of Bak also blocked induction of apoptosis by the compounds. The Mcl-1/Bak interaction seemed to be disrupted more efficiently in melanoma cells cotreated with obatoclax and TM. Taken together, these results identify obatoclax as a potent agent that overcomes resistance of melanoma cells to ER stress-induced apoptosis and seem to have important implications in the use of BH3 mimetics in the treatment of melanoma.","['Jiang, Chen Chen', 'Wroblewski, David', 'Yang, Fan', 'Hersey, Peter', 'Zhang, Xu Dong']","['Jiang CC', 'Wroblewski D', 'Yang F', 'Hersey P', 'Zhang XD']","['Immunology and Oncology Unit, Room 443, Calvary Mater Newcastle Hospital, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'QN4128B52A (obatoclax)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Indoles', 'Melanoma/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2009/09/03 06:00,2009/11/11 06:00,['2009/09/03 09:00'],"['2009/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1593/neo.09692 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 2009 Sep;11(9):945-55. doi: 10.1593/neo.09692.,PMC2735806,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The identification of a large number of novel miRNAs and other small regulatory RNAs will provide valuable insights into the roles they play in tumorgenesis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To gain further understanding of the role of miRNAs relevant to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we employed the sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) strategy to sequence small RNA libraries prepared from ALL patients and normal donors. In total we identified 159 novel miRNAs and 116 novel miRNA*s from both libraries. Among the 159 novel miRNAs, 42 were identified with high stringency in our data set. Furthermore, we demonstrated the different expression patterns of 20 newly identified and several known miRNAs between ALL patients and normal donors, suggesting these miRNAs may be associated with ALL and could constitute an ALL-specific miRNA signature. Interestingly, GO ""biological process"" classifications revealed that a set of significantly abnormally expressed miRNAs are associated with disease relapse, which implies that these dysregulated miRNAs might promote the progression of ALL by regulating genes involved in the pathway of the disease development. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The study presents a comprehensive picture of the expression of small RNAs in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia and highlights novel and known miRNAs differentially expressed between ALL patients and normal donors. To our knowledge, this is the first study to look at genome-wide known and novel miRNA expression patterns in in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our data revealed that these deregulated miRNAs may be associated with ALL or the onset of relapse.","['Zhang, Hua', 'Yang, Jian-Hua', 'Zheng, Yu-Sheng', 'Zhang, Peng', 'Chen, Xiao', 'Wu, Jun', 'Xu, Ling', 'Luo, Xue-Qun', 'Ke, Zhi-Yong', 'Zhou, Hui', 'Qu, Liang-Hu', 'Chen, Yue-Qin']","['Zhang H', 'Yang JH', 'Zheng YS', 'Zhang P', 'Chen X', 'Wu J', 'Xu L', 'Luo XQ', 'Ke ZY', 'Zhou H', 'Qu LH', 'Chen YQ']","[""Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090902,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Computational Biology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Library', 'Genome', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA/*genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Sequence Analysis, DNA']",2009/09/03 06:00,2010/02/02 06:00,['2009/09/03 09:00'],"['2009/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0006849 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Sep 2;4(9):e6849. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0006849.,PMC2731166,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate host factors contributing to the poor response of adoptively transferred tumor-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), we used a systemic model of murine acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AML progression resulted in a progressive regulatory T-cell (Treg) accumulation in disease sites. The adoptive transfer of in vitro-generated, potently lytic anti-AML-reactive CTLs failed to reduce disease burden or extend survival. Compared with non-AML-bearing hosts, transferred CTLs had reduced proliferation in AML sites of metastases. Treg depletion by a brief course of interleukin-2 diphtheria toxin (IL-2DT) transiently reduced AML disease burden but did not permit long-term survival. In contrast, IL-2DT prevented anti-AML CTL hypoproliferation, increased the number of transferred CTLs at AML disease sites, reduced AML tumor burden, and resulted in long-term survivors that sustained an anti-AML memory response. These data demonstrated that Tregs present at AML disease sites suppress adoptively transferred CTL proliferation, limiting their in vivo expansion, and Treg depletion before CTL transfer can result in therapeutic efficacy in settings of substantial pre-existing tumor burden in which antitumor reactive CTL infusion alone has proven ineffective.","['Zhou, Qing', 'Bucher, Christoph', 'Munger, Meghan E', 'Highfill, Steven L', 'Tolar, Jakub', 'Munn, David H', 'Levine, Bruce L', 'Riddle, Megan', 'June, Carl H', 'Vallera, Daniel A', 'Weigel, Brenda J', 'Blazar, Bruce R']","['Zhou Q', 'Bucher C', 'Munger ME', 'Highfill SL', 'Tolar J', 'Munn DH', 'Levine BL', 'Riddle M', 'June CH', 'Vallera DA', 'Weigel BJ', 'Blazar BR']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA120409/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA120409-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA72669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL056067/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA072669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090901,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (interleukin 2-diphtheria toxin)']",IM,"['*Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Diphtheria Toxin/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory/drug effects', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/*transplantation', '*T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory', 'Tumor Escape/drug effects/immunology']",2009/09/03 06:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/09/03 09:00'],"['2009/09/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39015-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-03-208181 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Oct 29;114(18):3793-802. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-03-208181.

In acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, the MAL gene is translocated and fused with the gene encoding one twenty-two (OTT). Herein, we show that MAL expression increases during the late differentiation steps of neonate and adult human megakaryopoiesis and localized into the nucleus after Rho GTPase activation by adhesion on collagen I or convulxin. MAL knockdown in megakaryocyte progenitors reduced the percentage of cells forming filopodia, lamellipodia, and stress fibers after adhesion on the same substrates, and reduced proplatelet formation. MAL repression led to dysmorphic megakaryocytes with disorganized demarcation membranes and alpha granules heterogeneously scattered in the cytoplasm. Gene expression profiling revealed a marked decrease in metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and MYL9 expression after MAL inhibition. Luciferase assays in HEK293T cells and chromatin immunoprecipitation in primary megakaryocytes showed that the MAL/SRF complex directly regulates MYL9 and MMP9 in vitro. Megakaryocyte migration in response to stromal cell-derived factor 1, through Matrigel was considerably decreased after MAL knockdown, implicating MMP9 in migration. Finally, the use of a shRNA to decrease MYL9 expression showed that MYL9 was involved in proplatelet formation. MAL/SRF complex is thus involved in platelet formation and megakaryocyte migration by regulating MYL9 and MMP9.","['Gilles, Laure', 'Bluteau, Dominique', 'Boukour, Siham', 'Chang, Yunhua', 'Zhang, Yanyan', 'Robert, Thomas', 'Dessen, Philippe', 'Debili, Najet', 'Bernard, Olivier A', 'Vainchenker, William', 'Raslova, Hana']","['Gilles L', 'Bluteau D', 'Boukour S', 'Chang Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Robert T', 'Dessen P', 'Debili N', 'Bernard OA', 'Vainchenker W', 'Raslova H']","['Inserm, U790, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090901,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MRTFA protein, human)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Myosin Light Chains)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SRF protein, human)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (myosin light chain 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Cardiac Myosins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Platelets/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Cardiac Myosins/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/genetics/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Focal Adhesions', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*genetics', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Myosin Light Chains/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Serum Response Factor/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Thrombopoiesis', 'Trans-Activators', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism']",2009/09/03 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/03 09:00'],"['2009/09/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38987-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-03-209932 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Nov 5;114(19):4221-32. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-03-209932.

However, resistance evolves due to BCR-ABL mutations and other mechanisms. Furthermore, patients with blast crisis CML are less responsive and quiescent CML stem cells are insensitive to these inhibitors. We found that triptolide, a diterpenoid, at nanomolar concentrations, promoted equally significant death of KBM5 cells, a cell line derived from a Bcr-Abl-bearing blast crisis CML patient and KBM5STI571 cells, an imatinib-resistant KBM5 subline bearing the T315I mutation. Similarly, Ba/F3 cells harboring mutated BCR-ABL were as sensitive as Ba/F3Bcr-Abl(p210wt) cells to triptolide. Importantly, triptolide induced apoptosis in primary samples from blast crisis CML patients, who showed resistance to Bcr-Abl TKIs in vivo, with less toxicity to normal cells. Triptolide decreased X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, Mcl-1, and Bcr-Abl protein levels in K562, KBM5, and KBM5STI571 cells and in cells from blast crisis CML patients. It sensitized KBM5, but not KBM5STI571, cells to imatinib. More importantly, triptolide also induced death of quiescent CD34(+) CML progenitor cells, a major problem in the therapy of CML with TKIs. Collectively, these results suggest that triptolide potently induces blast crisis CML cell death independent of the cellular responses to Bcr-Abl TKIs, suggesting that triptolide could eradicate residual quiescent CML progenitor cells in TKI-treated patients and benefit TKI-resistant blast crisis CML patients.","['Mak, Duncan H', 'Schober, Wendy D', 'Chen, Wenjing', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Carter, Bing Z']","['Mak DH', 'Schober WD', 'Chen W', 'Konopleva M', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Andreeff M', 'Carter BZ']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164-16/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049639-149007/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672-289015/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090901,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '19ALD1S53J (triptolide)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Epoxy Compounds/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Phenanthrenes/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/09/03 06:00,2010/01/06 06:00,['2009/09/03 09:00'],"['2009/09/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-09-0386 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0386 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2009 Sep;8(9):2509-16. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0386.

We have previously found the development of CLL in the New Zealand Black murine model to be associated with a point mutation in the primary mir-15a/16-1 region, which correlated with a decrease in mature miR-16 and miR-15a levels. In this study, addition of exogenous miR-15a and miR-16 led to an accumulation of cells in G(1) in non-New Zealand Black B cell and New Zealand Black-derived malignant B-1 cell lines. However, the New Zealand Black line had significantly greater G(1) accumulation, suggesting a restoration of cell cycle control upon exogenous miR-15a/16 addition. Our experiments showed a reduction in protein levels of cyclin D1, a miR-15a/16 target and cell cycle regulator of G(1)/S transition, in the New Zealand Black cell line following miR-15a/16 addition. These microRNAs were shown to directly target the cyclin D1 3' untranslated region using a green fluorescent protein lentiviral expression system. miR-16 was also shown to augment apoptosis induction by nutlin, a mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) antagonist, and genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, when added to a B-1 cell line derived from multiple in vivo passages of malignant B-1 cells from New Zealand Black mice with CLL. miR-16 synergized with nutlin and genistein to induce apoptosis. Our data support a role for the mir-15a/16-1 cluster in cell cycle regulation and suggest that these mature microRNAs in both the New Zealand Black model and human CLL may be targets for therapeutic efficacy in this disease.","['Salerno, Erica', 'Scaglione, Brian J', 'Coffman, Frederick D', 'Brown, Brian D', 'Baccarini, Alessia', 'Fernandes, Helen', 'Marti, Gerald', 'Raveche, Elizabeth S']","['Salerno E', 'Scaglione BJ', 'Coffman FD', 'Brown BD', 'Baccarini A', 'Fernandes H', 'Marti G', 'Raveche ES']","['Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, New Jersey Medical School, MSB C512, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090901,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cyclin D1/genetics', 'DNA Primers', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Genistein/therapeutic use', 'Imidazoles/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",2009/09/03 06:00,2010/01/06 06:00,['2009/09/03 09:00'],"['2009/09/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-09-0127 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0127 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2009 Sep;8(9):2684-92. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0127.

In this work we found that the accumulation of cells with 4C DNA content and the transcriptional change of several microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are relevant events in culture senescence. By comparing the miRNA expression profiles of physiologically senescent MEF and that of senescent MEF induced by the downregulation of leukemia-related factor, we identified miR-290 as a common upregulated miRNA. When miR-290 was transfected in presenescent MEF, SA-beta-gal(+) cells and p16, two markers of culture senescence, increased compared with control, indicating that miR-290 is causally involved in senescence. Interestingly, nocodazole (NCZ), which induces G2/M block, increased the percentage of senescent cells as well as the expression of miR-290 and of the tumor suppressor p16, thus mimicking culture senescence. As miR-290 was overexpressed in NCZ-treated cells and it was able to induce senescence in proliferating MEF, we investigated whether miR-290 and NCZ could share common mechanisms of culture senescence. Whereas the induction of SA-beta-gal(+) by miR-290 was not strengthened by coupling its transfection with NCZ treatment, the transfection of the antagomir 290 (d-290) plus NCZ treatment, while blocking cells at G2/M, suppressed SA-beta-gal(+) and p16 induction. On the basis of these findings we conclude that miR-290 might act as a physiological effector of NCZ induced as well as culture senescence via p16 regulation expanding the role of this miRNA from embryonic stem to differentiated cells.","['Pitto, Letizia', 'Rizzo, Milena', 'Simili, Marcella', 'Colligiani, Daria', 'Evangelista, Monica', 'Mercatanti, Alberto', 'Mariani, Laura', 'Cremisi, Federico', 'Rainaldi, Giuseppe']","['Pitto L', 'Rizzo M', 'Simili M', 'Colligiani D', 'Evangelista M', 'Mercatanti A', 'Mariani L', 'Cremisi F', 'Rainaldi G']","['Laboratory of Gene and Molecular Therapy, Institute of Clinical Physiology, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, 56124 Pisa, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090901,United States,Physiol Genomics,Physiological genomics,9815683,"['0 (Cdkn2a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (MIRN290 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Senescence/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/09/03 06:00,2010/03/03 06:00,['2009/09/03 09:00'],"['2009/09/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['00085.2009 [pii]', '10.1152/physiolgenomics.00085.2009 [doi]']",ppublish,Physiol Genomics. 2009 Nov 6;39(3):210-8. doi: 10.1152/physiolgenomics.00085.2009.

We focused on the development of the myeloid lineage and present evidence that promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) provides a novel function that is critical for both normal and stress-induced myelopoiesis. During homeostasis, PLZF restricts proliferation and differentiation of human cord blood-derived myeloid progenitors to maintain a balance between the progenitor and mature cell compartments. Analysis of PLZF promoter-binding sites revealed that it represses transcription factors involved in normal myeloid differentiation, including GFI-1, C/EBPalpha, and LEF-1, and induces negative regulators DUSP6 and ID2. Loss of ID2 relieves PLZF-mediated repression of differentiation identifying it as a functional target of PLZF in myelopoiesis. Furthermore, induction of ERK1/2 by myeloid cytokines, reflective of a stress response, leads to nuclear export and inactivation of PLZF, which augments mature cell production. Thus, negative regulators of differentiation can serve to maintain developmental systems in a primed state, so that their inactivation by extrinsic signals can induce proliferation and differentiation to rapidly satisfy increased demand for mature cells.","['Doulatov, Sergei', 'Notta, Faiyaz', 'Rice, Kim L', 'Howell, Louise', 'Zelent, Arthur', 'Licht, Jonathan D', 'Dick, John E']","['Doulatov S', 'Notta F', 'Rice KL', 'Howell L', 'Zelent A', 'Licht JD', 'Dick JE']","['Division of Cell and Molecular Biology, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1L7, Canada.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA059936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 59936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Homeostasis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myelopoiesis/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2009/09/03 06:00,2009/09/17 06:00,['2009/09/03 09:00'],"['2009/09/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['23/17/2076 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.1788109 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2009 Sep 1;23(17):2076-87. doi: 10.1101/gad.1788109.,PMC2751973,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this regard, the apoptotic-inducing effect is attributed to the catalytic activity of the enzyme, which phosphorylates proapoptotic proteins to inhibit their functions. In this study we investigate the role of intracellular redox status in the proapoptotic activity of CK2 inhibition in human leukemia Cem cells. We provide evidence that inhibition of CK2 activity induces apoptotic cell death as evident by activation of caspase 3, DNA fragmentation, and phosphatidylserine externalization. Inhibition of CK2 resulted in a significant increase in intracellular hydrogen peroxide production, which we show as a critical mediator of apoptosis. To that end, apoptotic hallmarks, like DNA fragmentation and phosphatidylserine externalization, were blocked with the specific hydrogen peroxide scavenger catalase. We also show that inhibition of CK2 reduces cytosolic intracellular superoxide, a precursor of hydrogen peroxide. In summary, decreasing CK2 activity increases intracellular hydrogen peroxide, creating an intracellular environment conducive for death execution. Taken together, these data provide information on novel pathways involved in CK2 biology with implications for effective tools against drug-resistant tumors.","['Hanif, Ismail M', 'Ahmad, Kashif A', 'Ahmed, Khalil', 'Pervaiz, Shazib']","['Hanif IM', 'Ahmad KA', 'Ahmed K', 'Pervaiz S']","['National University of Singapore Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['I01 BX001731/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'R01 CA015062/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA015062/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-15062/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Triazoles)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Casein Kinase II/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Intracellular Space/drug effects/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Triazoles/*pharmacology']",2009/09/03 06:00,2009/09/24 06:00,['2009/09/03 09:00'],"['2009/09/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['NYAS4916 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04916.x [doi]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2009 Aug;1171:591-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04916.x.,PMC4392777,['NIHMS677568'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various cell-death characteristics were studied in response to erufosine, such as morphological changes, oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, caspase activation, and poly (ADP)-ribose polymerase cleavage. Erufosine was found to cause cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and caspase-8 and -3 activation. Taken together, our data indicate that erufosine is a potential antimyeloma drug eliciting specific features of apoptotic cell death in vitro.","['Yosifov, Deyan Y', 'Konstantinov, Spiro M', 'Berger, Martin R']","['Yosifov DY', 'Konstantinov SM', 'Berger MR']","['Department of Pharmacology, Laboratory for Experimental Chemotherapy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University of Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria. deyanyosifov@abv.bg']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Organophosphates)', '0 (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds)', '0 (erucylphospho-N,N,N-trimethylpropylammonium)', '47165-04-8 (DAPI)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatin/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indoles/chemistry', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Multiple Myeloma/metabolism/pathology', 'Organophosphates/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/*pharmacology']",2009/09/03 06:00,2009/09/24 06:00,['2009/09/03 09:00'],"['2009/09/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['NYAS4694 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04694.x [doi]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2009 Aug;1171:350-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04694.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Partial differentiation to granulocytes was induced by 3 micromol/L RA, and its combination with HDAC inhibitors did not enhance RA-induced but potentiated apoptosis. HDACIs induced accumulation of hyperacetylated histone H4. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis has revealed phenyl butyrate and its combinations with RA and vitamin B3 cause histone H4 acetylation in the p21 promoter regions corresponding to p53 and/or Sp1 sites.

For further insights into the mechanisms and molecular targets implicated and modified as a result of apoptosis induced by these two mitosis-arresting drugs, we studied the possible alterations, at the mRNA level, of various apoptosis-related genes (BCL2, BAX, BCL2L12, CASPASE-3, FAS) after leukemia cell (HL-60) treatment with these drugs.

The percentage of nonviable cells was upregulated with increasing cell exposure time and drug concentrations to both taxol and vincristine. Distinct modulations of apoptosis-related genes at the mRNA level were also observed, mainly concerning BCL2 and BCL2L12 along apoptosis induction.

Although it has been shown to prevent apoptotic cell death in certain cell lines, bile acids significantly inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in cancer cells. To better understand the pharmacological potential of bile acids in cancer cells, we investigated and compared the effects of deoxycholic acid (DCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), and their taurine-derivatives [taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), respectively] on the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation of a human T leukemia cell line (Jurkat cells). All the bile acids tested induced a delay in cell cycle progression. Moreover, DCA markedly increased the fraction of apoptotic cells. The effects of TDCA, UDCA, and TUDCA were different from those observed for DCA. Their primary effect was the induction of necrosis. These distinctive features suggest that the hydrophobic properties of DCA play a role in its cytotoxic potential and indicate that it is possible to create new drugs useful for cancer therapy from bile acid derivatives as lead compounds.","['Fimognari, Carmela', 'Lenzi, Monia', 'Cantelli-Forti, Giorgio', 'Hrelia, Patrizia']","['Fimognari C', 'Lenzi M', 'Cantelli-Forti G', 'Hrelia P']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy. carmela.fimognari@unibo.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Bile Acids and Salts)', '005990WHZZ (Deoxycholic Acid)', '516-35-8 (Taurochenodeoxycholic Acid)', '516-50-7 (Taurodeoxycholic Acid)', '60EUX8MN5X (ursodoxicoltaurine)', '724L30Y2QR (Ursodeoxycholic Acid)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bile Acids and Salts/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Deoxycholic Acid/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology/physiopathology', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Taurochenodeoxycholic Acid/pharmacology', 'Taurodeoxycholic Acid/pharmacology', 'Ursodeoxycholic Acid/pharmacology']",2009/09/03 06:00,2009/09/24 06:00,['2009/09/03 09:00'],"['2009/09/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['NYAS4710 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04710.x [doi]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2009 Aug;1171:264-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04710.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been recently reported that OLO did not affect the viability of normal human MRC-5 fibroblasts, but it inhibited the proliferation of human HL-60 leukemia cells. Therefore, it was interesting to explore the antiproliferative effect of OLO and to characterize its action on distinct human cancer cells differing in the functional status of the cell cycle. Human HeLa cervical carcinoma and HL-60 leukemia cells were continuously exposed to increasing concentrations of OLO for 24 h and 48 h or alternatively, cells after treatment for 24 h were postincubated in a drug-free medium. Surprisingly, OLO more strongly affected the proliferation of HL-60 cells than that of HeLa cells. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that OLO at higher doses increases the frequency of a hypoploid HL-60 cell population representing cells undergoing apoptosis. These results substantiated the data of the determination of the number of viable cells. Moreover, OLO at higher doses modulates the cell cycle progression of tested cancer cells. Detailed analyses of the DNA concentration in single cells revealed that OLO-mediated reduction of the number of G(1)-phase cells was accompanied by an increase of the frequency of G(2)-phase cells. The kinetics of these changes differed between both tested cancer cell lines, suggesting that some cancer cells exhibit increased susceptibility to OLO action. It remains to clarify whether the strong proapoptotic effect of OLO observed in HL-60 cells depends on their differentiation status.","['Wandl, Stefanie', 'Wesierska-Gadek, Jozefa']","['Wandl S', 'Wesierska-Gadek J']","['Cell Cycle Regulation Group, Division Institute of Cancer Research, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '6A839B2HYS (olomoucine)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'P39Y9652YJ (Kinetin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase/genetics', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetin/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'S Phase/drug effects']",2009/09/03 06:00,2009/09/24 06:00,['2009/09/03 09:00'],"['2009/09/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['NYAS4700 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04700.x [doi]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2009 Aug;1171:242-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04700.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wogonin significantly potentiated etoposide-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. This flavone impaired the function of P-glycoprotein and then increased cellular content of etoposide in the cells. Thus, this flavone is likely to act as an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein and potentiate the apoptotic action of etoposide. On the other hand, wogonin inhibited etoposide-induced apoptosis in thymocytes, one of the normal cells. The potentiation by wogonin is likely to be a specific action for cancer cells but not normal cells. Therefore, this flavone may be used to reduce the excretion of the anticancer agents via P-glycoprotein and increase the pharmacological action of it in cancer cells.

The results of flow cytometry revealed that tested agents differentially reduced the viability of leukemic cells. Interestingly, roscovitine exerts a similar cytotoxic effect as the combinations of the used purine analogs with Mf, but with other kinetics. Roscovitine kills leukemic cells after a much shorter exposure time. Immunoblotting analysis showed that the reduction of the number of living cells coincides with marked changes of the balance between pro- and antiapoptotic factors. The latter were markedly reduced. The activation of proapoptotic proteins became evident especially after exposure of cells to roscovitine alone or to combinations of purine analogs and Mf. Furthermore, exposure of CLL cells to tested drugs degraded p27(KIP1) protein. Our findings demonstrate that roscovitine alone significantly reduces the number of viable CLL cells by inducing them to undergo apoptosis, and it acts earlier than clinically applied combinations of purine analogs with Mf/cyclophosphamide.

Cytoplasm compartment of cancer cells was overloaded with TGF-beta1, and 87% of all cancers were TGF-beta1 positive (94/108). A very strong pattern of staining was detected for TGF-beta1 in cytoplasm of inflammatory cells at tumor margins. TGF-beta1 correlated with Bcl-xL and Bax in all colorectal cancers (P < 0.001, r= 0.473 and P < 0.001, r= 0.435, respectively) and subgroups of different clinicopathological features, especially in deeply invading cancers (pT3+pT4) instead of superficially growing tumors (pT1+pT2). Expression of TGF-beta1 in inflammatory infiltrates correlated with immunoreactivities to Bcl-xL of cancer cells (P= 0.024, r= 0.217). TGF-beta1 did not associate with p53, nor did TGF-beta1 of inflammatory cells correlate with Bax expression in cancer cells. Lack of correlations between TGF-beta1 and p53 proteins could indicate mutations at the TGF-beta1-dependent apoptotic pathway. Dominant positive linkage between TGF-beta1 and Bcl-xL and selective lack of association with Bax suggest TGF-beta1 could support colorectal cancer cell survival. The pattern of correlations seems to confirm a remarkable shift from TGF-beta1-dependent suppression of cancer growth by apoptosis to inhibition of anticancer immunity by TGF-beta1.","['Sulkowski, Stanislaw', 'Wincewicz, Andrzej', 'Sulkowska, Mariola', 'Koda, Mariusz']","['Sulkowski S', 'Wincewicz A', 'Sulkowska M', 'Koda M']","['Department of General Pathomorphology, Collegium Pathologicum, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland. sulek@zeus.amb.edu.pl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Colon/chemistry/pathology', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rectum/chemistry/pathology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*biosynthesis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*biosynthesis', 'bcl-X Protein/*biosynthesis']",2009/09/03 06:00,2009/09/24 06:00,['2009/09/03 09:00'],"['2009/09/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['NYAS4686 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04686.x [doi]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2009 Aug;1171:116-23. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04686.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The highest incidence of nosocomial infections was found in patients having acute myelogenous leukemia (30.49 infections per 1,000 patient days); bone and joint cancer (27.27 infections per 1,000 patient days); and liver cancer (26.58 infections per 1,000 patient days). The respiratory tract was the most common site of infection, followed by bloodstream, surgical wound, and urinary tract infections. Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were most frequently implicated as pathogens. The distribution of specific types of infection according to underlying malignancy was also tabulated.

Within the kidney, the neoplastic lymphoid cells exhibited both the glomerular and peritubular capillary distribution pattern. Conventional cytogenetic analysis from the bone marrow aspirates displayed a complex karyotype, with a notable triple tandem repeat at band segment q22-q25 of chromosome 11. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with an MLL probe set, performed on both interphase cells and metaphase spreads, confirmed the presence of 3 copies of the MLL gene on the derivative chromosome 11.

MYST (Moz, Ybf2/Sas3, Sas2, Tip60) proteins form the largest family of histone acetyltransferases and are present in all eukaryotes. Surprisingly, until recently this protein family was poorly studied. However, in the last few years there has been a substantial increase in interest in the MYST proteins and a number of key studies have shown that these chromatin modifiers are required for a diverse range of cellular processes, both in health and disease. Translocations affecting MYST histone acetyltransferases can lead to leukemia and solid tumors. Some members of the MYST family are required for the development and self-renewal of stem cell populations; other members are essential for the prevention of inappropriate heterochromatin spreading and for the maintenance of adequate levels of gene expression.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Rationale and Insight for Gleevec High-Dose Therapy (RIGHT) trial is a multicenter study of imatinib 400 mg twice a day as initial therapy in 115 patients (70% Sokal low risk) with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase who were observed for both molecular and cytogenetic responses for up to 18 months. Eighty-three patients (72%) completed the study, 10 patients (9%) discontinued the study because of adverse events, and six patients (5%) discontinued because of unsatisfactory therapeutic effect. RESULTS: Polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated rapid kinetics of major molecular response (MMR), with 48% of patients achieving MMR by 6 months, 54% by 12 months, and 63% by 18 months. Corresponding complete molecular response rates were 39%, 44%, and 55%, respectively. Median dose-intensity was 98%. Overall, 79% of patients who received at least 90% dose-intensity achieved MMR. The most frequent adverse events included myelosuppression, rash, fatigue, and musculoskeletal symptoms. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that imatinib 400 mg twice a day results in more rapid reduction in tumor burden than imatinib 400 mg/d with minimal added toxicity.","['Cortes, Jorge E', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Goldberg, Stuart L', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Wetzler, Meir', 'Akard, Luke', 'Burke, John M', 'Kerr, Robert', 'Saleh, Mansoor', 'Salvado, August', 'McDougall, Karen', 'Albitar, Maher', 'Radich, Jerald']","['Cortes JE', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Goldberg SL', 'Powell BL', 'Giles FJ', 'Wetzler M', 'Akard L', 'Burke JM', 'Kerr R', 'Saleh M', 'Salvado A', 'McDougall K', 'Albitar M', 'Radich J']","['The University of Texas M.

In elderly patients, these AML types are rare, and intensive treatments are much less tolerated. We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the characteristics and outcome of AML with t(8;21) or inv(16) in the elderly. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with t(8;21) or inv(16) AML who were age 60 years or older and who received at least one course of induction chemotherapy were included. Postremission therapy consisted of low-dose maintenance chemotherapy (n = 72) or intensive consolidation (n = 56). RESULTS: A total of 147 patients were analyzed. The median age was 67 years. Sixty patients had t(8;21), and 87 patients had inv(16). A total of 129 patients achieved complete response (CR) after one or two induction courses (ie, 88% CR rate), and 15 patients (10%) died early (ie, during the 8 weeks after induction). During a median follow-up of 48 months, the 5-year probabilities of overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) were 31% and 27%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed a negative impact of high WBC, impaired performance status, and deletion (9q) on OS and LFS. Administration of intensive consolidation was associated with better LFS only in patients with t(8;21). In addition, the need for critical care during induction independently predicted lower LFS. CONCLUSION: Because of a high CR rate, induction chemotherapy should be considered systematically for elderly patients who have AML with t(8;21) or inv(16). The high risk of relapse suggests that alternative strategies of postremission therapy are warranted.","['Prebet, Thomas', 'Boissel, Nicolas', 'Reutenauer, Sarah', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Delaunay, Jacques', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves', 'Pigneux, Arnaud', 'Quesnel, Bruno', 'Witz, Francis', 'Thepot, Sylvain', 'Ugo, Valerie', 'Terre, Christine', 'Recher, Christian', 'Tavernier, Emmanuelle', 'Hunault, Mathilde', 'Esterni, Benjamin', 'Castaigne, Sylvie', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Vey, Norbert']","['Prebet T', 'Boissel N', 'Reutenauer S', 'Thomas X', 'Delaunay J', 'Cahn JY', 'Pigneux A', 'Quesnel B', 'Witz F', 'Thepot S', 'Ugo V', 'Terre C', 'Recher C', 'Tavernier E', 'Hunault M', 'Esterni B', 'Castaigne S', 'Guilhot F', 'Dombret H', 'Vey N']","['Institut Paoli-Calmettes, 13009 Marseille, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090831,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Core Binding Factors)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factors/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/09/02 06:00,2009/10/27 06:00,['2009/09/02 09:00'],"['2009/09/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.21.0674 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.21.0674 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Oct 1;27(28):4747-53. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.21.0674.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients with MF were treated. Therapy consisted of lenalidomide 10 mg/d (5 mg/d if baseline platelet count < 100 x 10(9)/L) on days 1 through 21 of a 28-day cycle for six cycles, in combination with prednisone 30 mg/d orally during cycle 1, 15 mg/d during cycle 2, and 15 mg/d every other day during cycle 3. Lenalidomide therapy was continued indefinitely in patients exhibiting clinical benefit. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 22 months (range, 6 to 27). Responses were recorded in 12 patients (30%) and are ongoing in 10 (25%). The median time to response was 12 weeks (range, 2 to 32). According to the International Working Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment consensus criteria, three patients (7.5%) had partial response and nine patients (22.5%) had clinical improvement durable for a median of 18 months (range, 3.5 to 24+). Overall response rates were 30% for anemia and 42% for splenomegaly. Moreover, 10 of 11 assessable responders who started therapy with reticulin fibrosis grade 4 experienced reductions to at least a score of 2. All eight JAK2(V617F)-positive responders experienced a reduction of the baseline mutant allele burden, which was greater than 50% in four, including one of whom the mutation became undetectable. Grade 3 to 4 hematologic adverse events included neutropenia (58%), anemia (42%), and thrombocytopenia (13%). CONCLUSION: The combination of lenalidomide and prednisone induces durable clinical, molecular, and pathologic responses in MF.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Manshouri, Taghi', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Manshouri T', 'Thomas D', 'Cortes J', 'Ravandi F', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Verstovsek S']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

Moreover, AA treatment upregulated Fas/FasL protein expression and transcription of Fas/FasL mRNA. Downregulation of FADD blocked AA-induced procaspase-8 degradation and rescued viability of AA-treated cells. BAPTA-AM (Ca(2+) chelator) pretreatment abolished AA-induced ROS generation, while N-acetylcysteine (NAC, ROS scavenger) was unable to alter AA-elicited [Ca(2+)]i increase. Pretreatment with BAPTA-AM or NAC abrogated p38 MAPK activation and restored ERK activation. Suppression of p38 MAPK or transfection of constitutively active MEK1 abolished AA-induced Fas and FasL upregulation. AA treatment repressed ERK-mediated c-Fos phosphorylation but evoked p38 MAPK-mediated ATF-2 phosphorylation. Knockdown of c-Fos and ATF-2 by siRNA reflected that c-Fos counteracted the effect of ATF-2 on Fas/FasL upregulation. Taken together, our data indicate that Fas/FasL upregulation in AA-treated U937 cells is elicited by Ca(2+)/ROS-mediated suppression of ERK/c-Fos pathway and activation of p38 MAPK/ATF-2, and suggest that autocrine Fas-mediated apoptotoic mechanism is involved in AA-induced cell death.","['Liu, Wen-Hsin', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Liu WH', 'Chang LS']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University-Kaohsiung Medical University Joint Research Center, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090829,Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factor 2)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 2/genetics/*physiology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arachidonic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium Signaling/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/biosynthesis', 'Fas Ligand Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/*biosynthesis', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Subcellular Fractions/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation', 'fas Receptor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/drug effects/genetics/*physiology']",2009/09/02 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/02 09:00'],"['2009/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-4274(09)01401-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.toxlet.2009.08.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 2009 Dec 15;191(2-3):140-8. doi: 10.1016/j.toxlet.2009.08.016.

Regulation by ROS and mitogen-activated protein kinases.,37-44,10.1016/j.cbi.2009.08.015 [doi],"The proved radio- and chemo-sensitizing capacity of genistein supports the potential use of this isoflavone in antitumour therapies. In this regard, we recently reported that genistein potentiates apoptosis induction by the anti-leukaemic agent arsenic trioxide (ATO) via reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and p38-MAPK activation. In the present study we analyze the action of agents sharing functional similarities with the isoflavone, namely 17-beta-estradiol, the DNA topoisomerase II poison etoposide, and the tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors herbimycin A, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and adaphostin, in U937 and other human acute myeloid leukaemia cell lines. Co-treatment with 17-beta-estradiol or etoposide failed to stimulate ROS production and potentiate ATO-provoked apoptosis, although etoposide caused G(2)/M cycle arrest, in the same manner as genistein. By contrast, all PTK inhibitors increased ATO-provoked apoptosis, with similar efficacy as genistein. Daidzein, a genistein analogue without PTK-inhibiting activity, failed to potentiate apoptosis, and co-treatment with orthovanadate attenuated the sensitizing capacity of genistein. Apoptosis potentiation by PTK inhibitors was associated to ROS over-accumulation and stimulation of p38-MAPK phosphorylation, was mimicked by conventional pro-oxidant agents (exogenous H(2)O(2) and the glutathione-depleting agent dl-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine), and was attenuated by the antioxidant agent N-acetyl-l-cysteine, and by the p38-MAPK inhibitor SB203580 or p38-MAPK-directed siRNAs. On the other hand, the PTK inhibitors caused disparate effects on ERK phosphorylation, and co-treatment with the MEK/ERK inhibitor PD98059 enhanced the pro-apoptotic capacity of the PTK inhibitors. These results suggest that PTK inhibition, together with ROS generation and p38-MAPK activation, are responsible for the chemo-sensitizing action of genistein and functionally related agents in leukaemia cells.","['Sanchez, Yolanda', 'Calle, Consuelo', 'de Blas, Elena', 'Aller, Patricio']","['Sanchez Y', 'Calle C', 'de Blas E', 'Aller P']","['Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Ramiro de Maeztu 9, 28040 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090829,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (NSC 680410)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'PJY633525U (Adamantane)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adamantane/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Catechin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Genistein/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/pharmacology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2009/09/02 06:00,2009/10/30 06:00,['2009/09/02 09:00'],"['2009/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/21 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(09)00349-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2009.08.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2009 Nov 10;182(1):37-44. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2009.08.015.

Biopsies showed dense lymphohistiocytic infiltrates involving the reticular dermis and subcutis without epidermotropism consisting mostly of small, CD20 and PAX-5-positive B-cells expressing CD5, CD23, CD43 and BCL2. Numerous large B-cells were present in a T-cell, histiocyte-rich background. A staging bone marrow biopsy showed a clonal B-cell proliferation with typical CLL flow cytometry immunophenotyping but neither lymphadenopathy nor absolute lymphocytosis was present. Numerous B and T-cell cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders can be associated with increased numbers of histiocytes occasionally masquerading as benign disorders.

However, the role of costimulatory molecules in UCB T-cell activation and effector functions in context with CAR remains elusive. To investigate the effect of costimulatory molecules (4-1BB and CD28) on UCB T cells, we transduced UCB T cells with lentiviral vectors expressing Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and CAR for CD19 containing an intracellular domain of the CD3zeta chain and either a 4-1BB (UCB-19BBzeta) or a CD28 intracellular domain (UCB-1928zeta), both (UCB-1928BBzeta), or neither (UCB-19zeta). We found that UCB-19BBzeta and UCB-28BBzeta T cells exhibited more cytotoxicity to CD19(+) leukemia and lymphoma cell lines than UCB-19zeta and UCB-1928zeta, although differences in secretion of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma by these T cells were not evident. In vivo adoptive transfer of these T cells into intraperitoneal tumor-bearing mice demonstrated that UCB-19BBzeta and UCB-1928BBzeta T cells mounted the most potent antitumor response. The mice adoptively transferred with UCB-1928BBzeta cells survived longer than the mice with UCB-19BBzeta. Moreover, UCB-1928BBzeta T cells mounted a more robust antitumor response than UCB-19BBzeta in a systemic tumor model. Our data suggest a synergistic role of 4-1BB and CD28 costimulation in engineering antileukemia UCB effector cells and implicate a design for redirected UCB T-cell therapy for refractory leukemia.","['Tammana, Syam', 'Huang, Xin', 'Wong, Marianna', 'Milone, Michael C', 'Ma, Linan', 'Levine, Bruce L', 'June, Carl H', 'Wagner, John E', 'Blazar, Bruce R', 'Zhou, Xianzheng']","['Tammana S', 'Huang X', 'Wong M', 'Milone MC', 'Ma L', 'Levine BL', 'June CH', 'Wagner JE', 'Blazar BR', 'Zhou X']","['Graduate Program in Microbial Engineering, University of Minnesota , Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA065493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA120409/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA120409-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'CD28 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9/*metabolism']",2009/09/02 06:00,2010/03/23 06:00,['2009/09/02 09:00'],"['2009/09/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/hum.2009.122 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2010 Jan;21(1):75-86. doi: 10.1089/hum.2009.122.,PMC2861957,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present a mathematical model of the process that incorporates the essential rate-limiting transduction steps including diffusion, convection and decay of viral vectors, their binding at the cell surface and entry into the cell cytoplasm, reverse transcription of uncoated RNA to form DNA intermediates, transport of the latter through the cytosol to the cell nucleus and, finally, nuclear import and integration of the delivered DNA into the target cell genome. Cell and virus population balances are used to account for the kinetics of multiple vector infections which influence the transduction efficiency and govern the integrated copy number. The mathematical model is validated using gibbon ape leukemia virus envelope pseudotyped retroviral vectors and K562 target cells. Viral intermediate complexes derived from the internalized retroviral vectors are found to remain stable inside the K562 cells and the cytoplasmic trafficking time is consistent with the time scale for retrovirus uncoating, reverse transcription and transport to the cell nucleus. The model predictions of transduction efficiency and integrated copy number agree well with experimental data for both static (i.e., standard gravity) and centrifugation-based gene transfer protocols. The formulation of the model can also be applied to transduction protocols involving lenti- or foamy-viruses and so should prove to be useful for the optimization of several types of gene transfer processes.","['Tayi, Venkata S', 'Bowen, Bruce D', 'Piret, James M']","['Tayi VS', 'Bowen BD', 'Piret JM']","['Michael Smith Laboratories, University of British Columbia, 2185 East Mall, Vancouver V6T1Z4, Canada.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/metabolism', '*Transduction, Genetic']",2009/09/01 06:00,2010/03/17 06:00,['2009/09/01 09:00'],"['2009/09/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/bit.22515 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2010 Jan 1;105(1):195-209. doi: 10.1002/bit.22515.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explored the participation of ouabain-activated signaling pathways in growth regulation of leukemia cells. METHODS: Lymphocytic leukemia Jhhan cells and megakaryocytic leukemia M07e cells were incubated at different concentrations of ouabain (0, 1 and 10 nmol) for 24 hours. Cell proliferation was measured by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. To probe the role of ouabain-induced signaling in control of cell growth, we employed Src kinase inhibitor PP2 and the MEK inhibitor PD98059, respectively. The expression of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit of leukemia cells was evaluated by RT-PCR and Western blotting. RESULTS: One nmol and 10 nmol ouabain promoted proliferation of both Jhhan and M07e cells. Ouabain also up-regulated the expression of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit. Addition of either PP2 or PD98059 blocked the effects of ouabain on cell proliferation.

Induction of ER chaperone GRP78/BiP increases protein folding capacity; as such it represents a major survival arm of UPR. Considering the central importance of the UPR in regulating cell survival and death, evidence is emerging that cells evolve feedback regulatory pathways to modulate the key UPR executors, however, the precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here, we report the fortuitous discovery of GRP78va, a novel isoform of GRP78 generated by alternative splicing (retention of intron 1) and alternative translation initiation. Bioinformatic and biochemical analyses revealed that expression of GRP78va is enhanced by ER stress and is notably elevated in human leukemic cells and leukemia patients. In contrast to the canonical GRP78 which is primarily an ER lumenal protein, GRP78va is devoid of the ER signaling peptide and is cytosolic. Through specific knockdown of endogenous GRP78va by siRNA without affecting canonical GRP78, we showed that GRP78va promotes cell survival under ER stress. We further demonstrated that GRP78va has the ability to regulate PERK signaling and that GRP78va is able to interact with and antagonize PERK inhibitor P58(IPK). Our study describes the discovery of GRP78va, a novel cytosolic isoform of GRP78/BiP, and the first characterization of the modulation of UPR signaling via alternative splicing of nuclear pre-mRNA. Our study further reveals a novel survival mechanism in leukemic cells and other cell types where GRP78va is expressed.","['Ni, Min', 'Zhou, Hui', 'Wey, Shiuan', 'Baumeister, Peter', 'Lee, Amy S']","['Ni M', 'Zhou H', 'Wey S', 'Baumeister P', 'Lee AS']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA027607/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA111700/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090831,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hspa5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PERK kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytosol/enzymology/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Protein Isoforms/*metabolism', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Signal Transduction', 'eIF-2 Kinase/*metabolism']",2009/09/01 06:00,2010/01/20 06:00,['2009/09/01 09:00'],"['2009/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0006868 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Aug 31;4(8):e6868. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0006868.,PMC2729930,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the 26 patients (median age 62 years, range 28-75) with relapsed AML (n=24) or CMMoL (n=2), 11 (42%) had poor-risk cytogenetics. Twenty-three patients had received fludarabine-based reduced-toxicity conditioning regimens, and three had received conventional myeloablative conditioning. Patients received 5-azacytidine s.c., at a total daily dose of 100 mg, on days 1-3, to be followed by DLI on day 10, with the next course of treatment to be started on day 22. A total of 60 courses of 5-azacytidine were administered, with a median of 2 courses (range: 1-10). In 44 courses, 5-azacytidine was followed by DLI, and thus 19/26 (73%) patients received at least one course of this combined treatment. Clinically relevant neutropenic infections not associated with progressive disease developed in four patients, one of them succumbing to sepsis. Only two patients developed de novo acute GvHD after the combination of 5-azacytidine and DLI. Overall, 66% of the patients benefited from this treatment, with continued CRs achieved in 4 (16%) patients, lasting a median of 525 days (range: 450+ to 820+), and a 50% rate of temporary disease control with stable mixed chimerism (median duration 72 days). The median survival from the start of 5-azacytidine treatment was 136 days (range: 23 to 873+), with an estimated 2-year survival probability of 16%. In conclusion, this non-intensive outpatient regimen of 5-azacytidine followed by DLI is feasible, with a very low aGVHD rate.

Previous studies have suggested that p210(Bcr-Abl) transformation contributes to homing and retention defects, typical of immature myeloid cells in CML, by attenuating chemotactic response to stromal-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha). As Rho family GTPases are key regulators of the cytoskeleton and have been previously found to interact with p210(Bcr-Abl), this study aimed to determine whether p210(Bcr-Abl) signaling affects SDF-1alpha chemotaxis through Rho GTPase signaling. We found that SDF-1alpha stimulated Cdc42 GTPase activation in myeloid progenitor 32D, but not in p210(Bcr-Abl)-transformed (32Dp210) cells. In fact, the basal level of active Cdc42 was elevated in 32Dp210 cells and mononuclear cells isolated from bone marrow of CML patients. Inhibition of p210(Bcr-Abl) kinase activity decreased basal Cdc42 activity and restored SDF-1alpha-induced Cdc42 and migration responses. Transduction of active Tat-Cdc42V12 abolished this reconstituted chemotactic response. As Cdc42 is particularly important in cytoskeletal remodeling and directional sensing, these results suggest that sustained activation of Cdc42 GTPase through p210(Bcr-Abl) tyrosine kinase signaling in CML cells contributes to defects in SDF-1alpha-chemotactic response due to desensitization of the actin polarization signal required for directional migration.","['Chang, Y-C', 'Tien, S-C', 'Tien, H-F', 'Zhang, H', 'Bokoch, G M', 'Chang, Z-F']","['Chang YC', 'Tien SC', 'Tien HF', 'Zhang H', 'Bokoch GM', 'Chang ZF']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090831,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '0 (VAV1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/metabolism', '*Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/physiology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav/genetics/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Transfection', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism/*physiology', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",2009/09/01 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/01 09:00'],"['2009/09/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2009260 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.260 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2009 Nov 19;28(46):4105-15. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.260.

Because deregulation of microRNAs has been linked to disease initiation and progression in CLL, we studied the value of the microRNAs as a signature for CLL patients with specific chromosomal abnormalities. We identified 32 microRNAs able to discriminate the 11q deletion, 17p deletion, trisomy 12, 13q deletion, and normal karyotype cytogenetic subgroups. The expression values of 9 among the 32 microRNAs (miR-151-3p, miR-34a, miR-29c, miR-29b, miR-155, miR-148a, miR-146a, miR-146b5p, and miR-640) were correlated with gene expression data from the same samples to assess their biologic impact on CLL. In this study we also found that IGHV unmutated, high expression of ZAP-70 protein, and low expression of the miR-223, miR-29c, miR-29b, and miR-181 family were strongly associated with disease progression in CLL cases harboring 17p deletion, whereas in those harboring trisomy 12 only high expression of the miR-181a, among the analyzed parameters, suggested more aggressive disease. Thus, the use of the microRNA-based classifications may yield clinically useful biomarkers of tumor behavior in CLL.","['Visone, Rosa', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Veronese, Angelo', 'Taccioli, Cristian', 'Costinean, Stefan', 'Aguda, Baltazar D', 'Volinia, Stefano', 'Ferracin, Manuela', 'Palatini, Jeff', 'Balatti, Veronica', 'Alder, Hansjuerg', 'Negrini, Massimo', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Croce, Carlo M']","['Visone R', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Veronese A', 'Taccioli C', 'Costinean S', 'Aguda BD', 'Volinia S', 'Ferracin M', 'Palatini J', 'Balatti V', 'Alder H', 'Negrini M', 'Kipps TJ', 'Croce CM']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA111953/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090828,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Trisomy', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics/metabolism']",2009/09/01 06:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/09/01 09:00'],"['2009/09/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39023-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-06-229211 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Oct 29;114(18):3872-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-06-229211.

For numerous gammaretroviruses, such as the gibbon ape leukemia virus, woolly monkey virus, feline leukemia virus subgroup B, feline leukemia virus subgroup T, and 10A1 murine leukemia virus, this receptor is the human type III sodium-dependent inorganic phosphate transporter, SLC20A1, formerly known as PiT1. Understanding the critical receptor functionalities and interactions with the virus that lead to successful infection requires that we first know the surface structure of the cellular receptor. Previous molecular modeling from the protein sequence, and limited empirical data, predicted a protein with 10 transmembrane helices. Here we undertake the biochemical approach of substituted cysteine accessibility mutagenesis to resolve the topology of this receptor in live cells. We discover that there are segments of the protein that are unexpectedly exposed to the outside milieu. By using information determined by substituted cysteine accessibility mutagenesis to set constraints in HMMTOP, a hidden Markov model-based transmembrane topology prediction method, we now propose a comprehensive topological model for SLC20A1, a transmembrane protein with 12 transmembrane helices and 7 extracellular regions, that varies from previous models and should permit approaches that define both virus interaction and transport function.","['Farrell, Karen B', 'Tusnady, Gabor E', 'Eiden, Maribeth V']","['Farrell KB', 'Tusnady GE', 'Eiden MV']","['Section on Molecular Virology, Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Regulation, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090828,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Hylobates', '*Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape', 'Mice', '*Models, Molecular', 'Mutagenesis', 'Protein Structure, Secondary/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",2009/09/01 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/09/01 09:00'],"['2009/09/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)38207-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.022566 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Oct 23;284(43):29979-87. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.022566.

Nonetheless, subjects with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia or advanced myelodysplasia often relapse, underscoring the need to intensify tumor immunity within this cohort. In preclinical models, allogeneic HSCT followed by vaccination with irradiated tumor cells engineered to secrete GM-CSF generates a potent antitumor effect without exacerbating the toxicities of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). To test whether this strategy might be similarly active in humans, we conducted a Phase I clinical trial in which high-risk acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia patients were immunized with irradiated, autologous, GM-CSF-secreting tumor cells early after allogeneic, nonmyeloablative HSCT. Despite the administration of a calcineurin inhibitor as prophylaxis against GVHD, vaccination elicited local and systemic reactions that were qualitatively similar to those previously observed in nontransplanted, immunized solid-tumor patients. While the frequencies of acute and chronic GVHD were not increased, 9 of 10 subjects who completed vaccination achieved durable complete remissions, with a median follow-up of 26 months (range 12-43 months). Six long-term responders showed marked decreases in the levels of soluble NKG2D ligands, and 3 demonstrated normalization of cytotoxic lymphocyte NKG2D expression as a function of treatment. Together, these results establish the safety and immunogenicity of irradiated, autologous, GM-CSF-secreting leukemia cell vaccines early after allogeneic HSCT, and raise the possibility that this combinatorial immunotherapy might potentiate graft-versus-leukemia in patients.","['Ho, Vincent T', 'Vanneman, Matthew', 'Kim, Haesook', 'Sasada, Tetsuro', 'Kang, Yoon Joong', 'Pasek, Mildred', 'Cutler, Corey', 'Koreth, John', 'Alyea, Edwin', 'Sarantopoulos, Stefanie', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Ritz, Jerome', 'Canning, Christine', 'Kutok, Jeffery', 'Mihm, Martin C', 'Dranoff, Glenn', 'Soiffer, Robert']","['Ho VT', 'Vanneman M', 'Kim H', 'Sasada T', 'Kang YJ', 'Pasek M', 'Cutler C', 'Koreth J', 'Alyea E', 'Sarantopoulos S', 'Antin JH', 'Ritz J', 'Canning C', 'Kutok J', 'Mihm MC', 'Dranoff G', 'Soiffer R']","[""Department of Medical Oncology and Cancer Vaccine Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['CA78378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA111506/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI29530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AI029530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA111506/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI029530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090826,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (MHC class I-related chain A)', '0 (MICB antigen)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cancer Vaccines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/blood', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2009/09/01 06:00,2009/11/17 06:00,['2009/09/01 09:00'],"['2009/09/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [medline]']","['0908358106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0908358106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Sep 15;106(37):15825-30. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0908358106.

ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs) are specialized PML bodies found exclusively in telomerase-negative tumors in which telomeres are maintained by recombination-based alternative (ALT) mechanisms. Although it has been suggested that APBs are directly implicated in telomere metabolism of ALT cells, their precise role and structure have remained elusive. Here we show that PML bodies in ALT cells associate with chromosome ends forming small, spatially well-defined clusters, containing on average 2-5 telomeres. Using an innovative approach that gently enlarges PML bodies in living cells while retaining their overall organization, we show that this physical enlargement of APBs spatially resolves the single telomeres in the cluster, but does not perturb the potential of the APB to recruit chromosome extremities. We show that telomere clustering in PML bodies is cell-cycle regulated and that unique telomeres within a cluster associate with recombination proteins. Enlargement of APBs induced the accumulation of telomere-telomere recombination intermediates visible on metaphase spreads and connecting heterologous chromosomes. The strand composition of these recombination intermediates indicated that this recombination is constrained to a narrow time window in the cell cycle following replication. These data provide strong evidence that PML bodies are not only a marker for ALT cells but play a direct role in telomere recombination, both by bringing together chromosome ends and by promoting telomere-telomere interactions between heterologous chromosomes.","['Draskovic, Irena', 'Arnoult, Nausica', 'Steiner, Villier', 'Bacchetti, Silvia', 'Lomonte, Patrick', 'Londono-Vallejo, Arturo']","['Draskovic I', 'Arnoult N', 'Steiner V', 'Bacchetti S', 'Lomonte P', 'Londono-Vallejo A']","[""Institut Curie, 26 rue d'Ulm, 75248 Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090826,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (CALCOCO2 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (TERF2 protein, human)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Intranuclear Space/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Telomere/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism']",2009/09/01 06:00,2009/11/17 06:00,['2009/09/01 09:00'],"['2009/09/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [medline]']","['0907689106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0907689106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Sep 15;106(37):15726-31. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0907689106.

While biochemical aspects, including cell adhesion, have been studied in detail, much less is known about the role of the mechanical properties of cells. Previous measurement methods rely on contact with artificial surfaces, which can convolute the results. Here, we used a non-contact, microfluidic optical stretcher to study cell mechanics, isolated from other parameters, in the context of tissue infiltration by acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells, which occurs during differentiation therapy with retinoic acid. Compliance measurements of APL cells reveal a significant softening during differentiation, with the mechanical properties of differentiated cells resembling those of normal neutrophils. To interfere with the migratory ability acquired with the softening, differentiated APL cells were exposed to paclitaxel, which stabilizes microtubules. This treatment does not alter compliance but reduces cell relaxation after cessation of mechanical stress six-fold, congruent with a significant reduction of motility. Our observations imply that the dynamical remodeling of cell shape required for tissue infiltration can be frustrated by stiffening the microtubular system. This link between the cytoskeleton, cell mechanics, and motility suggests treatment options for pathologies relying on migration of cells, notably cancer metastasis.","['Lautenschlager, Franziska', 'Paschke, Stephan', 'Schinkinger, Stefan', 'Bruel, Arlette', 'Beil, Michael', 'Guck, Jochen']","['Lautenschlager F', 'Paschke S', 'Schinkinger S', 'Bruel A', 'Beil M', 'Guck J']","['Department of Physics, University of Cambridge, JJ Thomson Avenue, Cambridge CB3 0HE, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090826,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/physiology', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Biophysical Phenomena', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/*physiology', 'Compliance/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques', 'Microtubules/drug effects/physiology', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tubulin Modulators/pharmacology']",2009/09/01 06:00,2009/11/17 06:00,['2009/09/01 09:00'],"['2009/09/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [medline]']","['0811261106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0811261106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Sep 15;106(37):15696-701. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0811261106.

As patients survive longer, long-term therapy-related complications take on greater importance. Herein, we describe a patient with AIDS who presented to medical attention with pancytopenia 48 months postchemotherapy with etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and rituximab (R-EPOCH) for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Bone marrow biopsy showed a moderately hypocellular marrow; 51% of the nucleated cells were blasts with myelomonocytic differentiation. Cytogenetic studies revealed an abnormal karyotype with deletion of the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q21) and 2 additional copies of the MLL gene attached to the short arms of chromosome 10 in 80% of the metaphase cells examined. With the diagnosis of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) secured, he began induction chemotherapy with idarubicin and cytarabine. Two weeks later, he died of fungal septicemia and multiorgan failure. Through a literature search, we were able to identify 4 additional cases of therapy-related AML in AIDS patients following chemotherapy for lymphomas. The median age of these patients at the time of AML diagnosis was 39 years (range, 33-59 years), the median time from the treatment of lymphoma to AML was 18 months (range, 11-48 months), and the median survival following induction chemotherapy was 4 weeks (range, 2-16 weeks). With many HIV-infected patients surviving alkylator and topoisomerase inhibitor-based treatment and radiation therapy for AIDS-defining cancers and NADCs, long-term follow-up for therapy-related complications assumes greater importance.","['Mani, Deepthi', 'Dorer, Russell K', 'Aboulafia, David M']","['Mani D', 'Dorer RK', 'Aboulafia DM']","['Division of Internal Medicine, Spokane Medical Centers, WA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma,Clinical lymphoma & myeloma,101256500,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics']",2009/09/01 06:00,2010/02/26 06:00,['2009/09/01 09:00'],"['2009/09/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['L226156X15U2827V [pii]', '10.3816/CLM.2009.n.062 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma. 2009 Aug;9(4):316-9. doi: 10.3816/CLM.2009.n.062.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is likely still room for improvement through optimizing conventional chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Through a pharmacy database search we identified all patients with AML treated at Washington University with cladribine-based regimens. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were identified that were treated with 2 cladribine-based regimens: CLAG (cladribine [5 mg/m2 days 1-5], cytarabine [2 g/m2 days 1-5] and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF; 300 microg subcutaneously (s.c.) days 0-5]) and CLAM (cladribine [5 mg/m2 days 1-5], cytarabine [2 g/m2 days 1-5], G-CSF [300 mg s.c. days 0-5] and mitoxantrone [10 mg/m2 days 1-3]). Complete responses were achieved in 53% of patients given induction chemotherapy and 44% of those given salvage chemotherapy. The regimens were well tolerated with minimal extramedullary toxicity. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that cladrabine-based regimens should be further explored in both the salvage and first-line setting and might offer an attractive backbone on which to add novel therapies.","['Martin, Mike G', 'Welch, John S', 'Augustin, Kristan', 'Hladnik, Lindsay', 'DiPersio, John F', 'Abboud, Camille N']","['Martin MG', 'Welch JS', 'Augustin K', 'Hladnik L', 'DiPersio JF', 'Abboud CN']","['Section of Leukemia and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO 63110, USA. mmartin@dom.wustl.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma,Clinical lymphoma & myeloma,101256500,['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/09/01 06:00,2010/02/26 06:00,['2009/09/01 09:00'],"['2009/09/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['JG451243887012G0 [pii]', '10.3816/CLM.2009.n.058 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma. 2009 Aug;9(4):298-301. doi: 10.3816/CLM.2009.n.058.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study interleukin-11 (IL-11), another member of the IL-6 family, was investigated for its role in regulating invasion, migration and proliferation of JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells. JEG-3 cells, like extra villous trophoblast (EVT), express mRNA transcripts encoding IL-11 and IL-11 receptor-alpha (IL-11Ralpha). Treatment of JEG-3 cells with IL-11 led to an increase in invasion across Matrigel extracellular matrix without an increase in proliferation. There was a dose-dependent increase in activation of STAT3 under the influence of IL-11 with maximum Tyr705 phosphorylation by 10min. In addition, treatment of JEG-3 cells with IL-11 for 24h led to an increase in expression of unphosphorylated STAT1 and STAT3. Analysis of the nuclear fraction showed an increased localization of STAT3 following IL-11 treatment while STAT1 was absent. Silencing the expression of STAT3 by siRNA caused a 25% reduction in invasion compared to control cells, however this was not significant. Furthermore, treatment of STAT3-silenced JEG-3 cells with IL-11 led to a significant increase in invasion compared to STAT3-silenced cells without cytokine, but this was not significant compared to non-transfected control cells. Silencing the expression of gp130 but not of IL-6R abrogated the increase in invasiveness of JEG-3 cells following IL-11 treatment. In conclusion, activation and upregulation of STAT3 appears to be critical for the IL-11-mediated increase in invasiveness of JEG-3 cells.","['Suman, Pankaj', 'Poehlmann, Tobias G', 'Prakash, Golla Jaya', 'Markert, Udo R', 'Gupta, Satish K']","['Suman P', 'Poehlmann TG', 'Prakash GJ', 'Markert UR', 'Gupta SK']","['National Institute of Immunology, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090828,Ireland,J Reprod Immunol,Journal of reproductive immunology,8001906,"['0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Choriocarcinoma/genetics/*immunology/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunomodulation/drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-11/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/immunology', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Uterine Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology/metabolism/pathology/therapy']",2009/09/01 06:00,2010/05/14 06:00,['2009/09/01 09:00'],"['2008/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/29 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-0378(09)00408-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jri.2009.07.002 [doi]']",ppublish,J Reprod Immunol. 2009 Oct;82(1):1-11. doi: 10.1016/j.jri.2009.07.002.

In reactive lymphoid tissues, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 was expressed in the cytoplasm of B-cells and histiocytes but not T-cells.

We hypothesized that epigenetic activation of EC lineage specification genes is an important mediator of embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation into EC. Mouse ESC was differentiated by removing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) from the maintenance media in the presence or absence of the specific DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (aza-dC). Expression of EC specification and marker genes was monitored by quantitative PCR, western, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometry. Functionality of differentiated EC was assessed by angiogenesis assay. The methylation status in the proximal promoter CpGs of the mediators of EC differentiation VEGF-A, BMP4, and EPAS-1 as well as of the mature EC marker VE-cadherin was determined by bisulfite sequencing. ESC differentiation resulted in repression of OCT4 expression in both the absence and presence of aza-dC treatment. However, significant increase in angiogenesis and expression of the mediators of EC differentiation and EC-specific genes was only observed in aza-dC-treated cells. The DNMT inhibition-mediated increase in EC specification and marker gene expression was not associated with demethylation of these genes. These studies suggest that DNMT inhibition is an efficient inducer of EC differentiation from ESC.","['Banerjee, Saswati', 'Bacanamwo, Methode']","['Banerjee S', 'Bacanamwo M']","['Cardiovascular Research Institute, Morehouse school of Medicine, 720 Westview Drive, Atlanta, GA 30310, USA.']",['eng'],"['K01 HL084725-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UH1 HL003676-07/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5 K01 HL084725-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'G12 RR003034/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UH1 HL003676-05/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 HL003676/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 HL084725/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 HL003676-09/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 HL003676-12/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'G12-RR03034/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 HL003676-08/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 HL003676-10/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UH1 HL003676-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UH1 HL003676-06/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5R25HL003676/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 HL003676-09S1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UH1 HL003676-04S1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UH1 HL003676-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'G12 RR003034-226594/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'G12 RR003034-235451/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 HL003676-11/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 HL084725-01A2/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UH1 HL003676-03S1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UH1 HL003676-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UH1 HL003676/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090826,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Angiopoietin-1)', '0 (Angpt1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Bmp4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (cadherin 5)', '0 (vascular endothelial growth factor A, mouse)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)', '1B37H0967P (endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, TIE-2)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Angiopoietin-1/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/genetics', 'Cadherins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Decitabine', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects/genetics', 'Mice', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/drug effects', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Receptor, TIE-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics', 'von Willebrand Factor/genetics/metabolism']",2009/09/01 06:00,2010/01/15 06:00,['2009/09/01 09:00'],"['2009/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/21 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/09/01 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(09)00368-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.08.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2010 Jan 15;316(2):172-80. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.08.011.

Similarly to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), they could provide a source of cellular grafts for new transplantation therapies of a broad variety of diseases. To test whether these stem cells can be rejected by the recipients, we have analyzed whether maGSCs and iPSCs can become targets for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) or whether they are protected, as previously proposed for embryonic stem cells (ESCs). RESULTS: We have observed that maGSCs can be maintained in prolonged culture with or without leukemia inhibitory factor and/or feeder cells and still retain the capacity to form teratomas in immunodeficient recipients. They were, however, rejected in immunocompetent allogeneic recipients, and the immune response controlled teratoma growth. We analyzed the susceptibility of three maGSC lines to CTL in comparison to ESCs, iPSCs, and F9 teratocarcinoma cells. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules were not detectable by flow cytometry on these stem cell lines, apart from low levels on one maGSC line (maGSC Stra8 SSC5). However, using a quantitative real time PCR analysis H2K and B2m transcripts were detected in all pluripotent stem cell lines. All pluripotent stem cell lines were killed in a peptide-dependent manner by activated CTLs derived from T cell receptor transgenic OT-I mice after pulsing of the targets with the SIINFEKL peptide. CONCLUSION: Pluripotent stem cells, including maGSCs, ESCs, and iPSCs can become targets for CTLs, even if the expression level of MHC class I molecules is below the detection limit of flow cytometry. Thus they are not protected against CTL-mediated cytotoxicity. Therefore, pluripotent cells might be rejected after transplantation by this mechanism if specific antigens are presented and if specific activated CTLs are present. Our results show that the adaptive immune system has in principle the capacity to kill pluripotent and teratoma forming stem cells.

This enzyme leads to the malignant transformation of primitive hematopoietic cells and to the consequent disease. The central role of Bcr-Abl in the pathogenesis of CML culminated in the discovery of imatinib (an ATP-competitive inhibitor), which is currently the frontline therapy for CML. Unfortunately, the initial enthusiasm generated by its high response rate has been dampened by the development of resistance, especially in the advanced phases of CML. To overcome imatinib resistance, several second-generation ATP-competitive inhibitors endowed with increased potency against imatinib-resistant mutants have been developed: the dual Src/Abl inhibitor dasatinib and the Abl inhibitor nilotinib have been recently approved by US-FDA for the treatment of imatinib-resistant CML, and many other compounds are currently in clinical trial. Although second-generation TK inhibitors have shown to be clinically effective against most of the imatinib-resistant mutants, to date poor results have been obtained in the treatment of the Bcr-Abl T315I mutant. In this review we will report the most interesting second-generation Abl and dual Src/Abl inhibitors recently entered in clinical trial, but also the new ATP-competitive and uncompetitive inhibitors published in the last few years, focusing on their chemical structure, mechanism of action, and structure-activity relationship.","['Schenone, S', 'Bruno, O', 'Radi, M', 'Botta, M']","['Schenone S', 'Bruno O', 'Radi M', 'Botta M']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Farmaceutiche, Universita degli Studi di Genova, Viale Benedetto XV, 3, I-16132 Genova, Italy. schensil@unige.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Med Res Rev,Medicinal research reviews,8103150,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Piperazines/chemistry', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thiazoles/chemistry']",2009/08/29 09:00,2011/04/19 06:00,['2009/08/29 09:00'],"['2009/08/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/med.20175 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Res Rev. 2011 Jan;31(1):1-41. doi: 10.1002/med.20175.,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

This review will summarize recent progress on the noncanonical TGF-beta signaling pathways and their role in SSc fibrosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Canonical TGF-beta signaling involves activation of the TGF-beta receptors and downstream signal transducers Smad2/3. The term noncanonical TGF-beta signaling includes a variety of intracellular signaling pathways activated by TGF-beta independently of Smad2/3 activation. There is evidence that these pathways play important role in SSc fibrosis. In a subset of SSc fibroblasts, a multiligand receptor complex consisting of TGF-beta and CCN2 receptors drives constitutive activation of the Smad1 pathway. CCN2 is also a primary effector of this pathway, thus establishing an autocrine loop that amplifies TGF-beta signaling. SSc fibroblasts also demonstrate reduced expression of endogenous antagonists of TGF-beta signaling including transcriptional repressors, Friend leukemia integration-1 and perixosome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, as well as inhibitor of Smad3 phosphorylation, PTEN. PTEN is a key mediator of the cross-talk between the sphingosine kinase and the TGF-beta pathways. SUMMARY: Discovery of the role of noncanonical TGF-beta signaling in fibrosis offers new molecular targets for the antifibrotic therapies. Due to the heterogeneous nature of SSc, knowledge of these pathways could help to tailor the therapy to the individual patient depending on the activation status of a specific profibrotic pathway.","['Trojanowska, Maria']",['Trojanowska M'],"['Division of Rheumatology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina 29425, USA. trojanme@musc.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 AR042334/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR044883/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Rheumatol,Current opinion in rheumatology,9000851,"['0 (CCN2 protein, human)', '0 (SMAD1 protein, human)', '0 (Smad1 Protein)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '139568-91-5 (Connective Tissue Growth Factor)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.- (sphingosine kinase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Collagen/genetics', 'Connective Tissue Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Fibrosis', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism', 'Scleroderma, Systemic/*etiology/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smad1 Protein/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism']",2009/08/29 09:00,2010/03/05 06:00,['2009/08/29 09:00'],"['2009/08/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/BOR.0b013e32833038ce [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Rheumatol. 2009 Nov;21(6):623-9. doi: 10.1097/BOR.0b013e32833038ce.,PMC4020352,['NIHMS575521'],,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The optimal postremission therapy for adults with ALL remains unclear. RECENT FINDINGS: Modern treatment strategies use a risk-adapted approach. The extension of 'pediatric-inspired' chemotherapy regimens into young and middle-age adults has improved their outcomes. Regimens that combine tyrosine kinase inhibitors with chemotherapy have improved the outcomes for patients with Philadelphia-chromosome-positive ALL. Improvements in transplantation technology with better donor matching and better supportive care have made this modality more widely available. Treatment-related morbidity and mortality are greater with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) than with chemotherapy, although relapses are less common. SUMMARY: Available data indicate no clear consensus as to whether there is an advantage to allogeneic HCT over modern chemotherapy for adults with ALL with standard risk features while in the first complete remission (CR1). However, allogeneic HCT is recommended in CR1 for patients with 'high-risk' ALL and for those in a second complete remission.","['Mattison, Ryan J', 'Larson, Richard A']","['Mattison RJ', 'Larson RA']","['Department of Medicine and the Cancer Research Center, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*surgery', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/08/29 09:00,2010/01/16 06:00,['2009/08/29 09:00'],"['2009/08/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCO.0b013e32833156eb [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2009 Nov;21(6):601-8. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0b013e32833156eb.,,,,53,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most CML cells undergo apoptosis when BCR/Abl tyrosine kinase activity is suppressed by TKIs. Cells surviving drug treatment are either stem cells (CML in early phase) or cells with BCR/Abl-dependent or -independent mechanisms of drug resistance (CML in advanced phase). Since survival of these cells is thought to be responsible for disease recurrence, it is critical to find ways to fully eradicate CML stem cells. We have recently shown that when CML cells, including stem cells, are exposed to TKI they activate an autophagic program, which relies on intracellular calcium and is not inhibited by Bcl-2. Pharmacological or RNAi-mediated inhibition of autophagy potentiates the effect of TKI in inducing death of CML cells, including the stem cells. These data strongly suggest that inhibition of autophagy may improve the therapeutic effects of TKIs in the treatment of CML. In addition, they give credence to the idea that in cancer cells autophagy is part of a stereotypic response to stress and specifically to abrogation of their main oncogenic signal(s).","['Salomoni, Paolo', 'Calabretta, Bruno']","['Salomoni P', 'Calabretta B']","['MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK. ps90@le.ac.uk']",['eng'],['MC_U132670601/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091014,United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Autophagy/*physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",2009/08/29 09:00,2010/01/05 06:00,['2009/08/29 09:00'],"['2009/08/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['9509 [pii]', '10.4161/auto.5.7.9509 [doi]']",ppublish,Autophagy. 2009 Oct;5(7):1050-1. doi: 10.4161/auto.5.7.9509.

Although the mechanisms are not fully understood, it is likely that they are mediated at least in part by stromal derived cytokines and chemokines. RESULTS: We have demonstrated that inhibition of p38(MAPK) in bone marrow stromal cells reduced the production of IL-6, VEGF, PDGF and CXCL12. In addition to the known role of CXCL12 in ALL cell stromal-dependent proliferation, we have shown that VEGF and PDGF also provide important proliferative cues for ALL cells, both as exogenous single agents and as bone marrow stromal culture-derived factors. In contrast we could not detect a significant role for IL-6 in ALL stromal-dependent proliferation. Consistent with these findings inhibition of p38(MAPK) significantly reduced stromal-dependent proliferation of ALL cells. METHODS: Cell proliferation was measured by (3)H-thymidine assays, survival by Annexin V/PI staining, gene expression by microarray, cytokine protein levels by antibody microarrays and/or ELISA and cellular signaling by western blotting. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that inhibition of p38(MAPK) may provide a useful adjunct to current treatment strategies by retarding ALL cell growth.","['Gaundar, Shivashni S', 'Bradstock, Kenneth F', 'Bendall, Linda J']","['Gaundar SS', 'Bradstock KF', 'Bendall LJ']","['Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, Westmead Millennium Institute and The University of Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090916,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/*metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2009/08/29 09:00,2009/12/31 06:00,['2009/08/29 09:00'],"['2009/08/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['9545 [pii]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2009 Sep 15;8(18):2975-83.

However, it is still unclear whether antigen involvement is restricted to the malignant transformation phase or whether the putative antigen(s) may continuously trigger the CLL clone and affect not only the progenitor cell but also the leukemic cells themselves. To address this issue, we conducted a large-scale subcloning study of rearranged immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) genes of diverse mutational status from 71 CLL cases (total, 1496 subcloned sequences), belonging to both the common IgM/IgD variant and the rare IgG-positive variant. Although most cases showed no or low levels of intraclonal diversification (ID), we report intense ID in the IGHV genes of selected cases, especially a subgroup of 13 IgG-switched cases expressing stereotyped, mutated IGHV4-34 rearrangements (subset 4). We demonstrate that the ID evident in subset 4 cases cannot be attributed to IGHV4-34 usage, IGHV gene-mutated status, class-switch recombination, or BCR stereotypy in general; rather, it represents a unique phenomenon strongly correlated with the distinctive BCR of subset 4.

The clinical significance of the type of BCR-ABL transcript in newly diagnosed patients in chronic phase treated with imatinib 400 mg from initial diagnosis remains unknown. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the clinical outcome of 78 newly diagnosed chronic phase patients, aged 16 or over, treated with imatinib 400 mg. Of these, 71 expressed either e13a2 or e14a2 transcripts. BCR-ABL transcripts were assayed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: After 12 months of treatment, 54% of the e14a2 patients had achieved a complete cytogenetic response, compared to 25% of the e13a2 patients (p=0.01). Kaplan-Meier analysis of the time to achieve complete cytogenetic response revealed that e14a2 patients had more rapid response rates, compared to e13a2 patients (p=0.006). e14a2 patients had a higher event-free survival rate in the first 12 months of treatment, although overall survival did not differ significantly between the patients with the two types of transcript. Human organic cation transporter protein 1 mRNA levels did not differ between the patients with the two types of transcript. The pre-treatment pCrKL/CrKL ratio (a surrogate marker of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity) was higher in patients with e13a2 transcripts than in those with e14a2 (p=0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Patients expressing the e14a2 transcript type have a higher rate and more rapid complete cytogenetic responses than e13a2-expressing patients, which may be due to higher BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity. Knowledge of the transcript type may yield additional prognostic information, although this requires testing on larger datasets.","['Lucas, Claire M', 'Harris, Robert J', 'Giannoudis, Athina', 'Davies, Andrea', 'Knight, Katy', 'Watmough, Sarah J', 'Wang, Lihui', 'Clark, Richard E']","['Lucas CM', 'Harris RJ', 'Giannoudis A', 'Davies A', 'Knight K', 'Watmough SJ', 'Wang L', 'Clark RE']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Prescot Street, Liverpool, L7 8XP, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20090827,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/genetics']",2009/08/29 09:00,2011/08/05 06:00,['2009/08/29 09:00'],"['2009/08/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.009134 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.009134 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Oct;94(10):1362-7. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.009134.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473 or Thr308) antibodies and western blotting were used to establish the activation status of Akt. The effects of two different, specific small-molecule inhibitors (A-443654 or Akti-1/2) or small interfering RNA on cell survival and downstream targets of Akt were assessed. Apoptosis was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of phosphatidylserine exposure and by measurement of PARP cleavage. The phosphorylation status of GSK-3 and MDM2, two immediate downstream substrates of Akt, levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2 and MCL1, and expression of p53 and p21 were all measured by western blotting. RESULTS: Fully activated Akt was demonstrable in all chronic lymphocytic leukemia clones examined (n=26). These results were validated with extensive controls and it was shown that a harsh method of cell extraction is needed for detection of the active enzyme. Specific inhibition of Akt induced extensive apoptosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, which was associated with both a rapid loss of MCL1 through proteasomal degradation and increased expression of p53. Moreover, the Akt inhibitors, at concentrations that induced extensive apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, had little or no effect on normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia clones consistently contain activated Akt which plays a pivotal role in maintaining cell survival. Inhibition of the Akt pathway may be of potential value as a novel therapeutic strategy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Zhuang, Jianguo', 'Hawkins, Stephen F', 'Glenn, Mark A', 'Lin, Ke', 'Johnson, Gillian G', 'Carter, Anthony', 'Cawley, John C', 'Pettitt, Andrew R']","['Zhuang J', 'Hawkins SF', 'Glenn MA', 'Lin K', 'Johnson GG', 'Carter A', 'Cawley JC', 'Pettitt AR']","['Division of Hematology, School of Cancer Studies, University of Liverpool, 3 Floor Duncan Building, Daulby Street, Liverpool L69 3GA, UK. j.zhuang@liv.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090827,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (A 443654)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (Indoles)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Clone Cells', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Indazoles/therapeutic use', 'Indoles/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology']",2009/08/29 09:00,2011/08/06 06:00,['2009/08/29 09:00'],"['2009/08/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.010272 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.010272 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Jan;95(1):110-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.010272.

DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective review analyzes the clinical features and outcome of children with biphenotypic acute leukemia diagnosed and treated over an 8-year period. According to the EGIL scoring system 24 (3.7%) of 633 patients with acute leukemia were classified as having biphenotypic acute leukemia. The diagnostic work-up and results were reviewed specifically for this study in the light of the newly published WHO criteria for the diagnosis of leukemia of ambiguous lineage. Based on these criteria, 11 (1.7%) patients were categorized according to the new nomenclature as having mixed phenotype acute leukemia. The majority of the patients (58.3%) had a B-lymphoid/myeloid phenotype, followed by the T-lymphoid/myeloid phenotype. The most frequent chromosomal abnormality involved the 14q32 locus. Patients received therapy based on a treatment regimen for acute lymphocytic leukemia regimen, which included myeloid-effective agents. RESULTS: At a median follow up of 4 years (range, 6 month - 7 years) the overall survival rate was 75.7% and the event-free survival rate was 73.5%. The survival of those patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in first complete remission was not different from that of the patients who were treated with chemotherapy alone (overall survival: 70.1% versus 81.1%, respectively, p=0.39; event-free survival: 70.1% versus 76.2%, respectively, p=0.75). The outcome of the 11 patients who were retrospectively classified as having mixed phenotype acute leukemia according to the new WHO criteria was excellent, with no relapses or deaths occurring among these patients. CONCLUSIONS: An acute lymphocytic leukemia type of induction therapy, using agents that are active against lymphoid and myeloid leukemias, appears to be more effective in achieving and maintaining complete remissions regardless of whether the patients are classified according to EGIL criteria or the new WHO criteria. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may not be necessary for all patients in first complete remission.","['Al-Seraihy, Amal S', 'Owaidah, Tarek M', 'Ayas, Mouhab', 'El-Solh, Hassan', 'Al-Mahr, Mohammed', 'Al-Ahmari, Ali', 'Belgaumi, Asim F']","['Al-Seraihy AS', 'Owaidah TM', 'Ayas M', 'El-Solh H', 'Al-Mahr M', 'Al-Ahmari A', 'Belgaumi AF']","['Deprtment of Pediatric, Hematology-Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. aseraihy@kfshrc.edu.sa']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090827,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care/methods', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies']",2009/08/29 09:00,2010/02/19 06:00,['2009/08/29 09:00'],"['2009/08/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.009282 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.009282 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Dec;94(12):1682-90. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.009282.

However, the prognostic impact of other rarer fusion genes is less well established in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia than in the childhood form. DESIGN AND METHODS: In the context of the German Multicenter Therapy Study Group for Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GMALL) we used reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to investigate 441 cases of BCR-ABL- and MLL-AF4-negative B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia for the TCF3-PBX1 (E2A-PBX1) and ETV6-RUNX1 (TEL-AML1) fusion transcripts generated by the t(1;19)(q23;p13.3) and t(12;21)(p13;q22) translocations. Both are well-known molecular alterations in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia in which they have favorable prognostic implications. RESULTS: We identified 23 adult patients with TCF3-PBX1 and ten with ETV6-RUNX1. In contrast to previous reports we found no significant difference in overall survival between TCF3-PBX1-positive and -negative patients. At 2 years after diagnosis all the ETV6-RUNX1-positive patients were alive and in continuous complete remission, but their long-term outcome was negatively affected by late relapses. TCF3-PBX1-positive patients exhibited a characteristic CD34(-)/CD33(-) and mostly cyIg(+) immunophenotype. ETV6-RUNX1 only occurred in patients under 35 years old and was associated with a significantly lower white blood count. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous suggestions, adult patients with TCF3-PBX1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia do not appear to have a worse outcome than their negative counterparts. ETV6-RUNX1-positive patients had a very favorable performance status during the first few years but their long-term survival was negatively affected by late relapses. Both groups of patients are characterized by distinct clinicobiological features which facilitate their diagnostic identification.","['Burmeister, Thomas', 'Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Schwartz, Stefan', 'Fischer, Lars', 'Hubert, Daniela', 'Sindram, Annette', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Thiel, Eckhard']","['Burmeister T', 'Gokbuget N', 'Schwartz S', 'Fischer L', 'Hubert D', 'Sindram A', 'Hoelzer D', 'Thiel E']","['Med Klinik fur Hamatologie/Onkologie Hindenburgdamm 30, 12200 Berlin, Germany. thomas.burmeister@charite.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090827,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TCF3-PBX1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Young Adult']",2009/08/29 09:00,2010/05/14 06:00,['2009/08/29 09:00'],"['2009/08/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.011346 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.011346 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Feb;95(2):241-6. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.011346.

We previously found that some mouse PGCs develop into pluripotential cells (EG cells) when cultured on a feeder layer expressing the membrane bound form of Steel factor with culture medium containing leukemia inhibitory factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. To understand the mechanisms of the conversion of PGCs into EG cells, we attempted to identify PGC subpopulations that have the ability to develop into EG cells. Using flow cytometry, we fractionated PGCs by the expression of the cell surface antigen integrin alpha6, as well as by the detection of side-population (SP) cells in which stem cells are enriched in various tissues. PGCs with negative or low integrin alpha6 expression and with SP cell phenotype showed higher potential to convert to EG cells. Negative or low integrin alpha6 expression in PGCs was also correlated with lower expression of Ddx4, which is specifically expressed in PGCs after embryonic day 10.5. The results indicate that the primitive PGC population showing the SP cell phenotype among undifferentiated PGCs has a higher ability of being converted into EG cells. Thus, conversion of PGCs into pluripotential stem cells may be regulated by being influenced by the natural status of individual PGCs as well as the reprogramming process after starting culture.","['Matsui, Yasuhisa', 'Tokitake, Yuko']","['Matsui Y', 'Tokitake Y']","['Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi 980-8575, Japan. ymatsui@idac.tohoku.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Dev Growth Differ,"Development, growth & differentiation",0356504,"['0 (Integrin alpha6)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Ddx4 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Germ Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Integrin alpha6/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism']",2009/08/29 09:00,2009/10/02 06:00,['2009/08/29 09:00'],"['2009/08/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['DGD1125 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1440-169X.2009.01125.x [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Growth Differ. 2009 Sep;51(7):657-67. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-169X.2009.01125.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through its effect on cell proliferation, iron is involved in both fetal development and cancer. We hypothesize that HFE links higher infant birth weight with leukemia risk and that maternal HFE genotype modifies this association. PROCEDURE: Nine hundred ninety-five infants and their mothers from the North Cumbria Community Genetics Project, and 163 incident childhood ALL cases from the Newcastle Haematology Biobank were genotyped for HFE, HAMP, TFRC variants and 21 genomic control loci. Cord blood iron levels were measured in 217 control infants. RESULTS: Three HFE variants showed correlations with birth weight with a gene-dosage relationship in males (gender effect). The association was stronger in homozygotes for TFRC S142G and when the mother was positive for any HFE variant (maternal effect). The genotypes expected to increase fetal iron levels correlated with birth weight in males and their association with ALL was stronger in females who, we postulate, could not offset iron excess by increasing their weight. CONCLUSIONS: Certain materno-fetal genotype combinations that increase fetal iron exposure showed associations with higher birth weight in males and somewhat higher ALL risk in females. Gender-specific use of iron during fetal growth may lead to this dichotomy in birth weight change. Only the materno-fetal genotype combinations that increase iron levels most extremely correlated with birth weight and ALL risk in males.","['Dorak, M Tevfik', 'Mackay, Rachel K', 'Relton, Caroline L', 'Worwood, Mark', 'Parker, Louise', 'Hall, Andrew G']","['Dorak MT', 'Mackay RK', 'Relton CL', 'Worwood M', 'Parker L', 'Hall AG']","['Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle, UK. dorakmt@dorak.info']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides)', '0 (CD71 antigen)', '0 (HAMP protein, human)', '0 (HFE protein, human)', '0 (Hemochromatosis Protein)', '0 (Hepcidins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*genetics', 'Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides/*genetics', 'Birth Weight/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/chemistry', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hemochromatosis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Hemochromatosis Protein', 'Hepcidins', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Infant, Low Birth Weight', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Iron/blood/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Models, Biological', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications/blood/*genetics', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*genetics', 'Risk', 'Sex Factors']",2009/08/28 09:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/08/28 09:00'],"['2009/08/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22236 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Dec 15;53(7):1242-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22236.,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

The type II cell lines could not differentiate into granulocytes by G-CSF treatment and died rapidly in response to M-CSF treatment. Transplantation of both types I and II cells induced lethal myeloproliferative disease (MPD)-like myeloid leukemia in most of the sublethally irradiated B6 mice. Flow cytometric analysis of GFP and lineage markers of the peripheral blood cells from MPD mice revealed that the monocytes and granulocytes were generated not only from the donor cells but also from the host cells. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the MLL/AF10(OM-LZ)-immortalized cells expressed mRNAs encoding colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) of M-CSF and GM-CSF and inflammatory cytokines of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. Our results showed that the MLL/AF10(OM-LZ)-immortalized cells could induce host cell proliferation in the transplanted mice, probably through stimulation by CSFs or cytokines produced by the donor cells.","['Fu, Jen-Fen', 'Hsu, Cheng-Lung', 'Shih, Lee-Yung']","['Fu JF', 'Hsu CL', 'Shih LY']","['Department of Medical Research, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, and Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (MLL-AF10 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Monocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2009/08/28 09:00,2010/02/19 06:00,['2009/08/28 09:00'],"['2009/08/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24867 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2010 Apr 1;126(7):1621-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24867.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine the relative frequency of different subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in Kuwait based on the Revised European-American Lymphoma (REAL) classification. From 1998 to 2006, 738 subjects were included that were registered with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the population-based cancer registry at the Kuwait Cancer Control Center. Expert pathologists reviewed histological slides from all subjects. We performed detailed immunohistochemical studies and classified subjects based on the REAL classification. The prevalence of different types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was determined based on age, sex, site of disease, and ethnicity. Ethnicity groups comprised Kuwaiti Arabs, non Kuwaiti Arabs, Asians, and others. The prevalence of B- and T-cell lymphomas was 81.8% and 14.2%, respectively. The most common age group was 41-60 years old. The three most common subtypes in Kuwaiti Arabs were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (46.5%), follicular lymphoma (15.5%), and mycosis fungoides (9.3%). In non-Kuwaiti Arabs, the most common subtypes were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (48%), B-cell small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (15.8%), and follicular lymphoma (12.7%). Overall, non-Kuwaiti Arabs exhibited the highest prevalence (59%), and 54% of all cases had extranodal presentation. Compared to the Western world, Kuwait had a lower prevalence of follicular lymphoma, a higher prevalence of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and extranodal presentation, and a high frequency of mycosis fungoides. Compared to other parts of Asia, Kuwait had a lower frequency of peripheral T-cell lymphomas.","['Ameen, Reem', 'Sajnani, Kamlesh P', 'Albassami, Amani', 'Refaat, Samar']","['Ameen R', 'Sajnani KP', 'Albassami A', 'Refaat S']","['Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Kuwait University, Kuwait, Kuwait. reemameen@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090828,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kuwait/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology/*ethnology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Sex Distribution', 'Young Adult']",2009/08/28 09:00,2010/01/12 06:00,['2009/08/28 09:00'],"['2009/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-009-0801-z [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2010 Feb;89(2):179-84. doi: 10.1007/s00277-009-0801-z.

We have previously shown that in vitro stimulation of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with primary AML cells modified to express CD80 and IL-2 promotes proliferation, secretion of Th1 cytokines and expansion of activated CD8(+) T cells. In this study, we show that allogeneic effector cells (from a healthy donor or AML patients) when stimulated with IL-2/CD80 modified AML blasts were able to induce the lysis of unmodified AML blasts. Effector cells stimulated with IL-2/CD80AML blasts had higher lytic activity than cells stimulated with AML cells expressing CD80 or IL-2 alone. Similarly, AML patient PBMCs primed with autologous IL-2/CD80 AML cells had a higher frequency of IFN-gamma secreting cells and show cytotoxicity against autologous, unmodified blasts. Crucially, the response appears to be leukaemia specific, since stimulated patient PBMCs show higher frequencies of IFN-gamma secreting effector cells in response to AML blasts than to remission bone marrow cells from the same patients. Although studied in a small number of heterogeneous patient samples, the data are encouraging and support the continuing development of vaccination for poor prognosis AML patients with autologous cells genetically modified to express IL-2/CD80.","['Hardwick, Nicola', 'Chan, Lucas', 'Ingram, Wendy', 'Mufti, Ghulam', 'Farzaneh, Farzin']","['Hardwick N', 'Chan L', 'Ingram W', 'Mufti G', 'Farzaneh F']","[""Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College London, The Rayne Institute, UK.""]",['eng'],"['BB/D014301/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'BB/E005896/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090827,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B7-1 Antigen/*genetics/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2009/08/28 09:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/08/28 09:00'],"['2009/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-009-0756-x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2010 Mar;59(3):379-88. doi: 10.1007/s00262-009-0756-x.

Initial results.",185-91,10.3413/nukmed-0236 [doi],"AIM: Granulocytic sarcomas (GS) are rare extramedullary manifestations of myeloid or lymphoblastic leukaemia. Laboratory examinations are of limited use for diagnosis of extramedullary disease. Radiological imaging based on morphology is challenging. To date, the possible role of FDG-PET/CT as a method for combined metabolic and morphologic imaging is unclear. We present a series of 10 patients to evaluate the potential role of FDG-PET/CT in the management of GS. PATIENTS, MATERIALS, METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of 18 FDG-PET/CT exams in 10 patients with histologically proven GS was performed. All scans included a contrast enhanced CT. The FDG uptake of GS was analyzed and the sensitivity of lesion detection was compared to PET and CT alone. The changes in FDG uptake after therapy were compared to morphological changes detected by CT and follow-up / clinical outcome. RESULTS: 52 untreated or recurrent GS lesions were detected by FDG-PET/CT and all showed an increased FDG uptake with a mean SUVmax and SUVavg of 5.1 and 3.4, respectively. GS was multifocal in 8/10 patients. Combined PET/CT avoided 5 false positive findings compared to PET alone and 13 false negative findings and 1 false positive compared to CT alone. Changes in FDG uptake after therapy correlated with clinical outcome and were more reliable than CT assessment alone. PET/CT identified recurrent GS in 3 patients. CONCLUSION: Viable GS are FDG-avid. Using this metabolic information and morphologic CT criteria, combined FDG-PET/CT was more accurate in lesion detection than FDG-PET or CT alone. Changes in FDG uptake after therapy might be a useful additional parameter for therapy monitoring. Therefore, FDG-PET/CT appears to be a promising diagnostic and monitoring tool in the management of patients with GS.","['Aschoff, P', 'Hantschel, M', 'Oksuz, M', 'Werner, M K', 'Lichy, M', 'Vogel, W', 'Pfannenberg, C']","['Aschoff P', 'Hantschel M', 'Oksuz M', 'Werner MK', 'Lichy M', 'Vogel W', 'Pfannenberg C']","['University Hospital, Eberhard-Karls-University Tuebingen, University Hospital, Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Hoppe-Seyler-Str. 3, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090827,Germany,Nuklearmedizin,Nuklearmedizin.

One possible explanation is that CD34(+) cells do not accumulate sufficient intracellular drug levels because of either inadequate active uptake or increased efflux. To determine the interaction of nilotinib with major clinically implicated drug transporters, we analyzed their interactions with MDR1 (ABCB1), MRP1 (ABCC1), ABCG2 (BCRP) and human organic cation transporter (hOCT)1 in CML cell lines and primitive (CD34(+)) primary CML cells. Nilotinib is neither dependent on active import by hOCT1, nor effluxed through the ATP-binding cassette transporters analyzed. Indeed, we found nilotinib to be an inhibitor of hOCT1, MDR1 and ABCG2. The efflux transporters MDR1, MRP1 and ABCG2 are expressed on CML CD34(+) cells at 13.5, 108 and 291% of control, respectively, although hOCT1 expression was absent; however, inhibition of efflux transporter activity did not potentiate the effect of nilotinib on apoptosis, Bcr-Abl inhibition or CML CD34(+) cell proliferation.

Unfortunately, however, tumors including adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) have disadvantages such as p53 mutations and a lack of p16(INK4a) and/or p14(ARF). In this study we characterized Nutlin-3a-induced cell death in 16 leukemia/lymphoma cell lines. Eight cell lines, including six ATL-related cell lines, had wild-type p53 and Nutlin-3a-activated p53, and the cell lines underwent apoptosis or cell-cycle arrest, whereas eight cell lines with mutated p53 were resistant. Interestingly, senescence-associated-beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) staining revealed that only ATL-related cell lines with wild-type p53 showed cellular senescence, although they lack both p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF). These results indicate that cellular senescence is an important event in p53-dependent cell death in ATL cells and is inducible without p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF). Furthermore, knockdown of Tp53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR), a novel target gene of p53, by small interfering RNA(siRNA) indicated its important role in the induction of cellular senescence. As many patients with ATL carry wild-type p53, our study suggests that p53 activation by Nutlin-3a is a promising strategy in ATL. We also found synergism with a combination of Nutlin-3a and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), suggesting the application of Nutlin-3a-based therapy to be broader than expected.","['Hasegawa, H', 'Yamada, Y', 'Iha, H', 'Tsukasaki, K', 'Nagai, K', 'Atogami, S', 'Sugahara, K', 'Tsuruda, K', 'Ishizaki, A', 'Kamihira, S']","['Hasegawa H', 'Yamada Y', 'Iha H', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Nagai K', 'Atogami S', 'Sugahara K', 'Tsuruda K', 'Ishizaki A', 'Kamihira S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090827,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (TIGAR protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cellular Senescence/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Piperazines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/08/28 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/28 09:00'],"['2009/08/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009171 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.171 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Nov;23(11):2090-101. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.171.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains incurable despite the introduction of new treatments. CLL B cells are characterized by an apoptosis defect rather than excessive proliferation, but proliferation centers have been found in organs such as the bone marrow and lymph nodes. In this study, we analyzed gene expression modifications in CLL B cells after treatment with valproic acid (VPA), a well-tolerated anti-epileptic drug with HDAC inhibitory activity. CLL B cells obtained from 14 patients were treated in vitro with a concentration of 1 mM VPA for 4 h. VPA effects on gene expression were thereafter studied using Affymetrix technology, and some identified genes were validated by real-time PCR and western blot. We observed that VPA induced apoptosis by downregulating several anti-apoptotic genes and by upregulating pro-apoptotic genes. Furthermore, VPA significantly increased chemosensitivity to fludarabine, flavopiridol, bortezomib, thalidomide and lenalidomide. VPA inhibited the proliferation of CpG/IL2-stimulated CLL B cells and modulated many cell cycle messenger RNAs. In conclusion, exposure of CLL B cells to VPA induced apoptosis, potentiated chemotherapeutic agent effects and inhibited proliferation. These data strongly suggest the use of VPA in CLL treatment, particularly in combination with antileukemia agents.","['Stamatopoulos, B', 'Meuleman, N', 'De Bruyn, C', 'Mineur, P', 'Martiat, P', 'Bron, D', 'Lagneaux, L']","['Stamatopoulos B', 'Meuleman N', 'De Bruyn C', 'Mineur P', 'Martiat P', 'Bron D', 'Lagneaux L']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Boulevard de Waterloo 121, Brussels, Belgium. bstamato@ulb.ac.be']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090827,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology']",2009/08/28 09:00,2010/01/15 06:00,['2009/08/28 09:00'],"['2009/08/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009176 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.176 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Dec;23(12):2281-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.176.

Earlier studies have shown that MLL fusion proteins induced acute leukemia together with another mutation, such as an FLT3 mutant, in mouse models. However, little has hitherto been elucidated regarding the molecular mechanism of the cooperativity in leukemogenesis. Using murine model systems of the MLL-fusion-mediated leukemogenesis leading to oncogenic transformation in vitro and acute leukemia in vivo, this study characterized the molecular network in the cooperative leukemogenesis. This research revealed that MLL fusion proteins cooperated with activation of Ras in vivo, which was substitutable for Raf in vitro, synergistically, but not with activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), to induce acute leukemia in vivo as well as oncogenic transformation in vitro. Furthermore, Hoxa9, one of the MLL-targeted critical molecules, and activation of Ras in vivo, which was replaceable with Raf in vitro, were identified as fundamental components sufficient for mimicking MLL-fusion-mediated leukemogenesis. These findings suggest that the molecular crosstalk between aberrant expression of Hox molecule(s) and activated Raf may have a key role in the MLL-fusion-mediated-leukemogenesis, and may thus help develop the novel molecularly targeted therapy against MLL-related leukemia.","['Ono, R', 'Kumagai, H', 'Nakajima, H', 'Hishiya, A', 'Taki, T', 'Horikawa, K', 'Takatsu, K', 'Satoh, T', 'Hayashi, Y', 'Kitamura, T', 'Nosaka, T']","['Ono R', 'Kumagai H', 'Nakajima H', 'Hishiya A', 'Taki T', 'Horikawa K', 'Takatsu K', 'Satoh T', 'Hayashi Y', 'Kitamura T', 'Nosaka T']","['Division of Hematopoietic Factors, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090827,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (raf Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Receptor Cross-Talk', 'raf Kinases/*metabolism', 'ras Proteins/*physiology']",2009/08/28 09:00,2010/01/15 06:00,['2009/08/28 09:00'],"['2009/08/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009177 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.177 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Dec;23(12):2197-209. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.177.

In mice, expression of oncogenic K-RAS or inactivation of Nf1 in hematopoietic cells results in myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) that do not progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Because NF1 is a RAS-GTPase-activating protein it has been proposed that NF1 deficiency is functionally equivalent to an oncogenic RAS. It is not clear, however, whether Nf1 deficiency would be redundant in K-RAS-induced MPD development or whether the 2 mutations would cooperate in leukemogenesis. Here, we show that the simultaneous inactivation of Nf1 and expression of K-RAS(G12D) in mouse hematopoietic cells results in AML that was fatal in primary mice within 4 weeks and transplantable to sublethally irradiated secondary recipients.

Eltrombopag is a small molecule thrombopoietin receptor agonist that might be a new option to treat thrombocytopenia in these diseases, provided that it does not stimulate malignant hematopoiesis. In this work, we studied the effects of Eltrombopag on proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, colony formation, and malignant self-renewal of bone marrow mononuclear cells of patients with AML and MDS. Malignant bone marrow mononuclear cells did not show increased proliferation, or increased clonogenic capacity at concentrations of Eltrombopag ranging from 0.1 to 30 microg/mL. On the contrary, we observed a moderate, statistically nonsignificant (P = .18), decrease of numbers of malignant cells (mean, 56%; SD, 28%).

Furthermore, we found that Eltrombopag was capable of increasing megakaryocytic differentiation and formation of normal megakaryocytic colonies in patients with AML and MDS.

An international, randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to compare complete remission (CR) rates and overall survival (OS) in patients with first relapse acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated with laromustine and high-dose cytarabine (HDAC) versus HDAC/placebo. Patients received 1.5 g/m(2) per day cytarabine continuous infusion for 3 days and laromustine 600 mg/m(2) (n = 177) or placebo (n = 86) on day 2. Patients in CR received consolidation with laromustine/HDAC or HDAC/placebo as per initial randomization. After interim analysis at 50% enrollment, the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) expressed concern that any advantage in CR would be compromised by the observed on-study mortality, and enrollment was held. The CR rate was significantly higher for the laromustine/HDAC group (35% vs 19%, P = .005). However, the 30-day mortality rate and median progression-free survival were significantly worse in this group compared with HDAC/placebo (11% vs 2%; P = .016; 54 days vs 34; P = .002). OS and median response durations were similar in both groups. Laromustine/HDAC induced significantly more CR than HDAC/placebo, but OS was not improved due to mortality associated with myelosuppression and its sequelae.

We studied peripheral blood from newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to assess the impact of this disease on the patients' T cells. The absolute number of peripheral blood T cells is increased in AML compared with healthy controls. An increase in the absolute number of CD3+56+ cells was also noted. Gene expression profiling on T cells from AML patients compared with healthy donors demonstrated global differences in transcription suggesting aberrant T-cell activation patterns. These gene expression changes differ from those observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), indicating the heterogeneous means by which different tumors evade the host immune response. However, in common with CLL, differentially regulated genes involved in actin cytoskeletal formation were identified, and therefore the ability of T cells from AML patients to form immunologic synapses was assessed. Although AML T cells could form conjugates with autologous blasts, their ability to form immune synapses and recruit phosphotyrosine signaling molecules to the synapse was significantly impaired. These findings identify T-cell dysfunction in AML that may contribute to the failure of a host immune response against leukemic blasts.","['Le Dieu, Rifca', 'Taussig, David C', 'Ramsay, Alan G', 'Mitter, Richard', 'Miraki-Moud, Faridah', 'Fatah, Rewas', 'Lee, Abigail M', 'Lister, T Andrew', 'Gribben, John G']","['Le Dieu R', 'Taussig DC', 'Ramsay AG', 'Mitter R', 'Miraki-Moud F', 'Fatah R', 'Lee AM', 'Lister TA', 'Gribben JG']","['Institute of Cancer, Centre for Medical Oncology, Barts and The London School of Medicine, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['G0501940/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'P01 CA095426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA95426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090826,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD36 Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blast Crisis/blood/diagnosis/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'CD3 Complex', 'CD36 Antigens', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/immunology', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunological Synapses/genetics/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/diagnosis/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/pathology']",2009/08/28 09:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/08/28 09:00'],"['2009/08/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39027-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-02-206946 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Oct 29;114(18):3909-16. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-02-206946.

For clinical purposes, the amount of chimeric transcript is considered proportional to the leukemic clone; thus, mRNA is commonly used for molecular monitoring of patients. However, there is no consensus regarding the degree of increase in mRNA that should cause concern or whether the absence of transcript indicates a ""cure."" In this study, we analyzed 57 samples from 10 chronic myeloid leukemia patients undergoing imatinib treatment. For each sample, we compared BCR-ABL mRNA levels with the actual proportion of leukemic cells, which were measured through a novel genomic approach based on the quantitative amplification of DNA breakpoints. The two approaches gave similar patterns of residual disease, and the majority of patients were still positive after an average treatment period of 2 years. Nevertheless, in one of two patients with confirmed undetectable levels of chimeric transcript, DNA still revealed the persistence of leukemic cells at 42 months. These findings appear to justify the clinical practice of maintaining imatinib treatment indefinitely. However, the absence of leukemic DNA (observed in 1 of 10 patients) could be used to identify possible candidates for drug discontinuation. In conclusion, DNA analysis proved to be a reliable index of residual disease with potential applications in the field of clinical diagnostics and research.","['Mattarucchi, Elia', 'Spinelli, Orietta', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Pasquali, Francesco', 'Lo Curto, Francesco', 'Campiotti, Leonardo', 'Porta, Giovanni']","['Mattarucchi E', 'Spinelli O', 'Rambaldi A', 'Pasquali F', 'Lo Curto F', 'Campiotti L', 'Porta G']","[""Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences, Universita dell'Insubria, via Dunant 5, 21100 Varese, Italy.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'DNA/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics']",2009/08/28 09:00,2009/11/05 06:00,['2009/08/28 09:00'],"['2009/08/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-1578(10)60267-X [pii]', '10.2353/jmoldx.2009.080150 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2009 Sep;11(5):482-7. doi: 10.2353/jmoldx.2009.080150.,PMC2729847,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DS children have a approximately 10- to 20-fold higher risk for developing acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as compared with non-DS children, although they do not have a uniformly increased risk of developing solid tumors. DS children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia frequently experience higher levels of treatment-related toxicity and inferior event-free survival rates, as compared with non-DS children. DS children also develop AML with unique features and have a 500-fold increased risk of developing the AML subtype, acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMkL; M7). Nearly 10% of DS newborns are diagnosed with a variant of AMkL, the transient myeloproliferative disorder, which can resolve spontaneously without treatment; event-free survival rates for DS patients with AMkL ranges from 80% to 100%, in comparison with <30% for non-DS children with AMkL. In addition, somatic mutations of the GATA1 gene have been detected in nearly all DS TMD and AMkL cases and not in leukemia cases in non-DS children. GATA1 mutations are key factors linked to both leukemogenesis and the high cure rates of DS AMkL patients. Identifying the mechanisms that account for the high event-free survival rates of DS AMkL patients may ultimately improve AML treatment as well. Examining leukemogenesis in DS children may identify factors linked to the general development of childhood leukemia and lead to potential new therapeutic strategies to fight this disease.","['Xavier, Ana C', 'Ge, Yubin', 'Taub, Jeffrey W']","['Xavier AC', 'Ge Y', 'Taub JW']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Department of Pediatrics, Wayne State University School of Medicine, 3901 Beaubien Blvd., Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.""]",['eng'],['R01 CA120772/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/*genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/epidemiology/etiology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/etiology/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology/genetics']",2009/08/28 09:00,2009/11/05 06:00,['2009/08/28 09:00'],"['2009/08/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-1578(10)60254-1 [pii]', '10.2353/jmoldx.2009.080132 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2009 Sep;11(5):371-80. doi: 10.2353/jmoldx.2009.080132.,PMC2729834,,,87,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These conditions shield pluripotent cells from differentiation-inducing stimuli. We investigate the effect of these inhibitors on the development of pluripotent epiblast in intact pre-implantation embryos. We find that blockade of Erk signalling from the 8-cell stage does not impede blastocyst formation but suppresses development of the hypoblast. The size of the inner cell mass (ICM) compartment is not reduced, however. Throughout the ICM, the epiblast-specific marker Nanog is expressed, and in XX embryos epigenetic silencing of the paternal X chromosome is erased. Epiblast identity and pluripotency were confirmed by contribution to chimaeras with germline transmission. These observations indicate that segregation of hypoblast from the bipotent ICM is dependent on FGF/Erk signalling and that in the absence of this signal, the entire ICM can acquire pluripotency. Furthermore, the epiblast does not require paracrine support from the hypoblast. Thus, naive epiblast and ES cells are in a similar ground state, with an autonomous capacity for survival and replication, and high vulnerability to Erk signalling. We probed directly the relationship between naive epiblast and ES cells. Dissociated ICM cells from freshly harvested late blastocysts gave rise to up to 12 ES cell clones per embryo when plated in the presence of inhibitors. We propose that ES cells are not a tissue culture creation, but are essentially identical to pre-implantation epiblast cells.","['Nichols, Jennifer', 'Silva, Jose', 'Roode, Mila', 'Smith, Austin']","['Nichols J', 'Silva J', 'Roode M', 'Smith A']","['Wellcome Trust Centre for Stem Cell Research, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QR, UK. jn270@cam.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['G9806702/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '073607/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'G9806702ID84670/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090826,England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (2-(2-chloro-4-iodophenylamino)-N-cyclopropylmethoxy-3,4-difluorobenzamide)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (SU 5402)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Blastocyst Inner Cell Mass/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Embryo Culture Techniques', 'Embryonic Development/drug effects/*physiology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Female', 'Germ Layers/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Pregnancy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'Rats']",2009/08/28 09:00,2009/10/15 06:00,['2009/08/28 09:00'],"['2009/08/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['dev.038893 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.038893 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2009 Oct;136(19):3215-22. doi: 10.1242/dev.038893.

Finally, LPL protein expression correlated significantly with mRNA expression and was higher in IGHV unmutated versus mutated CLL (p=0.018), although the majority of synthesized protein was catalytically inactive indicating a non-catalytical function in CLL.","['Mansouri, Mahmoud', 'Sevov, Marie', 'Fahlgren, Emma', 'Tobin, Gerard', 'Jondal, Mikael', 'Osorio, Lyda', 'Roos, Goran', 'Olivecrona, Gunilla', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Mansouri M', 'Sevov M', 'Fahlgren E', 'Tobin G', 'Jondal M', 'Osorio L', 'Roos G', 'Olivecrona G', 'Rosenquist R']","['Department of Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. mahmoud.mansouri@genpat.uu.se']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090825,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/genetics/mortality', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/*biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/08/28 09:00,2010/03/24 06:00,['2009/08/28 09:00'],"['2009/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00382-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.07.032 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Mar;34(3):301-6. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.07.032.

Our data demonstrated that ST6Gal I and ST3Gal V mRNA were up-regulated in lymphoblasts whereas its presence was negligible in non-malignant donors. In contrast, ST8SiaI was downregulated in patients. The extents of linkage-specific sialylation of glycoconjugates were found to be associated with disease establishment. Additionally, ST6Gal I and ST3Gal V were positively correlated with the high risk of the disease (P=0.0032 and 0.0016).

Based on a different cultural perspective, qualitative study regarding cancer-related fatigue in China can provide a cultural context for enriching the system of knowledge about fatigue. OBJECTIVES: To explore the real-life experiences of fatigue from the perspectives of Chinese Children with leukaemia. DESIGN: A phenomenological study. SETTING: A paediatric haematology oncology department of a regional tertiary children's hospital in Shanghai, China. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 14 children and adolescents with leukaemia, aged 7-18 years old, without known psychiatric or developmental disorders, was selected by purposive sampling. METHODS: Four focus group interviews were conducted with nine open-ended, semi-structured questions. FINDINGS: Cancer-related fatigue is a common and distressing issue for Chinese children and adolescents with leukaemia. Three themes were finally generated: 'fatigue is an open interpretation among children and adolescents', 'fatigue is not a single-dimensional aspect', and 'struggles with fatigue and balancing life suffering'. Fatigue, which is closely related to physical, psychological and situational factors, has negative affects on the participants physically, psychologically and on their cognitive well-being, and can impact the family, school and social interaction of children with leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents could easily distinguish cancer-related fatigue from normal fatigue. The participants' message to health professionals is that fatigue is a multidimensional and multifactorial symptom that should be comprehensively understood and managed. The findings provide insight and direction for clinical practice and research regarding intervention development and education plans for cancer-related fatigue for paediatric oncology patients.","['Wu, Meisi', 'Hsu, Lily', 'Zhang, Binghua', 'Shen, Nanping', 'Lu, Hong', 'Li, Sijian']","['Wu M', 'Hsu L', 'Zhang B', 'Shen N', 'Lu H', 'Li S']","[""Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090825,England,Int J Nurs Stud,International journal of nursing studies,0400675,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'China', 'Fatigue/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology/psychology']",2009/08/28 09:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/08/28 09:00'],"['2008/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0020-7489(09)00201-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2009.05.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Nurs Stud. 2010 Jan;47(1):49-59. doi: 10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2009.05.026.

Despite an increase in the white blood cell count, the leukaemic leukocytes are non-functional. The oral complications arising in leukaemic patients can be attributed to the direct and indirect effects of immunosuppressive chemotherapy. METHODS: This case report describes severe maxillary and mandibular necrotizing stomatitis and osteomyelitis in a young female patient after chemotherapy for acute leukaemia. On physical examination, the patient presented malnourished with pale skin, cervical lymphadenitis, frequent fever and generalized pain. The intra-oral clinical examination found halitosis, multiple ulcers, necrotizing stomatitis and osteomyelitis located in the maxillary and mandibular regions. The necrotizing stomatitis and osteomyelitis were treated locally with atraumatic removal of the necrotized tissues. The patient received a daily preventive protocol consisting of oral hygiene care, including twice daily brushing, and mouthrinses with a solution of chlorhexidine. She was also treated with systemic metronidazole and amoxicillin for 21 days. RESULTS: During the course of management the patient's oral condition improved with some re-epithelialization being noted. However, severe alveolar bone destruction remained evident. Thirty-two months after presentation of the initial symptoms, the patient died due to complications related to leukaemia recurrence (haemorrhage, sepsis and respiratory distress syndrome). CONCLUSIONS: Dental monitoring during cancer treatment is imperative in order to emphasize the importance of dental plaque control and the maintenance of a healthy periodontal condition throughout medical treatment.","['Santos, F A', 'Pochapski, M T', 'Pilatti, G L', 'Kozlowski, V A Jr', 'Goiris, F A J', 'Groppo, F C']","['Santos FA', 'Pochapski MT', 'Pilatti GL', 'Kozlowski VA Jr', 'Goiris FA', 'Groppo FC']","['Department of Dentistry, Ponta Grossa State University, Ponta Grossa, Parana, Brazil. fasantos11@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Australia,Aust Dent J,Australian dental journal,0370612,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents, Local)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'MOR84MUD8E (chlorhexidine gluconate)', 'R4KO0DY52L (Chlorhexidine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alveolar Bone Loss/chemically induced/*complications/pathology', 'Anti-Infective Agents, Local/therapeutic use', 'Chlorhexidine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Debridement', 'Dental Plaque/complications', '*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/therapeutic use', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy', 'Mandible', 'Maxilla', 'Necrosis/pathology', 'Osteomyelitis/chemically induced/*complications/pathology/therapy', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced/*complications/pathology/therapy']",2009/08/28 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/28 09:00'],"['2009/08/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ADJ1129 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1834-7819.2009.01129.x [doi]']",ppublish,Aust Dent J. 2009 Sep;54(3):262-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1834-7819.2009.01129.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, the efficacy of 8-Cl-Ado was evaluated using mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell lines: Granta 519, JeKo, Mino, and SP-53. After continuous exposure to 10 mumol/l 8-Cl-Ado for 24 h, loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and poly [adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose] polymerase (PARP) cleavage were detected in three of four cell lines. Reduced ATP levels (30-60% reduction) and concurrent 8-Cl-ATP accumulation were highly associated with cell death (P < 0.01). The intracellular 8-Cl-ATP concentrations were also highly correlated with inhibition of global transcription (50-90%, r(2) = 0.90, P < 0.01). However, the inhibition of transcription only accounted for 30-40% of cell death as determined by equivalent inhibition with actinomycin D. Likewise, short-lived mRNAs, those encoding cyclin D1 and Mcl-1, were not consistently reduced after treatment. Unique to MCL as compared to other haematological malignancies, 8-Cl-Ado inhibited the rates of DNA synthesis and selectively depleted dATP pools (50-80%). We conclude that the DNA and RNA directed actions of 8-Cl-Ado in combination with depleted energetics may promote cell death and inhibit growth of MCL cell lines.","['Dennison, Jennifer B', 'Balakrishnan, Kumudha', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Dennison JB', 'Balakrishnan K', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA085915/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA136411-01A15414/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 85915/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA085915-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA136411/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA136411/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090825,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'PA05MFH3I7 (8-chloroadenosine)']",IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/08/28 09:00,2010/02/24 06:00,['2009/08/28 09:00'],"['2009/08/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7850 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07850.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Nov;147(3):297-307. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07850.x.

Here, we investigated 167 first-degree relatives from 42 families of patients with non-familial (sporadic) CLL, using four-colour flow cytometry. MBL was found in seven of 167 subjects (4.1%). Monoclonality was detected in all cases either by light-chain restriction or by polymerase chain reaction. Fluorescence in situ hybridization did not show any chromosomal abnormality. The prevalence of MBL according to age was 0 (0/54) in individuals aged less than 40 years, 2.5% (2/81) between 40 and 60 years, and 15.6% (5/32) in individuals over 60 years. The prevalence of MBL cases in individuals over 60 years was similar to that found in familial CLL relatives at the same age group. This suggests that in older first-degree relatives of patients with sporadic CLL, the risk of MBL detection is as high as in older first-degree relatives from CLL families, which could render these individuals belonging to 'sporadic CLL families' as susceptible as individuals from 'familial CLL' to the development of clinical CLL.","['Matos, Daniel M', 'Ismael, Sebastiao J', 'Scrideli, Carlos A', 'de Oliveira, Fabio M', 'Rego, Eduardo M', 'Falcao, Roberto P']","['Matos DM', 'Ismael SJ', 'Scrideli CA', 'de Oliveira FM', 'Rego EM', 'Falcao RP']","['Department of Clinical Medicine and Centre for Research on Cell-Based Therapy, School of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto-SP, Brasil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090825,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', '*B-Lymphocytes', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation/methods', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Lymphocytosis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Sex Distribution']",2009/08/28 09:00,2010/02/24 06:00,['2009/08/28 09:00'],"['2009/08/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7861 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07861.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Nov;147(3):339-46. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07861.x.

Analyses include 310 deaths due to leukemia during the period 1950-2000 among 86,611 people in the LSS. Poisson regression methods were used to evaluate associations between estimated bone marrow dose and leukemia mortality. Attention was given to variation in the radiation dose-leukemia mortality association by time since exposure, age at exposure, city and sex. The excess relative rate per gray of acute myeloid leukemia was best described by a quadratic dose-response function that peaked approximately 10 years after exposure. Acute lymphatic leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia mortality were best described by a linear dose-response function that did not vary with time since exposure. Adult T-cell leukemia was not associated with estimated bone marrow dose. Overall, 103 of the 310 observed leukemia deaths were estimated to be excess deaths due to radiation exposure. In the most recent decade of observation (1991-2000), the estimated attributable fraction of leukemia deaths among those survivors exposed to >0.005 Gy was 0.34, suggesting that the effect of the atomic bombings on leukemia mortality has persisted in this cohort for more than five decades.","['Richardson, David', 'Sugiyama, Hiromi', 'Nishi, Nobuo', 'Sakata, Ritsu', 'Shimizu, Yukiko', 'Grant, Eric J', 'Soda, Midori', 'Hsu, Wan-Ling', 'Suyama, Akihiko', 'Kodama, Kazunori', 'Kasagi, Fumiyoshi']","['Richardson D', 'Sugiyama H', 'Nishi N', 'Sakata R', 'Shimizu Y', 'Grant EJ', 'Soda M', 'Hsu WL', 'Suyama A', 'Kodama K', 'Kasagi F']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA. david.richardson@unc.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Warfare/*statistics & numerical data', 'Sex Distribution', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",2009/08/28 09:00,2009/10/16 06:00,['2009/08/28 09:00'],"['2009/08/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1667/RR1801.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Res. 2009 Sep;172(3):368-82. doi: 10.1667/RR1801.1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty eight patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia (AL) were divided into three groups by anemia severity: group 1 (Hb > 90 g/l), group 2 (Hb 90-70 g/l), group 3 (Hb < 70 g/l). Erythropoietin concentration was measured with enzyme immunoassay, serum ferritin (SF)--by radioimmunoassay; HIF-1alpha, hepsidine--by sandvich enzyme immunoassay with use of monospecific antisera and monoclonal antibodies against relevant antigens. RESULTS: In AL patients SF before treatment was 10 times higher than in healthy subjects, administration of cytostatics elevated this concentration even more. Hepsidine and HIF-1alpha are also elevated. Treatment reduces hepsidine level twice in all the groups. This may be due to reduction of the tumor mass. Erythropoietin was 20-35 times higher in all the patients, especially in myelotoxic agranulocytosis (up to 1000 mU/ml) with reduction after recovery of hemopoiesis (in some patients to normal values 20-30 mU/ml). Hepsidine and HIF-1alpha concentrations were also maximal in myelotoxic agranulocytosis (20-28 pg/ml). After recovery of hemopoiesis these values fell to initial values 7-9 pg/ ml). Transfusion of donor erythrocytic mass normalized HIF-1alpha concentration and decreased that of hepsidine. Its elevation and high HIF-1alpha were observed after the transfusion in 17% patients. CONCLUSION: Disorders in regulatory mechanisms in AL patients throughout the observation confirm the role of the proteins studied in homeostasis. Changes in HIF-1alpha and hepsidine concentrations can be used as indicators of transfusion efficacy.","['Makeshova, A B', 'Levina, A A', 'Mamukova, Iu I', 'Savchenko, V G']","['Makeshova AB', 'Levina AA', 'Mamukova IuI', 'Savchenko VG']",,['rus'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,"['0 (Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Hepcidins)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides/blood', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion', 'Erythropoietin/blood', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Hepcidins', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/blood', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*blood/*metabolism/therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests']",2009/08/28 09:00,2010/01/20 06:00,['2009/08/28 09:00'],"['2009/08/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2009;81(7):16-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematological examination results are sensitive to changes in treatment, and are likely to be influenced by blood collection techniques. Panic values may directly influence the diagnosis in many cases because they are treated as clinical evidence. Therefore, the reported results should be carefully evaluated considering the pathologic condition of the patient. In our institution, panic values are determined based on the following concept: ""Panic values are established to determine when to ask the opinion of the physician in charge of the patient regarding the validity or confirmation of the clinical condition when an abnormal value is observed."" This report describes our approaches for the utilization of panic values and associated problems. Values were determined by referring to those reported previously in the literature and considering differences between the former panic values and clinical conditions and the prescription history of the patients. The reports were made to the doctors in charge in each of the departments directly by telephone or pager. Clinical technologists obtained clinical information, such as on the diagnosis, infusion solutions, and medications, and asked for approval to conduct additional examinations accordingly. The numbers of reports on each item for six months from March to August in 2008 were summed. As the results, a total of four items (SFMC + TAT + D-d + FDP) accounted for 28%, hemoglobin 15%, platelets 10%, INR 9%, APTT 8%, two or more items of CBC 8%, PT+APTT 7%, differential WBC 6%, CBC + differential WBC 5%, WBC 3%, fibrinogen 0.9%, and AT 0.1%. The number of reports as a percentage of the total orders was 0.14% for CBC-related and 0.49% for hemostasis-related items. Regarding diseases and clinical conditions, blood collection-related events accounted for 11.9%, poor management of warfarin administration 9.3%, leukemia and malignant lymphoma 7.7% and chemotherapy 7.4%, and then under-administration of heparin, DIC, the perinatal period, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, severe hepatic disorder, EBV, and acute virus infection, in order of decreasing frequency. This method enabled the quick and accurate reporting of panic values to clinical sites. Furthermore, clinical technologists could be motivated to increase their awareness of the value of examinations, medications, and treatments and to be more involved in medical practice. However, there were some problems, such as intervening in the clinical practice of physicians in charge, individual variations in the performance level of clinical technologists, and insufficient uniformity of management and calculation of panic values. The provision of clinically useful information will be made possible by constructing systems to send panic values to the mobile terminals of physicians in charge and being able to refer to the results and manage medical records on the system when electronic medical charts begin to be used next year.","['Shimazu, Chisato', 'Miyazawa, Yukihisa']","['Shimazu C', 'Miyazawa Y']","['Central Clinical Laboratory, Teikyo University Hospital, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo 173-8606, Japan. chisato@med.teikyo-u.ac.jp']",['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) was developed to aid in determining the prognosis of patients with MDS; this system categorizes patients into four risk groups for both overall survival and transformation to AML: low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and high. The management of MDS is based on the goal of controlling cytopenia-related symptoms, improving survival, improving quality of life, and decreasing risk of progression to AML. Treatment strategies include supportive care, iron chelation, treatment with hematopoietic growth factors,immunosuppressive therapies including lenalidomide, antithymocyte globulin, chemotherapy (eg, azacitidine, decitabine, low-dose Ara-C, 7+3 chemotherapy), and stem cell transplantation. However, selecting the appropriate therapy for each individual patient is critical to optimize clinical benefit. This monograph discusses treatment selection for the MDS patient,including a discussion of the overall survival and maintenance of MDS patients, how an appropriate therapy should be chosen in the community setting, and how MDS classification and risk stratification impacts treatment decisions.","['Silverman, Lewis R']",['Silverman LR'],"['Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,"['776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",2009/08/28 09:00,2009/10/14 06:00,['2009/08/28 09:00'],"['2009/08/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2009 Jul;7(7):S3-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These tools have been widely applied in leukaemias, lymphomas, and myelodysplasias, yet with very heterogeneous approaches. Consequently, there is no extensive reference document reporting on the characteristics of normal human bone marrow (BM) in multiparameter FCM. Here, we report a reference analysis procedure using relevant antibody combinations in normal human BM. METHODS: A first panel of 23 antibodies, constructed after literature review, was tested in four-color combinations (including CD45 in each) on 30 samples of BM. After evaluation of the data, a second set of 22 antibodies was further applied to another 35 BM samples. All list-modes from the 65 bone marrow samples were reviewed collectively. A systematised protocol for data analysis was established including biparametric representations and color codes for the three major lineages and undifferentiated cells. RESULTS: This strategy has allowed to obtain a reference atlas of relevant patterns of differentiation antigens expression in normal human BM that is available within the European LeukemiaNet. This manuscript describes how this atlas was constructed. CONCLUSIONS: Both the strategy and atlas could prove very useful as a reference of normality, for the determination of leukemia-associated immunophenotypic patterns, analysis of myelodysplasia and, ultimately, investigation of minimal residual disease in the BM.","['Arnoulet, Christine', 'Bene, Marie C', 'Durrieu, Francoise', 'Feuillard, Jean', 'Fossat, Chantal', 'Husson, Bernard', 'Jouault, Helene', 'Maynadie, Marc', 'Lacombe, Francis']","['Arnoulet C', 'Bene MC', 'Durrieu F', 'Feuillard J', 'Fossat C', 'Husson B', 'Jouault H', 'Maynadie M', 'Lacombe F']","['Biopathology, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseilles, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Novel formulations of standard chemotherapy agents may further reduce the incidence of disease recurrence after frontline chemotherapy. Vincristine (VCR) sulfate liposomes injection (VSLI) is a sphingomyelin/cholesterol nanoparticle encapsulated VCR formulation that improves the pharmacokinetic profile of VCR without augmenting neurotoxicity. METHODS: A phase 1 trial of weekly, intravenous VSLI at 1.5 mg/m(2), 1.825 mg/m(2), 2.0 mg/m(2), 2.25 mg/m(2), or 2.4 mg/m(2) was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using a standard, 3 + 3 dose-escalation design. Dexamethasone (40 mg) was given on Days 1 through 4 and on Days 11 through 14 of each 4-week cycle. RESULTS: Thirty-six adults with relapsed/refractory ALL, all previously treated with conventional VCR, received at least 1 dose of VSLI. The MTD of VSLI was 2.25 mg/m(2) based on dose-limiting toxicities of grade 3 motor neuropathy, grade 4 seizure, and grade 4 hepatotoxicity in 1 patient each at the 2.4 mg/m(2) dose level. The most common toxicities attributed to VSLI included peripheral neuropathy (55%) and constipation (53%). A complete response (CR) was achieved in 7 of 36 patients (19%) based on an intent-to-treat analysis; the CR rate was 29% for the 14 patients who underwent therapy as their first salvage attempt. Four of 7 patients who achieved a CR underwent subsequent allogeneic stem cell transplantation in remission. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, VSLI plus dexamethasone appeared to be an effective salvage therapy option for relapsed/refractory ALL. A phase 2, international, multicenter clinical trial assessing the efficacy of single-agent VSLI as second salvage therapy for patients with previously treated ALL is underway.","['Thomas, Deborah A', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Heffner, Leonard T', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Wierda, William', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Lu, Biao', 'Deitcher, Steven R', ""O'Brien, Susan""]","['Thomas DA', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Stock W', 'Heffner LT', 'Faderl S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Wierda W', 'Pierce S', 'Lu B', 'Deitcher SR', ""O'Brien S""]","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

A decrease in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, glucose transport activity and cell survival was observed in the presence of inhibitors of plasma membrane ROS sources, such as diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, and by small interference RNA for Nox2. Moreover, IL-3 incubation stimulated the synthesis of Nox2 cytosolic sub-unit p47phox and glucose transporter Glut1. Thus, the inhibition of ROS generation by Nox inhibitors stimulated apoptosis showing that ROS production, induced by IL-3 via Nox2, protects leukaemic cells from cell death. Also incubation with receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as anti-leukaemic drugs blocking the stem cell factor receptor (c-kit), showed similar effects, hinting that IL-3 transmodulates c-kit phosphorylation. These mechanisms may play an important role in acute myeloid leukaemia treatment, representing a novel therapeutic target.","['Maraldi, Tullia', 'Prata, Cecilia', 'Vieceli Dalla Sega, Francesco', 'Caliceti, Cristiana', 'Zambonin, Laura', 'Fiorentini, Diana', 'Hakim, Gabriele']","['Maraldi T', 'Prata C', 'Vieceli Dalla Sega F', 'Caliceti C', 'Zambonin L', 'Fiorentini D', 'Hakim G']","['Department of Anatomy and Histology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Free Radic Res,Free radical research,9423872,"['0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (CYBB protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidase 2', 'NADPH Oxidases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2009/08/27 09:00,2010/10/26 06:00,['2009/08/27 09:00'],"['2009/08/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['914185888 [pii]', '10.1080/10715760903186132 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Res. 2009;43(11):1111-21. doi: 10.1080/10715760903186132.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether the sulfur-containing molecules thiosulfinates (TS), diallyl TS (All(2)TS), dipropyl TS (Pr(2)TS) and dimethyl TS (Me(2)TS), are able to exert chemopreventative activity against AML is presently unknown. The present study was an evaluation of proliferation, cytotoxicity, differentiation and secretion of AML cell lines (U937, NB4, HL-60, MonoMac-6) in response to treatment with these TS and their related sulfides (diallylsulfide, diallyl disulfide, dipropyl disulfide, dimethyl disulfide). As assessed by flow cytometry, ELISA, gelatin zymogaphy and RT-PCR, we showed that Pr(2)TS and Me(2)TS, but not All(2)TS and sulfides, 1) inhibited cell proliferation in dose- and time-dependent manner and this process was neither due to cytotoxicity nor apoptosis, 2) induced macrophage maturation, and 3) inhibited the levels of secreted MMP-9 (protein and activity) and TNF-alpha protein, without altering mRNA levels. By establishing for the first time that Pr(2)TS and Me(2)TS affect proliferation, differentiation and secretion of leukemic cell lines, this study provides the opportunity to explore the potential efficiency of these molecules in AML.","['Merhi, Faten', 'Auger, Jacques', 'Rendu, Francine', 'Bauvois, Brigitte']","['Merhi F', 'Auger J', 'Rendu F', 'Bauvois B']","['UMR 7131 UPMC Paris Universitas/ CNRS, Groupe Hospitalier Broussais-HEGP, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,Biologics,Biologics : targets & therapy,101321511,,,,2009/08/27 09:00,2009/08/27 09:01,['2009/08/27 09:00'],"['2009/08/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/27 09:01 [medline]']",['10.2147/btt.s3212 [doi]'],ppublish,Biologics. 2008 Dec;2(4):885-95. doi: 10.2147/btt.s3212.,PMC2727902,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'differentiation', 'matrix metalloproteinase-9', 'proliferation', 'thiosulfinate']",,,,,,

Apoptosis, lymphocyte proliferation and T-cell cytokine production were determined using multiparameter flow cytometry. At concentrations of garlic compounds that did not result in significant increases in Annexin V and 7-AAD staining of normal lymphocytes, there was a significant increase in apoptosis of ALL cells with no alteration of T-cell proliferation as determined by CD25/CD69 upregulation or interferongamma, interleukin-2 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha intracellular cytokine production.

Rasburicase (recombinant urate oxidase) has been shown to be effective in reducing uric acid and preventing uric acid accumulation in patients with hematologic malignancies with hyperuricemia or at high risk of developing it. Rasburicase acts at the end of the purine catabolic pathway and, unlike allopurinol, does not induce accumulation of xanthine or hypoxanthine. Its rapid onset of action and the ability to lower pre-existing elevated uric acid levels are the advantages of rasburicase over allopurinol. Rasburicase represents an effective alternative to allopurinol to promptly reduce uric acid levels, improve patient's electrolyte status, and reverse renal insufficiency. The drug, initially studied in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, seems to show comparable benefit in adults with similar lymphoid malignancies or at high risk of tumor lysis syndrome.

However, imatinib resistance or intolerance occurs in a substantial number of patients. Additionally, patients who have progressed beyond the chronic phase of CML do relatively poorly with imatinib therapy. Mechanisms of imatinib resistance include BCR-ABL point mutations resulting in decreased imatinib binding, as well as mutation-independent causes of resistance such as SRC family kinase dysregulation, BCR-ABL gene amplification, drug influx/efflux mechanisms and other poorly understood processes. The options for therapy in these patients include stem cell transplantation, imatinib dose escalation as well as the use of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Dasatinib is a second-generation multi-kinase inhibitor with several theoretical and mechanistic advantages over imatinib. Moreover, several studies have evaluated dasatinib in patients who have progressed on imatinib therapy with encouraging results. Other novel agents such as mTOR inhibitors, bosutinib and INNO 406 have also shown promise in this setting. Although treatment options have increased, the choice of second-line therapy in patients with CML is influenced by concerns surrounding the duration of response as well as toxicity.

Tipifarnib is an orally bioavailable, nonpeptidomimetic methylquinolone FTI that has exhibited clinical activity in patients with myeloid malignancies including elderly adults with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who are not candidates for traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, patients with high-risk myelodysplasia, myeloproliferative disorders, and imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia. Because of its relatively low toxicity profile, tipifarnib provides an important alternative to traditional cytotoxic approaches for elderly patients who are not likely to tolerate or even benefit from aggressive chemotherapy. In this review, we will focus on the clinical development of tipifarnib for treatment of newly diagnosed AML, both as induction therapy for elderly adults with poor-risk AML and as maintenance therapy following achievement of first complete remission following induction and consolidation therapies for poor-risk AML. As with all other malignancies, the optimal approach is likely to lie in rational combinations of tipifarnib with cytotoxic, biologic and/or immunomodulatory agents with non-cross-resistant mechanisms of action. Gene expression profiling has identified networks of differentially expressed genes and gene combinations capable of predicting response to single agent tipifarnib. The clinical and correlative laboratory trials in progress and under development will provide the critical foundations for defining the optimal roles of tipifarnib and in patients with AMl and other hematologic malignancies.","['Karp, Judith E', 'Lancet, Jeffrey E']","['Karp JE', 'Lancet JE']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, Maryland, USA;']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,Biologics,Biologics : targets & therapy,101321511,,,,2009/08/27 09:00,2009/08/27 09:01,['2009/08/27 09:00'],"['2009/08/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/27 09:01 [medline]']",['10.2147/btt.s3485 [doi]'],ppublish,Biologics. 2008 Sep;2(3):491-500. doi: 10.2147/btt.s3485.,PMC2721391,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)', 'farnesylation', 'farnesyltransferase inhibitor', 'gene expression', 'signal transduction', 'tipifarnib']",,,,,,

Increasing evidence suggests that autophagy also functions as a tumor suppressor mechanism that harnesses the growth and/or survival of cells as they transition towards a rapidly dividing malignant state. However, the impact of autophagy on cancer progression and on the efficacy of cancer therapeutics is controversial. In particular, although the induction of autophagy has been reported after treatment with a number of therapeutic agents, including imatinib, this response has variously been suggested to either impair or contribute to the effects of anticancer agents. More recent studies support the notion that autophagy compromises the efficacy of anticancer agents, where agents such as chloroquine (CQ) that impair autophagy augment the anticancer activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and alkylating agents. Inhibition of autophagy is a particularly attractive strategy for the treatment of imatinib-refractory chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) since a combination of CQ with the HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) compromises the survival of even BCR-ABL-T315I+ imatinib-resistant CML. Additional studies are clearly needed to establish the clinical utility of autophagy inhibitors and to identify patients most likely to benefit from this novel therapeutic approach.","['Carew, Jennifer S', 'Nawrocki, Steffan T', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Cleveland, John L']","['Carew JS', 'Nawrocki ST', 'Giles FJ', 'Cleveland JL']","['The CTRC Institute for Drug Development, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA076379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,Biologics,Biologics : targets & therapy,101321511,,,,2008/06/01 00:00,2008/06/01 00:01,['2009/08/27 09:00'],"['2009/08/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.2147/btt.s1840 [doi]'],ppublish,Biologics. 2008 Jun;2(2):201-4. doi: 10.2147/btt.s1840.,PMC2721364,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['autophagy', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'imatinib', 'resistance']",,,,,,

The MPDs (which include polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and systemic mast cell disease (SMCD)) exclude chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) because of the pathognomic importance of the BCR-ABL translocation for the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder with imatinib mesylate. Empiric use of imatinib mesylate against the spectrum of BCR-ABL negative MPDs has had mixed results. Significant benefits were obtained when empiric use of imatinib in CEL and CMML led to significant clinical benefit and the discovery of the role of rearrangements of the platelet derived growth factor receptor -alpha (PDGFRa-FIP1L1 in CEL and SMCD) and -beta (PDGFRb through TEL-PDGFRb) for CMML). Empiric use of imatinib in PMF has been disappointing, and in PV quite modest. Although next generation Abelson kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib or nilotinib may expand the role for these agents in MPDs, targeted inhibition of the mutant kinase JAK2(V617F) is more likely to make significant therapeutic gains in the classic MPDs of PV, ET, and PMF.","['Mesa, Ruben A']",['Mesa RA'],"['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,Biologics,Biologics : targets & therapy,101321511,,,,2007/06/01 00:00,2007/06/01 00:01,['2009/08/27 09:00'],"['2009/08/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2007/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Biologics. 2007 Jun;1(2):129-38.,PMC2721304,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['essential thrombocythemia', 'myelofibrosis', 'myeloproliferative diseases', 'polycythemia vera', 'therapy']",,,,,,

Crystal structure analysis of the Abl-imatinib complex has proven helpful in identifying potential critical residues that hinder interactions of imatinib with mutated Abl. This has led to the development of a second generation of targeted therapies such as nilotinib and dasatinib, already in phase II clinical trials or SKI-606 and MK-0457 in phase I trials.

During the past 10 years, the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (STI571) has successfully been introduced in the treatment of the disease. However, intrinsic as well as acquired resistance against the drug have been described and have been recognized as an emerging problem and challenge in clinical practice, and a key issue in CML research. Most of the respective concepts focus on imatinib-resistant mutants of BCR/ABL that are detectable in a high proportion of cases. However, other factors also contribute to resistance against imatinib, including the genetic background, the biologic features of CML stem cells, gene amplifications, silencing of tumor suppressor genes, and various pharmacologic aspects. In this article, the mechanisms of resistance against imatinib and other BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors in CML are discussed together with strategies to overcome and to prevent resistance with available drugs or with novel antileukemic approaches.","['Valent, Peter']",['Valent P'],"['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,Biologics,Biologics : targets & therapy,101321511,,,,2007/12/01 00:00,2007/12/01 00:01,['2009/08/27 09:00'],"['2009/08/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2007/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Biologics. 2007 Dec;1(4):433-48.,PMC2721289,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR/ABL mutations', 'CML', 'drug-resistance', 'imatinib', 'stem cells']",,,,,,

We assessed whether breastfeeding and early infection were associated with the risk of developing AL in children with DS. METHODS: Children with DS in Mexico City, and either with or without AL, were the cases (N=57) and controls (N=218), respectively. Population was divided in children with AL and with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and also in children < or = 6 and >6 years old. RESULTS: Breastfeeding and early infections showed moderate (but not significant) association for AL, whereas hospitalisation by infection during the first year of life increased the risk: odds ratios (confidence interval 95%) were 0.84 (0.43-1.61), 1.70 (0.82-3.52); and 3.57 (1.59-8.05), respectively. A similar result was obtained when only ALL was analysed. CONCLUSION: We found that breastfeeding was a protective factor for developing AL and ALL, and during the first year of life, infections requiring hospitalisation were related to a risk for developing the disease in those children with DS >6 years of age. These data do not support the Greaves's hypothesis of early infection being protective for developing ALL.","['Flores-Lujano, J', 'Perez-Saldivar, M L', 'Fuentes-Panana, E M', 'Gorodezky, C', 'Bernaldez-Rios, R', 'Del Campo-Martinez, M A', 'Martinez-Avalos, A', 'Medina-Sanson, A', 'Paredes-Aguilera, R', 'De Diego-Flores Chapa, J', 'Bolea-Murga, V', 'Rodriguez-Zepeda, M C', 'Rivera-Luna, R', 'Palomo-Colli, M A', 'Romero-Guzman, L', 'Perez-Vera, P', 'Alvarado-Ibarra, M', 'Salamanca-Gomez, F', 'Fajardo-Gutierrez, A', 'Mejia-Arangure, J M']","['Flores-Lujano J', 'Perez-Saldivar ML', 'Fuentes-Panana EM', 'Gorodezky C', 'Bernaldez-Rios R', 'Del Campo-Martinez MA', 'Martinez-Avalos A', 'Medina-Sanson A', 'Paredes-Aguilera R', 'De Diego-Flores Chapa J', 'Bolea-Murga V', 'Rodriguez-Zepeda MC', 'Rivera-Luna R', 'Palomo-Colli MA', 'Romero-Guzman L', 'Perez-Vera P', 'Alvarado-Ibarra M', 'Salamanca-Gomez F', 'Fajardo-Gutierrez A', 'Mejia-Arangure JM']","['Unidad de Investigacion en Epidemiologia Clinica, Hospital de Pediatria, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI (IMSS), Quetzal 27, Las Arboledas, 52950 Mexico DF, Mexico.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Breast Feeding/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infections/*complications/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Regression Analysis', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2009/08/27 09:00,2009/09/19 06:00,['2009/08/27 09:00'],"['2009/08/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['6605244 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6605244 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2009 Sep 1;101(5):860-4. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605244.,PMC2736848,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We conducted a population-based study in Italy to identify deceased persons with CKS and the underlying causes of death among them, by reviewing multiple-causes-of-death records. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to compare the distribution of causes to that among the same-age general population of deceased persons. The geographical distribution was also evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 946 deaths among persons with CKS, 65.9% were attributable to non-neoplastic conditions and 21.9% to malignancies. For 12.2%, no lethal pathology was identified and CKS was considered as the underlying cause. In 90% of these cases, there was visceral/nodal involvement, therapy-related complications, or neoplastic cachexia. Among persons with CKS who died of other causes, an excess for lymphoid malignancies emerged (SMR=4.40) (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (11.03), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (4.22), Hodgkin's lymphoma (11.80), and multiple myeloma (2.3)), balanced by a deficit for all solid cancers (0.56), with a marked deficit for lung cancer (0.41). We found an excess for respiratory diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.86)) and genitourinary diseases (chronic renal failure (6.47)). There was marked geographical heterogeneity in the distribution of deaths.

Empirically validated interventions to address such disease and treatment related psychosocial morbidities are needed. PROCEDURE: We conducted a pilot study to evaluate participants' acceptance and impact of a 15-session, clinic-based training program to teach compensatory learning and problem-solving skills in survivors with cognitive deficits. The intervention program consisted of 5 core components designed to improve daily problem solving, attention and memory, and academic performance. RESULTS: A sample of 12 survivors completed the program. Virtually all objective performance scores showed gains from preintervention to postintervention in the expected positive direction, although only 2 of the gains were statistically significant. Parent responses indicated they perceived the skills taught to be useful, to have improved the child's problem-solving ability and learning skills, to have provided concrete and practical interventions for the home, and to have increased parental knowledge. Similarly, the children rated the overall program high, and reported satisfaction with learning more about their relative cognitive strengths and weaknesses and practical problem solving for academic difficulties. CONCLUSIONS: Although the majority of enrolled families completed at least 70% of the training sessions, the overall low participation rate from eligible families raise concern about widespread acceptance of such programs in the oncology clinic.

Donor-derived T cells, however, may not only induce GVL, but also mediate detrimental graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Because HLA-class II is under noninflammatory conditions predominantly expressed on hematopoietic cells, CD4+ T cells administered late after alloSCT may selectively confer GVL without GVHD. Although a broad range of different HLA-class I-restricted mHags have been identified, the first 2 autosomal HLA-class II-restricted mHags have only recently been characterized. By screening a recombinant bacteria cDNA expression library, we identified 4 new HLA-class II-restricted mHags recognized by CD4+ T cells induced in a patient with relapsed chronic myeloid leukemia who achieved long-term complete remission and experienced only mild GVHD of the skin after DLI. All CD4+ T cells were capable of recognizing the mHags presented by HLA-DR surface molecules on primary hematopoietic cells, but not on skin-derived (cytokine-treated) fibroblasts.

This analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with leukemia relapse following myeloablative UCB transplantation.

Patients received a UCB graft composed of either 1 (47%) or 2 (53%) partially human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched unit(s). Conditioning was with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation with or without fludarabine. The incidence of relapse was 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19%-33%). In multivariate analysis, relapse was higher in advanced disease patients (> or = third complete remission [CR3]; relative risk [RR], 3.6; P < .01), with a trend toward less relapse in recipients of 2 UCB units (RR = 0.6; P = .07). However, relapse was lower for CR1-2 patients who received 2 UCB units (RR 0.5; P < .03). Leukemia-free survival was 40% (95% CI, 30%-51%) and 51% (95% CI, 41%-62%) for single- and double-unit recipients, respectively (P = .35).

Surprisingly, the second-generation Bcr-Abl inhibitor, dasatinib, was reported to be clinically effective with once-daily dosing, despite a short (3- to 5-hour) plasma half-life. Consistent with this observation, dasatinib treatment of progenitor cells from chronic-phase CML patients for 4 hours, followed by washout, or continuously for 72 hours both resulted in an induction of apoptosis and a reduction in the number of clonogenic cells. Such acute treatments with clinically achievable dasatinib concentrations also irreversibly committed Bcr-Abl+ CML cell lines to apoptotic cell death. Potent transient Bcr-Abl inhibition using the alternative inhibitor, nilotinib, also resulted in cell death. These findings demonstrate that in vitro assays designed to model in vivo pharmacokinetics can predict clinical efficacy.

Various mechanisms have been identified how CEBPA function is dysregulated in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In particular, dominant-negative mutations located either at the N- or the C terminus of the CEBPA gene are observed in roughly 10% of AML patients, either in the combination on separate alleles or as sole mutation. Clinically significant complexity exists among AML with CEBPA mutations, and patients with double CEBPA mutations seem to have a more favorable course of the disease than patients with a single mutation. In addition, myeloid precursor cells of healthy carriers with a single germ-line CEBPA mutation evolve to overt AML by acquiring a second sporadic CEBPA mutation. This review summarizes recent reports on dysregulation of CEBPA function at various levels in human AML and therapeutic concepts targeting correction of CEBPA activity. The currently available data are persuasive evidence that impaired CEBPA function contributes directly to the development of AML, whereas restoring CEBPA function represents a promising target for novel therapeutic strategies in AML.","['Pabst, Thomas', 'Mueller, Beatrice U']","['Pabst T', 'Mueller BU']","['Department of Oncology, University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland. thomas.pabst@insel.ch']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090825,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/therapeutic use', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics']",2009/08/27 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/27 09:00'],"['2009/08/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-2941 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2941 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Sep 1;15(17):5303-7. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2941.

In MRL/MpJ-Fas(lpr) (MRL-lpr) mice, Bz-423 overcomes deficient expression of the Fas death receptor and hyperactivation of antiapoptotic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling to specifically kill pathogenic CD4(+) T cells. Bz-423 binds to the oligomycin-sensitivity-conferring protein component of the mitochondrial F(0)F(1)-ATPase, which modulates the enzyme leading to formation of superoxide by the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Scavenging this reactive oxygen species blocks all subsequent components of the apoptotic cascade. To gain insight into how apoptotic signaling activated by Bz-423-induced superoxide contributes to the selective depletion of MRL-lpr CD4(+) T cells, we characterized the death mechanism in a CD4(+) T cell leukemia line (Jurkat). Although Bz-423-induced superoxide indirectly inactivates Akt, this response is not required for T cell death. Apoptosis instead results from parallel increases in levels of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Noxa and Bak leading to specific activation of Bak, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, and a commitment to apoptosis. By directly up-regulating proteins that trigger loss of mitochondrial outer membrane integrity, Bz-423 bypasses defective Fas function and antiapoptotic PI3K-Akt signaling in MRL-lpr CD4(+) T cells. Moreover, because disease-associated abnormalities should sensitize autoreactive CD4(+) T cells to transcriptional up-regulation of Noxa by redox signals and to Bak-dependent apoptosis, the apoptotic mechanism elucidated in Jurkat cells provides important clues into the cell-type- and disease-selective effects of Bz-423 in MRL-lpr mice.","['Sundberg, Thomas B', 'Swenson, Lara', 'Wahl, Daniel R', 'Opipari, Anthony W Jr', 'Glick, Gary D']","['Sundberg TB', 'Swenson L', 'Wahl DR', 'Opipari AW Jr', 'Glick GD']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI047450/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI047450/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI47450/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA10456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090825,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '12794-10-4 (Benzodiazepines)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 3.6.3.14 (Proton-Translocating ATPases)', 'M4Z88L5FCM (Bz-423)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Autoimmunity/*immunology', 'Benzodiazepines/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/genetics', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/genetics', 'Proton-Translocating ATPases/*physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism']",2009/08/27 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/27 09:00'],"['2009/08/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['jpet.109.156422 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.109.156422 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2009 Nov;331(2):437-44. doi: 10.1124/jpet.109.156422.

However, most patients develop secondary resistance, which is associated with a dismal prognosis. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI) have been shown to enhance imatinib activity in imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia. Against this background, we explored whether HDACI might provide an alternative therapeutic strategy to KIT/PDGFRA kinase inhibitors in GIST. Inhibition of cell proliferation by HDACI was seen in KIT-positive but not in KIT-negative GIST cell lines, suggesting that HDACI activity is mainly conferred by targeting oncogenic KIT. KIT activity, expression, and activation of downstream pathways were strongly inhibited by several HDACI (SAHA, LBH589, VPA, trichostatin A, and NaButyrate). SAHA and LBH589 induced apoptosis in KIT-positive GIST, and strong synergism with imatinib was observed at low concentrations of SAHA and LBH589. Mechanistically, treatment with HDACI reduced KIT mRNA transcript levels and led to strong acetylation of HSP90, interfering with its activity as KIT chaperone. These results provide preclinical evidence for a disease-specific effect of HDACI in KIT-positive GIST, which could translate into therapeutic activity.","['Muhlenberg, Thomas', 'Zhang, Yixiang', 'Wagner, Andrew J', 'Grabellus, Florian', 'Bradner, James', 'Taeger, Georg', 'Lang, Hauke', 'Taguchi, Takahiro', 'Schuler, Martin', 'Fletcher, Jonathan A', 'Bauer, Sebastian']","['Muhlenberg T', 'Zhang Y', 'Wagner AJ', 'Grabellus F', 'Bradner J', 'Taeger G', 'Lang H', 'Taguchi T', 'Schuler M', 'Fletcher JA', 'Bauer S']","['Sarcoma Center, West German Cancer Center, University of Essen, Medical School, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['P50 CA127003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA127003-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090825,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Vorinostat']",2009/08/27 09:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/08/27 09:00'],"['2009/08/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-4004 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Sep 1;69(17):6941-50. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4004.

The Ser(88)-Arg-Ser-Arg-Tyr(92) is the minimum chemotactic sequence of uPAR required to induce the same intracellular signaling as its ligand uPA. Here, we describe the generation of new peptide inhibitors of cell migration and invasion derived from SRSRY by a drug design approach. Ac-Arg-Glu-Arg-Phe-NH(2) (i.e., RERF), which adopts a turned structure in solution, was selected for its ability to potently prevent SRSRY-directed cell migration. Fluorescein-RERF associates with very high affinity to RBL-2H3 rat basophilic leukemia cells expressing the human formyl peptide receptor (FPR). Accordingly, femtomolar concentrations of RERF prevent agonist-dependent internalization of FPR and inhibit N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-dependent migration in a dose-dependent manner. In the absence of FPR, fluorescein-RERF binds to cell surface at picomolar concentrations in an alphav integrin-dependent manner. The involvement of vitronectin receptor is further supported by the findings that 100 pmol/L RERF selectively inhibits vitronectin-dependent RBL-2H3 cell migration and prevents SRSRY-triggered uPAR/alphav association. Furthermore, RERF reduces the speed of wound closure and the extent of Matrigel invasion by human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells without affecting cell proliferation. Finally, a 3- to 5-fold reduction of lung metastasis number and size in nude mice following i.v. injection of green fluorescent protein-expressing HT1080 cells in the presence of 3.32 mg/kg RERF is observed. Our findings indicate that RERF effectively prevents malignant cell invasion in vivo with no signs of toxicity and may represent a promising prototype drug for anticancer therapy.","['Carriero, Maria Vincenza', 'Longanesi-Cattani, Immacolata', 'Bifulco, Katia', 'Maglio, Ornella', 'Lista, Liliana', 'Barbieri, Antonio', 'Votta, Giuseppina', 'Masucci, Maria Teresa', 'Arra, Claudio', 'Franco, Renato', 'De Rosa, Mario', 'Stoppelli, Maria Patrizia', 'Pavone, Vincenzo']","['Carriero MV', 'Longanesi-Cattani I', 'Bifulco K', 'Maglio O', 'Lista L', 'Barbieri A', 'Votta G', 'Masucci MT', 'Arra C', 'Franco R', 'De Rosa M', 'Stoppelli MP', 'Pavone V']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, National Cancer Institute of Naples, Via M.

In this study, a histone H2A full-length cDNA was cloned from disk abalone Haliotis discus discus. We identified a 40-amino acid AMP designated as abhisin from the N-terminus of the abalone histone H2A sequence. Abhisin shows the characteristic features of AMPs including net positive charge (+13), higher hydrophobic residues (27%) and 2.82 kcal/mol protein binding potential. Abhisin shares 80% amino acid identity with the buforin I peptide that is derived from Asian toad histone H2A. We synthesized the synthetic peptide of abhisin, and characterized its antimicrobial activities. Our results showed the growth inhibition of Gram positive (G+) Listeria monocytogenes, Gram negative (G-) Vibrio ichthyoenteri bacteria, and fungi (yeast) Pityrosporum ovale by abhisin treatment at 250 microg/mL. However, stronger activity was displayed against the G+ than G- bacteria. Additionally, scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation results confirmed that P. ovale cells were damaged by abhisin treatment. Interestingly, abhisin treatment (50 microg/mL) decreased the viability of THP-1 leukemia cancer cells approximately by 25% but there was no effect on the normal vero cells, suggesting that abhisin has cytotoxicity against cancer cells but not normal cells. Quantitative real time RT-PCR results revealed that histone H2A transcription was significantly induced at 3 h post-infection with bacteria in abalone gills and digestive tract. These results suggest that abhisin is a potential antimicrobial agent, and its precursor histone H2A may be involved in the innate immune defense system in abalone.","['De Zoysa, Mahanama', 'Nikapitiya, Chamilani', 'Whang, Ilson', 'Lee, Jae-Seong', 'Lee, Jehee']","['De Zoysa M', 'Nikapitiya C', 'Whang I', 'Lee JS', 'Lee J']","['Department of Marine Life Science, College of Ocean Science, Jeju National University, Jeju Special Self-Governing Province 690-756, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090823,England,Fish Shellfish Immunol,Fish & shellfish immunology,9505220,"['0 (Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Histones)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides/chemical synthesis/genetics/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Gene Library', 'Histones/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mollusca/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/08/27 09:00,2010/01/01 06:00,['2009/08/27 09:00'],"['2009/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/09 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S1050-4648(09)00268-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.fsi.2009.08.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2009 Nov;27(5):639-46. doi: 10.1016/j.fsi.2009.08.007.

Period analysis was used to obtain up-to-date information on survival expectations of adolescents and young adults diagnosed with hematologic malignancies through the early 21st century. METHODS: : Period analysis was used to calculate 5- and 10-year relative survival for adolescents and young adults diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), and chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) for 5 5-year periods from 1981-1985 to 2001-2005, using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. RESULTS: : Survival strongly improved for each of the 5 hematologic malignancies. Increases in 10-year relative survival between 1981-1985 and 2001-2005 were as follows: HL, from 80.4% to 93.4%; NHL, from 55.6% to 76.2%; ALL, from 30.5% to 52.1%; AML, from 15.2% to 45.1%; CML, from 0 to 74.5% (P < .001 in all cases). However, although survival improved steadily throughout the period examined for the lymphomas and CML, survival was stable during the late 1990s and early 21st century for the acute leukemias. CONCLUSIONS: : Survival expectations for adolescents and young adults with hematologic malignancies have strongly improved since the 1980s. However, with the exception of HL, survival rates have not reached the levels observed for children diagnosed with these malignancies, and survival expectations for patients with acute leukemia have stabilized at relatively low levels.

There was also a trend for a shorter overall survival in the high tumor burden group, 58 months compared to 75 months (P = 0.098). Massive splenomegaly was related to a shorter therapy-free as well as overall survival.

A 25-year-old female developed ATLL and underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in non-remission. She had chronic refractory eczema and corneal injury at the onset of ATLL. Remission of ATLL was achieved, and the HTLV-1 proviral load decreased after HSCT. In addition, her pre-existing eczema and corneal injuries almost disappeared.

However, stem cell damage can also play a role in the disease with the formation of solid tumors and leukaemias such as chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) disorder. Despite recent medical advances, CML remains incurable by drug therapy. Understanding the mechanisms which govern chemoresistance of individual stem cell leukaemias may therefore require analysis at the single cell level. This task is not trivial using current technologies given that isolating HSCs is difficult, expensive, and inefficient due to low cell yield from patients. In addition, hematopoietic cells are largely non-adherent and thus difficult to study over time using conventional cell culture techniques. Hence, there is a need for new microfluidic platforms that allow the functional interrogation of hundreds of non-adherent single cells in parallel. We demonstrate the ability to perform assays, normally performed on the macroscopic scale, within the microfluidic platform using minimal reagents and low numbers of primary cells. We investigated normal and CML stem cell responses to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, dasatinib, a drug approved for the treatment of CML. Dynamic, on-chip three-color cell viability assays revealed that differences in the responses of normal and CML stem/progenitor cells to dasatinib were observed even in the early phases of exposure, during which time normal cells exhibit a significantly elevated cell death rate, as compared to both controls and CML cells. Further studies show that dasatinib does, however, markedly reduce CML stem/progenitor cell migration in situ.","['Faley, Shannon L', 'Copland, Mhairi', 'Wlodkowic, Donald', 'Kolch, Walter', 'Seale, Kevin T', 'Wikswo, John P', 'Cooper, Jonathan M']","['Faley SL', 'Copland M', 'Wlodkowic D', 'Kolch W', 'Seale KT', 'Wikswo JP', 'Cooper JM']","['Bioelectronics Research Centre, University of Glasgow, Oakfield Avenue, Glasgow, UK G12 8LT. sfaley@elec.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['BB/C511572/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'G84/6317/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'SCD/04/CSO_/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090612,England,Lab Chip,Lab on a chip,101128948,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dasatinib', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Microfluidics/*methods', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2009/08/26 09:00,2009/10/17 06:00,['2009/08/26 09:00'],"['2009/08/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/b902083g [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Chip. 2009 Sep 21;9(18):2659-64. doi: 10.1039/b902083g.

The previous analysis with 5 years median follow-up had indicated improved tumor control with BEACOPP escalated. Since the long-term safety and efficacy of this regimen has been debated, we report the 10-year follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received one of three chemotherapy regimens: eight cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (COPP) alternating with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD); eight cycles of BEACOPP baseline; or eight cycles of BEACOPP escalated. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 111 months. At 10 years, freedom from treatment failure (FFTF) was 64%, 70%, and 82% with OS rates of 75%, 80%, and 86% for patients treated with COPP/ABVD (arm A), BEACOPP baseline (arm B), and BEACOPP escalated (arm C), respectively (P < .001). BEACOPP escalated was significantly better than BEACOPP baseline in terms of FFTF (P < .0001) and OS (P = .0053). A total of 74 second malignancies (6.2%) were documented, including acute myeloid leukemia (0.4%, 1.5%, and 3.0%), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (2.7%, 1.7%, and 1.0%), and solid tumors (2.7%, 3.4%, and 1.9%). The corresponding overall secondary malignancy rates were 5.7%, 6.6%, and 6.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The 10-year follow-up of the HD9 trial demonstrates a stabilized significant improvement in long-term FFTF and OS for BEACOPP escalated in advanced-stage HL. These results challenge ABVD as standard of care for this patient population.","['Engert, Andreas', 'Diehl, Volker', 'Franklin, Jeremy', 'Lohri, Andreas', 'Dorken, Bernd', 'Ludwig, Wolf-Dieter', 'Koch, Peter', 'Hanel, Mathias', 'Pfreundschuh, Michael', 'Wilhelm, Martin', 'Trumper, Lorenz', 'Aulitzky, Walter-Erich', 'Bentz, Martin', 'Rummel, Mathias', 'Sezer, Orhan', 'Muller-Hermelink, Hans-Konrad', 'Hasenclever, Dirk', 'Loffler, Markus']","['Engert A', 'Diehl V', 'Franklin J', 'Lohri A', 'Dorken B', 'Ludwig WD', 'Koch P', 'Hanel M', 'Pfreundschuh M', 'Wilhelm M', 'Trumper L', 'Aulitzky WE', 'Bentz M', 'Rummel M', 'Sezer O', 'Muller-Hermelink HK', 'Hasenclever D', 'Loffler M']","['Klinik I fur Innere Medizin, Universitatsklinik Koln, Kerpener Strasse 62, 50931 Koln, Germany. a.engert@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20090824,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ABVD protocol', 'BEACOPP protocol', 'COPP protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2009/08/26 09:00,2009/11/05 06:00,['2009/08/26 09:00'],"['2009/08/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.19.8820 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.19.8820 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Sep 20;27(27):4548-54. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.19.8820.

Based on excellent results with the chemotherapy-only regimen fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and mitoxantrone (FCM), we built a new chemoimmunotherapy combination--rituximab plus FCM (R-FCM). We report a phase II clinical trial consisting of an initial treatment with R-FCM followed by rituximab maintenance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-two untreated CLL patients age 70 years or younger received rituximab 500 mg/m(2) on day 1 (375 mg/m(2) the first cycle), fludarabine 25 mg/m(2) IV on days 1 to 3, cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 3, and mitoxantrone 6 mg/m(2) IV on day 1, given at 4-week intervals with up to six cycles supported with colony-stimulating factor. Patients achieving response received maintenance with rituximab 375 mg/m(2) every 3 months for 2 years. RESULTS: The overall response, minimal residual disease (MRD) -negative complete response (CR), MRD-positive CR, and partial response rates were 93%, 46%, 36%, and 11%, respectively. Severe neutropenia developed in 13% of patients. Major and minor infections were reported in 8% and 5% of cycles, respectively. Advanced clinical stage, del(17p), or increased serum beta2-microglobulin levels correlated with a lower CR rate. CONCLUSION: R-FCM is highly effective in previously untreated CLL, with an 82% CR rate and a high proportion of MRD-negative CRs (46%). Treatment toxicity is acceptable. Parameters correlating with a lower response rate were advanced clinical stage, high serum beta2-microglobulin levels, and del(17p).

In the heritable form, there is a predisposition to the development of non-ocular tumours. OBJECTIVES: To identify the types of non-ocular tumour occurring in retinoblastoma survivors and to produce estimates of risk for these tumours. METHODS: We carried out a cohort study that included 1927 cases of retinoblastoma diagnosed in Great Britain between 1951 and 2004. Cases were ascertained through the National Registry of Childhood Tumours and followed up for the occurrence of non-ocular tumours using the routine notification system based on the National Health Service Central Registers in Britain. RESULTS: Of the 1927 cases, 809 were known to have the heritable form of the disease and 1118 assumed to have the non-heritable form. 102 of the heritable and 13 of those classified as non-heritable developed a non-ocular tumour. The cumulative risk of developing such a tumour 50 years after retinoblastoma diagnosis was 48.3% (95% confidence interval: 38.1 to 59.7%) in the heritable and 4.9% (1.9 to 12.4%) in the non-heritable cases. The main categories of non-ocular tumours observed in the heritable cases were soft-tissue sarcomas (36 of which 21 were leiomyosarcoma), osteosarcoma (32), carcinoma (13), brain and central nervous system tumours (10), melanoma (9), leukaemia (4) and others (4). There were a total of 108 non-ocular tumours in 102 cases. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high risk of non-ocular tumours occurring in survivors of heritable retinoblastoma. These results have important implications for the clinical follow-up and counselling of survivors.","['MacCarthy, A', 'Bayne, A M', 'Draper, G J', 'Eatock, E M', 'Kroll, M E', 'Stiller, C A', 'Vincent, T J', 'Hawkins, M M', 'Jenkinson, H C', 'Kingston, J E', 'Neale, R', 'Murphy, M F G']","['MacCarthy A', 'Bayne AM', 'Draper GJ', 'Eatock EM', 'Kroll ME', 'Stiller CA', 'Vincent TJ', 'Hawkins MM', 'Jenkinson HC', 'Kingston JE', 'Neale R', 'Murphy MF']","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, University of Oxford, 57 Woodstock Road, Oxford OX2 6HJ, UK. angela.maccarthy@ccrg.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Department of Health/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Ophthalmol,The British journal of ophthalmology,0421041,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Retinal Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Retinoblastoma/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction Behavior', 'Survivors/statistics & numerical data', 'Time Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2009/08/26 09:00,2009/09/16 06:00,['2009/08/26 09:00'],"['2009/08/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['93/9/1159 [pii]', '10.1136/bjo.2008.146035 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Ophthalmol. 2009 Sep;93(9):1159-62. doi: 10.1136/bjo.2008.146035.,,,,,['Br J Ophthalmol. 2009 Sep;93(9):1129-31.

The Notch receptor is locked down in a protease-resistant state by a negative regulatory region (NRR) that protects an ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) cleavage site. Engagement with ligand-bearing cells induces global conformational movements in Notch that unfold the NRR structure to expose the ADAM cleavage site and initiate proteolytic activation. Although both ADAM10 and ADAM17 have been reported to cleave Notch to facilitate NICD release by gamma-secretase, the relevant ADAM has remained controversial. Our study provides new insight into this conflict, as we find that although Notch1 (N1) is a substrate for both ADAM10 and ADAM17, the particular ADAM required for receptor activation is context dependent. Specifically, ADAM10 was absolutely required for N1 signaling induced by ligands, while signaling independent of ligands required ADAM17. In contrast to the strict and differential use of ADAM10 and ADAM17 in normal and dysregulated signaling, respectively, both proteases participated in signaling intrinsic to N1 mutations associated with leukemia. We propose that in addition to exposing the ADAM cleavage site, activating N1 conformational changes facilitate selective cleavage by specific proteases.","['Bozkulak, Esra Cagavi', 'Weinmaster, Gerry']","['Bozkulak EC', 'Weinmaster G']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 NS031885/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 NS031885/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS31885/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090824,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.81 (ADAM10 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.81 (Adam10 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.24.86 (ADAM17 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.86 (ADAM17 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.86 (Adam17 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['ADAM Proteins/*metabolism', 'ADAM10 Protein', 'ADAM17 Protein', 'Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/enzymology', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, Notch/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",2009/08/26 09:00,2009/11/17 06:00,['2009/08/26 09:00'],"['2009/08/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00406-09 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00406-09 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2009 Nov;29(21):5679-95. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00406-09.

Set1/COMPASS was the founding member and is the only H3K4 methylase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae; however, in mammals, at least six H3K4 methylases, Set1A and Set1B and MLL1 to MLL4, are found in COMPASS-like complexes capable of methylating H3K4. To gain further insight into the different roles and functional targets for the H3K4 methylases, we have undertaken a genome-wide analysis of H3K4 methylation patterns in wild-type Mll1(+/+) and Mll1(-)(/)(-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We found that Mll1 is required for the H3K4 trimethylation of less than 5% of promoters carrying this modification. Many of these genes, which include developmental regulators such as Hox genes, show decreased levels of RNA polymerase II recruitment and expression concomitant with the loss of H3K4 methylation. Although Mll1 is only required for the methylation of a subset of Hox genes, menin, a component of the Mll1 and Mll2 complexes, is required for the overwhelming majority of H3K4 methylation at Hox loci. However, the loss of MLL3/MLL4 and/or the Set1 complexes has little to no effect on the H3K4 methylation of Hox loci or their expression levels in these MEFs. Together these data provide insight into the redundancy and specialization of COMPASS-like complexes in mammals and provide evidence for a possible role for Mll1-mediated H3K4 methylation in the regulation of transcriptional initiation.","['Wang, Pengfei', 'Lin, Chengqi', 'Smith, Edwin R', 'Guo, Hong', 'Sanderson, Brian W', 'Wu, Min', 'Gogol, Madelaine', 'Alexander, Tara', 'Seidel, Christopher', 'Wiedemann, Leanne M', 'Ge, Kai', 'Krumlauf, Robb', 'Shilatifard, Ali']","['Wang P', 'Lin C', 'Smith ER', 'Guo H', 'Sanderson BW', 'Wu M', 'Gogol M', 'Alexander T', 'Seidel C', 'Wiedemann LM', 'Ge K', 'Krumlauf R', 'Shilatifard A']","['Stowers Institute for Medical Research, 1000 East 50th Street, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA.']",['eng'],"['ZIADK047055-03/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '5R01CA089455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA DK075003-08/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIADK075003-06/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 DK047055-01/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 DK075003-04/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 DK047055-02/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 DK075003-05/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z99 DK999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090824,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Intergenic)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Men1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (MLL3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'DNA, Intergenic/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Genome/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysine/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase II/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2009/08/26 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/26 09:00'],"['2009/08/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00924-09 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00924-09 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2009 Nov;29(22):6074-85. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00924-09.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, some children with DS who developed leukaemia received fewer cycles of chemotherapy or were advised not to have treatment. METHODS: In this population-based study, trends in 5-year survival from leukaemia were evaluated for children with and without DS who were diagnosed in Great Britain during 1971-2000 and followed to the end of 2004. RESULTS: For all children, with and without DS, survival has increased dramatically over the 30 year study period. For lymphoid leukaemia, survival in children with DS increased, but remains lower than for other children (5-year survival 59% vs 83% during 1996-2000). For acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL), however, 5-year survival improved substantially for children with DS, from less than 1% in the early 1970s to over 80% in the 1990s. For other children, survival increased from 6% to 64% during the same period. CONCLUSION: Survival for all children diagnosed with leukaemia has improved during the last three decades. For lymphoid leukaemia, the inferior outcome observed on more recent treatment protocols in children with DS remains an area for concern. For ANLL, the improvement in survival for children with DS is due to a number of factors, namely increased recruitment of these children to clinical trials, changes in clinical practice and important differences in the biology of myeloid leukaemia in young children with DS, resulting in a better response to some chemotherapeutic agents.","['Shah, Anjali', 'Stiller, Charles', 'Lancaster, Donna', 'Vincent, Tim', 'Coleman, Michel P']","['Shah A', 'Stiller C', 'Lancaster D', 'Vincent T', 'Coleman MP']","['Non-communicable Disease Epidemiology Unit, Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London WC1E 7HT, UK. anjali.shah@lshtm.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['11700/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090824,England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,,IM,"['Child', 'Down Syndrome/complications/*mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*mortality', 'Male', 'Population Surveillance', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2009/08/26 09:00,2012/06/14 06:00,['2009/08/26 09:00'],"['2009/08/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['jech.2008.086207 [pii]', '10.1136/jech.2008.086207 [doi]']",ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 2010 Jul;64(7):604-9. doi: 10.1136/jech.2008.086207.

METHODS: We describe the clinical presentation and relevant laboratory findings of 3 patients who presented with new-onset diabetes mellitus after bone marrow transplantation and discuss the possible mechanisms. RESULTS: A 52-year-old white man with chronic myelogenous leukemia, a 51-year-old white woman with acute myelogenous leukemia, and a 38-year-old Hispanic woman with acute myelogenous leukemia presented with acute onset of diabetes mellitus after bone marrow transplantation. Although blood glucose levels were initially very high, the patients required only small insulin dosages for glycemic control. Both the acute onset and requirement of relatively small insulin dosages were characteristic of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Onset of diabetes appeared to be unrelated to immunosuppressive drug therapy because it happened several months after starting these drugs. C-peptide was detectable, and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies were absent. Diabetes mellitus remitted spontaneously after a few months while the immunosuppressive drugs were continued. CONCLUSION: Although the underlying mechanisms are unknown, cytokine changes after bone marrow transplantation may have led to temporary beta-cell dysfunction in these patients.","['Tor, Ozlem', 'Garg, Rajesh K']","['Tor O', 'Garg RK']","[""Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Hypertension, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Endocr Pract,Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists,9607439,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Diabetes Mellitus/*etiology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2009/08/26 09:00,2010/04/29 06:00,['2009/08/26 09:00'],"['2009/08/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S1530-891X(20)40354-4 [pii]', '10.4158/EP09158.CR [doi]']",ppublish,Endocr Pract. 2010 Jan-Feb;16(1):93-6. doi: 10.4158/EP09158.CR.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the strategy is compromised by the general loss of multipotency and ability to generate neurons after long-term in vitro propagation. In the present study, human embryonic (5 weeks post-conception) ventral mesencephalic (VM) precursor cells were propagated as neural tissue-spheres (NTS) in epidermal growth factor (EGF; 20 ng/ml) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2; 20 ng/ml). After more than 325 days, the NTS were transferred to media containing either EGF+FGF2, EGF+FGF2+heparin or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; 10 ng/ml)+FGF2+heparin. Cultures were subsequently propagated for more than 180 days with NTS analyzed at various time-points. Our data show for the first time that human VM neural precursor cells can be long-term propagated as NTS in the presence of EGF and FGF2. A positive effect of heparin was found only after 150 days of treatment. After switching into different media, only NTS exposed to LIF contained numerous cells positive for markers of newly formed neurons. Besides of demonstrating the ability of human VM NTS to be long-term propagated, our study also suggests that LIF favours neurogenic differentiation of human VM precursor cells.","['Andersen, Rikke K', 'Widmer, Hans R', 'Zimmer, Jens', 'Wahlberg, Lars U', 'Meyer, Morten']","['Andersen RK', 'Widmer HR', 'Zimmer J', 'Wahlberg LU', 'Meyer M']","['Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Institute of Medical Biology, University of Southern Denmark, Winslowparken 21, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090822,Ireland,Neurosci Lett,Neuroscience letters,7600130,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Heparin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Mesencephalon/*cytology', 'Neurons/*cytology/drug effects', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Time Factors']",2009/08/26 09:00,2009/11/10 06:00,['2009/08/26 09:00'],"['2009/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3940(09)01140-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neulet.2009.08.050 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurosci Lett. 2009 Oct 30;464(3):203-8. doi: 10.1016/j.neulet.2009.08.050.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pim-1 expression was investigated in a series of human leukemia cell lines with immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. The inhibitory effect of P9 on cell proliferation was evaluated with (3)H-thymidine incorporation assay. Cell apoptosis was assayed with Annexin-V/propidium iodide dual staining. The in vivo effect of P9 was evaluated with xenograft tumor models in severe combined immunodeficient mice. RESULTS: Pim-1 expression varied depending on the cell lines and correlated with the inhibitory effects mediated by P9. An association between Pim-1 expression and drug resistance was observed. Although the drug-resistant CEM/A7R cells were highly resistant to cytotoxic P-glycoprotein substrates, their growth was inhibited by P9 as demonstrated by in vitro proliferation assay and in vivo inhibition of xenograft tumors. P9 had little effect on P-glycoprotein expression and intracellular Rhodamine 123 accumulation, but it inhibited the phosphorylation of Bad and induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Pim-1 is variably expressed in leukemia cell lines and associated with drug resistance. Targeting Pim-1 with monoclonal antibody could be explored for the treatment of leukemia and may represent a novel strategy to overcome drug resistance.","['Li, Jie', 'Hu, Xiu Feng', 'Loveland, Bruce E', 'Xing, Pei Xiang']","['Li J', 'Hu XF', 'Loveland BE', 'Xing PX']","['Cancer Immunotherapy Laboratory, Burnet Institute Incorporating Austin Research Institute, Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia. jieli6688@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['R01 CA104470/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090821,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/metabolism']",2009/08/26 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/26 09:00'],"['2009/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/30 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00326-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2009.08.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Nov;37(11):1284-94. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2009.08.002.

However, research regarding ambient environmental benzene exposures and leukemogenesis is lacking. Alternatively, occupational exposure to significantly elevated levels of benzene is associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This investigation uses ambient air monitoring data from six counties in the state of Florida to characterize the extrapolated cancer risk from airborne benzene concentrations. The study uses both a regulatory and comparative risk analysis methodology to appropriately frame ""risk"" for the public. Between the years 2003 and 2006, 3794 air samples were collected from 23 monitoring stations distributed in Broward, Duval, Orange, Miami-Dade, Hillsborough, and Pinellas counties. The mean benzene concentrations by site ranged from 0.18 to 3.58ppb. Extrapolated cumulative lifetime exposures ranged from 0.036 to 0.702ppm-years. Regulatory risk analysis resulted in cancer risk estimates ranging from 4.37 x10(-6) to 8.56 x 10(-5), all of which exceed the Florida Department of Environmental Protection acceptable risk of 1x10(-6). Comparative analysis with the epidemiologic literature indicates the association between benzene exposure and AML is related to cumulative exposures far in excess of 1ppm-years, with the likely threshold for benzene-induced leukemogenesis of 50ppm-years cumulative exposure. Based upon the results of this investigation, it is unreasonable to anticipate AML cases in Florida residents as a result of ambient airborne benzene concentrations.","['Johnson, Giffe T', 'Harbison, Stephen C', 'McCluskey, James D', 'Harbison, Raymond D']","['Johnson GT', 'Harbison SC', 'McCluskey JD', 'Harbison RD']","['College of Public Health, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA. gtjohnso@mail.usf.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090822,Netherlands,Regul Toxicol Pharmacol,Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,8214983,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Carcinogens)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Air Pollution/adverse effects', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens/toxicity', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Environmental Monitoring/methods', 'Epidemiological Monitoring', 'Florida/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced', 'Risk Assessment/methods']",2009/08/26 09:00,2010/01/26 06:00,['2009/08/26 09:00'],"['2009/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/30 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0273-2300(09)00168-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yrtph.2009.08.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Regul Toxicol Pharmacol. 2009 Dec;55(3):361-6. doi: 10.1016/j.yrtph.2009.08.008.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The investigation was a hospital-based case-control study consisting of 722 confirmed AML cases and 1444 individually gender-age-matched patient controls at 29 hospitals in Shanghai. A 17-page questionnaire was used to obtain information on: demographics, medical history, family history, lifestyle risk factors, employment history, residential history, and environmental and occupational exposures. Certain occupations of interest triggered a second questionnaire, which was occupation-specific and asked for more details about jobs, tasks, materials used and work environment. Risk estimates (odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals) were calculated using conditional logistic regression models. RESULTS: Several potential risk factors of AML (all subtypes combined) and individual subtypes were identified; including low-level education, body mass index (BMI), blood transfusion, smoking, alcohol consumption, home or workplace renovation, living on a farm, planting crops, raising livestock or animals, employment as farm workers or in the agricultural industry, and exposures to insecticides or fertilizers. Some risk factors applied to all or several subtypes (such as low-level education and living on a farm), while others were limited to one or two specific subtypes (such as home/office renovation and acute promyelocytic leukemia). An inverse association was found between BMI and overall AML or the sub-category ""AML not otherwise categorized"", whereas a positive association between BMI and the subtype acute promyelocytic leukemia was detected. An unexpected finding was the association between the use of traditional Chinese medicines and a reduced risk of AML in general as well as several major subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified a number of risk factors for AML in general as well as for some specific subtypes. Some of the risk factors were subtype-specific. The difference in risk by subtype underscores the importance of investigating the etiologic commonality and heterogeneity of AML by subtype in epidemiologic research.","['Wong, Otto', 'Harris, Fran', 'Yiying, Wang', 'Hua, Fu']","['Wong O', 'Harris F', 'Yiying W', 'Hua F']","['Applied Health Sciences, San Mateo, CA 94401, USA. ottowong@aol.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090822,Netherlands,Regul Toxicol Pharmacol,Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,8214983,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Body Mass Index', 'Case-Control Studies', 'China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Life Style', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional/*methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'World Health Organization']",2009/08/26 09:00,2010/01/26 06:00,['2009/08/26 09:00'],"['2009/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/17 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0273-2300(09)00165-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yrtph.2009.08.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Regul Toxicol Pharmacol. 2009 Dec;55(3):340-52. doi: 10.1016/j.yrtph.2009.08.007.

In the majority of patients, the induction treatment leads to complete remission (CR), defined as microscopic disappearance of leukaemic disease along with the return of normal haematopoiesis. However, despite the introduction of more efficacious consolidation regimens, a worryingly large proportion of AML patients in CR will subsequently experience relapses with poor prospects of long-term survival. A relapse is assumed to be the result of expansion of residual leukaemic cells that have escaped the initial chemotherapy. The anti-leukaemic functions of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells has formed the background to the use of interleukin-2 (IL-2), a T- and NK cell-activating cytokine, with the aim to eliminate residual leukaemia and hence reduce the relapse rate in AML, but the clinical trials using IL-2 monotherapy have yielded disappointment. A recent phase III study has demonstrated that post-consolidation treatment with the combination of histamine dihydrochloride (HDC) and IL-2 significantly prevents relapse in AML patients.

METHODS: This retrospective case series includes patients with leukaemia whose only ophthalmic manifestation was extraocular muscle enlargement. Demographic data, clinical information on the systemic disease, prominent ocular signs and symptoms, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics, treatments applied and the outcomes were collected. RESULTS: Five patients were diagnosed as leukaemic infiltration of extraocular muscle between 1995 and 2008. The age at presentation ranged between 3 and 61 years. Acute myeloid leukaemia was the diagnosis in two patients, and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia and biphenotypic acute leukaemia were found in one patient each, respectively. One patient had bilateral involvement. The lateral rectus muscle was affected in four patients and the superior rectus muscle in one case. Restricted ocular motility was the most common finding. In one patient who had no prior history of leukaemia, an incisional biopsy established the diagnosis. All patients received multi-agent chemotherapy. Four patients expired after a rapid decline of the systemic status within a mean period of 7 months. CONCLUSIONS: Leukaemic infiltration of extraocular muscles is a rare and late manifestation of the advanced disease associated with relapse and there seems to be a predilection for the lateral rectus muscle.

On the other hand, the prognosis of patients with central nervous system (CNS) relapses of APL remains poor. Therefore, CNS relapses have become major concerns, and effective therapeutic approaches for CNS relapses are needed. In fact, possible active roles of molecularly targeted therapies in CNS relapses of APL have been suggested, and several new approaches with molecularly targeted therapies for CNS relapses have been examined in APL. In this review, we discuss three main topics; the relationship between the incidence of CNS relapses and the introduction of molecularly targeted therapies for APL, new approaches with targeted therapies for CNS relapses of APL, and other complications of targeted therapies in CNS such as pseudotumor cerebri induced by ATRA and subarachnoid hemorrhage.

The second and more recent trial, Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 49907, provides substantial evidence supporting the use of standard adjuvant chemotherapy regimens (doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide or cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-5-fluorouracil) as opposed to simplified oral regimens (capecitabine). In this trial, both the risk of relapse (hazard ratio: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.38-3.17; p < 0.001) and the risk of death (hazard ratio: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.11-3.08; p = 0.02) were significantly higher with capecitabine compared with standard chemotherapy. The current review explores both the implications and potential caveats of this innovative trial. CALGB 49907 represents a paradigm for further studies of adjuvant cancer therapy in older adults.","['Pal, Sumanta Kumar', 'Mortimer, Joanne']","['Pal SK', 'Mortimer J']","['Division of Genitourinary Malignancies, Department of Medical Oncology & Experimental Therapeutics, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA. spal@coh.org']",['eng'],,"['Comment', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Womens Health (Lond),"Women's health (London, England)",101271249,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '6804DJ8Z9U (Capecitabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Capecitabine', '*Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors']",2009/08/26 09:00,2010/09/30 06:00,['2009/08/26 09:00'],"['2009/08/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/whe.09.43 [doi]'],ppublish,Womens Health (Lond). 2009 Sep;5(5):481-4. doi: 10.2217/whe.09.43.,,,,25,,,['N Engl J Med. 2009 May 14;360(20):2055-65.

By studying the effect of LIGHT in the transcriptional profile of a lymphoid malignancy, we found that HVEM, but not LT-betaR, stimulation induces a significant increase in the expression of chemokine genes such as IL-8, and an unexpected upregulation of apoptotic genes. This had functional consequences, since LIGHT, or HVEM mAb, thus far known to costimulate T- and B-cell activation, induced chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell death. Many of the mediators involved were identified here, with an apoptotic pathway as demonstrated by caspases activation, decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, but also a role of TRAIL. Moreover, HVEM induced endogenous TNF-alpha production and TNF-alpha enhanced HVEM-mediated cell death. HVEM function was mainly dependent on LIGHT, since other ligands like HSV-glycoprotein D and B and T lymphocyte attenuator were essentially ineffective. In conclusion, we describe a novel, as yet unknown killing effect of LIGHT through HVEM on a lymphoid malignancy, and combined with induction of chemokine release this may represent an additional tool to boost cancer immunotherapy.","['Pasero, Christine', 'Barbarat, Bernadette', 'Just-Landi, Sylvaine', 'Bernard, Alain', 'Aurran-Schleinitz, Therese', 'Rey, Jerome', 'Eldering, Eric', 'Truneh, Alemsedeg', 'Costello, Regis T', 'Olive, Daniel']","['Pasero C', 'Barbarat B', 'Just-Landi S', 'Bernard A', 'Aurran-Schleinitz T', 'Rey J', 'Eldering E', 'Truneh A', 'Costello RT', 'Olive D']","[""INSERM UMR891, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Universite de Mediterranee, Institut de Cancerologie et d'Immunologie de Marseille, Marseille, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Lymphotoxin beta Receptor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 14)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF14 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 14)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/metabolism', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphotoxin beta Receptor/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 14/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 14/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*metabolism']",2009/08/25 09:00,2009/09/23 06:00,['2009/08/25 09:00'],"['2009/08/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.200939069 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2009 Sep;39(9):2502-14. doi: 10.1002/eji.200939069.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The S1 site lies within a key negative regulatory region (NRR) of the receptor, which contains three highly conserved Lin12/Notch repeats and a heterodimerization domain (HD) that interact to prevent premature signaling in the absence of ligands. Because the role of S1 cleavage in Notch signaling remains unresolved, we investigated the effect of S1 cleavage on the structure, surface trafficking and ligand-mediated activation of human Notch1 and Notch2, as well as on ligand-independent activation of Notch1 by mutations found in human leukemia. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The X-ray structure of the Notch1 NRR after furin cleavage shows little change when compared with that of an engineered Notch1 NRR lacking the S1-cleavage loop. Likewise, NMR studies of the Notch2 HD domain show that the loop containing the S1 site can be removed or cleaved without causing a substantial change in its structure. However, Notch1 and Notch2 receptors engineered to resist S1 cleavage exhibit unexpected differences in surface delivery and signaling competence: S1-resistant Notch1 receptors exhibit decreased, but detectable, surface expression and ligand-mediated receptor activation, whereas S1-resistant Notch2 receptors are fully competent for cell surface delivery and for activation by ligands. Variable dependence on S1 cleavage also extends to T-ALL-associated NRR mutations, as common class 1 mutations display variable decrements in ligand-independent activation when introduced into furin-resistant receptors, whereas a class 2 mutation exhibits increased signaling activity. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: S1 cleavage has distinct effects on the surface expression of Notch1 and Notch2, but is not generally required for physiologic or pathophysiologic activation of Notch proteins. These findings are consistent with models for receptor activation in which ligand-binding or T-ALL-associated mutations lead to conformational changes of the NRR that permit metalloprotease cleavage.","['Gordon, Wendy R', 'Vardar-Ulu, Didem', ""L'Heureux, Sarah"", 'Ashworth, Todd', 'Malecki, Michael J', 'Sanchez-Irizarry, Cheryll', 'McArthur, Debbie G', 'Histen, Gavin', 'Mitchell, Jennifer L', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Blacklow, Stephen C']","['Gordon WR', 'Vardar-Ulu D', ""L'Heureux S"", 'Ashworth T', 'Malecki MJ', 'Sanchez-Irizarry C', 'McArthur DG', 'Histen G', 'Mitchell JL', 'Aster JC', 'Blacklow SC']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.""]",['eng'],"['P01 CA119070-030003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092433-05S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA119070-01A10003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA119070-039001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA119070-029001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA119070-020003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092433-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 119070/PHS HHS/United States', 'P01 CA119070-01A19001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092433-06A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092433-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA119070/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090824,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH2 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptor, Notch2)', 'EC 3.4.21.75 (Furin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Dimerization', 'Furin/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptor, Notch1/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch2/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Signal Transduction', 'X-Ray Diffraction']",2009/08/25 09:00,2010/01/20 06:00,['2009/08/25 09:00'],"['2009/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0006613 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Aug 24;4(8):e6613. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0006613.,PMC2726630,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human leukocyte cDNA library, we identified BCL6 (B-cell lymphoma 6) as a cellular protein, which interacts with Tax 1. The BCL6 gene encodes a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor that contains a conserved N-terminal poxvirus and zinc finger (POZ) repressor domain and a C-terminal Kruppel-like zinc finger DNA binding domain. Using both in vivo and in vitro methods, we demonstrate that the POZ domain of BCL6 is sufficient for its interaction with Tax 1. Using functional assays, we demonstrate that Tax 1 enhanced the repressive activity of BCL6 and increased the levels of apoptosis induced by BCL6 in osteosarcoma cells indicating that both proteins cooperate in vivo to cause a physiological affect. Furthermore, BCL6 recruited Tax 1 into punctate nuclear structures, which suggests that Tax 1 colocalizes with BCL6 in repressor complexes in vivo. BCL6 expression significantly downregulated both basal and Tax-induced nuclear factor-kappaB and long terminal repeat activation. This suggests that the expression of BCL6 in HTLV infected cells may contribute to the silencing of viral gene expression and to the long clinical latency associated with HTLV infection.","['Dean, J', 'Hashimoto, K', 'Tsuji, T', 'Gautier, V', 'Hall, W W', 'Sheehy, N']","['Dean J', 'Hashimoto K', 'Tsuji T', 'Gautier V', 'Hall WW', 'Sheehy N']","['UCD Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090824,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (BCL6 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Gene Silencing', 'HTLV-I Infections/pathology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/chemistry/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', '*Poxviridae', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Signal Transduction', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', '*Zinc Fingers']",2009/08/25 09:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/08/25 09:00'],"['2009/08/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2009230 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.230 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2009 Oct 22;28(42):3723-34. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.230.

Nine genetic variants (BAX (rs4645878), GSTM1 (null/present), GSTT1 (null/present), IL10 (rs1800896), LTA (rs909253), MTHFR (rs1801131), MTHFR (rs1801133), P2RX7 (rs3751143), and TNF (rs1800629)) were investigated in 4 or more studies, and their results were meta-analyzed. In individual studies, 147 variants showed a significant association with CLL risk under any genetic model. For 53 variants, the association was significant at P < 0.01 with an increased risk greater than 40%. Only 0.3% of studies had statistical power greater than 80%. In meta-analyses, none of the variants showed significant results, and heterogeneity ranged from none to high. Large and rigorous genetic studies (candidate-gene association studies and genome-wide association studies) designed to investigate epistatic and gene-environment interactions may produce more conclusive evidence about the genetic etiology of CLL.

However, there is no report that the effects of carotenoids on degranulation of mast cell is critical for type I allergy. In this study, we focused on the effect of carotenoids on antigen-induced degranulation of mast cells. Fucoxanthin, astaxanthin, zeaxanthin, and beta-carotene significantly inhibited the antigen-induced release of beta-hexosaminidase in rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 cells and mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells. Those carotenoids also inhibited antigen-induced aggregation of the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilonRI), which is the most upstream of the degranulating signals of mast cells. Furthermore, carotenoids inhibited Fc epsilonRI-mediated intracellular signaling, such as phosphorylation of Lyn kinase and Fyn kinase. It suggests that the inhibitory effect of carotenoids on the degranulation of mast cells were mainly due to suppressing the aggregation of Fc epsilonRI followed by intracellular signaling. In addition, those carotenoids inhibited antigen-induced translocation of Fc epsilonRI to lipid rafts, which are known as platforms of the aggregation of Fc epsilonRI. We assume that carotenoids may modulate the function of lipid rafts and inhibit the translocation of Fc epsilonRI to lipid rafts. This is the first report that focused on the aggregation of Fc epsilonRI to investigate the mechanism of the inhibitory effects on the degranulation of mast cells and evaluated the functional activity of carotenoids associated with lipid rafts.","['Sakai, Shota', 'Sugawara, Tatsuya', 'Matsubara, Kiminori', 'Hirata, Takashi']","['Sakai S', 'Sugawara T', 'Matsubara K', 'Hirata T']","['Division of Applied Biosciences, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8502.', 'Division of Applied Biosciences, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8502.

Using residential histories collected from the families of 213 ALL cases and 268 matched controls enrolled in the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study, the authors assessed residential proximity within a half-mile (804.5m) of pesticide applications by linking address histories with reports of agricultural pesticide use. Proximity was ascertained during different time windows of exposure, including the first year of life and the child's lifetime through the date of diagnosis for cases or reference for controls. Agricultural pesticides were categorized a priori into groups based on similarities in toxicological effects, physicochemical properties, and target pests or uses. The effects of moderate and high exposure for each group of pesticides were estimated using conditional logistic regression. Elevated ALL risk was associated with lifetime moderate exposure, but not high exposure, to certain physicochemical categories of pesticides, including organophosphates, chlorinated phenols, and triazines, and with pesticides classified as insecticides or fumigants. A similar pattern was also observed for several toxicological groups of pesticides. These findings suggest future directions for the identification of specific pesticides that may play a role in the etiology of childhood leukemia.","['Rull, Rudolph P', 'Gunier, Robert', 'Von Behren, Julie', 'Hertz, Andrew', 'Crouse, Vonda', 'Buffler, Patricia A', 'Reynolds, Peggy']","['Rull RP', 'Gunier R', 'Von Behren J', 'Hertz A', 'Crouse V', 'Buffler PA', 'Reynolds P']","['Northern California Cancer Center, 2001 Center Street, Suite 700, Berkeley, CA 94704, USA. rrull@nccc.org']",['eng'],"['R01-CA92674/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-ES09137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092674-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137-01A1/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092674/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090822,Netherlands,Environ Res,Environmental research,0147621,['0 (Pesticides)'],IM,"['California/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Pesticides/*poisoning', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*chemically induced/epidemiology']",2009/08/25 09:00,2009/10/02 06:00,['2009/08/25 09:00'],"['2008/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/25 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0013-9351(09)00139-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.envres.2009.07.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Environ Res. 2009 Oct;109(7):891-9. doi: 10.1016/j.envres.2009.07.014.

The antimicrobial activity of LfcinB resides in its RRWQWR amino acid sequence (referred to here as LfcinB6); however, the anticancer activity of LfcinB6 is not known. Here, we show that free LfcinB6 did not kill T-leukemia or breast cancer cells but LfcinB6 was strongly cytotoxic when delivered to the cytosolic compartment by fusogenic liposomes. LfcinB6 bound weakly to isolated mitochondria but, unlike LfcinB, did not permeabilize mitochondria or cause cytochrome c to be released.

The mechanism of LfcinB6-induced cytotoxicity is therefore different from that of LfcinB.

Due to the large number of transcripts, relatively limited number of samples, and high variability of data, identification of predictive biomarkers is a challenge for data analysis. Furthermore, many genes may be responsible for drug response differences, but often only a few are sufficient for accurate prediction. Here we present an analysis approach, the Convergent Random Forest (CRF) method, for the identification of highly predictive biomarkers. The aim is to select from genome-wide expression data a small number of non-redundant biomarkers that could be developed into a simple and robust diagnostic tool. Our method combines the Random Forest classifier and gene expression clustering to rank and select a small number of predictive genes. We evaluated the CRF approach by analyzing four different data sets. The first set contains transcript profiles of whole blood from rheumatoid arthritis patients, collected before anti-TNF treatment, and their subsequent response to the therapy. In this set, CRF identified 8 transcripts predicting response to therapy with 89% accuracy. We also applied the CRF to the analysis of three previously published expression data sets. For all sets, we have compared the CRF and recursive support vector machines (RSVM) approaches to feature selection and classification. In all cases the CRF selects much smaller number of features, five to eight genes, while achieving similar or better performance on both training and independent testing sets of data. For both methods performance estimates using cross-validation is similar to performance on independent samples.

TGIF is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and modulates TGF-beta and retinoic acid (RA) signaling, both of which play an important role in hematopoiesis. We recently reported that TGIF's levels correlate inversely with survival in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. Here we present the first direct evidence of a role for TGIF in myelopoiesis. We used short hairpin RNA interference to define the effects of TGIF knockdown on proliferation and differentiation of myeloid leukemia-derived cell lines. Decreased TGIF expression resulted in reduced proliferation and differentiation and lower expression of CEBPbeta, CEBPepsilon, PU.1 and RUNX1, key myeloid transcription factors. Furthermore, TGF-beta signaling was increased and RA signaling was decreased. Further insights into the molecular basis of TGIF's effects were provided by a genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation-based elucidation of TGIF target genes. Together, these data suggest that TGIF has an important role myelopoiesis and may regulate the balance between proliferation and differentiation. Reduced TGIF expression could tip the balance toward quiescence thus providing progenitor as well as hematopoietic stem cells protection from anti-cycle agents.","['Hamid, Rizwan', 'Brandt, Stephen J']","['Hamid R', 'Brandt SJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232, United States. rizwan.hamid@vanderbilt.edu']",['eng'],['K08 HL089903/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090729,United States,Mol Oncol,Molecular oncology,101308230,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TGIF1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myelopoiesis/*physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/metabolism']",2009/08/25 09:00,2010/01/12 06:00,['2009/08/25 09:00'],"['2009/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/29 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S1574-7891(09)00087-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molonc.2009.07.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Oncol. 2009 Dec;3(5-6):451-63. doi: 10.1016/j.molonc.2009.07.004.

The bone marrow of patients suffering from chronic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia represents a very convenient model for such measurements because of the satisfactory number of early stages, as well as advanced stages, of the granulocytic cell lineage represented by neutrophils. In contrast to the erythroid cell lineage, similar nucleolar and cytoplasmic RNA density-concentration values were found only in early granulocytic progenitors such as myeloblasts and promyelocytes. In advanced stages of the granulocytic development starting with myelocytes, these cells were characterized by a larger decrease in the cytoplasmic RNA concentration in comparison with that of the nucleoli. Thus, the nucleolar to cytoplasmic RNA concentration ratio in these cells was above 1. On the other hand, it should be pointed out that late differentiation stages of granulocytes, starting with myelocytes, possessed nucleolar bodies (nucleoli without surrounding perinucleolar chromatin) of a markedly reduced size.","['Smetana, Karel', 'Jiraskova, Ilona', 'Mikulenkova, Dana', 'Klamova, Hana']","['Smetana K', 'Jiraskova I', 'Mikulenkova D', 'Klamova H']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic. karel.smetanas@uhkt.cz']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090820,Germany,Acta Histochem,Acta histochemica,0370320,['63231-63-0 (RNA)'],IM,"['Biopsy', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Nucleolus/*ultrastructure', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Densitometry', '*Granulocyte Precursor Cells/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/metabolism/pathology', 'Particle Size', '*RNA/analysis']",2009/08/25 09:00,2011/03/26 06:00,['2009/08/25 09:00'],"['2009/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0065-1281(09)00074-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.acthis.2009.07.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Histochem. 2011 Jan;113(1):58-61. doi: 10.1016/j.acthis.2009.07.008.

With the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, several groups have also attempted to use microarray profiling to ascertain if particular gene expression profiles pre-existing in patients' CML cells, which could reflect intrinsic disease biology, would predict for response to treatment. This could streamline patients for alternative treatments upfront should a poor risk profile be found. In this article, we provide an overview of the progress made so far in this field, and outline the more substantial results of available microarray studies to date.","['Yong, Agnes S M', 'Melo, Junia V']","['Yong AS', 'Melo JV']","['Haematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

In the last decade, following the introduction of this methodology in leukaemia research, various studies have demonstrated that classification of the majority of known genetic subclasses in AML can be performed with high accuracy by GEP. Further, GEP allowed for detecting new biologically and prognostically relevant subclasses within the defined subgroups, mainly in the normal karyotype AML. These new classifiers cross the borders of traditionally defined prognostic parameters, and some of these gene expression signatures were independently validated by different study groups. The development of treatment-specific sensitivity assays being able to predict the individual patient's response to targeted therapy is another interesting perspective. With respect to molecular mutations in genes such as FLT3 or NPM1, future studies must outline the definite position of GEP. International multicentre studies such as the MILE study (Microarray Innovations in LEukemia) pave the way to a standardised workflow of GEP in routine diagnostics in AML.","['Bacher, Ulrike', 'Kohlmann, Alexander', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Bacher U', 'Kohlmann A', 'Haferlach C', 'Haferlach T']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Cancer Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

Preparing fertile soil: the importance of endometrial receptivity.,923-34,10.1071/RD09145 [doi],"The human endometrium is receptive for implantation of a blastocyst for only 4-5 days in each menstrual cycle. Failure of implantation is a major reason for infertility in women and the inability to achieve endometrial receptivity is responsible for much of the failure of reproductive technologies. Endometrial receptivity requires changes in the uterine luminal and glandular cells, particularly in terms of their secretory capacity and altered expression of adhesion molecules. In parallel with these changes, decidualisation (differentiation) of the endometrial stroma is initiated in women during the receptive phase, regardless of the presence of a blastocyst. Increased leucocyte numbers are also important. The microenvironments provided by the endometrium during the receptive phase and that support implantation are highly complex and constantly changing as implantation progresses. The present review provides a comprehensive overview of the cellular and molecular events of human implantation. It also summarises work from our laboratories emphasising the functional importance of proprotein convertase 6, along with key cytokines (interleukin-11, leukaemia inhibitory factor, activin A) and chemokines (including CX3CL1 and CCL14), during implantation. Of particular importance is how these mediators contribute to receptivity and how they are disturbed in infertile women. Factors that are critical for uterine receptivity may also be manipulated to provide new contraceptive strategies for women.","['Salamonsen, Lois A', 'Nie, Guiying', 'Hannan, Natalie J', 'Dimitriadis, Evdokia']","['Salamonsen LA', 'Nie G', 'Hannan NJ', 'Dimitriadis E']","[""Prince Henry's Institute of Medical Research, Clayton, Australia. lois.salamonsen@princehenrys.org""]",['eng'],,"['Lecture', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Australia,Reprod Fertil Dev,"Reproduction, fertility, and development",8907465,"['0 (Contraceptive Agents, Female)', '0 (Fertility Agents, Female)']",IM,"['Contraceptive Agents, Female/therapeutic use', '*Embryo Implantation/drug effects', 'Endometrium/drug effects/metabolism/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Female', '*Fertility/drug effects', 'Fertility Agents, Female/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/metabolism/pathology/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Reproductive Techniques, Assisted', 'Signal Transduction']",2009/08/25 09:00,2009/11/06 06:00,['2009/08/25 09:00'],"['2009/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['RD09145 [pii]', '10.1071/RD09145 [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Fertil Dev. 2009;21(7):923-34. doi: 10.1071/RD09145.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical data of 100 cases of allo-HSCT were retrospectively analyzed. The incidences and risk factors of aGVHD and cGVHD, relapse and survival were studied. The results showed that 31 cases developed aGVHD of II - IV grade (34.4%) and 14 cases developed aGVHD of III - IV grade (17.7%). HLA matched or mismatched did not show significant difference in the development of aGVHD of II - IV grade (p > 0.05). Previous occurrence of aGVHD was the risk factor for cGVHD (HR = 2.303, p = 0.088). The female was a favorable factor for cGVHD (HR = 0.401, p = 0.055). The relapse rate was lower in patients who developed cGVHD. The development of aGVHD of II - IV grade was the risk factor for overall survival (p < 0.05). The mortality of patients with aGVHD of III - IV grade and mortality of patients with aGVHD of 0 - I grade were 81.0% and 35.7% respectively, there was very significant difference between them (p = 0.000). In conclusion, till now GVHD and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect can not be separated. The positive effect of GVL could be counteracted by GVHD-related mortality. It is necessary to prevent and control the development of severe aGVHD. The development of local cGVHD may be beneficial to the long-term disease-free survival of patients after allo-HSCT.","['Deng, Xue-Rong', 'Ren, Han-Yun', 'Cen, Xi-Nan', 'Wang, Li-Hong', 'Liang, Ze-Yin', 'Wang, Wen-Sheng', 'Qiu, Zhi-Xiang', 'Ou, Jin-Ping', 'Xu, Wei-Lin', 'Wang, Mang-Ju', 'Li, Yuan', 'Yin, Yue']","['Deng XR', 'Ren HY', 'Cen XN', 'Wang LH', 'Liang ZY', 'Wang WS', 'Qiu ZX', 'Ou JP', 'Xu WL', 'Wang MJ', 'Li Y', 'Yin Y']","['Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology/*mortality', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/mortality', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",2009/08/25 09:00,2011/07/14 06:00,['2009/08/25 09:00'],"['2009/08/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2009)04-0994-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Aug;17(4):994-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the detected results of 161 samples, there were 33 samples' values above the baseline value, in which resistance/relapse/progression (R/R/P) 13 (39.4%, 13/33), no remission (NR) 17 (51.5%, 17/33) and complete hematologic remission (CHR) 3 (9.1%, 3/33) were observed. the values of 26 samples decreased by 0 - 1 order of magnitude (0.1 < or = bcr-abl/abl % < 1), in which R/R/P 6 (23.1%, 6/26), NR 7 (26.9%, 7/26), CHR 7 (26.9%, 7/26) and cytogenetic remission (CyR) 6 (23.1%, 6/26) were observed, the values of 19 samples decreased by 1 - 2 order of magnitude (0.01 < or = bcr-abl/abl % < 0.1), in which NR 2 (10.5%, 2/19), CHR 3 (15.8%, 3/19) and CyR 14 (73.7%, 14/19) were determined. 7 samples decreased by 2 - 3 order of magnitude (0.001 < or = bcr-abl/abl % < 0.01) in which major CyR (MCyR) 2 (28.6%, 2/7) and complete CyR (CCyR) 5 (71.4%, 5/7) were determined, the values of 76 samples decreased by 3 or more order of magnitude (bcr-abl/abl % < 0.001), and all these were CCyR. In conclusion, the using decrease degree of one time point-detected value compared to the baseline could well assess the patient clinical status. The bcr-abl/abl % < 0.01 can reliably reflect CyR obtained by patients at the time point, and bcr-abl/abl % < 0.001 can reflect CCyR obtained by patients. However, exact judgments of patient status relies on dynamic and serial monitoring.","['Wang, Guo-Rong', 'Yu, Zhen', 'Zhao, Yao-Zhong', 'Li, Zeng-Jun', 'Li, Chang-Hong', 'Qian, Lin-Sheng', 'Qiu, Lu-Gui']","['Wang GR', 'Yu Z', 'Zhao YZ', 'Li ZJ', 'Li CH', 'Qian LS', 'Qiu LG']","['National Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Young Adult']",2009/08/25 09:00,2011/07/14 06:00,['2009/08/25 09:00'],"['2009/08/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2009)04-0861-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Aug;17(4):861-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to test the lrp16 mRNA expression in 4 leukemia cell lines, including K562 (CML), HL-60 (APL), MOLT4 (ALL) and U937 cell lines, as well as in bone marrow-derived cells from 115 patients with leukemia. The effect of lrp16 gene expression on genesis and progression of leukemia was analyzed according to clinicopathological features. The results indicated that positive expression of lrp16 mRNA was found in all 4 leukemia cell lines. For leukemia patients, the positive expression rate of lrp16 mRNA in all AML patients was 38% (16/42), in which the positive rates in AML patients with complete remission (CR) and AML patients without remission were 13% (4/30) and 100% (12/12) respectively. The positive expression rate of lrp16 mRNA in ALL patients was 38% (10/26), in which the positive rate in ALL patients with CR and ALL patients without remission were 16% (3/18) and 87% (7/8) respectively. The positive expression rate of lrp16 mRNA in CML patients was 36% (9/25), in which the positive rates in CML patients with CR and CML patients without remission were 20% (4/20) and 100% (5/5) respectively. The positive rate of lrp16 mRNA in CLL patients was 31% (7/22), in which the positive rate in CLL patients with CR and CLL patients without remission were 11% (2/17) and 100% (5/5) respectively. There was no difference of lrp16 gene expression between leukemia subtypes, but there was statistical significant difference in lrp16 gene expression between CR patients and non CR patients (p < 0.001). It is concluded that the lrp16 gene is a leukemic oncogene and closely relates to genesis and progression of leukemia, which may be an indicator for evaluating clinical efficacy of leukemia therapy.","['Yang, Bo', 'Chi, Xiao-Hua', 'Lu, Xue-Chun', 'Han, Wei-Dong', 'Yu, Li', 'Lou, Fang-Ding']","['Yang B', 'Chi XH', 'Lu XC', 'Han WD', 'Yu L', 'Lou FD']","['Department of Geriatric Hematology, PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.']",['chi'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (MACROD1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Young Adult']",2009/08/25 09:00,2011/07/14 06:00,['2009/08/25 09:00'],"['2009/08/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2009)04-0857-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Aug;17(4):857-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the global molecular changes that precede the appearance of clinically detectable symptoms. In this study, the effects of mainstream tobacco smoke (MTS) on global transcription in the mouse lung were investigated. METHODS: Male C57B1/CBA mice were exposed to MTS from two cigarettes daily, 5 days/week for 6 or 12 weeks. Mice were sacrificed immediately, or 6 weeks following the last cigarette. High density DNA microarrays were used to characterize global gene expression changes in whole lung. Microarray results were validated by Quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Further analysis of protein synthesis and function was carried out for a select set of genes by ELISA and Western blotting. RESULTS: Globally, seventy nine genes were significantly differentially expressed following the exposure to MTS. These genes were associated with a number of biological processes including xenobiotic metabolism, redox balance, oxidative stress and inflammation. There was no differential gene expression in mice exposed to smoke and sampled 6 weeks following the last cigarette. Moreover, cluster analysis demonstrated that these samples clustered alongside their respective controls. We observed simultaneous up-regulation of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and its antagonist, suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS3) mRNA following 12 weeks of MTS exposure. Analysis by ELISA and Western blotting revealed a concomitant increase in total IL-6 antigen levels and its downstream targets, including phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), basal cell-lymphoma extra large (BCL-XL) and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1) protein, in total lung tissue extracts. However, in contrast to gene expression, a subtle decrease in total SOCS3 protein was observed after 12 weeks of MTS exposure. CONCLUSION: Global transcriptional analysis identified a set of genes responding to MTS exposure in mouse lung. These genes returned to basal levels following smoking cessation, providing evidence to support the benefits of smoking cessation. Detailed analyses were undertaken for IL-6 and its associated pathways. Our results provide further insight into the role of these pathways in lung injury and inflammation induced by MTS.","['Halappanavar, Sabina', 'Russell, Marsha', 'Stampfli, Martin R', 'Williams, Andrew', 'Yauk, Carole L']","['Halappanavar S', 'Russell M', 'Stampfli MR', 'Williams A', 'Yauk CL']","['Environmental Health Science and Research Bureau, Health Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, K1A 0L2, Canada. sabina_halappanavar@hc-sc.gc.ca']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090821,England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,,,,2009/08/25 09:00,2009/08/25 09:01,['2009/08/25 09:00'],"['2008/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/25 09:01 [medline]']","['1755-8794-2-56 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8794-2-56 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2009 Aug 21;2:56. doi: 10.1186/1755-8794-2-56.,PMC2737544,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The agent, administered orally, has approximately 98% oral bioavailability, achieves maximum plasma concentration approximately 2-4 hours after ingestion, and has a plasma half-life of approximately 18 hours. As maintaining an adequate plasma imatinib concentration is essential to achieving a favorable therapeutic response, it is important to determine whether gastrointestinal surgery, pathologic conditions, or anatomic changes negatively affect imatinib absorption, and thereby result in subtherapeutic plasma imatinib concentrations. We describe a 36-year-old, morbidly obese woman with chronic myeloid leukemia who received treatment with alpha-interferon and cytarabine over 5 years. Her chemotherapy was then switched to imatinib 400 mg/day because she failed to achieve a molecular response with the other two agents. A complete molecular response was achieved with imatinib. Four years later, she underwent a sleeve gastrectomy while receiving imatinib. Imatinib plasma pharmacokinetic values were assessed before and on four occasions during the year after the sleeve gastrectomy. The patient's trough plasma concentration before surgery (1558 ng/ml) was consistent with those found in the literature (>/= 1000 ng/ml), whereas her trough concentrations after surgery were 46-60% lower (629-836 ng/ml) than the preoperative value. Despite this, the patient remained in complete molecular remission for 1 year after surgery. Monitoring plasma imatinib concentrations is recommended in morbidly obese patients with chronic myeloid leukemia or gastrointestinal stromal tumors who undergo gastric procedures. Additional pharmacokinetic studies, however, are needed in these patients.","['Pavlovsky, Carolina', 'Egorin, Merrill J', 'Shah, Dhvani D', 'Beumer, Jan H', 'Rogel, Silvia', 'Pavlovsky, Santiago']","['Pavlovsky C', 'Egorin MJ', 'Shah DD', 'Beumer JH', 'Rogel S', 'Pavlovsky S']","['Division of Hematology, Angelica Ocampo Hospitalization and Clinical Research Center, FUNDALEU (Fundacion para Combatir la Leucemia), Buenos Aires, Argentina. cpavlovsky@fundaleu.org.ar']",['eng'],"['P30 CA047904/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA47904/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Gastrectomy/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/*drug therapy', 'Obesity, Morbid/complications/*surgery', 'Piperazines/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/08/25 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/25 09:00'],"['2009/08/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1592/phco.29.9.1152 [doi]', '10.1592/phco.29.9.1152 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2009 Sep;29(9):1152-6. doi: 10.1592/phco.29.9.1152.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between 1990 and 1996, 20 patients (11 males and nine females, median age of 49 years [range 30-75 years]) were treated with carboplatin, 250 mg/m(2)/day x 5 days as an infusion and mitoxantrone, 10 mg/m(2)/day x 3 days, IV bolus. Median time from diagnosis of CML to BC was 4.25 years (range 0-11 years). CMLBC was myeloid in 13 patients, lymphoid in six, and megakaryocytic in one. All patients were Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome positive; four had a single Ph chromosome, five had double Ph chromosome, three had abnormalities of chromosome 17, and eight had complex cytogenetic abnormalities. Prior treatment for chronic phase included hydroxyurea (12 patients), interferon-alpha (11 patients), cytarabine or all-trans retinoic acid, three patients each and other agents (four patients). Eight patients (five myeloid and three lymphoid) had an objective response (median duration, 3 months). Five had complete responses (CR) of 2, 3, 3, 6, and 6+ months duration, and three had partial responses (PR) for 1, 2, and 4 months. Seven patients died too early to evaluate (TETE): three died pancytopenic in <30 days from initiation of chemotherapy, two patients had pancytopenia for >30 days but had only blasts in their day 30 bone marrow, and two patients were pancytopenic >30 days but demonstrated trilineage marrow regeneration. Three of eight responders survived > or =1 year. Toxicity was primarily hematologic. The objective response rate was 61% (8/13) among those who did not die TETE and 40% among all treated patients. Carboplatin plus mitoxantrone are highly active in CMLBC, with marrow aplasia as the dose-limiting toxicity, and these agents deserve further study in CMLBC, perhaps in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Dutcher, Janice P', 'Morris, Evelyn L', 'Gaynor, Bruce', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Wiernik, Peter H']","['Dutcher JP', 'Morris EL', 'Gaynor B', 'Paietta E', 'Wiernik PH']","['New York Medical College, 600 East 233rd Street, Bronx, NY 10466, USA. jpd4401@aol.com']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090821,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Pancytopenia/chemically induced', 'Pilot Projects', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/08/22 09:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2009/08/22 09:00'],"['2009/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-009-9276-y [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2010 Sep;27(3):728-35. doi: 10.1007/s12032-009-9276-y.

We showed previously that the oncogenic tyrosine kinase BCR/ABL stimulated DSBs repair by HRR. To evaluate the role of BCR/ABL in DSBs repair by NHEJ we examined the ability of leukemic BCR/ABL-expressing cell line BV173 to repair DNA damage induced by two DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors: etoposide and sobuzoxane. DNA lesions induced by sobuzoxane are repaired by a NHEJ pathway which is dependent on the catalytic subunit of protein kinase dependent on DNA (DNA-PK(CS); D-NHEJ), whereas damage evoked by etoposide are repaired by two distinct NHEJ pathways, dependent on or independent of DNA-PK(CS) (backup NHEJ, B-NHEJ). Cells incubated with STI571, a highly specific inhibitor of BCR/ABL, displayed resistance to these agents associated with an accelerated kinetics of DSBs repair, as measured by the neutral comet assay and pulsed field gel electrophoresis. However, in a functional NHEJ assay, cells preincubated with STI571 repaired DSBs induced by a restriction enzyme with a lower efficacy than without the preincubation and addition of wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of DNA-PK(CS), did not change efficacy of the NHEJ reaction. We suggest that BCR/ABL switch on B-NHEJ which is more error-prone then D-NHEJ and in such manner contribute to the increase of the genomic instability of leukemic cells.","['Poplawski, Tomasz', 'Blasiak, Janusz']","['Poplawski T', 'Blasiak J']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Banacha 12/16, 90-237 Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090821,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PRKDC protein, human)', 'R1308VH37P (sobuzoxane)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/drug effects', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', '*Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', '*Recombination, Genetic/drug effects', 'Time Factors', '*Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Wortmannin']",2009/08/22 09:00,2010/10/01 06:00,['2009/08/22 09:00'],"['2009/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11033-009-9730-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2010 Jun;37(5):2309-15. doi: 10.1007/s11033-009-9730-0.

In chimerism analysis, previous studies have indicated single unit predominance early after DCBT. In the present study, we evaluated the chimeric pattern in T-, B- and myeloid cells using PCR-based chimerism analysis in seven patients after DCBT: five patients had acute leukemia and two had lymphoma. Five patients received myeloablative conditioning and two patients were given reduced intensity conditioning. All patients received anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) before DCBT. Three of the six evaluable patients showed donor-donor mixed chimerism in all cell lineages at 90 days after DCBT. Interestingly, two patients in long-term follow-up showed mixed donor chimerism in all cell lineages at 25 and 35 months after DCBT, respectively. Both patients are doing clinically well. Neither of the two developed GVHD after DCBT. In conclusion, in this study donor-donor mixed chimerism was common after high dose ATG and DCBT. Further studies are warranted concerning the immunological consequences of the phenomenon of donor-donor mixed chimerism after DCBT.","['Berglund, Sofia', 'Okas, Mantas', 'Gertow, Jens', 'Uhlin, Michael', 'Mattsson, Jonas']","['Berglund S', 'Okas M', 'Gertow J', 'Uhlin M', 'Mattsson J']","['Center for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, 141 86, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, 141 86, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, 141 86, Stockholm, Sweden.

Most prior established iPS cell lines were derived and maintained on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells supplemented with exogenous leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Drawbacks of MEF cells impede optimization as well as dissection of reprogramming events and limit the usage of iPS cell derivatives in therapeutic applications. In this study, we develop a reproducible protocol for efficient reprogramming mouse neural progenitor cells (NPCs) on human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells via retroviral transfer of human transcriptional factors OCT4/SOX2/KLF4/C-MYC. Two independent iPS cell lines are derived without exogenous LIF. They display typical undifferentiated morphology and express pluripotency markers Oct4 and Sox2. Transgenes are inactivated and the endogenous Oct4 promoter is completely demethylated in the established iPS cell lines, indicating a fully reprogrammed state. Moreover, the iPS cells can spontaneously differentiate or be induced into various cell types of three embryonic germ layers in vitro and in vivo when they are injected into immunodeficient mice for teratoma formation. Importantly, iPS cells extensively integrate with various host tissues and contribute to the germline when injected into the blastocysts. Interestingly, these two iPS cell lines, while both pluripotent, exhibit distinctive differentiation tendencies towards different lineages. Taken together, the data describe the first genuine mouse iPS cell lines generated on human feeder cells without exogenous LIF, providing a reliable tool for understanding the molecular mechanisms of nuclear reprogramming.","['Li, Chunliang', 'Yu, Hongyao', 'Ma, Yu', 'Shi, Guilai', 'Jiang, Jing', 'Gu, Junjie', 'Yang, Ying', 'Jin, Shibo', 'Wei, Zhe', 'Jiang, Hua', 'Li, Jinsong', 'Jin, Ying']","['Li C', 'Yu H', 'Ma Y', 'Shi G', 'Jiang J', 'Gu J', 'Yang Y', 'Jin S', 'Wei Z', 'Jiang H', 'Li J', 'Jin Y']","['Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences/Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090821,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', '*Germ Cells', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology']",2009/08/22 09:00,2010/01/20 06:00,['2009/08/22 09:00'],"['2009/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0006724 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Aug 21;4(8):e6724. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0006724.,PMC2725300,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It consists of an N-terminal portion of NUP98 fused to the homeodomain of HOXA9 and is believed to act as an aberrant transcription factor that binds DNA through the homeodomain. Here we show that NUP98-HOXA9 can regulate transcription without binding to DNA. In order to determine the relative contributions of the NUP98 and HOXA9 portions to the transforming ability of NUP98-HOXA9, the effects of NUP98-HOXA9 on primary human CD34+ cells were dissected and compared to those of wild-type HOXA9. In contrast to previous findings in mouse cells, HOXA9 had only mild effects on the differentiation and proliferation of primary human hematopoietic cells. The ability of NUP98-HOXA9 to disrupt the differentiation of primary human CD34+ cells was found to depend primarily on the NUP98 portion, whereas induction of long-term proliferation required both the NUP98 moiety and an intact homeodomain. Using oligonucleotide microarrays in primary human CD34+ cells, a group of genes was identified whose dysregulation by NUP98-HOXA9 is attributable primarily to the NUP98 portion. These include RAP1A, HEY1, and PTGS2 (COX-2). Their functions may reflect the contribution of the NUP98 moiety of NUP98-HOXA9 to leukemic transformation. Taken together, these results suggest that the effects of NUP98-HOXA9 on gene transcription and cell transformation are mediated by at least two distinct mechanisms: one that involves promoter binding through the homeodomain with direct transcriptional activation, and another that depends predominantly on the NUP98 moiety and does not involve direct DNA binding.","['Yassin, Enas R', 'Sarma, Nayan J', 'Abdul-Nabi, Anmaar M', 'Dombrowski, James', 'Han, Ye', 'Takeda, Akiko', 'Yaseen, Nabeel R']","['Yassin ER', 'Sarma NJ', 'Abdul-Nabi AM', 'Dombrowski J', 'Han Y', 'Takeda A', 'Yaseen NR']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL082549/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K02 HL084179/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA091842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009547/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA91842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090821,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nup98 protein, human)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA Primers', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', '*Oncogenes', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology']",2009/08/22 09:00,2010/01/20 06:00,['2009/08/22 09:00'],"['2009/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0006719 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Aug 21;4(8):e6719. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0006719.,PMC2725295,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor cell differentiation ends cancer cells' immortality, thus stopping cell growth and proliferation. In our previous study, we found that fucose-containing polysaccharide fraction F3 extracted from Ganoderma lucidum can bring about cytokine secretion and cell death in human leukemia THP-1 cells. This prompted us to further investigate on how F3 induces the differentiation in human leukemia cells. We integrated time-course microarray analysis and network modeling to study the F3-induced effects on THP-1 cells. In addition, we determined the differentiation effect using Liu's staining, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction assay, flow cytometer, western blotting and Q-PCR. We also examined the modulation and regulation by F3 during the differentiation process. Dynamic gene expression profiles showed that cell differentiation was induced in F3-treated THP-1 cells. Furthermore, F3-treated THP-1 cells exhibited enhanced macrophage differentiation, as demonstrated by changes in cell adherence, cell cycle arrest, NBT reduction and expression of differentiation markers including CD11b, CD14, CD68, matrix metalloproteinase-9 and myeloperoxidase. In addition, caspase cleavage and p53 activation were found to be significantly enhanced in F3-treated THP-1 cells.

We describe here an approach for measuring ribosomal RNA turnover in vivo using [6,6-(2)H(2)]-glucose as a precursor for de novo RNA synthesis. Because this method involves neither radioactivity nor toxic metabolites, it is suitable for human studies. METHODS: For method development in vitro, a lymphocyte cell line (PM1) was cultured in the presence of [6,6-(2)H(2)]-glucose. RNA was extracted, hydrolyzed enzymatically to ribonucleosides, and derivatized to either the aldonitrile tetra-acetate or the pentafluoro triacetate derivative of the pentose before GC-MS. We identified optimum derivatization and analysis conditions and demonstrated quantitative incorporation of deuterium from glucose into RNA of dividing cells. RESULTS: Pilot clinical studies demonstrated the applicability of this approach to blood leukocytes and solid tissues. A patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia received [6,6-(2)H(2)]-glucose (1 g/kg) orally in aliquots administered every 30 min for a period of 10 h. When we analyzed CD3(-) B cells that had been purified by gradient centrifugation and magnetic-bead adhesion, we observed deuterium enrichment, a finding consistent with a ribosomal RNA production rate of about 7%/day, despite the slow division rates observed in concurrent DNA-labeling analysis. Similarly, in 2 patients with malignant infiltration of lymph nodes, administration of [6,6-(2)H(2)]-glucose (by intravenous infusion for 24 h) before excision biopsy allowed estimation of DNA and RNA turnover in lymph node samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our study results demonstrate the proof-of-principle that deuterium-labeled glucose may be used to analyze RNA turnover, in addition to DNA production/cell proliferation, in clinical samples.","['Defoiche, Julien', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Lagneaux, Laurence', 'Pettengell, Ruth', 'Hegedus, Andrea', 'Willems, Luc', 'Macallan, Derek C']","['Defoiche J', 'Zhang Y', 'Lagneaux L', 'Pettengell R', 'Hegedus A', 'Willems L', 'Macallan DC']","[""Centre for Infection, St George's, University of London, London, UK.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090820,England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', 'AR09D82C7G (Deuterium)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['AIDS-Related Complex/blood/pathology', 'Adenosine/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Deuterium', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', '*Glucose/pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood', 'Lymph Nodes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'RNA, Ribosomal/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleosides/metabolism', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/blood/pathology']",2009/08/22 09:00,2009/10/14 06:00,['2009/08/22 09:00'],"['2009/08/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['clinchem.2008.119446 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2008.119446 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2009 Oct;55(10):1824-33. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2008.119446.

Genetic analyses of mutant alleles of the Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans VRK1 homologs have revealed phenotypes ranging from embryonic lethality to mitotic and meiotic defects with resultant sterility. Herein, we describe the first genetic analysis of murine VRK1. Two lines of mice containing distinct gene-trap integrations into the Vrk1 locus were established. Insertion into intron 12 (GT12) spared VRK1 function, enabling the examination of VRK1 expression in situ. Insertion into intron 3 (GT3) disrupted VRK1 function, but incomplete splicing to the gene trap rendered this allele hypomorphic (approximately 15% of wild-type levels of VRK1 remain). GT3/GT3 mice are viable, but both males and females are infertile. In testes, VRK1 is expressed in Sertoli cells and spermatogonia. The infertility of GT3/GT3 male mice results from a progressive defect in spermatogonial proliferation or differentiation, culminating in the absence of mitotic and meiotic cells in adult testis. These data demonstrate an important role for VRK1 in cell proliferation and confirm that the need for VRK1 during gametogenesis is evolutionarily conserved.","['Wiebe, Matthew S', 'Nichols, R Jeremy', 'Molitor, Tyler P', 'Lindgren, Jill K', 'Traktman, Paula']","['Wiebe MS', 'Nichols RJ', 'Molitor TP', 'Lindgren JK', 'Traktman P']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['U54 AI057153/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '1-U54-AI-057153/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090819,United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Vrk1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Nuclear/metabolism', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Infertility, Female/metabolism', 'Infertility, Male/*metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Male', 'Meiosis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitosis', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sertoli Cells/*metabolism', 'Spermatogonia/*metabolism']",2009/08/22 09:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2009/08/22 09:00'],"['2009/08/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['biolreprod.109.079095 [pii]', '10.1095/biolreprod.109.079095 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2010 Jan;82(1):182-93. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.109.079095.

EPR spectroscopy suggests a distorted octahedral geometry for the complex with the dppz ligand acting as bidentate, binding through both nitrogen donor atoms in an axial-equatorial mode. An oxo group, two water molecules and a sulphate donor occupy the remainder coordination positions. The complex, as well as the anti-trypanosomal reference drug Nifurtimox, showed IC(50) values in the muM range against T. cruzi Dm28c strain. In addition the complex exhibited excellent in vitro anti-tumor activity against leukemia (HL-60 cell line) comparable to that of cisplatin, inducing cell death by apoptosis with IC(50) values in the micromolar range. Data from gel electrophoresis and atomic force microscopy indicate that the complex interacts with DNA, suggesting that its mechanism of action may include DNA as a target. EPR and (51)V NMR experiments were also carried out with aged aerated solutions of the complex to get insight into the stability of the complex in solution and the species responsible for the in vitro activities observed.","['Benitez, Julio', 'Guggeri, Lucia', 'Tomaz, Isabel', 'Pessoa, Joao Costa', 'Moreno, Virtudes', 'Lorenzo, Julia', 'Aviles, Francesc X', 'Garat, Beatriz', 'Gambino, Dinorah']","['Benitez J', 'Guggeri L', 'Tomaz I', 'Pessoa JC', 'Moreno V', 'Lorenzo J', 'Aviles FX', 'Garat B', 'Gambino D']","['Catedra de Quimica Inorganica, Facultad de Quimica, Universidad de la Republica, Gral.

Information on the pharmacokinetics of nilotinib in Chinese patients with CML is lacking, and regulatory requirements for registration of this drug are needed in China. OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the pharmacokinet-ics of single and multiple oral doses of nilotinib in Chinese patients with CML and compared the pharmacokinetic profiles of nilotinib between the Chinese patients and a subgroup of white patients with CML. METHODS: Chinese patients aged > or =18 years with Ph+ CML-CP, CML-AP, or CML-BC (blast crisis) resistant to or intolerant of imatinib were eligible. Patients were administered oral nilotinib 400 mg BID for 15 days. Serial blood samples were collected before and at 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 12 hours after the administration of a single dose (day 1) and multiple doses (day 15, steady state). Serum nilotinib concentrations were determined using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay, and pharmacokinetic parameters of nilotinib were calculated using a noncompartmental method. Tolerability was assessed using cardiac assessments; laboratory analysis (hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis); and physical examination, including vital signs. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were enrolled (18 men, 5 women; mean age, 40.0 years; mean weight, 68.3 kg; CML-CP, 22 patients; CML-AP, 1). All 23 patients were included in the tolerability analysis. Two patients withdrew consent and discontinued after administration of the first dose; thus, 21 patients were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. Median T(max) was ~2 hours after administration of single and multiple doses. At steady state, C(min) was 1025.4 ng/mL and C(max) was 2160.7 ng/mL. Mean AUCs from time 0 to the end of the dosing interval tau (AUC(0-tau)) were 5076.3 and 17,751.3 ng . h/mL at days 1 and 15, respectively, representing an accumulation factor of 3.92. Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 0.39 L/h/kg (range, 0.12-0.74 L/h/ kg) at steady state. The study found a 42% intersubject variability in nilotinib pharmacokinetics. Steady-state C(max), C(min), AUC(0-tau), and CL/F were not significantly different from those previously reported in a subgroup of white patients with CML who received the same 400-mg BID dose. Rash (11/23 patients [47.8%]) and elevated bilirubin, headache, and muscle pain (4 patients each [17.4%]) were the most frequently reported nonhematologic adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In this pharmacokinetic study in Chinese patients with CML resistant to or intolerant of imatinib, nilotinib 400 mg BID was rapidly absorbed after a single dose and multiple doses. The steady-state pharmacokinetic properties in this population were consistent with those reported previously in white patients with CML.","['Zhou, Li', 'Meng, Fanyi', 'Yin, Ophelia', 'Wang, Jianxiang', 'Wang, Ying', 'Wei, Yongqiang', 'Hu, Pei', 'Shen, Zhixiang']","['Zhou L', 'Meng F', 'Yin O', 'Wang J', 'Wang Y', 'Wei Y', 'Hu P', 'Shen Z']","['Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],,"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Ther,Clinical therapeutics,7706726,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Asians', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy', 'China', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Whites', 'Young Adult']",2009/08/22 09:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/08/22 09:00'],"['2009/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0149-2918(09)00229-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinthera.2009.07.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Ther. 2009 Jul;31(7):1568-75. doi: 10.1016/j.clinthera.2009.07.016.,,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00302016'],,,,,,,,,

The odds ratios (ORs) for individual studies range from 0.73 to 1.2. The pooled OR is 1.003 with 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.94-1.07 (p=0.98) for both a fixed effects model and a random effects model.

METHODS: Incidence data were obtained from the cancer registries of Puerto Rico and three U.S. northeastern states (New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut) with a high density of mainland Puerto Ricans. Age-adjusted rates were compared by standardized rate ratios (SRRs). RESULTS: Total cancer incidence was the lowest in island Puerto Ricans, intermediate for mainland Puerto Ricans, and highest in U.S. non-Hispanic whites. Compared to mainland Puerto Ricans, islanders had significantly lower rates (p<0.05) for major cancers-lung (SRRs=0.36 in males and 0.29 in females), prostate (SRR=0.71), female breast (SRR=0.73), and colon-rectum (SRRs=0.74 in males and 0.65 in females)-as well as several less common cancers (urinary bladder; non-Hodgkin lymphoma; liver; kidney and renal pelvis; pancreas; thyroid; leukemia; and skin melanoma). Overall cancer rates in mainland Puerto Ricans were modestly lower than those in U.S. non-Hispanic whites, but mainland Puerto Ricans had the highest rates for stomach, liver, and cervical cancers among the three populations. CONCLUSION: Despite socioeconomic disadvantages, island Puerto Ricans have relatively low cancer incidence. Identifying contributing factors would be informative for cancer research, and understanding the reasons for increased cancer risk in their mainland counterparts would facilitate the development of ethnic-specific intervention programs.","['Ho, Gloria Y F', 'Figueroa-Valles, Nayda R', 'De La Torre-Feliciano, Taina', 'Tucker, Katherine L', 'Tortolero-Luna, Guillermo', 'Rivera, Winna T', 'Jimenez-Velazquez, Ivonne Z', 'Ortiz-Martinez, Ana Patricia', 'Rohan, Thomas E']","['Ho GY', 'Figueroa-Valles NR', 'De La Torre-Feliciano T', 'Tucker KL', 'Tortolero-Luna G', 'Rivera WT', 'Jimenez-Velazquez IZ', 'Ortiz-Martinez AP', 'Rohan TE']","['Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, United States of America. ho@aecom.yu.edu']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Rev Panam Salud Publica,Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,9705400,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Puerto Rico/epidemiology', 'Sex Distribution', 'United States/epidemiology', '*Whites', 'Young Adult']",2009/08/22 09:00,2009/10/27 06:00,['2009/08/22 09:00'],"['2009/08/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S1020-49892009000500003 [pii]', '10.1590/s1020-49892009000500003 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Panam Salud Publica. 2009 May;25(5):394-400. doi: 10.1590/s1020-49892009000500003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, pCRT was replaced by extended triple intrathecal therapy (TIT) in prednisone good early responders - medium-risk (MR) group, accounting for 76% of T-ALL patients. From 1989 to 2003, 143 T-ALL patients aged 1-18 years were enrolled in the Israel National Studies (INS) 89 (n = 84) and INS 98 (n = 59) trials, based on ALL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) 86/90 and ALL-BFM 95 protocols, respectively. Five-year event-free survival (EFS) of the MR group in the INS 89 (n = 60) was 70 +/- 5.9% and the INS 98 (n = 43), 83.7 +/- 5.6% (P = 0.12); the cumulative incidence (CI) of any CNS relapse was 5.0 +/- 2.8% and 2.3 +/- 2.3% (P = 0.50), respectively.

Immune function in a homogenous cohort of 20 children with standard- and intermediate-risk ALL was analysed by immunophenotyping, intracellular cytokine staining, assessment of serum cytokine concentrations, T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire diversity and thymic function. B-cells were most severely affected by chemotherapy, rapidly declined under induction and did not recover until the cessation of maintenance therapy. This recovery was paralleled by a relative increase in naive IgM(+)IgD(+)CD27(-) B-cells, indicating de novo B-cell generation as the major pathway for B-cell reconstitution. T- and Natural Killer-cells were less severely affected. Although numerically diminished by chemotherapy, they had partially recovered at the end of induction. Interestingly, CD4:CD8 ratio, distribution of naive versus memory T-cells, cytokine production, TCR-repertoire complexity and thymic function were all only marginally affected by chemotherapy. Patients receiving dexamethasone had significantly less IFNgamma(+) T-cells than those receiving prednisone. Our data show that during chemotherapy in standard- and intermediate-risk paediatric ALL patients the T-cell system remains relatively well preserved.

Although this drug has been demonstrated to display anticancer activity against a wide variety of tumors, it is needed to be administered at high doses to elicit the required therapeutic response, simultaneously leading to severe adverse effects. We hypothesized that the efficient delivery of gemcitabine to tumors using a biodegradable carrier system could reduce the dose required to elicit sufficient therapeutic response. Thus, we have developed a nanoparticle formulation of gemcitabine suitable for parenteral administration based on the biodegradable polymer poly(octylcyanoacrylate) (POCA). The nanoparticles were synthesized by anionic polymerization of the corresponding monomer. Two drug loading methods were analyzed: the first one based on gemcitabine surface adsorption onto the preformed nanoparticles, and the second method being gemcitabine addition before the polymerization process leading to drug entrapment in the polymeric network. A detailed investigation of the capabilities of the polymer particles to load this drug is described. Gemcitabine entrapment into the polymer matrix yielded a higher drug loading and a slower drug release profile as compared with drug adsorption procedure. The main factors determining the gemcitabine incorporation to the polymer network were the nanoparticles preparation procedure, the monomer concentration, the surfactant concentration, the pH, and the drug concentration. The release kinetic of gemcitabine was found to be controlled by the pH and the type of drug incorporation. The cytotoxicity studies performed on L1210 tumor cells revealed a similar anticancer activity of the gemcitabine-loaded POCA (GPOCA) nanoparticle as free gemcitabine. Following intravenous administration into the mice bearing L1210 wt subcutaneous tumor, the GPOCA nanoparticles displayed significantly greater anticancer activity compared to free gemcitabine; this has been additionally confirmed by histology and immunohistochemistry studies, suggesting the potential of GPOCA for the efficient treatment of cancer.","['Arias, Jose L', 'Reddy, L Harivardhan', 'Couvreur, Patrick']","['Arias JL', 'Reddy LH', 'Couvreur P']","['Departamento de Farmacia y Tecnologia Farmaceutica, Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad de Granada, Granada, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Drug Target,Journal of drug targeting,9312476,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cyanoacrylates)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (octylcyanoacrylate)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cyanoacrylates/chemistry', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Carriers/chemistry', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', '*Nanoparticles', 'Polymers/chemistry']",2009/08/22 09:00,2009/10/27 06:00,['2009/08/22 09:00'],"['2009/08/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/10611860903105739 [doi]'],ppublish,J Drug Target. 2009 Sep;17(8):586-98. doi: 10.1080/10611860903105739.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe a case of ATLL with an unusual presentation which we believe is the first reported case of ATLL in Malaysia based on our literature search. A 51-year-old Indian lady was referred to University Malaya Medical Centre for an incidental finding of lymphocytosis while being investigated for pallor and giddiness. Clinical examination revealed bilateral shotty cervical lymph nodes with no hepato-splenomegaly or skin lesions. Laboratory investigations showed absolute lymphocytosis (38 x 10(9)/L) with a mildly increased serum lactate dehydrogenase. The peripheral blood smear showed the presence of predominantly small to medium sized, non-flower lymphocytes. The bone marrow showed similar findings of prominent lymphocytosis. Immunophenotyping of the bone marrow mononuclear cells showed CD3+, CD4+, CD5+, CD7- and CD25+ which is characteristic of ATLL phenotype. HTLV-1 infection was confirmed by the presence of HTLV-1 proviral DNA in the tumor cells using conventional Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR.

MDS are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, increased apoptosis, peripheral blood cytopenias, and propensity to evolve into acute myelogenous leukemia. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our investigation was to compare the usefulness of classic cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect chromosome aberrations in myelodysplastic syndromes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was carried out in a group of 58 patients with MDS. G-banding using trypsin and Giemsa (GTG banding) and FISH with a panel of five molecular probes for aberrations with prognostic significance in MDS (cen7/8, 5q31, 7q22/q35, 17p13, 20q13.3) were performed on bone marrow cells. RESULTS: The use of GTG technique allowed to detect chromosome aberrations in 25 (43.1%) subjects. However, the additional use of FISH showed the presence of aberrations also in additional 10 (17.2%) patients, which shifted 11 patients from one cytogenetic category to another. CONCLUSIONS: The use of FISH with MDS probe panel beside classic cytogenetics improves detection of chromosome aberrations, and also stratification of MDS patients to prognostic groups. Both methods should be used simultaneously in every genetically diagnosed MDS patient.","['Skonieczka, Katarzyna', 'Duszenko, Ewa', 'Wyrowinska, Elzbieta', 'Haus, Olga']","['Skonieczka K', 'Duszenko E', 'Wyrowinska E', 'Haus O']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Bydgoszcz, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Poland,Pol Arch Med Wewn,Polskie Archiwum Medycyny Wewnetrznej,0401225,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*pathology', 'Reference Values']",2009/08/22 09:00,2009/09/18 06:00,['2009/08/22 09:00'],"['2009/08/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Pol Arch Med Wewn. 2009 Jun;119(6):366-72.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: With the exposure time extending, the total NF-kappaB showed no significant changes,but NF-kappaB expression in nucleus was decreased dramatically after treated with berbamine for 24 h. The ratio of nucleus NF-kappaB/histone H1 was decreased from 59.2%,gradually to 31.4%,19.7%,4.1%,and 0%. At the same time,the expression of A20 was increased,while the expression of pIkappaBalpha, IKKalpha was down-regulated. CONCLUSION: Berbamine may induce K562 cell apoptosis through NF-kappaB pathway.

Molecular analysis using short tandem repeat sequences proved the ALL to be of donor origin. He underwent combination chemotherapy and second allo-BMT from an alternative donor. After second allo-BMT, extramedullary myeloma relapsed as tumor, but was successfully treated with proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib. However, he died from severe graft-versus-host disease four months after the second transplantation. Although more than 50 cases of DCL have been reported, there have been only two reports of DCL developed in MM patients including our case.

To investigate whether such a LIF-controlled survival pathway might be commonly induced upon photoreceptor injury independently of the nature of the toxic stimulus, we analyzed the role of LIF during light-induced retinal degeneration. METHODS: Lif(+/-) and Lif(-/-) mice were exposed to 15,000 lx of white light for 2 h. Retinal morphology and rhodopsin content were analyzed nine days after light exposure. Gene expression studies were done using real-time PCR. Protein levels were determined by western blotting using specific antibodies. RESULTS: A lack of LIF reduced survival of photoreceptor cells after light exposure. In the absence of LIF several genes encoding molecules involved in the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak/STAT) signaling pathway were not activated after light exposure. Presence or absence of LIF did not affect AKT (also known as protein kinase B, PKB) signaling and had only a mild effect on extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. Stress-induced glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) induction was minimal in the absence of LIF. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that increased retinal expression of LIF is a general response to photoreceptor injury. Independent of the nature of the toxic insult (gene mutation, light), LIF may activate an endogenous rescue pathway that protects viable photoreceptor cells, leading to an increased photoreceptor survival in the stressed retina. This defense system may depend on the Jak/STAT pathway and may involve endothelin 2 (EDN2) but not (or only minimally) AKT and ERK1,2 signaling.","['Burgi, Sandra', 'Samardzija, Marijana', 'Grimm, Christian']","['Burgi S', 'Samardzija M', 'Grimm C']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Laboratory for Retinal Cell Biology, Zurich Center for Integrative Human Physiology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090818,United States,Mol Vis,Molecular vision,9605351,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation/radiation effects', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/deficiency/*metabolism', '*Light', 'Mice', 'Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate/metabolism/*pathology/*radiation effects', 'Retinal Degeneration/*pathology/*prevention & control', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/radiation effects']",2009/08/21 09:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/08/21 09:00'],"['2009/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['174 [pii]'],epublish,Mol Vis. 2009 Aug 18;15:1631-7.,PMC2728564,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients received HDMP at 1 g/m(2) each day for 3 days during each of the three 4-week cycles together with rituximab and prophylactic antimicrobial therapy. The treatment was well tolerated with few adverse events of grade III or higher. The overall response rate was 96% (N=27). Nine patients (32%) achieved a complete remission (CR), two of which were without detectable minimal residual disease (MRD). Six patients with MRD received consolidation with alemtuzumab; five of these patients achieved an MRD-negative CR. With over 3 years of follow-up median progression-free survival was 30.3 months with only 39% of patients requiring additional therapy, and an overall survival was 96%.

RNAs from primary cells of 50 treatment-naive CLL patients and peripheral B cells of 14 healthy donors were applied to miRNA expression profiling using bead chip technology. In CLL cells, a set of 7 up- and 19 down-regulated miRNAs was identified. Among the miRNAs down-regulated in CLL cells, 6 of 10 miRNA promoters examined showed gain of methylation compared with normal B-cell controls. Subsequent target prediction of deregulated miRNAs revealed a highly significant binding prediction at the 3' untranslated region of the pleomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) oncogene. Luciferase reporter assays including site-directed mutagenesis of binding sites revealed a significant regulation of PLAG1 by miR-181a, miR-181b, miR-107, and miR-424. Although expression of PLAG1 mRNA was not affected, PLAG1 protein expression was shown to be significantly elevated in CLL cells compared with the levels in healthy donor B cells.

Recently, a glucose transporter, GLUT-1, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), and neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) were demonstrated to facilitate HTLV-1 entry into T cells. DCs express their own array of antigen receptors, the most important being the DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 (ICAM-3)-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) with respect to retrovirus binding. Consequently, the role of DC-SIGN and other HTLV-1 attachment factors was analyzed in viral binding, transmission, and productive infection using monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs), blood myeloid DCs, and B-cell lines expressing DC-SIGN. The relative expression of DC-SIGN, GLUT-1, HSPGs, and NRP-1 first was examined on both DCs and B-cell lines. Although the inhibition of these molecules reduced viral binding, HTLV-1 transmission from DCs to T cells was mediated primarily by DC-SIGN. DC-SIGN also was shown to play a role in the infection of MDDCs as well as model B-cell lines. The HTLV-1 infection of MDDCs also was achieved in blood myeloid DCs following the enhancement of virus-induced interleukin-4 production and subsequent DC-SIGN expression in this cell population. This study represents the first comprehensive analysis of potential HTLV-1 receptors on DCs and strongly suggests that DC-SIGN plays a critical role in HTLV-1 binding, transmission, and infection, thereby providing an attractive target for the development of antiretroviral therapeutics and microbicides.","['Jain, Pooja', 'Manuel, Sharron L', 'Khan, Zafar K', 'Ahuja, Jaya', 'Quann, Kevin', 'Wigdahl, Brian']","['Jain P', 'Manuel SL', 'Khan ZK', 'Ahuja J', 'Quann K', 'Wigdahl B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Molecular Medicine and Infectious Disease, Drexel University College of Medicine, New College Building, Rm. 18311, 245 N. 15th St., Philadelphia, PA 19102, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI077414/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI077414-01A2/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA054559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090819,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (DC-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '144713-63-3 (Neuropilin-1)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Dendritic Cells/metabolism/virology', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/metabolism', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans/metabolism', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/immunology', 'Lectins, C-Type/genetics/*immunology', 'Neuropilin-1/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Attachment', 'Virus Internalization', 'Virus Replication']",2009/08/21 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/21 09:00'],"['2009/08/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01054-09 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01054-09 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2009 Nov;83(21):10908-21. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01054-09.

Whether collective failure of all parts of the immune response or selective deficiency in one crucial part underlies the inability of the host to clear retroviral infections is currently uncertain. We examine here the contribution of virus-specific CD4(+) T cells in resistance against Friend virus (FV) infection in the murine host. We show that the magnitude and duration of the FV-specific CD4(+) T-cell response is directly proportional to resistance against acute FV infection and subsequent disease. Notably, significant protection against FV-induced disease is afforded by FV-specific CD4(+) T cells in the absence of a virus-specific CD8(+) T-cell or B-cell response. Enhanced spread of FV infection in hosts with increased genetic susceptibility or coinfection with Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) causes a proportional increase in the number of FV-specific CD4(+) T cells required to control FV-induced disease. Furthermore, ultimate failure of FV/LDV coinfected hosts to control FV-induced disease is accompanied by accelerated contraction of the FV-specific CD4(+) T-cell response. Conversely, an increased frequency or continuous supply of FV-specific CD4(+) T cells is both necessary and sufficient to effectively contain acute infection and prevent disease, even in the presence of coinfection. Thus, these results suggest that FV-specific CD4(+) T cells provide significant direct protection against acute FV infection, the extent of which critically depends on the ratio of FV-infected cells to FV-specific CD4(+) T cells.","['Pike, Rebecca', 'Filby, Andrew', 'Ploquin, Mickael J-Y', 'Eksmond, Urszula', 'Marques, Rute', 'Antunes, Ines', 'Hasenkrug, Kim', 'Kassiotis, George']","['Pike R', 'Filby A', 'Ploquin MJ', 'Eksmond U', 'Marques R', 'Antunes I', 'Hasenkrug K', 'Kassiotis G']","['Division of Immunoregulation, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, The Ridgeway, Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['MC_U117581330/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090819,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '07MXG07O12 (interferon gamma receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Interferon/genetics/immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology']",2009/08/21 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/21 09:00'],"['2009/08/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01225-09 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01225-09 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2009 Nov;83(21):11211-22. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01225-09.

Conceptually, it is accepted that MTX and folic acid are transported by folate receptors (FRs) in cancerous cells, but the exact mechanism of MTX uptake in human leukemia is unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate different transport systems for FA and MTX, and to delineate their uptake mechanism in MOLT4, K562, Hut78 leukemia cells and normal human T cells. In MOLT4, uptake of MTX was higher than FA, similar to that of K562, Hut78 and normal T cells. In MOLT4 cells, MTX uptake was maximum at pH 7.4 whereas FA uptake was maximum at pH 4.5. Uptake of FA and MTX was significantly inhibited by anions, suggesting anion-dependent transport system. FA uptake was found to be energy dependent whereas MTX uptake was energy independent. RT-PCR and immunofluorescence results demonstrated the presence of reduced folate carrier as well as proton coupled folate transporter and absence of FR in MOLT4 and normal T cells. These data suggest the existence of two separate and independent carrier-mediated transport systems for the uptake of FA and MTX in normal and leukemic human T cells.","['Biswal, Bijesh Kumar', 'Verma, Rama Shanker']","['Biswal BK', 'Verma RS']","['Stem Cell and Molecular Biology Laboratory, Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai-600036, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090819,England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Buffers)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Ions)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', '0 (Sulfates)', '3XC8GUZ6CB (Sulfasalazine)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Buffers', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Folic Acid/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration/drug effects', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ions', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Methotrexate/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Mitomycin/pharmacology', 'Phosphates/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sulfasalazine/pharmacology', 'Sulfates/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",2009/08/21 09:00,2010/02/02 06:00,['2009/08/21 09:00'],"['2009/08/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['mvp130 [pii]', '10.1093/jb/mvp130 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biochem. 2009 Nov;146(5):693-703. doi: 10.1093/jb/mvp130.

Immunophenotyping is now the gold standard for classification of leukaemias. The purpose of this prospective study was to assess the clinical pathological and epidemiological features of a population of dogs with morphologically and immunologically confirmed leukaemia and to compare them within categories: acute and chronic lymphoid leukaemia (ALL and CLL), and acute and chronic myeloid leukaemia (AML and CML). There were 64 cases of morphologically and immunologically confirmed leukaemia: 25 cases of ALL, 17 cases of CLL and 22 cases of AML. Prevalence of B and T immunophenotypes in ALL and CLL was not statistically different. Dogs with AML were significantly younger than those with ALL at presentation (P = 0.04). Golden Retriever dogs in the study population were overrepresented in comparison with a control population of dogs (6/25 ALL cases, 8/64 leukaemia cases). No sex was overrepresented. Dogs with ALL had significantly more severe neutropenia (P = 0.001) and thrombocytopenia (P = 0.002) than those with CLL and had significantly more cytopenias. The severity and numbers of cytopenias seen in ALL and AML were not significantly different. Twenty-one of the leukaemia cases showed one cytopenia, fourteen had two cytopenias and twenty-one cases had pancytopenia. Anaemia was the most common cytopenia seen in isolation (17/21). No dogs had neutropenia without anaemia and/or thrombocytopenia. Total white blood cell counts were not different between the groups. The atypical cell counts within the peripheral blood were significantly higher in ALL than AML; both in isolation and as a percentage of the total white blood cell count (P = 0.03). This study strengthens the hypothesis that acute leukaemias give rise to more profound cytopenias, affecting more cell lines, than chronic leukaemias.","['Adam, F', 'Villiers, E', 'Watson, S', 'Coyne, K', 'Blackwood, L']","['Adam F', 'Villiers E', 'Watson S', 'Coyne K', 'Blackwood L']","['Small Animal Teaching Hospital, University of Liverpool, Neston CH647TE, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Vet Comp Oncol,Veterinary and comparative oncology,101185242,,IM,"['Age Distribution', 'Animals', 'Dog Diseases/*diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/epidemiology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Male', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2009/08/21 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/21 09:00'],"['2009/08/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['VCO189 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1476-5829.2009.00189.x [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Comp Oncol. 2009 Sep;7(3):181-95. doi: 10.1111/j.1476-5829.2009.00189.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, it was found that this enzyme also participates in the reverse reaction of iron removal from heme. To clarify the role of the reverse reaction of ferrochelatase in cells, mouse liver mitochondria were fractionated to examine the localization of ferrochelatase, and it was found that the enzyme localizes not only to the inner membrane, but also to the outer membrane. Observations by immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the dual localization of ferrochelatase in ferrochelatase-expressing human embryonic kidney cells and mouse liver mitochondria. The conventional (zinc-insertion) activities of the enzyme in the inner and outer membranes were similar, whereas the iron-removal activity was high in the outer membrane. 2D gel analysis revealed that two types of the enzyme with different isoelectric points were present in mitochondria, and the acidic form, which was enriched in the outer membrane, was found to be phosphorylated. Mutation of human ferrochelatase showed that serine residues at positions 130 and 303 were phosphorylated, and serine at position 130 may be involved in the balance of the reversible catalytic reaction. When mouse erythroleukemia cells were treated with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate, an activator of protein kinase C, or hemin, phospho-ferrochelatase levels increased, with a concomitant decrease in zinc-insertion activity and a slight increase in iron-removal activity. These results suggest that ferrochelatase localizes to both the mitochondrial outer and inner membranes and that the change in the equilibrium position of the forward and reverse activities may be regulated by the phosphorylation of ferrochelatase.","['Sakaino, Masayoshi', 'Ishigaki, Mutsumi', 'Ohgari, Yoshiko', 'Kitajima, Sakihito', 'Masaki, Ryuichi', 'Yamamoto, Akitsugu', 'Taketani, Shigeru']","['Sakaino M', 'Ishigaki M', 'Ohgari Y', 'Kitajima S', 'Masaki R', 'Yamamoto A', 'Taketani S']","['Department of Biotechnology, Kyoto Institute of Technology, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090819,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'EC 4.99.1.1 (Ferrochelatase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Ferrochelatase/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kidney/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Mitochondria/*enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Mitochondria, Liver/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphorylation', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection']",2009/08/21 09:00,2009/10/23 06:00,['2009/08/21 09:00'],"['2009/08/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['EJB7248 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07248.x [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS J. 2009 Oct;276(19):5559-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07248.x.

For the most part, this disease presents in the pediatric population and most, but not all, patients are successfully treated. Although the t(2;5) product nucleophosmin-ALK has been extensively studied for its transforming properties, very little is known regarding cooperative genetic mutations that may contribute to lymphomagenesis and may predict survival outcome, specifically in a purely pediatric population. We set out to determine the frequency and positions of genomic imbalances in this relatively rare disease. We collected biopsy material from 15 UK-resident children with ALK-expressing ALCL. We performed array comparative genomic hybridization at a resolution of 1 MB using DNA isolated from tumor tissue. Some of the more common genomic gains were confirmed by quantitative PCR. Regions of genomic gain were far more common than losses and were most often detected on chromosomes 1-4, 5-12, 14, and 17, with Chromosome 11 being the most frequent site of genomic imbalances. Patients with 14 or fewer imbalances had a lower overall 3-year survival (87.5-40%, P = 0.14) as did patients with gains in the regions of DDB1 or BIRC5. A range of genomic imbalances exist in ALK-expressing ALCL of a pediatric origin, with a greater number associated with poorer overall survival.","['Youssif, Catrin', 'Goldenbogen, Jan', 'Hamoudi, Rifat', 'Carreras, Joaquim', 'Viskaduraki, Maria', 'Cui, Yu-xin', 'Bacon, Chris M', 'Burke, G A Amos', 'Turner, Suzanne D']","['Youssif C', 'Goldenbogen J', 'Hamoudi R', 'Carreras J', 'Viskaduraki M', 'Cui YX', 'Bacon CM', 'Burke GA', 'Turner SD']","['Division of Molecular Histopathology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (DDB1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HOXB1 homeodomain protein)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ALK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization/methods', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Markov Chains', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survivin']",2009/08/20 09:00,2010/01/13 06:00,['2009/08/20 09:00'],"['2009/08/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20701 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2009 Nov;48(11):1018-26. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20701.,,,,,,"['Copyright 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

According to cytogenetic-based risk stratification of de novo acute leukemia (AL), all patients had an unfavorable profile. JAK2 (V617F) mutational status was evaluated in five patients. In two of them, the JAK2 mutation was undetectable in blast cells (one with JAK2-positive ET), whereas in three both granulocytes and blast cells displayed the mutation. Treatment of BP was patient-based according to the performance status and co-morbidities and consisted of palliation in 14 patients, and of induction of remission in five. Median survival was 2.3 months (range 0.2-22.3), irrespective of the treatment received. In conclusion, this study indicates that AL evolved from ET has unfavorable clinical and biological features.

Only 93 patients (3.4% of total) had lower risk MDS (international prognostic scoring system low or intermediate 1) and deletion 5q; their median survival was 29 months (2-year survival 60%), and ranged from 13-41 months depending on the presence or absence of additional chromosomal abnormalities. Among 198 patients with MDS with deletion 5q and <10% blasts (a subset now often offered lenalidomide), the median survival was 12 months. Monosomy 5 was significantly more frequently associated with advanced MDS and with other chromosomal abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided baseline expectations of outcome in different MDS subsets and deletion 5q.","['Kantarjian, Hagop', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Abruzzo, Lynne', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Ravandi F', 'Borthakur G', 'Faderl S', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Abruzzo L', 'Pierce S', 'Shan J', 'Issa JP', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. hkantarj@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA108631/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1P50 CA100632-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', '*Monosomy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2009/08/20 09:00,2009/12/29 06:00,['2009/08/20 09:00'],"['2009/08/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.24575 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2009 Nov 15;115(22):5202-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.24575.,PMC2783477,['NIHMS140782'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, there was a long period of time between diagnosis and the initiation of imatinib therapy for many patients. This study aims to compare the major molecular remission (MMR) rates of early versus late imatinib therapy in chronic phase CML patients. METHODS: Between May 2002 and November 2007, 44 patients with chronic phase CML were treated with second-line imatinib therapy at the Hematology Unit of the Ophir Loyola Hospital (Belem, Para, Brazil). BCR-ABL transcript levels were measured at approximately six-month intervals using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The early treatment group presented a 60% probability of achieving MMR, while the probability for those patients who received late treatment was 40%. The probability of either not achieving MMR within one year of the initiation of imatinib therapy or losing MMR was higher in patients who received late treatment (79%), compared with patients who received early treatment (21%, odds ratio=5.75, P=0.012). The probability of maintaining MMR at 30 months of treatment was 80% in the early treatment group and 44% in the late treatment group (P=0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: For CML patients in the chronic phase who were treated with second-line imatinib therapy, the probability of achieving and maintaining MMR was higher in patients who received early treatment compared with those patients for whom the time interval between diagnosis and initiation of imatinib therapy was longer than one year.","['Scerni, Ana Carolina Costa', 'Alvares, Leonardo Azevedo', 'Beltrao, Ana Cristina', 'Bentes, Ie Regina', 'Azevedo, Tereza Cristina', 'Bentes, Alessandra Quinto', 'Lemos, Jose Alexandre Rodrigues']","['Scerni AC', 'Alvares LA', 'Beltrao AC', 'Bentes IR', 'Azevedo TC', 'Bentes AQ', 'Lemos JA']","['Universidade Federal do Para, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Belem/PA, Brazil.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Brazil,Clinics (Sao Paulo),"Clinics (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",101244734,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/08/20 09:00,2010/05/06 06:00,['2009/08/20 09:00'],"['2009/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1590/S1807-59322009000800004 [doi]'],ppublish,Clinics (Sao Paulo). 2009;64(8):731-4. doi: 10.1590/S1807-59322009000800004.,PMC2728184,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'CML', 'Imatinib', 'late treatment', 'major molecular remission']",,,,,,

However, specific data on individuals with a parental history are not available so far. METHODS: On the basis of the nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database including 18,207 primary invasive prostate cancers, standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to estimate the relative risks of subsequent tumours after prostate cancer in the general population and among individuals with a parental history of cancer. RESULTS: A significantly increased SIR of colorectal cancer was found among prostate cancer patients with a parental history of colorectal cancer (2.26, 11 cases). The SIRs of parental concordant (same site) tumours after prostate cancer were also increased for urinary bladder cancer (4.42, 4 cases) and chronic lymphoid leukaemia (38.0, 2 cases). CONCLUSION: A higher than additive and multiplicative interaction was observed between the individual history of prostate cancer and parental history of colorectal and urinary bladder cancers, although the number of cases did not permit the rejection of any interaction model. The results suggest that the occurrence of second tumours, for example bladder after prostate or prostate after bladder tumours, is mostly related to shared genetic and non-genetic risk factors rather than treatment of first cancer.","['Zhang, H', 'Bermejo, J L', 'Sundquist, J', 'Hemminki, K']","['Zhang H', 'Bermejo JL', 'Sundquist J', 'Hemminki K']","['Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg 69120, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090818,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Family', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology/*genetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Risk', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/etiology/genetics']",2009/08/20 09:00,2009/09/24 06:00,['2009/08/20 09:00'],"['2009/08/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['6605263 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6605263 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2009 Sep 15;101(6):935-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605263.

Probing phage-displayed peptide libraries, we identified and characterized mimetopes for Igs of 4 patients with IGHV mutated CLL (M-CLL) and 4 with IGHV unmutated CLL (U-CLL). Six of these mAbs were representatives of stereotyped B-cell receptors characteristic of CLL. We found that mimetic epitopes for U- and M-CLL Igs differed significantly. M-CLL-derived peptides exhibited better amino acid motifs, were more similar to each other, aligned more easily, and formed tighter clusters than U-CLL-derived peptides. Mono-, oligo-, and polyreactivity of peptides correlated with structural changes within antigen-binding sites of selecting M-CLL mAbs. Although M-CLL-isolated peptides and certain U-CLL mAbs bound more effectively to the selecting mAb, others were not as specific, reacting with M-CLL and U-CLL mAbs; these data suggest that in vivo structurally diverse epitopes could bind smIgs of distinct CLL clones, thereby altering survival and growth. Finally, an M-CLL-derived peptide inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, binding of its homologous mAb to human B lymphocytes; therefore peptides that inhibit or alter the consequences of antigen-smIg interactions may represent therapeutic modalities in CLL.","['Seiler, Till', 'Woelfle, Manuela', 'Yancopoulos, Sophia', 'Catera, Rosa', 'Li, Wentian', 'Hatzi, Katerina', 'Moreno, Carol', 'Torres, Marcela', 'Paul, Santanu', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Kaufman, Matthew S', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Chu, Charles C', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas']","['Seiler T', 'Woelfle M', 'Yancopoulos S', 'Catera R', 'Li W', 'Hatzi K', 'Moreno C', 'Torres M', 'Paul S', 'Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Kaufman MS', 'Kolitz JE', 'Allen SL', 'Rai KR', 'Chu CC', 'Chiorazzi N']","['The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-Long Island Jewish (LIJ) Health System, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA.']",['eng'],"['M01 RR018535/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA081554/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA81554/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090818,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Autoantibodies/*immunology', 'Biomimetics', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/genetics/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology/pharmacology', 'Peptide Library', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*immunology']",2009/08/20 09:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/08/20 09:00'],"['2009/08/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36738-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-01-197822 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Oct 22;114(17):3615-24. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-01-197822.

Therefore, we used the human Jurkat T cell leukemia cell line as a model system and performed large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomic analyses of TCR signaling. We identified 10,665 unique phosphorylation sites, of which 696 showed TCR-responsive changes. In addition, we analyzed broad trends in phosphorylation data sets to uncover underlying mechanisms associated with T cell activation. We found that, upon stimulation of the TCR, phosphorylation events extensively targeted protein modules involved in all of the salient phenomena associated with T cell activation: patterning of surface proteins, endocytosis of the TCR, formation of the F-actin cup, inside-out activation of integrins, polarization of microtubules, production of cytokines, and alternative splicing of messenger RNA. Further, case-by-case analysis of TCR-responsive phosphorylation sites on proteins belonging to relevant functional modules together with network analysis allowed us to deduce that serine-threonine (S-T) phosphorylation modulated protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in a system-wide fashion. We also provide experimental support for this inference by showing that phosphorylation of tubulin on six distinct serine residues abrogated PPIs during the assembly of microtubules. We propose that modulation of PPIs by stimulus-dependent changes in S-T phosphorylation state is a widespread phenomenon applicable to many other signaling systems.","['Mayya, Viveka', 'Lundgren, Deborah H', 'Hwang, Sun-Il', 'Rezaul, Karim', 'Wu, Linfeng', 'Eng, Jimmy K', 'Rodionov, Vladimir', 'Han, David K']","['Mayya V', 'Lundgren DH', 'Hwang SI', 'Rezaul K', 'Wu L', 'Eng JK', 'Rodionov V', 'Han DK']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, 06030, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL067569/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL 67569/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL 70694/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090818,United States,Sci Signal,Science signaling,101465400,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Biological Transport', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Endocytosis', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Microtubules/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphoproteins/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Mapping/methods', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'RNA Splicing', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Serine/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Threonine/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/genetics/metabolism']",2009/08/20 09:00,2009/10/27 06:00,['2009/08/20 09:00'],"['2009/08/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['2/84/ra46 [pii]', '10.1126/scisignal.2000007 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Signal. 2009 Aug 18;2(84):ra46. doi: 10.1126/scisignal.2000007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, RCA has been associated with significant metabolic complications including hypocalcemia, hypernatremia, metabolic alkalosis, and citrate toxicity. OBJECTIVE: To describe our experience with a newly implemented RCA protocol with acid citrate dextrose formula A (ACD-A) and intravenous calcium gluconate, for use with PrismaFlex CRRT in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted from May 1, 2006, until May 1, 2007, in a 16-bed medical-surgical university-affiliated intensive care unit. Data collected included dialysis filter life, patient and circuit metabolic parameters, and units of packed red blood cells transfused. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients received dialysis with citrate (n = 178 filters). Circuit clotting occurred in 24% of all filters. Mean +/- SD filter life was 38.4 +/- 25.9 hours, and filter survival at 48 hours was 38.2%. Persistent metabolic alkalosis while on CRRT was identified in 6 of 45 (13.3%) patients. Mild hypocalcemia (ionized calcium <3.6 mg/dL) occurred in 11 (23%) patients, but no patient had an ionized calcium level less than 2.8 mg/dL.

The specific molecular mechanisms underlying this effect remain to be elucidated. We examined whether 15d-PGJ(2) has antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo, and investigated the underlying mechanism. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We examined 15d-PGJ(2)-induced apoptosis in human leukemia cells in the context of mitochondrial injury, oxidative damage, and signaling pathway disturbances. In addition, we investigated the antitumor effect of 15d-PGJ(2) in a mouse CT-26 s.c. tumor model and HL-60 leukemia xenograft model. RESULTS: 15d-PGJ(2) induced apoptosis in leukemia and colorectal cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner and led to generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through mitochondria and NADPH oxidase activation, activation of JNK, and inactivation of Akt, a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase. Constitutive activation of Akt for an engineered myristoylated protein prevented 15d-PGJ(2)-mediated apoptosis but not ROS generation. Collectively, these findings suggest a hierarchical model of apoptosis induced by 15d-PGJ(2) in human leukemia cells: oxidative injury represents a primary event resulting in Akt inactivation, which in turn leads to mitochondrial injury and apoptosis. Moreover, 15d-PGJ(2) markedly reduced growth of mouse CT-26 s.c. tumors and HL-60 xenograft tumors and down-regulated p-Akt and Akt expression in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Akt inactivation through ROS production may contribute to 15d-PGJ(2)-induced apoptosis in leukemia and colorectal cancer cell lines and that 15d-PGJ(2) may have therapeutic relevance in the treatment of human leukemia and colorectal cancer.","['Shin, Sung-Won', 'Seo, Chi-Yeon', 'Han, Hoon', 'Han, Jin-Yeong', 'Jeong, Jin-Sook', 'Kwak, Jong-Young', 'Park, Joo-In']","['Shin SW', 'Seo CY', 'Han H', 'Han JY', 'Jeong JS', 'Kwak JY', 'Park JI']","['Department of Biochemistry, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan, South Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090818,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (15-deoxyprostaglandin J2)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidases/drug effects/metabolism', 'PPAR gamma/metabolism', 'Prostaglandin D2/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/agonists/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/08/20 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/20 09:00'],"['2009/08/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-3101 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-3101 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Sep 1;15(17):5414-25. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-3101.

C/EBPbeta is involved in tissue-specific gene expression and thereby takes part in fundamental cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation. Here, we show that the activity of C/EBPbeta is negatively regulated by the transcriptional co-repressor Daxx. C/EBPbeta was found to directly interact with Daxx after overexpression as well as on the endogenous level. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays showed that Daxx binds via amino acids 190-400 to the C-terminal part of C/EBPbeta. Co-expression of C/EBPbeta changed the sub-nuclear Daxx distribution pattern from predominantly POD-localized to nucleoplasmic. Daxx suppressed basal and p300-enhanced transcriptional activity of C/EBPbeta. Furthermore, Daxx decreased the C/EBPbeta-dependent phosphorylation of p300, which in turn was associated with a diminished level of p300-mediated C/EBPbeta acetylation. Co-expression of promyelocytic leukemia protein abrogated the repressive effect of Daxx on C/EBPbeta as well as the direct interaction of Daxx and C/EBPbeta, presumably by re-recruiting Daxx to PML-oncogenic domains. In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells, C/EBPbeta activity is known to be required for all-trans-retinoic acid-induced cell differentiation and disease remission. We show that all-trans-retinoic acid as well as arsenic trioxide treatment leads to a reduced C/EBPbeta fraction associated with Daxx suggesting a relief of Daxx-dependent C/EBPbeta repression as an important molecular event leading to APL cell differentiation. Overall, our data identify Daxx as a new negative regulator of C/EBPbeta and provide first clues for a link between abrogation of Daxx-C/EBPbeta complex formation and APL remission.","['Wethkamp, Nils', 'Klempnauer, Karl-Heinz']","['Wethkamp N', 'Klempnauer KH']","['Institut fur Biochemie, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat Munster, Wilhelm-Klemm-Strasse 2, Munster D-48149, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090818,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Quail', 'Tretinoin/metabolism', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2009/08/20 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/20 09:00'],"['2009/08/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)38246-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.041186 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Oct 16;284(42):28783-94. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.041186.

Yet the origin, rationale for possessing both a slow-acting (FasL) and a fast-acting (perforin) killing mechanism has remained enigmatic. Here we have investigated perforin expression in CTL directly involved in acute tumour (i.e. leukaemias EL4 and L1210) allograft rejection occurring within the peritoneal cavity. We show that at the height of the immune response, the majority of conjugate-forming CD8(+) CTL express high levels of perforin messenger RNA and protein, and kill essentially via perforin. Later however, coinciding with complete rejection, fully cytocidal CTL emerge which exhibit a stark decrease in perforin and now kill preferentially via constitutively expressed FasL. Although late in emergence, and persistent, these powerful CTL are neither effector-memory nor memory CTL. This finding has implications for the monitoring of anti-transplant responses in clinical settings, based on assessing perforin expression in graft infiltrating CD8(+) T cells. The results show that as the immune response progresses in vivo, targeted cellular suicide mainly prunes high perforin-expressing CD8(+) cells, resulting in the gradual switch in effector CTL, from mostly perforin-based to largely Fas/FasL-based killers. Hence, two kinds of CD8(+) CTL have two killing strategies.","['Meiraz, Avihai', 'Garber, Orit Gal', 'Harari, Shaul', 'Hassin, David', 'Berke, Gideon']","['Meiraz A', 'Garber OG', 'Harari S', 'Hassin D', 'Berke G']","['Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Fas Ligand Protein/immunology', 'Graft Rejection/immunology', 'Immunologic Memory/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Perforin/deficiency/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",2009/08/20 09:00,2009/11/05 06:00,['2009/08/20 09:00'],"['2009/08/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['IMM3072 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2567.2009.03072.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunology. 2009 Sep;128(1):69-82. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2567.2009.03072.x.,PMC2747140,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The peanut allergen, Ara h 1, belongs to the cupin plant food allergen family, which, unlike other structural families, appears to be broken down rapidly following gastrointestinal digestion. OBJECTIVE: Using Ara h 1 as a model allergen, the ability of digested protein to sensitize has been investigated. METHODS: Ara h 1 was purified from whole roasted peanuts. Intact Ara h 1 was digested in an in vitro model, simulating the human gastrointestinal digestion process. Digestion products were analysed for peptide sizes and their ability to aggregate. Brown Norway (BN) rats, used as an animal model, were immunized with purified intact Ara h 1 or the gastrointestinal digestion products thereof. The sensitizing capacity was evaluated by analyses of specific antibody (IgG1, IgG2a and IgE) responses and ability to trigger mediator release of rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL)-2H3 cells. RESULTS: The present study showed that Ara h 1 was broken down, resulting in peptide fragments of sizes<2.0 kDa, of which approximately 50% was in aggregated complexes of Mr up to 20 kDa. Ara h 1 digesta were shown to have sensitizing capacity in BN rats, being capable of inducing specific IgG and IgE antibodies. The IgE response was functional, having the capacity to induce specific degranulation of RBL cells. CONCLUSION: From this study, it can be concluded that lability of a food allergen to gastrointestinal digestion does not necessarily abrogate its allergenic sensitizing potential.","['Bogh, K L', 'Kroghsbo, S', 'Dahl, L', 'Rigby, N M', 'Barkholt, V', 'Mills, E N C', 'Madsen, C B']","['Bogh KL', 'Kroghsbo S', 'Dahl L', 'Rigby NM', 'Barkholt V', 'Mills EN', 'Madsen CB']","['Department of Toxicology and Risk Assessment, National Food Institute, Technical University of Denmark, Soborg, Denmark. kalb@food.dtu.dk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090818,England,Clin Exp Allergy,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,8906443,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, Plant)', '0 (Ara h 1 protein, Arachis hypogaea)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Plant Proteins)']",IM,"['Allergens/chemistry/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity/*immunology', 'Antigens, Plant', 'Cell Line', 'Digestion/*immunology', 'Glycoproteins/chemistry/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Peanut Hypersensitivity/*immunology', 'Peptides/chemistry/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Plant Proteins/chemistry/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Rats']",2009/08/20 09:00,2010/02/18 06:00,['2009/08/20 09:00'],"['2009/08/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['CEA3333 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2222.2009.03333.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Allergy. 2009 Oct;39(10):1611-21. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2222.2009.03333.x.

Due to the side effects of the original immunotoxins, they were only considered for the treatment of cancer as in these cases, the potential favourable effect outweighed the unwanted toxic side effects. Over time, many improvements in the construction of immunotoxins have been implemented that circumvent, or at least strongly diminish, the side effects. In consequence this opens the way to employ these immunotoxins for the treatment of non-life threatening diseases. One such category of disease could be the many chronic inflammatory disorders in which an uncontrolled interaction between inflammatory cells leads to chronicity. In several of these chronic conditions, activated macrophages, which are characterised by an increased expression of CD64, are known to play a key role. In this review we discuss the data presently available on elimination of activated macrophages through CD64 immunotoxins in several animal models for chronic disease. A chemically linked complete antibody with the plant toxin Ricin-A, proved very effective and provided proof of concept. Subsequently, the development towards genetically engineered, fully human, multivalent single chain based immunotoxins that have diminished immunogenicity, is discussed. The data show that the specific elimination of activated macrophages through CD64 is indeed beneficial for the course of disease. As opposed to other methods used to inactivate or eliminate macrophages, with the CD64 based immunotoxins only the activated population is killed. This may open the way to apply these immunotoxins as therapeutics in chronic inflammatory disease.","['Thepen, T', 'Huhn, M', 'Melmer, G', 'Tur, M K', 'Barth, S']","['Thepen T', 'Huhn M', 'Melmer G', 'Tur MK', 'Barth S']","['Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology, Department of Pharmacetical Product Development, 52074 Aachen, Germany.

Among various human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), we have focused on HERV-R. To investigate the biological roles of HERV-R, we earlier established transgenic rats carrying the full sequence of the viral genome. In these HERV-R rats, however, no disease occurred. Another trigger that induces autoimmunity may be essential for the recognition of HERV-R products by the immune system. Thus, in this study, we mated HERV-R rats with env-pX rats (transgenic rats carrying the env-pX gene of human T cell leukemia virus type I) that develop autoimmune diseases, and generated double transgenic (DTG) rats. In DTG rats, autoimmune diseases occurred similarly in env-pX rats. Interestingly, deposition of rat IgM but not IgG was observed on the glomerular endothelial cells. Such IgM deposition was never seen in the parental HERV-R or env-pX rats. We considered that in situ formation of immune complexes consisted of the HERV-R env glycoprotein and anti-HERV-R env IgM antibodies (Abs) in DTG rats, according to the following evidence: (1) No dense deposit, representing deposition of circulating immune complexes, was seen on glomerular endothelial cells.

Successes of several marketed and clinical trial Abl inhibitors against leukemia and other cancers and appearances of reduced efficacies and drug resistances have led to significant interest in and efforts for developing new Abl inhibitors. In silico methods of pharmacophore, fragment, and molecular docking have been used in some of these efforts. It is desirable to explore other in silico methods capable of searching large compound libraries at high yields and reduced false-hit rates. We evaluated support vector machines (SVM) as a virtual screening tool for searching Abl inhibitors from large compound libraries. SVM trained and tested by 708 inhibitors and 65,494 putative noninhibitors correctly identified 84.4 to 92.3% inhibitors and 99.96 to 99.99% noninhibitors in 5-fold cross validation studies. SVM trained by 708 pre-2008 inhibitors and 65 494 putative noninhibitors correctly identified 50.5% of the 91 inhibitors reported since 2008 and predicted as inhibitors 29,072 (0.21%) of 13.56M PubChem, 659 (0.39%) of 168K MDDR, and 330 (5.0%) of 6638 MDDR compounds similar to the known inhibitors. SVM showed comparable yields and substantially reduced false-hit rates against two similarity based and another machine learning VS methods based on the same training and testing data sets and molecular descriptors. These suggest that SVM is capable of searching Abl inhibitors from large compound libraries at low false-hit rates.","['Liu, X H', 'Ma, X H', 'Tan, C Y', 'Jiang, Y Y', 'Go, M L', 'Low, B C', 'Chen, Y Z']","['Liu XH', 'Ma XH', 'Tan CY', 'Jiang YY', 'Go ML', 'Low BC', 'Chen YZ']","['Bioinformatics and Drug Design Group, Department of Pharmacy, Centre for Computational Science and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Blk S16, Level 8, 3 Science Drive 2, Singapore 117543.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Chem Inf Model,Journal of chemical information and modeling,101230060,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['*Artificial Intelligence', 'Databases, Factual', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/*methods', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*analysis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*User-Computer Interface']",2009/08/20 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/20 09:00'],"['2009/08/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ci900135u [doi]'],ppublish,J Chem Inf Model. 2009 Sep;49(9):2101-10. doi: 10.1021/ci900135u.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Data of all adult patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia from January 1984 to December 2003 were collected retrospectively. Univariate and multivariate analysis for time to progression and overall survival were performed. RESULTS: The incidence of acute myeloid leukemia in the adult population in southern Switzerland is 2.6/100,000 per year. Complete clinical and pathological data and follow-up information were available for 128 patients. The median age was 67 years (range, 18 to 94). The median follow-up was 97 months. Median overall survival was 6 months, with a 2-year overall survival of 16%. Median time to progression was 3 months. Thirty-five patients (median age, 80 years) were given best supportive care and/or palliative chemotherapy. The median survival in this subset was 2 months. Of the 93 patients treated with a curative intent, 48 were older than 60 years. The complete remission rate after induction chemotherapy was 80% for patients younger than 60 years and 31% for those older than 60 years (P < 0.0001). Overall survival at 2 years was 40% and 12%, respectively (P < 0.0005). The relapse rate was 61%, and only 28% of the patients who were given reinduction chemotherapy reached a second complete remission. Of the patients treated with curative intent, 52% were treated in a clinical trial. Their median age was significantly lower than those not included in a trial: 57 vs 66 years (P < 00001). Patients treated in a trial had a significantly better prognosis than those not so treated (median survival, 12 vs 6 months). Patients treated with high-dose cytarabine as first-line therapy (given to 25 of 93 patients treated with a curative intent) had a better survival than those given standard cytarabine doses (P < 0.0005). The outcome of the patients treated after 1993 was significantly better (P = 0.026) than that of the previously treated cohort. In multivariate analysis (not including cytogenetic data), only age (P = 0.005), performance status > 1 (P = 0.001) and treatment given before/after 1993 (P = 0.044) were found to be independent prognostic factors for both overall survival and time to progression. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with acute myeloid leukemia are older than 60 years, and their outcome is still disappointing. For younger patients, the prognosis is better if they receive high-dose cytarabine as post-remission therapy and if they are treated in the setting of a clinical trial.","['Lerch, Erika', 'Espeli, Vittoria', 'Zucca, Emanuele', 'Leoncini, Leda', 'Scali, Giancarlo', 'Mora, Oreste', 'Bordoni, Andrea', 'Cavalli, Franco', 'Ghielmini, Michele']","['Lerch E', 'Espeli V', 'Zucca E', 'Leoncini L', 'Scali G', 'Mora O', 'Bordoni A', 'Cavalli F', 'Ghielmini M']","['Istituto Oncologico della Svizzera Italiana (IOSI), Bellinzona, Switzerland.

To detect this complication (CNS-LCH) early and to evaluate the potential efficacy of therapeutic interventions, biomarkers detecting and measuring ongoing neurodegeneration would be valuable. We evaluated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of ongoing neurodegeneration in CNS-LCH patients. PROCEDURE: Nine patients with endocrine, neuromotor, cognitive or/and behavioral abnormalities as well as neuroradiological evidence of CNS-LCH were evaluated 4-12 years after LCH diagnosis for CSF levels of neurofilament protein light chain (NF-L), glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAp), and total tau protein (TAU). Two patients were analyzed longitudinally. One hundred ten children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) served as controls. RESULTS: NF-L, TAU, and GFAp levels were elevated in four, six, and eight of nine patients studied, respectively. NF-L (P < 0.001) and GFAp (P < 0.001) were higher in patients than in controls (TAU not analyzed in controls). The patient with most severe clinical and neuroradiological CNS-LCH displayed the highest levels of NF-L and GFAp whereas three patients without signs of systemic disease had low TAU levels and normal/slightly elevated NF-L. NF-L tended to be higher at radiological progression of neurodegeneration than at status quo (P = 0.07). Notably, we experienced frequent lumbar puncture complications in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: CSF levels of NF-L, TAU, and GFAp appear to be elevated in CNS-LCH. It would be valuable if these markers were validated in order to serve as markers for early CNS-LCH, to monitor disease progression and to evaluate various treatment attempts for CNS-LCH.","['Gavhed, Desiree', 'Akefeldt, Selma Olsson', 'Osterlundh, Gustaf', 'Laurencikas, Evaldas', 'Hjorth, Lars', 'Blennow, Kaj', 'Rosengren, Lars', 'Henter, Jan-Inge']","['Gavhed D', 'Akefeldt SO', 'Osterlundh G', 'Laurencikas E', 'Hjorth L', 'Blennow K', 'Rosengren L', 'Henter JI']","['Department of Woman and Child Health, Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Karolinska University Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Neurofilament Proteins)', '0 (neurofilament protein L)', '0 (tau Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers', 'Brain/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition Disorders/cerebrospinal fluid/etiology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Histiocytosis, Langerhans-Cell/*cerebrospinal fluid/complications/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofilament Proteins/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Pituitary Diseases/cerebrospinal fluid/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Radiography', 'Spinal Puncture/adverse effects', 'Young Adult', 'tau Proteins/*cerebrospinal fluid']",2009/08/19 09:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/08/19 09:00'],"['2009/08/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22238 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Dec 15;53(7):1264-70. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22238.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Patients (1,638) were enrolled in CCG 1961 from November 1996 to May 2002. Weight was measured as BMI percent (%), specific for age and gender, and defined as 100 x ln(BMI/median BMI). RESULTS: By the end of treatment, 23% of children were obese (BMI >or=95%), compared with 14% at diagnosis. Children who received post-induction intensified therapy (arms C, D, SER with Doxorubicin or Idarubicin) had higher gastrointestinal toxicities and lower BMI% from consolidation through interim maintenance 1. BMI% then increased for all arms between delayed intensification and maintenance 1 or 2. Children who were of Black or Hispanic race, obese at diagnosis, or who had grade 3 or 4 pancreatitis/glucose toxicities during induction had higher BMI% throughout treatment. Children were more likely to be obese at the end of the study if they were aged 5-9 years at diagnosis or female gender. Cranial radiation was not a predictor of obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Successful treatment of higher risk childhood ALL was associated with obesity, independent of cranial irradiation. The beginning of maintenance therapy may be the best time to intervene with nutritional and behavioral interventions, particularly for children who are obese or aged 5-9 years at diagnosis, female, Black or Hispanic, or those with metabolic toxicities during induction.","['Withycombe, Janice S', 'Post-White, Janice E', 'Meza, Jane L', 'Hawks, Ria G', 'Smith, Lynette M', 'Sacks, Nancy', 'Seibel, Nita L']","['Withycombe JS', 'Post-White JE', 'Meza JL', 'Hawks RG', 'Smith LM', 'Sacks N', 'Seibel NL']","[""Children's Cancer and Blood Disorder Center, South Carolina Cancer Center, Columbia, South Carolina, USA.""]",['eng'],"['U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/chemically induced', 'Glucose Intolerance/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Obesity/epidemiology/etiology', 'Pancreatitis/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*epidemiology/radiotherapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Weight Gain', 'Weight Loss', 'Young Adult']",2009/08/19 09:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/08/19 09:00'],"['2009/08/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22237 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Dec 15;53(7):1249-54. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22237.,PMC3044478,['NIHMS144355'],,,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

We searched for objective, easily measurable indicators for MBI in children with cancer. PURPOSE: In children with acute myeloid leukemia, various MBI-related clinical and laboratory tests were investigated, reflecting clinical severity (NCI symptomatic adverse events criteria (gold standard), daily gut score (DGS)), inflammation (plasma and fecal interleukin-8 (IL-8), fecal calprotectin), enterocytic loss (plasma citrulline, ratio fecal human DNA/total DNA) and intestinal permeability (sugar absorption tests). RESULTS: Intestinal MBI as detected by the NCI adverse events criteria was found in 55% of chemotherapy cycles, correlating well with the continuous DGS (n = 55, rho = 0.581; P < 0.001). Intestinal cell loss as measured by the ratio fecal human DNA/total DNA and plasma citrulline correlated well with both NCI criteria (n = 61, rho = 0.357, P = 0.005 resp. n = 58, rho = -0.482; P < 0.001) and DGS (n = 54, rho = 0.352, P = 0.009 resp. n = 55, rho = -0.625; P < 0.001). Plasma IL-8 correlated strongly to plasma citrulline (n = 46, rho = -0.627; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: MBI was reflected by parameters indicating inflammation (IL-8) and cell loss (plasma citrulline, ratio fecal human DNA/total DNA). We conclude that plasma citrulline might be a good parameter for MBI. Further studies are needed to show whether plasma citrulline can be used as a marker for MBI in future research.","['van Vliet, Michel J', 'Tissing, Wim J E', 'Rings, Edmond H H M', 'Koetse, Harma A', 'Stellaard, Frans', 'Kamps, Willem A', 'de Bont, Eveline S J M']","['van Vliet MJ', 'Tissing WJ', 'Rings EH', 'Koetse HA', 'Stellaard F', 'Kamps WA', 'de Bont ES']","[""Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '29VT07BGDA (Citrulline)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Amsacrine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Carbohydrates/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Citrulline/*blood', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'DNA/analysis/isolation & purification', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Enterocytes/chemistry/pathology', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Feces/chemistry', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-8/analysis/blood', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex/analysis', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Models, Biological', 'Mucositis/chemically induced/*diagnosis/metabolism', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced/diagnosis/metabolism']",2009/08/19 09:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/08/19 09:00'],"['2009/08/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22210 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Dec 15;53(7):1188-94. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22210.,,,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Dec 15;53(7):1169-70.

Four dose-range groups were selected for statistical analysis (0-2.9, 3-9.9, 10-99.9 and 100-313.3 mGy). The risk of leukemia was significantly increased (-2.4 [95%CI: 1.4-4.0]) among those with radiation exposure doses higher than 10 mGy (p = 0.01). The association between radiation exposure and risk was stronger among males (-2.8 [95%CI: 1.4-5.5, p = 0.01]), and for cases of acute leukemia that were diagnosed during the period from 1987 to 1992 (-2.5 [95%CI: 1.2-5.1, p = 0.05]), particularly acute myeloid leukemia (-5.8 [95%CI: 1.4-24.6, p = 0.05]). The influence of possible confounders and methods of selecting controls on the leukemia risk assessment was analyzed. The evaluated risk per unit dose is discussed.","['Noshchenko, Andriy G', 'Bondar, Oleksandra Y', 'Drozdova, Vira D']","['Noshchenko AG', 'Bondar OY', 'Drozdova VD']","['Department of Environmental Sciences, National University, Kiev, Ukraine. noshchenko@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Radioactive Hazard Release', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Ukraine/epidemiology']",2009/08/19 09:00,2010/06/23 06:00,['2009/08/19 09:00'],"['2009/08/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24834 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2010 Jul 15;127(2):412-26. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24834.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because isolated testicular relapse often precedes hematological relapse, systemic therapy is required in addition to local therapy. However, a rationale for the use of a combination of systemic chemotherapy and local therapy is unclear. A 12-year-old boy with T-ALL suffered from isolated testicular relapse at 27 months after diagnosis. He was successfully treated with systemic chemotherapy with orchiectomy and prophylactic irradiation to the contralateral testis. We retrospectively estimated the minimal residual disease in the bone marrow (BM) and the testis by detection of clone-specific T-cell receptor rearrangement of leukemic cells. We detected leukemic cells in the affected testis at relapse, as well as in the BM at initial diagnosis. In addition, we confirmed submicroscopic disease in the unaffected testis and the BM at relapse. We conclude that molecular analysis could reveal the submicroscopic disease in the patient with apparently isolated testicular relapse. This finding may provide a rationale for intensified systemic treatment of patients with isolated testicular relapse.","['Arima, Keitaro', 'Hasegawa, Daisuke', 'Ogawa, Chitose', 'Kato, Itaru', 'Imamura, Toshihiro', 'Takusagawa, Ayako', 'Takahashi, Hiroka', 'Kitagawa, Yoshiro', 'Hori, Toshinari', 'Tsurusawa, Masahito', 'Manabe, Atsushi', 'Hosoya, Ryota']","['Arima K', 'Hasegawa D', 'Ogawa C', 'Kato I', 'Imamura T', 'Takusagawa A', 'Takahashi H', 'Kitagawa Y', 'Hori T', 'Tsurusawa M', 'Manabe A', 'Hosoya R']","[""Department of Pediatrics, St. Luke's International Hospital, 9-1 Akashi-cho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-8560, Japan."", ""Department of Pediatrics, St. Luke's International Hospital, 9-1 Akashi-cho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-8560, Japan. hase-dai@umin.net."", ""Department of Pediatrics, St. Luke's International Hospital, 9-1 Akashi-cho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-8560, Japan."", ""Department of Pediatrics, St. Luke's International Hospital, 9-1 Akashi-cho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-8560, Japan."", ""Department of Pediatrics, St. Luke's International Hospital, 9-1 Akashi-cho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-8560, Japan."", ""Department of Pediatrics, St. Luke's International Hospital, 9-1 Akashi-cho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-8560, Japan."", ""Department of Pediatrics, St. Luke's International Hospital, 9-1 Akashi-cho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-8560, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Aichi Medical University, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aichi Medical University, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aichi Medical University, Aichi, Japan.', ""Department of Pediatrics, St. Luke's International Hospital, 9-1 Akashi-cho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-8560, Japan."", ""Department of Pediatrics, St. Luke's International Hospital, 9-1 Akashi-cho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-8560, Japan.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090818,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/pathology', 'Orchiectomy', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Testicular Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology/surgery', 'Testis/*pathology/surgery', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",2009/08/19 09:00,2010/04/09 06:00,['2009/08/19 09:00'],"['2008/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/01 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-009-0393-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-009-0393-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2009 Oct;90(3):370-373. doi: 10.1007/s12185-009-0393-3.

In particular, several studies have reported that the PIM-1 gene is associated with the development of lymphoma, leukemia and prostate cancer. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the association between the single nucleotide polymorphisms in the PIM-1 gene and the risk of lung cancer occurrence in the Korean population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To evaluate the role of the PIM-1 gene in the development of lung cancer, the genotypes of the PIM-1 gene were determined in 408 lung cancer patients and 410 normal subjects. RESULTS: We found that the T-C-T-C haplotypes of the PIM-1 gene (-1196 T>C, IVS4 +55 T>C, IVS4 +1416 T>A and +3684 C>A) were associated with an increased risk of lung cancer [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.98; 95% CI: 1.24 approximately 12.75, p-value: 0.020]. In particular, these haplotypes showed an increased risk of lung cancer in males (aOR: 5.67; 95% CI: 1.32~24.30, p-value: 0.019) and smokers (aOR: 7.82; 95% CI: 1.75 approximately 34.98, p-value: 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that the T-C-T-C haplotype of the PIM-1 gene could influence the risk of developing smoking-related lung cancer in the Korean population. Additional functional studies with an larger sample sized analysis are warranted to reconfirm our findings.","['Kim, Dae Sik', 'Sung, Jae Sook', 'Shin, Eun Soon', 'Ryu, Jeong-Seon', 'Choi, In Keun', 'Park, Kyong Hwa', 'Park, Yong', 'Kim, Eui Bae', 'Park, Seh Jong', 'Kim, Yeul Hong']","['Kim DS', 'Sung JS', 'Shin ES', 'Ryu JS', 'Choi IK', 'Park KH', 'Park Y', 'Kim EB', 'Park SJ', 'Kim YH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20081231,Korea (South),Cancer Res Treat,Cancer research and treatment,101155137,,,,2009/08/19 09:00,2009/08/19 09:01,['2009/08/19 09:00'],"['2008/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/19 09:01 [medline]']",['10.4143/crt.2008.40.4.190 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Res Treat. 2008 Dec;40(4):190-6. doi: 10.4143/crt.2008.40.4.190.

We measured the clinical correlation between brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 2005 and March 2007, 86 patients with acute leukemia, malignant lymphoma, or multiple myeloma receiving systemic chemotherapy with anthracycline were enrolled in the Department of Hemato-oncology, Kosin University Gospel Hospital. We investigated the relationship between BNP level and cardiotoxicity through echocardiography, electrocardiography, BNP levels, and symptoms of heart failure at each chemotherapy cycle. RESULTS: Of the 86 participants (mean age, 48.5 years; range 20 approximately 65 years), cardiotoxicity developed in 21 patients (24.4%), with 2 patients showing arrhythmia only, 17 patients with transient aspects of heart failure, and 2 patients with chronic heart failure. Cardiotoxicity related to serum BNP level, age, cumulative dose of anthracycline, accompanying chronic disease, and elevated level of troponin-I. Heart failure was more common if BNP levels reached 100 pg/ml at least once. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical correlation between BNP and cardiotoxicity was significant in patients with systemic anthracycline chemotherapy.

Data from Hes1 deficient mice suggested that Hes1, like Notch1, is necessary for the progression of early T cell progenitors. Constitutive activation of Notch is known to cause T cell leukemia or lymphoma but whether Hes1 has any oncogenic activity is not known. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We generated mice carrying a Hes1 transgene under control of the proximal promote of the lck gene. Hes1 expression led to a reduction in numbers of total thymocytes, concomitant with the increased percentage and number of immature CD8+ (ISP) T cells and sustained CD25 expression in CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) thymocytes. Hes1 transgenic mice develop thymic lymphomas at about 20 weeks of age with a low penetrance. However, expression of Hes1 significantly shortens the latency of T cell lymphoma developed in Id1 transgenic mice, where the function of bHLH E proteins is inhibited. Interestingly, Hes1 increased expression of a subset of Notch target genes in pre-malignant ISP and DP thymocytes, which include Notch1, Notch3 and c-myc, thus suggesting a possible mechanism for lymphomagenesis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We have demonstrated for the first time that Hes1 potentiates T cell lymphomagenesis, by up-regulating a subset of Notch target genes and by causing an accumulation of ISP thymocytes particularly vulnerable to oncogenic transformation.","['Dudley, Darryll D', 'Wang, Hong-Cheng', 'Sun, Xiao-Hong']","['Dudley DD', 'Wang HC', 'Sun XH']","['Immunobiology and Cancer Research Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI56129/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI056129/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32-AI07633/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA077553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007633/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090818,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Hes1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Transcription Factor HES-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'DNA Primers', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*physiology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Notch/*physiology', 'Transcription Factor HES-1', '*Up-Regulation']",2009/08/19 09:00,2010/01/20 06:00,['2009/08/19 09:00'],"['2009/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0006678 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Aug 18;4(8):e6678. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0006678.,PMC2722736,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study examined the distribution pattern of C7orf24 mRNA in rat tissues using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization histochemistry. The RT-PCR experiments demonstrated that C7orf24 and a variant C7orf24 mRNA were expressed in various tissues. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed significantly high levels of both C7orf24 mRNAs in the liver and kidney, compared with other tissues examined.

Principally, mastocytosis should be divided in 2 main subentities: cutaneous mastocytosis and systemic mastocytosis mainly involving the bone marrow. Mastocytosis is a morphologic diagnosis and should not be diagnosed on the basis of clinical findings alone. Pathologists need to be aware of the disease and its mimickers. Application of the defined diagnostic criteria can confirm or exclude mastocytosis in most cases. Use of antibodies against tryptase, CD117 (KIT), and CD25 is recommended in every suspected case. Because most cases of systemic mastocytosis show a very low degree of infiltration of the bone marrow, antitryptase and anti-CD117 are of major importance for screening and quantification of mast cells, in particular to detect even small compact infiltrates as the only major diagnostic criterion for mastocytosis. Expression of CD25 on mast cells is defined as a minor diagnostic criterion and is usually seen only in mastocytosis but not in reactive states of mast cell hyperplasia.","['Horny, Hans-Peter']",['Horny HP'],"['Institute of Pathology, D-91522 Ansbach, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Congresses as Topic', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Middle Aged']",2009/08/19 09:00,2009/09/05 06:00,['2009/08/19 09:00'],"['2009/08/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['132/3/438 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCPPXHMN5CJOXHZ [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2009 Sep;132(3):438-47. doi: 10.1309/AJCPPXHMN5CJOXHZ.,,,,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cooccupancy with FOG-1, SCL, and MTA-2 was found at all regions of GATA-1 binding, with cooccupancy of SCL and MTA-2 also found at regions of NF-E2 binding. Cooccupancy of GATA-1 and NF-E2 was found frequently. A common signature of histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 4, GATA-1, NF-E2, FOG-1, SCL, and MTA-2 binding and consensus GATA-1-E-box binding motifs located 34 to 90 bp away from NF-E2 binding motifs was found frequently in erythroid cell-expressed genes. These results provide insights into our understanding of membrane protein gene regulation in erythropoiesis and the regulation of complex genetic loci in erythroid and nonerythroid cells and identify numerous candidate regions for mutations associated with membrane-linked hemolytic anemia.","['Steiner, Laurie A', 'Maksimova, Yelena', 'Schulz, Vincent', 'Wong, Clara', 'Raha, Debasish', 'Mahajan, Milind C', 'Weissman, Sherman M', 'Gallagher, Patrick G']","['Steiner LA', 'Maksimova Y', 'Schulz V', 'Wong C', 'Raha D', 'Mahajan MC', 'Weissman SM', 'Gallagher PG']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, P.O.

To dissect their role in FLT3-ITD-mediated transformation, we performed bone marrow reconstitution assays. Unexpectedly, FLT3-ITD cells deficient for PIM1 failed to reconstitute lethally irradiated recipients, whereas lack of PIM2 induction did not interfere with FLT3-ITD-induced disease. PIM1-deficient bone marrow showed defects in homing and migration and displayed decreased surface CXCR4 expression and impaired CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling. Through small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown, chemical inhibition, expression of a dominant-negative mutant, and/or reexpression in knockout cells, we found PIM1 activity to be essential for proper CXCR4 surface expression and migration of cells toward a CXCL12 gradient. Purified PIM1 led to the phosphorylation of serine 339 in the CXCR4 intracellular domain in vitro, a site known to be essential for normal receptor recycling. In primary leukemic blasts, high levels of surface CXCR4 were associated with increased PIM1 expression, and this could be significantly reduced by a small molecule PIM inhibitor in some patients. Our data suggest that PIM1 activity is important for homing and migration of hematopoietic cells through modification of CXCR4. Because CXCR4 also regulates homing and maintenance of cancer stem cells, PIM1 inhibitors may exert their antitumor effects in part by interfering with interactions with the microenvironment.","['Grundler, Rebekka', 'Brault, Laurent', 'Gasser, Christelle', 'Bullock, Alex N', 'Dechow, Tobias', 'Woetzel, Sabine', 'Pogacic, Vanda', 'Villa, Antonello', 'Ehret, Sabine', 'Berridge, Georgina', 'Spoo, Anke', 'Dierks, Christine', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Knapp, Stefan', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Schwaller, Juerg']","['Grundler R', 'Brault L', 'Gasser C', 'Bullock AN', 'Dechow T', 'Woetzel S', 'Pogacic V', 'Villa A', 'Ehret S', 'Berridge G', 'Spoo A', 'Dierks C', 'Biondi A', 'Knapp S', 'Duyster J', 'Schwaller J']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Technical University, Munich 81739, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090817,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (CXCR4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Movement/*physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2009/08/19 09:00,2009/10/06 06:00,['2009/08/19 09:00'],"['2009/08/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20082074 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20082074 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2009 Aug 31;206(9):1957-70. doi: 10.1084/jem.20082074.

In addition to direct cytotoxicity, cytokines produced by NK cells amplify the immune response and help control the neoplasm/pathogen. Several activating and inhibitory receptors responsible for NK cell activation are recently characterized and play a crucial role in tumour eradication. These include, but are not limited to, the killer immunoglobulin-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors and natural cytotoxicity receptors. The downstream signalling of some of these receptors is also characterized. The net balance in the sum of the signals generated by ligation of activating and inhibitory receptors determines the final outcome, cytotoxicity versus tolerance. NK cell-based immunotherapy can be successfully exploited in the haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for the treatment of haematological malignancies and has a potential to separate the beneficial graft versus leukaemia effect from, often dangerous, graft versus host disease.

We investigated the expression of TLRs 1-9 on the cells of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and analyzed the functional consequences of TLR stimulation on leukemic cells. We showed that B-CLL cells express similar set of TLRs as memory B cells of healthy donors, i.e. TLR-1, TLR-2, TLR-6, TLR-7 and TLR-9. However, in contrast to memory B cells, B-CLL cells lack TLR-4 expression. Expression of TLRs correlates with their capacity to respond to specific TLR agonists. At the level of phenotype, ODN2006 (TLR-9 agonist) is the most potent stimulus. B-CLL cells also respond to the stimulation with loxoribine, Pam3CSK4 and MALP-2 (TLR-7, TLR1/TLR2 and TLR2/TLR6 agonists, respectively). TLR-7 and TLR-9 stimulation induces production of IL-6 and TNFalpha. In 47% of tested patients, treatment with ODN2006, MALP-2 and Pam3CSK4 reduced leukemic cells survival. Stimulation of B-CLL cells with TLR-9 agonists, loxoribine, MALP-2 and Pam3CSK4 induces significant proliferation. We report that TLR stimulation induces expression of CD38, a negative prognostic marker, on B-CLL cells. Expression of CD38 is induced by direct stimulation of B-CLL cells through TLR-7 and TLR-9 or CD38 can be induced on B-CLL cells indirectly by a soluble factor induced in non-B-CLL cells after stimulation with TLR-2, TLR-3 or TLR-5 agonists; the nature of this factor remains unknown. Our results argue for cautious evaluation of immunointervention strategies based on the administration of TLR agonists in the treatment of B-CLL as their effects on B-CLL cells may be tumor promoting as well as tumor suppressing.","['Rozkova, Daniela', 'Novotna, Linda', 'Pytlik, Robert', 'Hochova, Ivana', 'Kozak, Tomas', 'Bartunkova, Jirina', 'Spisek, Radek']","['Rozkova D', 'Novotna L', 'Pytlik R', 'Hochova I', 'Kozak T', 'Bartunkova J', 'Spisek R']","['Institute of Immunology, Charles University, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic. daniela.rozkova@lfmotol.cuni.cz']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Toll-Like Receptors/agonists/*immunology/*metabolism']",2009/08/18 09:00,2010/01/23 06:00,['2009/08/18 09:00'],"['2009/08/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24832 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2010 Mar 1;126(5):1132-43. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24832.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent evidence suggests that anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family are overexpressed in melanoma and may contribute to melanoma's striking resistance to apoptosis. ABT-737, a small-molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and Bcl-w, has demonstrated efficacy in several forms of leukemia, lymphoma as well as solid tumors. However, overexpression of Mcl-1, a frequent observance in melanoma, is known to confer ABT-737 resistance. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we report that knockdown of Mcl-1 greatly reduces cell viability in combination with ABT-737 in six different melanoma cell lines. We demonstrate that the cytotoxic effect of this combination treatment is due to apoptotic cell death involving not only caspase-9 activation but also activation of caspase-8, caspase-10 and Bid, which are normally associated with the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Caspase-8 (and caspase-10) activation is abrogated by inhibition of caspase-9 but not by inhibitors of the death receptor pathways. Furthermore, while caspase-8/-10 activity is required for the full induction of cell death with treatment, the death receptor pathways are not. Finally, we demonstrate that basal levels of caspase-8 and Bid correlate with treatment sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that the combination of ABT-737 and Mcl-1 knockdown represents a promising, new treatment strategy for malignant melanoma. We also report a death receptor-independent role for extrinsic pathway proteins in treatment response and suggest that caspase-8 and Bid may represent potential markers of treatment sensitivity.","['Keuling, Angela M', 'Felton, Kathleen E A', 'Parker, Arabesque A M', 'Akbari, Majid', 'Andrew, Susan E', 'Tron, Victor A']","['Keuling AM', 'Felton KE', 'Parker AA', 'Akbari M', 'Andrew SE', 'Tron VA']","['Department of Medical Genetics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090817,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 8/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', '*RNA Interference', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",2009/08/18 09:00,2010/01/20 06:00,['2009/08/18 09:00'],"['2009/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0006651 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Aug 17;4(8):e6651. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0006651.,PMC2722728,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cumulative evidences indicate that the deregulation of cyclin A(2) is tightly linked to the chromosomal instability, neoplastic transformation and tumor proliferation. Here we report that treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia K562 cells with doxorubicin results in an accumulation of cyclin A(2) and follows by induction of apoptotic cell death. To investigate the potential preclinical relevance, K562 cells were transiently transfected with the siRNA targeting cyclin A(2) by functionalized single wall carbon nanotubes. Knocking down the expression of cyclin A(2) in K562 cells suppressed doxorubicin-induced growth arrest and cell apoptosis. Upon administration with doxorubicin, K562 cells with reduced cyclin A(2) showed a significant decrease in erythroid differentiation, and a small fraction of cells were differentiated along megakaryocytic and monocyte-macrophage pathways. The results demonstrate the pro-apoptotic role of cyclin A(2) and suggest that cyclin A(2) is a key regulator of cell differentiation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that knocking down expression of one gene switches differentiation pathways of human myeloid leukemia K562 cells.","['Wang, Xiaohui', 'Song, Yujun', 'Ren, Jinsong', 'Qu, Xiaogang']","['Wang X', 'Song Y', 'Ren J', 'Qu X']","['Division of Biological Inorganic Chemistry, State Key Laboratory of Rare Earth Resources Utilization, Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun, Jilin, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090817,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclin A2)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cyclin A2/*genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*RNA, Small Interfering', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/08/18 09:00,2010/01/20 06:00,['2009/08/18 09:00'],"['2009/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0006665 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Aug 17;4(8):e6665. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0006665.,PMC2721982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the mechanisms of action of PIs, we analyzed the proapoptotic activities of PIs (MG132 or Bortezomib) in NSCLC cells. We found that both MG132 (>1 microM) and Bortezomib (>0.025 microM) induced a significant apoptosis in NCI-H1703, a PI-sensitive NSCLC cell line, through initially activating the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, leading to the activation of a positive feedback mechanism (PFM), which then conveyed apoptosis signaling from the intrinsic pathway to the extrinsic pathway with formation of a signaling loop for maximal caspase activation. Mcl-1 and Noxa were identified to be the major anti-apoptotic and proapoptotic proteins, respectively, in PI-induced apoptosis and mutually exclusive in protein stability. Although the Mcl-1 protein was upregulated by proteasome inhibition, it was also subjected to caspase 3-dependent cleavage governed by the PFM. Moreover, it was revealed that Mcl-1 protein cleavage contributed to PFM-governed apoptosis in following inter-related ways: reducing the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1; generating the truncated proapoptotic Mcl-1(S); and inducing a shift of balance between Mcl-1 and Noxa. It was further manifested that tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand boosted MG132's proapoptotic activity through strengthening the PFM in both NCI-H1703 and NCI-H358, a PI-resistant NSCLC cell line. Therefore, this study provides a basis for enhancing the efficacy of PIs in treating NSCLC.","['Yuan, B-Z', 'Chapman, J', 'Reynolds, S H']","['Yuan BZ', 'Chapman J', 'Reynolds SH']","['Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Toxicology and Molecular Biology Branch, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, CDC, Morgantown, WV 26505, USA. bby1@cdc.gov']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090817,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Caspases/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Feedback, Physiological', 'Humans', 'Leupeptins/*pharmacology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/pharmacology']",2009/08/18 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/18 09:00'],"['2009/08/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2009240 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.240 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2009 Oct 29;28(43):3775-86. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.240.

We identified risk loci for ALL at 7p12.2 (IKZF1, rs4132601, odds ratio (OR) = 1.69, P = 1.20 x 10(-19)), 10q21.2 (ARID5B, rs7089424, OR = 1.65, P = 6.69 x 10(-19)) and 14q11.2 (CEBPE, rs2239633, OR = 1.34, P = 2.88 x 10(-7)). The 10q21.2 (ARID5B) risk association appears to be selective for the subset of B-cell precursor ALL with hyperdiploidy. These data show that common low-penetrance susceptibility alleles contribute to the risk of developing childhood ALL and provide new insight into disease causation of this specific hematological cancer. Notably, all three risk variants map to genes involved in transcriptional regulation and differentiation of B-cell progenitors.","['Papaemmanuil, Elli', 'Hosking, Fay J', 'Vijayakrishnan, Jayaram', 'Price, Amy', 'Olver, Bianca', 'Sheridan, Eammon', 'Kinsey, Sally E', 'Lightfoot, Tracy', 'Roman, Eve', 'Irving, Julie A E', 'Allan, James M', 'Tomlinson, Ian P', 'Taylor, Malcolm', 'Greaves, Mel', 'Houlston, Richard S']","['Papaemmanuil E', 'Hosking FJ', 'Vijayakrishnan J', 'Price A', 'Olver B', 'Sheridan E', 'Kinsey SE', 'Lightfoot T', 'Roman E', 'Irving JA', 'Allan JM', 'Tomlinson IP', 'Taylor M', 'Greaves M', 'Houlston RS']","['Section of Cancer Genetics, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],"['13027/LLR_/Blood Cancer UK/United Kingdom', 'G0000934/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'C1298/A8362/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090816,United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,"['0 (ARID5B protein, human)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '142805-41-2 (CEBPE protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Confidence Intervals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Introns', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Meta-Analysis as Topic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Odds Ratio', 'Physical Chromosome Mapping', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology/genetics', 'Probability', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Risk Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",2009/08/18 09:00,2009/09/29 06:00,['2009/08/18 09:00'],"['2009/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['ng.430 [pii]', '10.1038/ng.430 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Genet. 2009 Sep;41(9):1006-10. doi: 10.1038/ng.430.

METHODS: This is a single institutional, randomized control trial in pediatric LRFN aged 2 to 15 years, in which 123 episodes in 88 patients were randomized to outpatient oral ofloxacin 7.5 mg/kg 12 hourly and amoxycillin-clavulanate 12.5 mg/kg 8 hourly or outpatient intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone 75 mg/kg and amikacin 15 mg/kg once daily after blood cultures. RESULTS: Out of 119 evaluable episodes, one-third were leukemia patients in maintenance and rest were solid tumors. Success was achieved in 55/61 (90.16%) and 54/58 (93.1%) in oral and IV arms, respectively, (P=0.56). There were 3 hospitalizations but no mortality. Median days to resolution of fever, absolute neutrophil count >500/mm(3) and antibiotic use were 3, 5, and 6 days in both arms. There were 5 blood culture isolates (3 gram-positive and 2 gram-negative bacteria). Failure of outpatient therapy was associated with perianal infections, bacteremia, febrile neutropenia onset before day 9 of chemotherapy in solid tumors and Vincristine, actinomycin-D, and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy for rhabdomyosarcoma. All gram-positive isolates were successes, whereas both gram-negative isolates were failures. Diarrhea in IV arm and Vincristine, actinomycin-D, and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy in the oral arm predicted failure in subgroup analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient therapy is efficacious and safe in pediatric LRFN. There was no difference in outcome in oral versus IV outpatient therapy. Amoxycillin-clavulanate and ofloxacin may be the oral regimen of choice.","['Gupta, Ajay', 'Swaroop, Chetanya', 'Agarwala, Sandeep', 'Pandey, Ravindra Mohan', 'Bakhshi, Sameer']","['Gupta A', 'Swaroop C', 'Agarwala S', 'Pandey RM', 'Bakhshi S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '74469-00-4 (Amoxicillin-Potassium Clavulanate Combination)', '75J73V1629 (Ceftriaxone)', '84319SGC3C (Amikacin)', 'A4P49JAZ9H (Ofloxacin)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Ambulatory Care/methods', 'Amikacin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Amoxicillin-Potassium Clavulanate Combination/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Ceftriaxone/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Fever/*etiology', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/etiology', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*complications', 'Ofloxacin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/08/18 09:00,2009/09/23 06:00,['2009/08/18 09:00'],"['2009/08/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181acd8cd [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2009 Sep;31(9):635-41. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181acd8cd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An improved understanding of the genetic and molecular changes underlying AML can help both to guide treatment strategies and to predict clinical outcomes, thereby enabling more precise decision-making regarding the optimal treatment strategy for individual patients. RECENT FINDINGS: The tyrosine kinase receptor FLT3 plays an important role in the survival and proliferation of blasts, and approximately 25% of patients with AML have mutations in the FLT3 gene. This protein is therefore an obvious therapeutic target in AML. Amongst recently developed tyrosine kinase inhibitors of FLT3, lestaurtinib and midostaurin are two orally bioavailable agents that have shown encouraging activity, both preclinically and in relapsed AML, and are now in phase III clinical trials. These agents are also being tested in combination with conventional chemotherapy. SUMMARY: Oral FLT3 inhibitors offer a hope of improved treatment outcomes for patients with relapsed and newly diagnosed AML.","['Sanz, Miguel', 'Burnett, Alan', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Lowenberg, Bob']","['Sanz M', 'Burnett A', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Lowenberg B']","['Hematology Service, University Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain. msanz@uv.es']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,"['0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Furans)', 'DO989GC5D1 (lestaurtinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Carbazoles/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Furans', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Structure', '*Mutation', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism']",2009/08/18 09:00,2010/01/16 06:00,['2009/08/18 09:00'],"['2009/08/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCO.0b013e32833118fd [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2009 Nov;21(6):594-600. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0b013e32833118fd.,,,,61,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This validates literature hypotheses concerning the viability of human ASNS as a target for new drugs against acute lymphoblastic leukemia and ovarian cancer. Developing structure-function relationships for this class of human ASNS inhibitors has proven difficult, however, primarily because of the absence of rapid synthetic procedures for constructing highly functionalized sulfoximines. We now report conditions for the efficient preparation of these compounds by coupling sulfoxides and sulfamides in the presence of a rhodium catalyst. Access to this methodology has permitted the construction of two new adenylated sulfoximines, which were expected to exhibit similar binding affinity and better bioavailability than the original human ASNS inhibitor. Steady-state kinetic characterization of these compounds, however, has revealed the importance of a localized negative charge on the inhibitor that mimics that of the phosphate group in a key acyl-adenylate reaction intermediate. These experiments place an important constraint on the design of sulfoximine libraries for screening experiments to obtain ASNS inhibitors with increased potency and bioavailability.","['Ikeuchi, Hideyuki', 'Meyer, Megan E', 'Ding, Yun', 'Hiratake, Jun', 'Richards, Nigel G J']","['Ikeuchi H', 'Meyer ME', 'Ding Y', 'Hiratake J', 'Richards NG']","['Institute for Chemical Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto 611-011, Japan.']",['eng'],['CA09126/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090803,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Sulfoxides)', '1982-67-8 (Methionine Sulfoximine)', 'DMK383DSAC (Rhodium)', 'EC 6.3.1.1 (Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase)']",IM,"['Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Catalysis', 'Humans', 'Methionine Sulfoximine/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Protein Conformation', 'Rhodium/chemistry', 'Sulfonamides/chemistry', 'Sulfoxides/chemistry']",2009/08/18 09:00,2009/12/18 06:00,['2009/08/18 09:00'],"['2009/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/26 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0968-0896(09)00743-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2009.07.071 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2009 Sep 15;17(18):6641-50. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2009.07.071.

DESIGN AND METHODS: GLDH activity was determined in a supernatant obtained from pelleted PBMC. GLUD1 and GLUD2 mRNA expression was determined using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. CD19(+) B cells from PBMC were purified by using positive selection. RESULTS: The highest GLDH activity was found in PBMC of the B-CLL group followed by the HI group and IM group. The PBMC GLDH activity was higher in 60% of the B-CLL patients according to the established reference interval for our HI (2.17-5.70 microkat/g protein). The greater GLDH activity was also found in the CD19(+) cell preparation of the B-CLL patients (two of the three) but not in HI (n=3). The median value of GLUD1 expression was highest in the IM group (n=11), followed by the HI (n=14) and B-CLL groups (n=59) (median 4.69/3.78, P<0.005 and 4.69/2.91, P<0.0005, respectively). GLUD2 expression was not significantly different between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The increased GLDH activity is specific for the PBMC of B-CLL patients. The GLUD1 but not the GLUD2 gene expression pattern is different between the PBMC of IM and B-CLL patients.","['Pajic, Tadej', 'Cernelc, Peter', 'Sesek Briski, Alenka', 'Lejko-Zupanc, Tatjana', 'Malesic, Ivan']","['Pajic T', 'Cernelc P', 'Sesek Briski A', 'Lejko-Zupanc T', 'Malesic I']","['Department of Haematology, Division of Internal Medicine, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Zaloska 7, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090813,United States,Clin Biochem,Clinical biochemistry,0133660,['EC 1.4.1.2 (Glutamate Dehydrogenase)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Glutamate Dehydrogenase/*blood/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*enzymology', 'Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/08/18 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/18 09:00'],"['2009/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-9120(09)00334-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2009.08.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Biochem. 2009 Nov;42(16-17):1677-84. doi: 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2009.08.003.

Here, we propose an alternative and simple way to generate bispecific binding molecules using designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins). For this purpose, monovalent DARPins with different epitope specificities were selected against the alpha chain of the high-affinity receptor for human immunoglobulin E (IgE) (FcepsilonRIalpha). Two of the isolated binders interfering with IgE binding to the receptor were joined to each other or to themselves via a flexible protein linker. The resulting bivalent and bispecific DARPins were tested for their ability to prevent allergen-induced cell degranulation using rat basophilic leukemia cells stably transfected with human FcepsilonRIalpha. The bispecific DARPin construct was the most potent one, efficiently blocking the IgE-FcepsilonRI interaction and preventing the release of proinflammatory mediators. Noteworthy, the multivalent and multispecific DARPin construct did not show any alteration of the beneficial biophysical properties of the monovalent parental DARPins. Hence, bispecific DARPins may be used to generate receptor antagonists simultaneously targeting different epitopes on the same molecule. Moreover, they easily overcome the limiting immunoglobulin binding paradigm (one binding molecule=one epitope) and thereby represent an alternative to monoclonal antibodies in cases where the immunoglobulin scaffold is unsuitable.","['Eggel, Alexander', 'Baumann, Michael J', 'Amstutz, Patrick', 'Stadler, Beda M', 'Vogel, Monique']","['Eggel A', 'Baumann MJ', 'Amstutz P', 'Stadler BM', 'Vogel M']","['Institute of Immunology, University of Bern, Inselspital, Sahlihaus 2, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090813,England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (FcepsilonRI alpha-chain, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,"['Anaphylaxis/immunology', 'Animals', '*Ankyrin Repeat', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Proteins/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Transfection']",2009/08/18 09:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/08/18 09:00'],"['2009/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2836(09)00998-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2009.08.014 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2009 Oct 30;393(3):598-607. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2009.08.014.

Therefore, we investigated FCRL2 mRNA expression in a large cohort with 152 CLL patients in order to assess its role in risk prediction in B-CLL. FCRL2 mRNA expression was found to be expressed at considerably higher levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of B-CLL patients compared to controls (range 1.35- to 210-fold upregulation; P < 0.0001) and cells of other hematological diseases. Patients with high FCRL2 expression (according to ROC-analysis) had a significantly longer treatment-free survival (TFS) and overall survival (OS) than patients with low FCRL2 expression (median TFS: 119 vs. 34 months, P < 0.0001; median OS: 321 months vs. not reached, P = 0.009). Univariate comparisons found that FCRL2 expression was weakly associated with IGHV mutation status (P = 0.05), CD38 status (P < 0.0001) and ZAP-70 status (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, we show that the combination of FCRL2 with ZAP70-, CD38- or IGHV-status could further significantly refine the prognostic information provided by either of the factors alone in TFS and OS. In multivariate analysis low FCRL2 expression was a significant independent prognostic factor (HR 2.4; P = 0.005). Here we demonstrate that the level of FCRL2 expression is correlated with prognosis in B-CLL.","['Nuckel, Holger', 'Collins, Crista H', 'Frey, Ulrich H', 'Sellmann, Ludger', 'Durig, Jan', 'Siffert, Winfried', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich']","['Nuckel H', 'Collins CH', 'Frey UH', 'Sellmann L', 'Durig J', 'Siffert W', 'Duhrsen U']","['Department of Hematology, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany. holger.nueckel@uni-due.de']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090804,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (FCRL2 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/blood', 'Aged', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematologic Diseases/blood', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/mortality', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/chemistry', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*blood/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/blood', 'RNA, Neoplasm/blood', 'ROC Curve', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/biosynthesis/*blood/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/blood']",2009/08/18 09:00,2010/03/13 06:00,['2009/08/18 09:00'],"['2009/08/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1328 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01328.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2009 Dec 1;83(6):541-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01328.x.

We discovered that mice expressing the shortened GATA1 protein (DeltaNTR mice) phenocopies the human transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) that precedes AMKL in Down syndrome children. In perinatal livers of the DeltaNTR mutant mice, immature megakaryocytes accumulate massively, and this fraction contains cells that form hyperproliferative megakaryocytic colonies. Furthermore, showing good agreement with the clinical course of TMD in humans, DeltaNTR mutant mice undergo spontaneous resolution from the massive megakaryocyte accumulation concomitant with the switch of hematopoietic microenvironment from liver to bone marrow/spleen. These results thus demonstrate that expression of the GATA1/Gata1 N-terminal deletion mutant per se induces hyperproliferative fetal megakaryopoiesis. This mouse model serves as an important means to clarify how impaired GATA1 function contributes to the multi-step leukemogenesis.","['Shimizu, Ritsuko', 'Kobayashi, Eri', 'Engel, James Douglas', 'Yamamoto, Masayuki']","['Shimizu R', 'Kobayashi E', 'Engel JD', 'Yamamoto M']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8575, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090813,England,Genes Cells,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,9607379,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down Syndrome/genetics/physiopathology', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Female', '*Fetal Diseases/genetics/physiopathology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/genetics/physiopathology', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/physiopathology']",2009/08/18 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/18 09:00'],"['2009/08/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['GTC1338 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2443.2009.01338.x [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Cells. 2009 Sep;14(9):1119-31. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2443.2009.01338.x.

Therefore, we used high-resolution genome-wide array-based comparative genomic hybridisation (array-CGH) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to characterise copy number alterations (CNAs) in DNA from 13 cases of HCL. We also summarise CNAs and cytogenetic features in 109 HCL cases comprising our 13 cases and 96 cases from the literature. Genomic array-CGH revealed imbalances in two out of 13 cases in addition to previously described copy number variants (CNVs) found in healthy individuals. In one case, a 700 kb deletion of 20q11.22 was detected encompassing ten characterised genes, among them the TP53INP2, DNCL2A and ITCH genes. In the second case, trisomy 5, and a deletion of 5p15.2 encompassing a non-characterised gene AY328033 was found. Altogether only 20/81 (25%) of all cases studied by CGH or gene dose array revealed CNAs. The most common recurrent deletions and breakpoints were 14q22-32 (33%), 6q25 (16%), 2p12 (10%), 22q11 (10%), 17p11-13 (10%), 7q32-36 (9%), 18q11-13 (7%), 1q32-44 (6%), 8p22-23 (6%) and 7q11 (6%). Trisomy 5 occurred in 15%. In addition, several other recurrent breakpoints were identified.

During the differentiation, activity, mRNA and protein levels of G6PD were increased. DHEA increased these levels further. DHEA by itself suppressed the production of superoxide from DMSO-HL60 upon stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). However, DMSO-HL60/DHEA stimulated with PMA in the absence of DHEA produced superoxide and 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine more than PMA-stimulated DMSO-HL60.

This is mainly related to more successful chemotherapy, using combinations of drugs including cisplatinum. Therapy with cisplatinum was started in 1978 in Iceland. The survival of Icelandic men with non-seminoma testicular cancer, before and after this change in therapy, is not known. OBJECTIVE: Therefore a retrospective population-based study was carried out on all Icelandic males diagnosed with non-seminoma testicular cancer between 1971 and 1995. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-seven males with an average age of 29.1 years (range 17-52) were included in the study. Clinical information was obtained from the Icelandic Cancer Registry and hospital records. All specimens were reexamined by a pathologist and the modified staging system of Boden and Gibb was used for staging the disease. Crude survival was evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Age standardized incidence for non-seminoma testicular cancer was 1.8 / 100,000 males per year for the whole period. Among the 57 patients, testicular swelling (93%) and pain (56%) were the most common symptoms at diagnosis. All 57 patients underwent orchiectomy, and 37 received chemotherapy as well. The most common histological type was embryonal carcinoma (44%) and average tumor diameter was 4.3 cm with a range of 1-12 cm. Tventy-six (51%) patients had stage I disease at diagnosis but 10 (17%) had stage IV. Crude five and 10 year survival for the whole group was 85% and 83%. From 1971 to 1977 the crude five year survival was 36% but 98% for the period 1978-1995. In December 1995 seven (64%) of 11 patients diagnosed between 1971-1977 have died of the disease. On the other hand only two patients (4%) diagnosed after 1977 have died as of december 1995. One because of acute myelogenic leukemia, nearly seven years after diagnosis of testis cancer. The other died of teratocarcinoma 12 months after diagnosis despite intensive chemotherapy including cisplatinum. CONCLUSION: Survival of patients with non-seminoma testicular cancer in Iceland has improved dramatically after the introduction of cisplatinum based chemotherapy in 1978. Of 46 patients diagnosed after 1977 only one (2%) has died because of the disease and median follow up was eight years. The incidence is low compared to other Western countries if Norway and Danmark are not included, were the incidence is much higher. Clinical presentation of the disease is similar between these countries.","['Bjornsson, R', 'Gudbjartsson, T', 'Magnusson, K', 'Gudlaugsson, E', 'Bjornsson, S', 'Einarsson, G V']","['Bjornsson R', 'Gudbjartsson T', 'Magnusson K', 'Gudlaugsson E', 'Bjornsson S', 'Einarsson GV']",,['ice'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Iceland,Laeknabladid,Laeknabladid,7901326,,,,1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['2009/08/15 09:00'],"['2009/08/15 09:00 [entrez]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Laeknabladid. 1997 Jul;83(7):477-85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past, we isolated and characterized the specificity and function of a WT1-specific T-cell receptor. The goal of this translational study was to develop a safe and efficient WT1-T-cell receptor retroviral vector for an adoptive immunotherapy trial with engineered T cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: We generated a panel of retroviral constructs containing unmodified or codon-optimized WT1-T-cell receptor alpha and beta genes, linked via internal ribosome entry sites or 2A sequences, with or without an additional inter-chain disulfide bond in the T-cell receptor constant domains. These constructs were functionally analyzed in vitro, and the best one was tested in an autologous primary leukemia model in vivo. RESULTS: We identified a WT1-T-cell receptor construct that showed optimal tetramer staining, antigen-specific cytokine production and killing activity when introduced into primary human T cells. Fresh CD34(+) cells purified from a patient with leukemia were engrafted into NOD/SCID mice, followed by adoptive immunotherapy with patient's autologous T cells transduced with the WT1-T-cell receptor. This therapeutic treatment evidently decreased leukemia engraftment in mice and resulted in a substantial improvement of leukemia-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report that patient's T cells, engineered to express the WT1-T-cell receptor, can eliminate autologous leukemia progenitor cells in an in vivo model. This study provides a firm basis for the planned WT1-T-cell receptor gene therapy trial in leukemia patients.","['Xue, Shao-An', 'Gao, Liquan', 'Thomas, Sharyn', 'Hart, Daniel P', 'Xue, John Zhao', 'Gillmore, Roopinder', 'Voss, Ralf-Holger', 'Morris, Emma', 'Stauss, Hans J']","['Xue SA', 'Gao L', 'Thomas S', 'Hart DP', 'Xue JZ', 'Gillmore R', 'Voss RH', 'Morris E', 'Stauss HJ']","['1Department of Immunology, Division of Infection & Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Hospital, Rowland Hill Street,London, UK. s.xue@medsch.ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['G0700149/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0900950/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G9721629/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090813,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/*immunology/therapy', 'Genetic Engineering/*methods', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Vectors/biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Hepatitis B Virus, Woodchuck/genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/physiology/*therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Transplantation, Autologous/immunology', 'Wilms Tumor/immunology/*pathology/therapy']",2009/08/15 09:00,2011/08/06 06:00,['2009/08/15 09:00'],"['2009/08/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.006486 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.006486 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Jan;95(1):126-34. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.006486.

A secondary purpose explored the impact of exercise on selected physiological, psychological, and inflammatory markers. METHODS: Ten patients, aged 18 to 50 years, diagnosed with acute leukemia or newly relapsed were assessed for body weight, height, body composition (skinfolds), cardiorespiratory endurance (total minutes on bicycle ergometer at 60% heart rate reserve), dynamic muscular endurance (Rocky Mountain Cancer Rehabilitation Institute protocol), fatigue (Revised Piper Fatigue Scale), depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, National Institute of Mental Health questionnaire), and quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General) at baseline (within 3 days of diagnosis) and at the end of induction phase of treatment. Blood draws were taken at baseline, midpoint, and at the end of induction for analyses of inflammatory markers (Linco Luminex assay). Combined aerobic and strength training exercises were administered 3 times per week, twice daily, for 30 minutes. Paired-samples t-tests were used for the analyses of physiological and psychological parameters. One-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used for the analyses of inflammatory markers. RESULTS: Significant improvements in cardiorespiratory endurance (P = .009, baseline 8.9 +/- 8.8 minutes, postexercise intervention 17 +/- 14.3 minutes) with significant reductions in total fatigue scores (P = .009, baseline 4.6 +/- 1.7, postexercise intervention 1.8 +/- 1.6) and depression scores (P = .023, baseline 19 +/- 11.5, postexercise intervention 12 +/- 8.2) were observed. Marginally significant decrease in interleukin-6 (IL-6; P = .059) with no significant changes in IL-10 (P = .223) or interferon-gamma (P = .882) were observed. CONCLUSION: Administration of exercise to acute leukemia patients undergoing treatment is feasible. The exercise protocol used increased cardiovascular endurance, reduced fatigue and depression scores, and maintained quality of life. Although no significant change in inflammation was observed, a trend demonstrating a reduction in IL-6 and an increase in IL-10 warrants further investigation.","['Battaglini, Claudio L', 'Hackney, A C', 'Garcia, Rey', 'Groff, Diane', 'Evans, Elizabeth', 'Shea, Thomas']","['Battaglini CL', 'Hackney AC', 'Garcia R', 'Groff D', 'Evans E', 'Shea T']","['Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Exercise and Sport Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599, USA. claudio@email.unc.edu']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Integr Cancer Ther,Integrative cancer therapies,101128834,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Depression/etiology/therapy', 'Exercise Therapy/*methods', 'Fatigue/complications/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/complications/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Physical Endurance/physiology', 'Quality of Life', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/08/15 09:00,2009/09/30 06:00,['2009/08/15 09:00'],"['2009/08/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['8/2/130 [pii]', '10.1177/1534735409334266 [doi]']",ppublish,Integr Cancer Ther. 2009 Jun;8(2):130-8. doi: 10.1177/1534735409334266.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Poor patients received less individual attention from oncologists and access to parental education and donated chemotherapy was lacking. INTERVENTION: A structured parental education programme for both poor and prosperous parents was introduced in January 2004 to improve access to parental education and donated chemotherapy. The programme consisted of a video presentation, an information booklet, DVD, audiocassette, a statement-of-understanding for donated chemotherapy, and a complaints procedure. Informed consent was also sought. OBJECTIVE: Our study compared childhood ALL treatment outcome before and after the introduction of the parental education programme. DESIGN: The medical records of 283 children with ALL diagnosed before (1997-2002; n = 164) and after (2004-2006; n = 119) the introduction of the education programme were reviewed. Data on treatment results and parental socioeconomic status were collected. RESULTS: After the introduction of the education programme, treatment refusal decreased (from 14% to 2%) and event-free survival increased (from 13% to 29%) significantly among poor patients. Treatment dropout increased (from 0% to 13%) significantly among prosperous patients. Overall, toxic death (from 23% to 36%) increased significantly, but there was no significant difference in event-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: After introduction of the programme, treatment refusal decreased and event-free survival increased significantly among poor families. However, improved knowledge, skills and communication are still required to combat the high rates of toxic death and treatment dropout. Treatment intensity should be accompanied by improved supportive care.","['Mostert, S', 'Sitaresmi, M N', 'Gundy, C M', 'Janes, V', 'Sutaryo', 'Veerman, A J P']","['Mostert S', 'Sitaresmi MN', 'Gundy CM', 'Janes V', 'Sutaryo', 'Veerman AJ']","['Paediatric Haematology Oncology Division, Department of Paediatrics, VU University Medical Centre, Vrije University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. s.mostert@vumc.nl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090812,England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Developing Countries', 'Female', 'Health Education/methods/*organization & administration', 'Health Services Accessibility/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Indonesia', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Parents/*education', 'Patient Dropouts/statistics & numerical data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Program Evaluation', 'Social Class', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Treatment Refusal/statistics & numerical data']",2009/08/15 09:00,2010/01/28 06:00,['2009/08/15 09:00'],"['2009/08/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['adc.2008.154138 [pii]', '10.1136/adc.2008.154138 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 2010 Jan;95(1):20-5. doi: 10.1136/adc.2008.154138.

Although these arise in utero, there is long latency before overt ALL, showing that additional changes are needed. Gene dysregulation through hypermethylation may be such an event; however, this has not previously been investigated in a detailed fashion. We performed genome-wide methylation profiling using bacterial artificial chromosome arrays and promoter-specific analyses of high hyperdiploid and ETV6/RUNX1-positive ALLs. In addition, global gene expression analyses were performed to identify associated expression patterns. Unsupervised cluster and principal component analyses of the chromosome-wide methylome profiles could successfully subgroup the two genetic ALL types. Analysis of all currently known promoter-specific CpG islands demonstrated that several B-cell- and neoplasia-associated genes were hypermethylated and underexpressed, indicating that aberrant methylation plays a significant leukemogenic role. Interestingly, methylation hotspots were associated with chromosome bands predicted to harbor imprinted genes and the tri-/tetrasomic chromosomes in the high hyperdiploid ALLs were less methylated than their disomic counterparts. Decreased methylation of gained chromosomes is a previously unknown phenomenon that may have ramifications not only for the pathogenesis of high hyperdiploid ALL but also for other disorders with acquired or constitutional numerical chromosome anomalies.","['Davidsson, Josef', 'Lilljebjorn, Henrik', 'Andersson, Anna', 'Veerla, Srinivas', 'Heldrup, Jesper', 'Behrendtz, Mikael', 'Fioretos, Thoas', 'Johansson, Bertil']","['Davidsson J', 'Lilljebjorn H', 'Andersson A', 'Veerla S', 'Heldrup J', 'Behrendtz M', 'Fioretos T', 'Johansson B']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital, Lund University, SE-221 85 Lund, Sweden. josef.davidsson@med.lu.se']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090813,England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (CAV1 protein, human)', '0 (CAVIN3 protein, human)', '0 (CDK2AP1 protein, human)', '0 (Caveolin 1)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 3.1.2.- (THEM4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.2.- (Thiolester Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Caveolin 1/genetics', 'Child', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'CpG Islands/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genome, Human/genetics', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods', 'Thiolester Hydrolases', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/genetics']",2009/08/15 09:00,2010/02/23 06:00,['2009/08/15 09:00'],"['2009/08/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['ddp354 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddp354 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2009 Nov 1;18(21):4054-65. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddp354.

However, the identity of putative oncogene(s) associated with this amplification has remained elusive. The chromatin remodeling factor DEK is an attractive candidate as it maps to 6p (within common melanoma-amplified loci). Moreover, DEK expression is increased in metastatic melanomas, although the functional relevance of this induction remains unclear. Importantly, in other tumor types, DEK can display various tumorigenic effects in part through its ability to promote proliferation and inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis. Here, we report a generalized up-regulation of DEK protein in aggressive melanoma cells and tumors. In addition, we provide genetic and mechanistic evidence to support a key role of DEK in the maintenance of malignant phenotypes of melanoma cells. Specifically, we show that long-term DEK down-regulation by independent short hairpin RNAs resulted in premature senescence of a variety of melanoma cell lines. Short-term abrogation of DEK expression was also functionally relevant, as it attenuated the traditional resistance of melanomas to DNA-damaging agents. Unexpectedly, DEK short hairpin RNA had no effect on p53 levels or p53-dependent apoptosis. Instead, we identified a new role for DEK in the transcriptional activation of the antiapoptotic MCL-1. Other MCL-1-related factors such as BCL-2 or BCL-xL were unaffected by changes in the endogenous levels of DEK, indicating a selective effect of this gene on the apoptotic machinery of melanoma cells. These results provide support for DEK as a long sought-after oncogene mapping at chromosome 6, with novel functions in melanoma proliferation and chemoresistance.","['Khodadoust, Michael S', 'Verhaegen, Monique', 'Kappes, Ferdinand', 'Riveiro-Falkenbach, Erica', 'Cigudosa, Juan C', 'Kim, David S L', 'Chinnaiyan, Arul M', 'Markovitz, David M', 'Soengas, Maria S']","['Khodadoust MS', 'Verhaegen M', 'Kappes F', 'Riveiro-Falkenbach E', 'Cigudosa JC', 'Kim DS', 'Chinnaiyan AM', 'Markovitz DM', 'Soengas MS']","['Program in Immunology, Department of Dermatology, Michigan Center for Translational Pathology, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-5640, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI062248/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107237/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'T32-GM07863/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA107237/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI062248/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA111275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA69568/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007863/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI062248-05/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA069568/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Dek protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Senescence/drug effects/genetics', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Skin Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2009/08/15 09:00,2009/09/16 06:00,['2009/08/15 09:00'],"['2009/08/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['69/16/6405 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-1063 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Aug 15;69(16):6405-13. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-1063.,PMC2727675,['NIHMS127671'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this class of proteins could be very useful, if their immunogenicity could be markedly reduced so that many treatment cycles could be administered. One approach to reduce the immunogenicity of foreign proteins is to identify B cell epitopes on the protein and eliminate them by mutagenesis. In this article, theoretical aspects and experimental evidence for the feasibility of B cell epitope removal is reviewed. A special focus is given to our results with deimmunization of recombinant immunotoxins in which Fvs are fused to a 38kDa portion of the bacterial protein, Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE38). Immunotoxins targeting CD22 and CD25 have produced complete remissions in many patients with drug resistant Hairy Cell Leukemia and are being evaluated in other malignancies. Experimental data summarized in this review indicates that removal of B cell epitopes is a practical approach for making less immunogenic protein therapeutics from non-human functional proteins. This approach requires grouping of the epitopes to identify targets for deimmunization followed by quantitative analysis of the decrease in affinity produced by the mutations in B cell epitopes.","['Nagata, Satoshi', 'Pastan, Ira']","['Nagata S', 'Pastan I']","['Cancer Biology Research Center, Sanford Research/USD, Sioux Falls, SD 57105, USA. nagatas@sanfordhealth.org']",['eng'],['Z01 BC008753-25/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",20090811,Netherlands,Adv Drug Deliv Rev,Advanced drug delivery reviews,8710523,"['0 (Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', '*Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/immunology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins/*immunology']",2009/08/15 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/15 09:00'],"['2009/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0169-409X(09)00223-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.addr.2009.07.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Adv Drug Deliv Rev. 2009 Sep 30;61(11):977-85. doi: 10.1016/j.addr.2009.07.014.

Therefore, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis may be a critical target for cancer therapy. OBJECTIVE: This review discusses how PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling network is constitutively active in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), where it strongly influences proliferation, survival and drug-resistance of leukemic cells, and how effective targeting of this pathway with pharmacological inhibitors, used alone or in combination with existing drugs, may result in suppression of leukemic cell growth, including leukemic stem cells. METHODS: We searched the literature for articles dealing with activation of this pathway in AML and highlighting the efficacy of small molecules directed against the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling cascade. CONCLUSIONS: The limit of acceptable toxicity for standard chemotherapy has been reached in AML. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed. Targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling network with small molecule inhibitors, alone or in combinations with other drugs, may result in less toxic and more efficacious treatment of AML patients. Efforts to exploit selective inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway that show effectiveness and safety in the clinical setting are currently underway.","['Martelli, Alberto M', 'Evangelisti, Camilla', 'Chiarini, Francesca', 'Grimaldi, Cecilia', 'Manzoli, Lucia', 'McCubrey, James A']","['Martelli AM', 'Evangelisti C', 'Chiarini F', 'Grimaldi C', 'Manzoli L', 'McCubrey JA']","['Universita di Bologna, Dipartimento di Scienze Anatomiche Umane, 40126 Bologna, Italy. alberto.martelli@unibo.it']",['eng'],['R01098195/PHS HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Small Molecule Libraries/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",2009/08/15 09:00,2010/02/26 06:00,['2009/08/15 09:00'],"['2009/08/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14728220903136775 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2009 Sep;18(9):1333-49. doi: 10.1517/14728220903136775.,,,,177,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: An overall response was achieved in 30 of 32 evaluated patients, with 62.5% in CR and 31.25% in PR. After applying radiotherapy, two patients with PR after ASCT reached CR. Median follow-up was 15.5 months (range 3-133 months). The probability of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) at a 3-year period for all patients was 51.9 % and 48.9%, respectively. For 22 patients in CR after ASCT, a 3-year DFS was 66.5%. Estimates of 2.5-year survival were 14.3%, 61.9% and 100% for CRD, CSR and for patients with CR/PR, respectively (p < 0.01). However, when patients undergoing consolidation were analyzed separately from those in CSR, no significant difference in OS and PFS was observed according to the disease status at ASCT. In univariate analysis for OS, PFS i DFS, extranodal site of disease and disease bulk had no predictive value. Twelve patients died. The main cause of death was Hodgkin's disease. Transplant-related mortality was 3.1%. One patient with CRD developed secondary acute myeloid leukemia and died 28 months after the transplantation. CONCLUSION: Autologous SCT is efficient as consolidation therapy in high-risk patients and in chemosensitive relapse, but it has no benefit in patients with chemoresistant disease.","['Tarabar, Olivera', 'Tukic, Ljiljana', 'Stamatovic, Dragana', 'Balint, Bela', 'Elez, Marija', 'Ostojic, Gordana', 'Tatomirovic, Zeljka', 'Marjanovic, Slobodan']","['Tarabar O', 'Tukic L', 'Stamatovic D', 'Balint B', 'Elez M', 'Ostojic G', 'Tatomirovic Z', 'Marjanovic S']","['Vojnomedicinska akademija, Klinika za hematologiju, Beograd, Srbija.']",['srp'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Serbia,Vojnosanit Pregl,Vojnosanitetski pregled,21530700R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Young Adult']",2009/08/15 09:00,2009/09/18 06:00,['2009/08/15 09:00'],"['2009/08/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2298/vsp0907571t [doi]'],ppublish,Vojnosanit Pregl. 2009 Jul;66(7):571-6. doi: 10.2298/vsp0907571t.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 are constitutively expressed in the liver. Although previous research established Bcl-xL as a critical apoptosis antagonist in differentiated hepatocytes, the significance of Mcl-1 in the liver, especially in conjunction with Bcl-xL, has not been clear. To examine this question, we generated hepatocyte-specific Mcl-1-deficient mice by crossing mcl-1(flox/flox) mice and AlbCre mice and further crossed them with bcl-x(flox/flox) mice, giving Mcl-1/Bcl-xL-deficient mice. The mcl-1(flox/flox) AlbCre mice showed spontaneous apoptosis of hepatocytes after birth, as evidenced by elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and caspase-3/7 activity and an increased number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells in the liver; these phenotypes were very close to those previously found in hepatocyte-specific Bcl-xL-deficient mice. Although mcl-1(flox/+) AlbCre mice did not display apoptosis, their susceptibility to Fas-mediated liver injury significantly increased. Further crossing of Mcl-1 mice with Bcl-xL mice showed that bcl-x(flox/+) mcl-1(flox/+) AlbCre mice also showed spontaneous hepatocyte apoptosis similar to Bcl-xL-deficient or Mcl-1-deficient mice. In contrast, bcl-x(flox/flox) mcl-1(flox/+) AlbCre, bcl-x(flox/+) mcl-1(flox/flox) AlbCre, and bcl-x(flox/flox) mcl-1(flox/flox) AlbCre mice displayed a decreased number of hepatocytes and a reduced volume of the liver on day 18.5 of embryogenesis and rapidly died within 1 day after birth, developing hepatic failure evidenced by increased levels of blood ammonia and bilirubin. CONCLUSION: Mcl-1 is critical for blocking apoptosis in adult liver and, in the absence of Bcl-xL, is essential for normal liver development. Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL are two major anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins expressed in the liver and cooperatively control hepatic integrity during liver development and in adult liver homeostasis in a gene dose-dependent manner.","['Hikita, Hayato', 'Takehara, Tetsuo', 'Shimizu, Satoshi', 'Kodama, Takahiro', 'Li, Wei', 'Miyagi, Takuya', 'Hosui, Atsushi', 'Ishida, Hisashi', 'Ohkawa, Kazuyoshi', 'Kanto, Tatsuya', 'Hiramatsu, Naoki', 'Yin, Xiao-Ming', 'Hennighausen, Lothar', 'Tatsumi, Tomohide', 'Hayashi, Norio']","['Hikita H', 'Takehara T', 'Shimizu S', 'Kodama T', 'Li W', 'Miyagi T', 'Hosui A', 'Ishida H', 'Ohkawa K', 'Kanto T', 'Hiramatsu N', 'Yin XM', 'Hennighausen L', 'Tatsumi T', 'Hayashi N']","['Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Z01 DK061000-10/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,"['0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/blood', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/metabolism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Hepatocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Liver/embryology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/08/14 09:00,2009/10/21 06:00,['2009/08/14 09:00'],"['2009/08/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hep.23126 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2009 Oct;50(4):1217-26. doi: 10.1002/hep.23126.,PMC3560852,['NIHMS434727'],,,['Hepatology. 2009 Oct;50(4):1009-13.

Here we show that BME displays strong cytotoxic properties in several human leukemia cell lines (U937, K-562, THP-1, Jurkat, and Molt-3) and in cells that over-express two anti-apoptotic proteins, namely Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L). BME arrested HL-60 cells at G(2)-M phase of the cell cycle, which was associated with the accumulation of cyclin B1 and p21(Cip1). Fluorescence microscopy experiments suggest that BME blocked the cell cycle in mitosis. The in vivo tubulin polymerization assay shows that BME inhibits tubulin polymerization and causes similar changes of cellular microtubule network as colchicine. Our results demonstrate that BME-induced cell death is (i) triggered in human myeloid leukemia cell that over-express Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L), and (ii) associated with loss of inner mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although ROS increased in response to BME, this did not seem to play a pivotal role in the apoptotic process since the anti-oxidant trolox was unable to provide cell protection. The treatment of HL-60 cells with BME induces the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as c-Jun N-terminal kinases, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)1/2 and stimulates the acid sphingomyelinase with concomitant ceramide generation. The findings of this study suggest that BME could be useful in the development of novel anticancer agents.","['Rubio, Sara', 'Quintana, Jose', 'Eiroa, Jose L', 'Triana, Jorge', 'Estevez, Francisco']","['Rubio S', 'Quintana J', 'Eiroa JL', 'Triana J', 'Estevez F']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (Ethers)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (betuletol 3-methyl ether)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/metabolism', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ethers/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microtubules/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sphingomyelins/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2009/08/14 09:00,2010/02/02 06:00,['2009/08/14 09:00'],"['2009/08/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mc.20574 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2010 Jan;49(1):32-43. doi: 10.1002/mc.20574.,,,,,,"['2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we provide for the first time evidence that small molecule inhibitors that target the anti-apoptotic protein X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) sensitize ALL cells for CD95-induced apoptosis. XIAP inhibitors at subtoxic concentrations, but not a structurally related control compound, act synergistically with agonistic anti-CD95 antibodies or MegaFasL, a hexameric form of CD95 ligand, to induce apoptosis in ALL cells. Further, XIAP inhibitors co-operate with MegaFasL to reduce clonogenic survival of ALL cells demonstrating their effect also on long-term survival. In contrast, XIAP inhibitors show little effect on MegaFasL-mediated apoptosis in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), pointing to some tumor selectivity. Molecular studies reveal that XIAP inhibitors enhance CD95-induced activation of caspases, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release in a caspase-dependent manner. Importantly, XIAP inhibitors sensitize primary leukemic blasts from children with ALL for MegaFasL-induced apoptosis. Thus, small molecule XIAP inhibitors present a promising novel approach to enhance CD95-induced apoptosis in childhood acute leukemia.","['Loeder, Sandra', 'Drensek, Annekathrin', 'Jeremias, Irmela', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael', 'Fulda, Simone']","['Loeder S', 'Drensek A', 'Jeremias I', 'Debatin KM', 'Fulda S']","[""University Children's Hospital, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Fas Ligand Protein/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",2009/08/14 09:00,2010/03/26 06:00,['2009/08/14 09:00'],"['2009/08/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24816 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2010 May 1;126(9):2216-28. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24816.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bioinformatics analysis revealed that anti-apoptosis family member B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) are potential targets of miR-153. Indeed, Western blot analysis indicated that miR-153 downregulated both Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 at the protein levels.

Genotyping patients and the population to which the patients belong, is important for effective treatment and reducing toxicity. There is a need for faster methods for genotyping. Hence the present study was planned to test the application of SNaPshot technique for analysis of the three common TPMT alleles: TPMT*2, TPMT*3A, and TPMT*3C in DNA from healthy Indian volunteers as well as to apply the method on cDNA samples obtained from children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). METHODS: A total of 120 healthy volunteers and 25 patients were analysed by multiplexed SNaPshot reaction. Genomic DNA was the template for most of the analyses, but additionally the cDNA synthesized for translocation detection was used as the template in case of patients with ALL. The results of SNaPshot reaction were confirmed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: The TPMT genotype could be reliably identified by SNaPshot analysis in multiplex reactions both in genomic DNA samples and cDNA. The overall frequency of the three common polymorphisms was observed to be 4.9 per cent, arising from heterozygosity for TPMT*3C (4.1%) and TPMT*3A (0.8%). INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: SNaPshot method for TPMT polymorphism analysis works faster with the potential for high throughput. By simultaneously interrogating the genotype at multiple sites, the method can provide future opportunity to multiplex, though multiplexing has not been done in the present analysis. Heterozygosity for TPMT*3C (719 A>G) was detected in 4.1 per cent of the study population and no homozygosity was observed.

We describe modifications of the SATE moieties with the introduction of polar groups on the acyl residue, in order to study how these changes affect antitumoral activity and metabolic stability. Two different synthetic pathways were explored and lead to obtain the corresponding mixed derivatives in satisfactory yields. Cytotoxicity was studied in murine leukaemia cells L1210 as well as in cells derived from solid human tumours (Messa and MCF7). Biological evaluation of these compounds in cell culture experiments with nucleoside analogue-sensitive and resistant cell lines showed that the modified compounds were active at higher concentrations than unmodified cytarabine, yet were much able to partially reverse resistance due to deficient nucleoside transport or activation.

METHODS: The study population consisted of 30 children with otitis media with effusion (OME), 22 children with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and 27 children with adenoid hyperplasia. IgA, IgG, IgD and IgM concentrations in these three groups were compared immunohistochemically. We also compared the levels of expression of B lymphocyte inducer of maturation program 1 (BLIMP-1), a promoter of plasmacytosis, and B cell leukemia/lymphoma-6 (BCL-6), a repressor of plasmacytosis, in the adenoids of these children. RESULTS: The expression of antibody to Ig A in the OME and CRS groups each was significantly lower than the score in the adenoid hyperplasia group. The staining scores of antibodies to IgG, IgD and Ig M did not differ significantly among the three groups. The expression of antibody to BLIMP-1 in the CRS and adenoid hyperplasia groups showed a significant difference. Staining scores of Antibody to BCL-6 did not differ significantly among the three groups.

However, genotoxic treatments may induce mutations and translocations that result in secondary malignancies or recurrent disease. In addition, about 50% of human cancers are associated with mutations in the p53 gene. Nongenotoxic activation of apoptosis by targeting specific molecular pathways thus provides an attractive therapeutic approach. METHODS: Normal and leukemic cells were evaluated for their sensitivity to 5, 6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) through cell viability and caspase activation tests. The apoptotic pathway induced by DRB was analysed by immunfluorescence and immunoblot analysis. H2AX phosphorylation and cell cycle analysis were performed to study the dependance of apoptosis on DNA damage and DNA replication, respectively. To investigate the role of p53 in DRB-induced apoptosis, specific p53 inhibitors were used. Statistical analysis on cell survival was performed with the test of independence. RESULTS: Here we report that DRB, an inhibitor of the transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 7 and 9, triggers DNA replication-independent apoptosis in normal and leukemic human cells regardless of their p53 status and without inducing DNA damage. Our data indicate that (i) in p53-competent cells, apoptosis induced by DRB relies on a cytosolic accumulation of p53 and subsequent Bax activation, (ii) in the absence of p53, it may rely on p73, and (iii) it is independent of ATM and NBS1 proteins. Notably, even apoptosis-resistant leukemic cells such as Raji were sensitive to DRB. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that DRB represents a potentially useful cancer chemotherapeutic strategy that employs both the p53-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways without inducing genotoxic stress, thereby decreasing the risk of secondary malignancies.","['Turinetto, Valentina', 'Porcedda, Paola', 'Orlando, Luca', 'De Marchi, Mario', 'Amoroso, Antonio', 'Giachino, Claudia']","['Turinetto V', 'Porcedda P', 'Orlando L', 'De Marchi M', 'Amoroso A', 'Giachino C']","['Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Orbassano, Italy. valentina.turinetto@unito.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090812,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '53-85-0 (Dichlororibofuranosylbenzimidazole)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'Dichlororibofuranosylbenzimidazole/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/08/14 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/14 09:00'],"['2009/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-9-281 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-9-281 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2009 Aug 12;9:281. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-9-281.,PMC2743708,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND: Cancer survivors contend with physical, psychosocial and emotional consequences of the disease and its treatment. There has been little research in Taiwan assessing these outcomes and, as survivor numbers increase, appropriate interventions need to be implemented. Haase's Adolescent Resilience Model was used as the theoretical framework. METHODS: A mixed methods design was used to assess the relationship between the variables for survivors of leukaemia and brain cancers. Ninety-eight participants completed quantitative tools and interviews, and the data were collected in 2006. FINDINGS: Survivors of leukaemia had better quality of life than those with brain tumours. This is attributed to more positive protective factors, fewer illness-related and individual risk factors and more positive resilience scores. Findings were congruent with similar studies from other countries. Qualitatively, participants believed that better quality of life meant less loss of self, a more integrated self, less chronic fear, and an ability to rebound and achieve personal control over one's life. CONCLUSION: Interventions and assessment of their efficacy are necessary to help survivors capitalize on their strengths, to decrease their individual risks and to promote resilience promote self-control.","['Chou, Li-Na', 'Hunter, Anita']","['Chou LN', 'Hunter A']","['Department of Nursing, National Tainan Institute of Nursing, Taiwan. chou_lina@yahoo.com.tw']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,J Adv Nurs,Journal of advanced nursing,7609811,,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Attitude to Health', 'Brain Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Child', 'Emotions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Regression Analysis', '*Resilience, Psychological', 'Risk Factors', 'Self-Assessment', 'Survival Rate', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Taiwan', 'Young Adult']",2009/08/14 09:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2009/08/14 09:00'],"['2009/08/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['JAN5078 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2648.2009.05078.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Adv Nurs. 2009 Oct;65(10):2131-41. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2009.05078.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism involved remains unclear. In the present study, we collected high-purity human CD4(+)CD25(-)CD45RA(+) naive T cells by microbead cell separation. These cells did not express FOXP3 by single-cell analysis, and few cells expressed FOXP3 when they were activated with anti-CD3/CD28 dual signal. However, more cells expressed FOXP3 when the supernatant of human epithelial ovarian carcinoma cell culture was added, yet not the supernatant of normal human ovarian surface epithelia cell culture. Neutralization assays revealed that neutralizing antibody against transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), interleukin-10, and interleukin-4 did not abrogate elevated FOXP3 expression induced by carcinoma cell culture supernatant, whereas neutralizing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) partially abrogated FOXP3 expression, but LIF alone could not increase FOXP3 expression in activated naive T cells. Further, an in vitro coculture suppression assay showed that these cells could suppress the proliferation of autologous CD4(+)CD25(-)CD45RA(-) T cells. In summary, our findings show that ovarian carcinoma cells are able to induce expression of FOXP3 and exhibit suppressive ability in activated naive T cells by producing soluble substances, and multiple cytokines involve in the induction of FOXP3 expression.","['Zhao, Xiaofeng', 'Ye, Feng', 'Chen, Lili', 'Lu, Weiguo', 'Xie, Xing']","['Zhao X', 'Ye F', 'Chen L', 'Lu W', 'Xie X']","['Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090710,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/analysis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Interleukin-10/physiology', 'Interleukin-6/physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/physiology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/*immunology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology/*physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/physiology']",2009/08/14 09:00,2009/11/05 06:00,['2009/08/14 09:00'],"['2009/08/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['CAS1286 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01286.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2009 Nov;100(11):2143-51. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01286.x.

METHODS: All patients with ALL treated at the only cancer pediatric hospital in Nicaragua during 2006 were studied prospectively. Diagnostic immunophenotyping was performed locally and bone marrow or blood samples were sent to the cytogenetic laboratory of Zurich for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis and G-banding. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients with ALL were evaluated. Their mean age at diagnosis was 7.3 years, 31.8% were >or=10 years. Thirty-four patients (51.5%) presented with hyperleucocytosis >or=50 x 10(9)/L, 45 (68.2%) had hepatosplenomegaly. Immunophenotypically 63/66 patients (95%) had a B-precursor, 2 (3%) a T- and 1 (1.5%) a B-mature ALL. FISH analysis demonstrated a TEL/AML1 fusion in 9/66 (14%), BCR/ABL fusion in 1 (1.5%), MLL rearrangement in 2 (3.1%), iAMP21 in 2 (3.1%), MYC rearrangement in 1 (1.5%), and high-hyperdiploidy in 16 (24%). All patients but two with TEL/AML1 fusion and high-hyperdiploidy were clinically and hematologically in the standard risk group whereas those with poor cytogenetic factors had clinical high-risk features and were treated intensively. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to Europe, the ALL population in Nicaragua is older, has a higher proportion of poor prognostic clinical and hematological features and receives more intensive treatment, while patients with TEL/AML1 translocations and high-hyperdiploidy are clinically in the standard risk group. Cytogenetics did not contribute as an additional prognostic factor in this setting.","['Ceppi, Francesco', 'Brown, Angela', 'Betts, David R', 'Niggli, Felix', 'Popovic, Maja Beck']","['Ceppi F', 'Brown A', 'Betts DR', 'Niggli F', 'Popovic MB']","['Pediatric Hematology Oncology Unit, University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland. francesco.ceppi@chuv.ch']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aneuploidy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Hepatomegaly/epidemiology/etiology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Nicaragua/epidemiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Splenomegaly/epidemiology/etiology']",2009/08/13 09:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/08/13 09:00'],"['2009/08/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22169 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Dec 15;53(7):1238-41. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22169.,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed the nadir enzyme activity and tolerability of Erwinia asparaginase, an alternative preparation, in E. coli asparaginase-allergic patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2000 and 2002, 215 children with newly diagnosed ALL were enrolled on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 00-01 and were to receive 30 weekly doses of intramuscular E. coli asparaginase. If E. coli asparaginase allergy developed, patients were switched to twice-weekly intramuscular Erwinia asparaginase (25,000 IU/m(2)). Nadir serum asparaginase activity (NSAA) was measured every 3 weeks. RESULTS: Forty-two patients (20%) developed E. coli asparaginase allergy and switched to Erwinia. Of 38 patients with evaluable samples, 34 (89%) Erwinia-treated patients had at least one therapeutic NSAA (> or =0.1 IU/ml). The median NSAA was 0.247 IU/ml 3 days and 0.077 IU/ml 4 days after an Erwinia dose. Associated toxicities included allergy in 14 (33%) and pancreatitis in 3 patients (7%). At a median follow-up of 5.4 years, event-free survival (+/-standard error) of the 42 patients who switched to Erwinia was 86 +/- 5% compared with 81 +/- 3% for the 170 patients without E. coli asparaginase allergy (P = 0.55). CONCLUSIONS: Twice-weekly Erwinia asparaginase was well tolerated and achieved a therapeutically effective NSAA in most E. coli asparaginase-allergic patients. Development of E. coli allergy and subsequent treatment with twice-weekly Erwinia did not adversely impact event-free survival. Erwinia asparaginase should be considered for E. coli asparaginase-allergic patients.","['Vrooman, Lynda M', 'Supko, Jeffrey G', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Asselin, Barbara L', 'Athale, Uma H', 'Clavell, Luis', 'Kelly, Kara M', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Michon, Bruno', 'Schorin, Marshall', 'Cohen, Harvey J', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Silverman, Lewis B']","['Vrooman LM', 'Supko JG', 'Neuberg DS', 'Asselin BL', 'Athale UH', 'Clavell L', 'Kelly KM', 'Laverdiere C', 'Michon B', 'Schorin M', 'Cohen HJ', 'Sallan SE', 'Silverman LB']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Biostatistics, and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. lynda_vrooman@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['P01 CA068484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA068484-149001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 P01CA068484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*prevention & control', 'Erwinia/*enzymology', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Survival Analysis']",2009/08/13 09:00,2010/01/27 06:00,['2009/08/13 09:00'],"['2009/08/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22225 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Feb;54(2):199-205. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22225.,PMC3706086,['NIHMS144366'],,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Feb;54(2):189-90.

Low expression levels associated with a higher risk of toxic death.,996-1004,10.1002/pbc.22220 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Increased activity of multidrug resistance (MDR) genes has been associated with treatment failure in acute leukemias, although with controversial reports. The objective of the present study was to assess the expression profile of the genes related to MDR: ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCC3, ABCG2, and LRP/MVP in terms of the clinical and biological variable and the survival of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PROCEDURE: The levels of mRNA expression of the drug resistance genes ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCC3, ABCG2, and LRP/MVP were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using the median values as cut-off points, in consecutive samples from 140 children with ALL at diagnosis. RESULTS: Expression levels of the ABCG2 gene in the patient group as a whole (P = 0.05) and of the ABCG2 and ABCC1 genes in patients classified as being at high risk were associated with higher rates of 5-year event-free survival (EFS) (P = 0.04 and P = 0.01). Expression levels of the ABCG2 gene below the median were associated with a greater chance of death related to treatment toxicity for the patient group as a whole (P = 0.009) and expression levels below the median of the ABCG2 and ABCC1 genes were associated with a greater chance of death due to treatment toxicity for the high-risk group (P = 0.02 and P = 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSION: The present data suggest a low participation of the drug efflux genes in treatment failure in patients with childhood ALL. However, the low expression of some of these genes may be associated with a higher death risk related to treatment toxicity.","['Cortez, Maria A A', 'Scrideli, Carlos A', 'Yunes, Jose A', 'Valera, Elvis T', 'Toledo, Silvia R C', 'Pavoni-Ferreira, Patricia C B', 'Lee, Maria L M', 'Petrilli, Antonio S', 'Brandalise, Silvia R', 'Tone, Luiz G']","['Cortez MA', 'Scrideli CA', 'Yunes JA', 'Valera ET', 'Toledo SR', 'Pavoni-Ferreira PC', 'Lee ML', 'Petrilli AS', 'Brandalise SR', 'Tone LG']","['Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, Department of Genetics, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, MDR/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Failure']",2009/08/13 09:00,2009/10/14 06:00,['2009/08/13 09:00'],"['2009/08/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22220 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Dec;53(6):996-1004. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22220.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other investigators have demonstrated that these neoplasms have distinctive clinicopathologic and molecular features. METHODS: The authors searched for patients who had AML with cuplike nuclei at their institution over a 10-year interval. A strict definition for cuplike nuclei was used: >or=10% blasts with nuclear invaginations in >or=25% of the nuclear area. The relevant data were reviewed, and the results were compared with a control group of patients who had AML without cuplike nuclei. RESULTS: In total, 22 patients who had AML with cuplike nuclei were identified and were classified as AML without maturation (French-American-British classification M1) (AML M1). Compared with the control group (AML M1), patients who had AML with cuplike nuclei were associated significantly with fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication (ITD) (86% vs 38%, respectively; P = .002); nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) mutations (86% vs 19%; P < .0001); both mutations (77% vs 14%; P < .0001); normal karyotype (86% vs 40%; P = .003); bone marrow blast count (90% vs 84%; P = .016); myeloperoxidase positivity (95% vs 30% blasts; P = .001); higher D-dimer levels (>5000 ng/mL vs 569 ng/mL; P = .001); and the absence of CD7 (91% vs 52%; P = .007), CD34 (82% vs 5%; P < .0001), and human leukocyte antigen, D-related (59% vs 10%; P = .001). There were no differences in age, sex, or peripheral blood counts. The positive predictive value of recognizing AML with cuplike nuclei for FLT3-ITD, NPM1, and both mutations was 81%, 86%, and 77%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Cuplike nuclei in AML were highly associated with the presence of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations and with several clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic features.

Despite well-documented inhibitory effects of dasatinib on BCR/ABL kinase, the exact downstream cellular events leading to generation of its potent antileukemic effects remain to be defined. We provide evidence that p38 Map kinase (MAPK) pathway is activated leading to increased upregulation of mixed lineage kinase 3, MKK3/6, MSK1, and Mapkapk2, upon treatment of BCR/ABL expressing cells with dasatinib, including cells expressing various imatinib-resistant mutants, except for T315I. Our data demonstrate that such dasatinib-dependent activation of p38 MAPK and its effectors plays a critical role in the generation of antileukemic responses, since pharmacological inhibition of p38 or siRNA-mediated knockdown of its expression reverse dasatinib-mediated apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and anti-proliferative effects. p38 MAPK inhibition also reversed dasatinib-induced suppression of CML patient-derived leukemic colony-forming units progenitor growth in vitro, as well as BCR/ABL expressing KT-1 cell-derived leukemic progenitor growth. Altogether, our findings suggest a critical role for p38 MAPK pathway in the generation of antileukemic effects of dasatinib, and raise the possibility that development of novel means to enhance p38 MAPK activation in BCR/ABL expressing cells may be an approach to promote antileukemic responses and, possibly, reverse T315I mutation-mediated resistance.","['Dumka, Disha', 'Puri, Poonam', 'Carayol, Nathalie', 'Lumby, Crystal', 'Balachandran, Harikrishnan', 'Schuster, Katja', 'Verma, Amit K', 'Terada, Lance S', 'Platanias, Leonidas C', 'Parmar, Simrit']","['Dumka D', 'Puri P', 'Carayol N', 'Lumby C', 'Balachandran H', 'Schuster K', 'Verma AK', 'Terada LS', 'Platanias LC', 'Parmar S']","['Dallas VAMedical Center and UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA121192/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL61897/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL061897/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 HL061897/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL061897-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA060553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL082946-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL067256/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL082946/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL082946-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA121192/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL082946-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL067256/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL082946/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA121192-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MAP-kinase-activated kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (mitogen and stress-activated protein kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 6)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K6 protein, human)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 6/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/08/13 09:00,2010/03/24 06:00,['2009/08/13 09:00'],"['2009/08/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [medline]']","['913850930 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190903147637 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Dec;50(12):2017-29. doi: 10.3109/10428190903147637.,PMC2888505,['NIHMS131763'],,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Dec;50(12):1909-10.

All the patients were administered the CHG regimen comprising low-dose cytarabine (25 mg/day, intravenous continuous infusion, days 1-14), homoharringtonine (1 mg/day, intravenous continuous infusion, days 1-14), and G-CSF (300 microg/day, subcutaneous injection, days 0-14, interrupted when the peripheral white blood cell count reached >20 x 10(9)/L). The overall response rate was 71.9% after the administration of one course of the CHG regimen. Of the 32 patients, 15 (46.9%) achieved complete remission (CR) and 8 (25%) achieved partial remission (PR). This regimen was followed by a post-remission therapy that included conventional chemotherapy, when CR was achieved. Of the patients with CR who just received post-remission regimens as homoharringtonine and cytarabine (HA) and daunorubicin and cytarabine (DA) 6 relapsed rapidly and just had a mean 6.1 months of CR. Otherwise, the other 8 out of 14 patients with CR alternatively received subsequent chemotherapy, which combined mitoxantrone, idarubicin, pirarubicin, or aclarubicin with cytarabine. The mean CR duration of the 8 patients had reached 10.6 months, and 5 of the 8 still kept a continuous CR. The median overall survival (OS) was 18.2 months. There were no statistically significant differences for CR, PR, and OS when the patients were grouped by age, blasts in bone marrow, and karyotypes, respectively. No treatment-related deaths were observed. Myelosuppression was mild to moderate, and no severe non-hematological toxicity was observed. Thus, a CHG priming regimen as an induction therapy was well tolerated and effective in patients with advanced MDS or t-AML. Stronger and alternative subsequent chemotherapy is necessary for patients with CR to maintain longer CR and better OS.","['Wu, Lingyun', 'Li, Xiao', 'Su, Jiying', 'Chang, Chunkang', 'He, Qi', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Xu, Li', 'Song, Luxi', 'Pu, Quan']","['Wu L', 'Li X', 'Su J', 'Chang C', 'He Q', 'Zhang X', 'Xu L', 'Song L', 'Pu Q']","['Department of Hematology, Sixth Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Harringtonines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/pathology', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Harringtonines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/08/13 09:00,2011/02/22 06:00,['2009/08/13 09:00'],"['2009/08/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['913851175 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190903096719 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Sep;50(9):1461-7. doi: 10.1080/10428190903096719.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They recognize a specific set of molecular patterns of microbial origin, immediately trigger an innate immune response, and bridge innate and adaptive immunity. TLR have also been shown to play a role in tumor development. In this context, chronic B-cell malignancies are an interesting example as clonal B lymphocytes remain responsive to and dependent on stimuli originating from the microenvironment which then become crucial for maintaining and propagating the disease. Emerging evidences suggest that, among other microenvironmental elements, TLR ligands may play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic B-cell lymphoid malignancies.

Twenty patients with ALL, who had been referred to the Children's Medical Center Hospital, during the year 2007, were enrolled in this study in order to evaluate the morphologic and immunophenotypic profile of these patients. Cytologic analysis of blood and bone marrow samples revealed that the frequency of ALL-L1 was 70%, followed by ALL-L2 and ALL-L3. The onset age of the patients with ALL-L1 was significantly lower than the patients with L2/L3. Severe anemia was significantly detected more in L1 group. Flow cytometic study of bone marrow showed that 10 cases had Pre-B1 ALL and 7 cases had Pre-B2 ALL, while three cases had Pro-B ALL. Comparisons of the characteristics and clinical manifestations among these groups did not show any appreciable difference. There were an increase percentage of CD20+ cells and a decrease CD10+ cells in pre-B2 group in comparison with pre-B1 group. Fifteen patients were in standard risk and five were in high risk. Although standard risk patients were more common in the group of pre-B1, this was not significant. Our results confirm the previous reports indicating heterogeneity of ALL. Immunophenotyping is not the only diagnostic test of importance, while morphological assessment still can be used in the diagnosis and classification of the disease.","['Ramyar, Asghar', 'Shafiei, Masoud', 'Rezaei, Nima', 'Asgarian-Omran, Hossein', 'Esfahani, Shadi Abdar', 'Moazzami, Kasra', 'Sarafnejad, Abdolfattah', 'Aghamohammadi, Asghar']","['Ramyar A', 'Shafiei M', 'Rezaei N', 'Asgarian-Omran H', 'Esfahani SA', 'Moazzami K', 'Sarafnejad A', 'Aghamohammadi A']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology of Children's Medical Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol,"Iranian journal of allergy, asthma, and immunology",101146178,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Neprilysin/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Risk Factors']",2009/08/13 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/13 09:00'],"['2009/08/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['080299106 [pii]', '08.02/ijaai.99106 [doi]']",ppublish,Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2009 Jun;8(2):99-106. doi: 08.02/ijaai.99106.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, most viruses that establish chronic infections evade destruction by CD8(+) T cells, and regulatory T cells (Treg) are thought to be involved in this immune evasion. We have infected transgenic mice, in which Treg can be selectively depleted, with Friend retrovirus (FV) to investigate the influence of Treg on pathogen-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses in vivo. We observed that Treg expansion during acute infection was locally defined to organs with high viral loads and massive activation of virus-specific effector CD8(+) T cells. Experimental ablation of Treg resulted in a significant increase of peak cytotoxic CD8(+) T-cell responses against FV. In addition, it prevented the development of functional exhaustion of CD8(+) T cells and significantly reduced FV loads in lymphatic organs. Surprisingly, despite the massive virus-specific CD8(+) T-cell response after temporary Treg depletion, no evidence of immunopathology was found. These results demonstrate the important role of Treg in controlling acute retrovirus-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses, and suggest that temporary manipulation of Treg might be a possible therapeutic approach in chronic infectious diseases.","['Zelinskyy, Gennadiy', 'Dietze, Kirsten K', 'Husecken, Yvonne P', 'Schimmer, Simone', 'Nair, Savita', 'Werner, Tanja', 'Gibbert, Kathrin', 'Kershaw, Olivia', 'Gruber, Achim D', 'Sparwasser, Tim', 'Dittmer, Ulf']","['Zelinskyy G', 'Dietze KK', 'Husecken YP', 'Schimmer S', 'Nair S', 'Werner T', 'Gibbert K', 'Kershaw O', 'Gruber AD', 'Sparwasser T', 'Dittmer U']","['Institute for Virology, University Clinics in Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090811,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Chronic Disease', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/methods', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Viral Load']",2009/08/13 09:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/08/13 09:00'],"['2009/08/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36795-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-03-208736 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Oct 8;114(15):3199-207. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-03-208736.

To investigate the impact of inhibiting the CT-L activity with carfilzomib, we set out to quantitate the levels of CT-L subunits beta5 from the c20S and LMP7 from the i20S in normal and malignant hematopoietic cells. We found that the i20S is a major form of the proteasome expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin, including multiple myeloma (MM) CD138+ tumor cells. Although specific inhibition of either LMP7 or beta5 alone was insufficient to produce an antitumor response, inhibition of all proteasome subunits was cytotoxic to both hematologic tumor cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. However, selective inhibition of both beta5 and LMP7 was sufficient to induce an antitumor effect in MM, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia cells while minimizing the toxicity toward nontransformed cells. In MM tumor cells, CT-L inhibition alone was sufficient to induce proapoptotic sequelae, including proteasome substrate accumulation, Noxa and caspase 3/7 induction, and phospho-eIF2alpha suppression. These data support a hypothesis that hematologic tumor cells are uniquely sensitive to CT-L inhibition and provide a mechanistic understanding of the clinical safety profile and antitumor activity of proteasome inhibitors.","['Parlati, Francesco', 'Lee, Susan J', 'Aujay, Monette', 'Suzuki, Erika', 'Levitsky, Konstantin', 'Lorens, James B', 'Micklem, David R', 'Ruurs, Paulina', 'Sylvain, Catherine', 'Lu, Yan', 'Shenk, Kevin D', 'Bennett, Mark K']","['Parlati F', 'Lee SJ', 'Aujay M', 'Suzuki E', 'Levitsky K', 'Lorens JB', 'Micklem DR', 'Ruurs P', 'Sylvain C', 'Lu Y', 'Shenk KD', 'Bennett MK']","['Department of Research, Proteolix Inc, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA. francescoparlati@gmail.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090811,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '72X6E3J5AR (carfilzomib)', 'EC 3.4.21.1 (Chymotrypsin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chymotrypsin/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/methods', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Oligopeptides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism']",2009/08/13 09:00,2009/11/07 06:00,['2009/08/13 09:00'],"['2009/08/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36768-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-05-223677 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Oct 15;114(16):3439-47. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-05-223677.

Recent data indicate an additional role of LXR in immunity by controlling dendritic cell and T-cell function and in breast and prostate cancer cells. Here, we show that LXR activation interferes with IL-2 and IL-7-induced proliferation and cell cycle progression of human T-cell blasts mainly through inhibited phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein and decreased expression of the cell cycle protein cyclin B. Comparable results were obtained with IL-2-dependent chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) T cells. Furthermore, we show for B-CLL cells that LXR are functionally active and inhibit expression of survival genes bcl-2 and MMP-9, and significantly reduce cell viability, suggesting an interference of LXR with cytokine-dependent CLL cell survival. In conclusion, our data reveal LXR as a potent modulator of cytokine-dependent proliferation and survival of normal and malignant T and B lymphocytes.

TMZ resistance results from increased O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) activity and from mismatch repair (MMR) system mutations. We evaluated the relative importance of MGMT activity, MMR deficiency, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), and PARP activity in ABT-888 potentiation of TMZ. MMR-proficient and MMR-deficient leukemia cells with varying MGMT activity, as well as primary leukemia samples, were used to determine TMZ IC(50) alone and with ABT-888. ABT-888 effectively inhibited PARP activity and enhanced TMZ growth inhibition in most leukemia cells. ABT-888 potentiation was most effective in MMR-deficient cells with low MGMT activity [potentiation factor (PF) = 21]. ABT-888 also potentiated TMZ activity in MMR-deficient cells with elevated MGMT activity. Unexpectedly, ABT-888 also enhanced TMZ activity in MMR-proficient cells (PF = 3-7). ABT-888 potentiation was unrelated to NHEJ activity. ABT-888 potentiated TMZ (PF = 2-5) in two of four acute myeloid leukemia patient samples but showed little potentiation in primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In conclusion, although ABT-888 potentiation of TMZ was most pronounced in MMR-deficient cells with low MGMT activity, neither MMR proficiency nor MGMT overexpression completely abrogated ABT-888 potentiation of TMZ.","['Horton, Terzah M', 'Jenkins, Gaye', 'Pati, Debananda', 'Zhang, Linna', 'Dolan, M Eileen', 'Ribes-Zamora, Albert', 'Bertuch, Alison A', 'Blaney, Susan M', 'Delaney, Shannon L', 'Hegde, Madhuri', 'Berg, Stacey L']","['Horton TM', 'Jenkins G', 'Pati D', 'Zhang L', 'Dolan ME', 'Ribes-Zamora A', 'Bertuch AA', 'Blaney SM', 'Delaney SL', 'Hegde M', 'Berg SL']","[""Texas Children's Cancer Center/Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. tmhorton@txccc.org""]",['eng'],"['K23 CA113775/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA14599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA90433-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109478/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA63187/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA81485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 GM084897/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM077509/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA090433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA081485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090811,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '01O4K0631N (veliparib)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*toxicity', 'Benzimidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Mismatch Repair', 'Dacarbazine/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase/genetics/*metabolism', '*Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Temozolomide']",2009/08/13 09:00,2010/01/20 06:00,['2009/08/13 09:00'],"['2009/08/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-09-0142 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0142 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2009 Aug;8(8):2232-42. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0142.

Now we show that TZD18 also has the same effects against six human breast cancer cell lines. To obtain insights into the mechanism involved in TZD18-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in breast cancer, the gene expression profiles of TZD18-treated and untreated MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were compared by microarray analysis. Results reveal that many genes implicated in endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling, such as CHOP (also known as DDIT3 or GADD153), GRP78 (HSPA5), and ATF4, are highly up-regulated, suggesting endoplasmic reticulum stress is induced. This is supported by our data that treatment of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells with TZD18 induces phosphorylation of PERK and the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha), as well as an up-regulation of GRP78 and an activation of ATF6, all of which are specific markers for endoplasmic reticulum stress. Furthermore, this ligand increases the endoplasmic reticulum stress-related cell death-regulators such as CHOP, DR5, GADD34, Bax, and Bak in these cells. Importantly, knockdown of CHOP by small interference RNA antagonizes the TZD18-induced apoptosis, indicating a crucial role of CHOP in the apoptotic process triggered by TZD18. In addition, TZD18 also activates stress-sensitive mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways including p38, ERK, and JNK. The specific inhibitors of these MAPKs attenuated the TZD18-induced growth inhibition in these cells. These results clearly show that activation of these MAPKs is important for TZD18-induced growth inhibition.

Expression of bcl-2 is determined, in part, by regulatory mechanisms that control the stability of bcl-2 mRNA. Elements in the 3'-untranslated region of bcl-2 mRNA have been shown to play a role in regulating the stability of the message. Previously, it was found that the RNA binding proteins nucleolin and Ebp1 have a role in stabilizing bcl-2 mRNA in HL60 cells. Here, we have identified HuR as a component of bcl-2 messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. RNA coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that HuR binds to bcl-2 mRNA in vivo. We also observed an RNA-dependent coprecipitation of HuR and nucleolin, suggesting that the two proteins are present in common mRNP complexes. Moreover, nucleolin and HuR bind concurrently to bcl-2 AU-rich element (ARE) RNA in vitro, suggesting separate binding sites for these proteins on bcl-2 mRNA. Knockdown of HuR in A431 cells leads to down-regulation of bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels. Observation of a decreased ratio of bcl-2 mRNA to heterogeneous nuclear RNA in HuR knockdown cells confirmed a positive role for HuR in regulating bcl-2 stability. Recombinant HuR retards exosome-mediated decay of bcl-2 ARE RNA in extracts of HL60 cells. This supports a role for HuR in the regulation of bcl-2 mRNA stability in HL60 cells, as well as in A431 cells. Addition of nucleolin and HuR to HL60 cell extracts produced a synergistic protective effect on decay of bcl-2 ARE RNA. HuR knockdown also leads to redistribution of bcl-2 mRNA from polysomes to monosomes. Thus, HuR seems to play a positive role in both regulation of bcl-2 mRNA translation and mRNA stability.","['Ishimaru, Daniella', 'Ramalingam, Sivakumar', 'Sengupta, Tapas K', 'Bandyopadhyay, Sumita', 'Dellis, Stephanie', 'Tholanikunnel, Baby G', 'Fernandes, Daniel J', 'Spicer, Eleanor K']","['Ishimaru D', 'Ramalingam S', 'Sengupta TK', 'Bandyopadhyay S', 'Dellis S', 'Tholanikunnel BG', 'Fernandes DJ', 'Spicer EK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA 109254/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 87553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090811,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (ELAV Proteins)', '0 (ELAV-Like Protein 1)', '0 (ELAVL1 protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Regulatory Sequences, Ribonucleic Acid)', '0 (nucleolin)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'ELAV Proteins', 'ELAV-Like Protein 1', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Polyribosomes/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Ribonucleic Acid/genetics']",2009/08/13 09:00,2010/01/07 06:00,['2009/08/13 09:00'],"['2009/08/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-08-0476 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-08-0476 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2009 Aug;7(8):1354-66. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-08-0476.

We show that in epithelial cancer cells, such death is associated with dramatic and simultaneous up-regulation of several BH3-only proteins, including BIK, BIM, MCL-1S, NOXA, and PUMA, as well as p53. Elevated levels of these proteins seem to be the result of direct inhibition of their proteasomal degradation, induction of transcription, and active translation. Subsequent cell death is independent of BAX, and probably BAK, and proceeds through the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. We identify the cascade of molecular events responsible for cell death induced by a prototypical proteasome inhibitor, MG132, starting with rapid accumulation of BH3-only proteins in the mitochondria, proceeding through mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and subsequent loss of DeltaPsi(m), and leading to irreversible changes of mitochondrial ultrastructure, degradation of mitochondrial network, and detrimental impairment of crucial mitochondrial functions. Our results also establish a rationale for the broader use of proteasome inhibitors to kill apoptosis-resistant tumor cells that lack functional BAX/BAK proteins.","['Lomonosova, Elena', 'Ryerse, Jan', 'Chinnadurai, G']","['Lomonosova E', 'Ryerse J', 'Chinnadurai G']","['Institute for Molecular Virology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA-33616/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA073803/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-73803/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA073803-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA033616-29/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA033616/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090811,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leupeptins/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Permeability/drug effects', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2009/08/13 09:00,2010/01/07 06:00,['2009/08/13 09:00'],"['2009/08/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-08-0183 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-08-0183 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2009 Aug;7(8):1268-84. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-08-0183.

The moral task of comparing the various time dimensions of a given situation is explained as an act of 'synchronizing' the clocks. Ethical sensitivity and competence are presented as core skills that allow a continuity of care in situations where dramatic issues seem to be resolved, but undramatic ones are still not addressed.

METHODS: A tumor xenografts model was established by subcutaneously injecting multidrug resistance cell line K562/A02 into the axillary flank of BALB/c-nu mice. Sixty tumor-bearing nude mice were divided into untreated group, ADM group and high-, medium-, and low-dose CZBG plus ADM groups. The nude mice in the CZBG plus ADM groups were intragastrically administered with CZBG once per day and intraperitoneally injected with ADM once every other day. The nude mice in the untreated group and the ADM group were administered with normal saline or ADM respectively. The course of treatment was continuous for 14 days. The weight of tumor xenografts was measured after treatment and the inhibition rate of tumor xenografts was calculated. The mdr 1 gene expression in tumor xenografts was tested by quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. RESULTS: Compared with the untreated group, CZBG (high-, medium- and low-dose) plus ADM could significantly decrease the weight of tumor xenografts in nude mice (P<0.05). Compared with ADM, high- and medium-dose CZBG plus ADM could decrease the weight of tumor xenografts in nude mice with statistical significance (P<0.05). The high- and medium-dose CZBG plus ADM could also significantly decrease the mdr 1 gene expression in tumor xenografts as compared with ADM alone (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: CZBG at high- and medium-dose plus ADM can inhibit the growth of tumor xenografts and decrease the mdr 1 gene expression in tumor xenografts in nude mice.","['Zheng, Zhi', 'Chen, Ju', 'Li, Dong-Yun', 'Chen, Xin-Yi']","['Zheng Z', 'Chen J', 'Li DY', 'Chen XY']","['Department of Oncology and Hematology, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100700, China.']",['chi'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Xue Bao,Zhong xi yi jie he xue bao = Journal of Chinese integrative medicine,101199657,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Random Allocation', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/08/13 09:00,2011/02/04 06:00,['2009/08/13 09:00'],"['2009/08/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['jcim20090810 [pii]', '10.3736/jcim20090810 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Xue Bao. 2009 Aug;7(8):758-62. doi: 10.3736/jcim20090810.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past decade, due to the incidence and poor prognosis associated with FLT3, numerous agents have been developed to directly inhibit the activity of wild type and mutated FLT3.

Also, early clinical trial data specifically focusing on drug toxicity, clinical efficacy and future directions of FLT3-directed anticancer therapy are discussed.","['Ustun, Celalettin', 'DeRemer, David L', 'Jillella, Anand P', 'Bhalla, Kapil N']","['Ustun C', 'DeRemer DL', 'Jillella AP', 'Bhalla KN']","['Medical College of Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, GA, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01CA116629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA123207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA129962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drugs, Investigational)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drugs, Investigational/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/physiopathology', 'Mutation', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/08/13 09:00,2009/12/25 06:00,['2009/08/13 09:00'],"['2009/08/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543780903179278 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2009 Oct;18(10):1445-56. doi: 10.1517/13543780903179278.,,,,101,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, it is a key mediator of immune receptors signaling in host inflammatory cells (B cells, mast cells, macrophages and neutrophils), important for both allergic and antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases. Deregulated Syk kinase activity also allows growth factor-independent proliferation and transforms bone marrow-derived pre-B cells that are able to induce leukemia. Consequently, the development of Syk kinase inhibitors could conceivably treat these disorders and so they have became a major focus in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry. OBJECTIVE: In this review, we analyze the structure and role of Syk kinase, the use of small molecules, interacting with ATP-binding site, as inhibitors of kinase activity and finally the potential of using inhibitors of Syk kinase expression to attenuate pathological conditions. CONCLUSION: Syk kinase inhibition is suggested as a powerful tool for the therapy of different pathologies.","['Ruzza, Paolo', 'Biondi, Barbara', 'Calderan, Andrea']","['Ruzza P', 'Biondi B', 'Calderan A']","['Institute of Biomolecular Chemistry of CNR, Padova Unit, c/o Dept.

PLA(2) treatment induced an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i) and ROS generation levels, leading to activation of p38 MAPK and JNK. Suppression of both p38 MAPK and JNK abrogated Fas and FasL upregulation. Unlike PLA(2), catalytically inactive PLA(2) treatment did not markedly increase Fas and FasL protein expression, and p38 MAPK activation was exclusively responsible for catalytically inactive PLA(2)-induced increase in Fas and FasL protein expression. Knockdown of p38 alpha MAPK and JNK1 by siRNA proved that p38 alpha MAPK and JNK1 were involved in ATF-2 and c-Jun phosphorylation, respectively. Compared with the p38 alpha MAPK/ATF-2 pathway, the JNK1/c-Jun pathway played a crucial role in Fas/FasL upregulation. Unlike arachidonic acid, lysophosphatidylcholine mimicked the PLA(2) action in inducing Fas/FasL upregulation. Together with the previous finding that c-Jun and ATF-2 are involved in transcriptional regulation of Fas and FasL, our data suggest that PLA(2) induces Fas and FasL upregulation through p38 alpha MAPK/ATF-2 and JNK1/c-Jun pathways in K562 cells, and PLA(2) catalytic activity is involved in this action.","['Chen, Ku-Chung', 'Chiou, Yi-Ling', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Chen KC', 'Chiou YL', 'Chang LS']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University-Kaohsiung Medical University Joint Research Center, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (ATF2 protein, human)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 2)', '0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Lysophosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 2/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects', 'Elapidae', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fas Ligand Protein/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/pathology', 'Lysophosphatidylcholines/pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Taiwan', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2009/08/12 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.22293 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2009 Oct 15;108(3):612-20. doi: 10.1002/jcb.22293.,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Lkn-1 functions as an essential factor in the migration of monocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils. Although eosinophils express both receptors, the role of Lkn-1 in immature eosinophils remains to be elucidated. In this present study, we investigated the contribution of the CCR1-binding chemokines to chemotactic activity and in the differentiation in the human eosinophilic leukemia cell line EoL-1. Lkn-1 induced the stronger migration of EoL-1 cells than other CCR1-binding chemokines such as RANTES/CCL5, MIP-1alpha/CCL3 and HCC-4/CCL16. Lkn-1-induced chemotaxis was inhibited by pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of G(i)/G(o) protein; U73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase C and rottlerin, an inhibitor of protein kinase C delta (PKCdelta). Lkn-1 increased PKCdelta activity, which was partially blocked by the pertussis toxin and U73122. Lkn-1 enhanced the butyric acid-induced differentiation via PKCdelta after binding to the increased CCR1 because Lkn-1 caused EoL-1 cells to change morphologically into mature eosinophil-like cells. Likewise, Lkn-1 increased the expression of both eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) and the major basic protein (MBP). PKCdelta activation due to Lkn-1 is involved in migration, as well as the butyric acid-induced differentiation. This finding contributes to an understanding of CC chemokines in eosinophil biology and to the development of novel therapies for the treatment of eosinophilic disorders. This study suggests the pivotal roles of Lkn-1 in the regulation of the movement and development of eosinophils.","['Lee, Ji-Sook', 'Kim, In Sik']","['Lee JS', 'Kim IS']","['Department of Biology, College of Natural Sciences, Daejeon University, Daejeon, 300-716, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090811,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,"['0 (CCL15 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CCR1)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go)']",IM,"['Butyric Acid/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Chemokines, CC/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C-delta/*metabolism', 'Receptors, CCR1/metabolism', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism']",2009/08/12 09:00,2010/10/01 06:00,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2009/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11033-009-9687-z [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2010 Jun;37(5):2149-56. doi: 10.1007/s11033-009-9687-z.

Cultured cells were analyzed regarding their phenotypes and functions using flow cytometry, colony-forming unit (CFU) assay and long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) assay. All cultured and colony cells in the LTC-IC assay were collected and analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization to identify Ph (bcr/abl)-positive cells. Our results showed that all parameters were higher in the 3D than in the 2D system, either at 2 or 5 weeks, i.e., regarding the number of CD34(+) cells (8,277.00 vs. 4,490.75 or 2,276.75 vs. 786.00 per well on average, respectively), number of CD34(+)/CD38(-) cells (1,207.50 vs. 474.25 or 497.25 vs. 114.25 per well on average, respectively), numbers of CFUs (103.33 vs. 79 or 47.0 vs. 21.67/10(5) MNCs; 189.33 vs. 131.00 or 10.33 vs. 3.67 per well on average, respectively), frequency of LTC-ICs (2.23 x 10(-5) vs. 1.40 x 10(-5) or 1.86 x 10(-5) vs. 0.64 x 10(-5), respectively) and number of remaining LTC-ICs (2.80 vs. 2.03 or 0.46 vs. 0.07 per well on average, respectively). The Ph (bcr/abl)-positive cell fraction was reduced in both systems during culture, but in the 3D system, it was not as rapid as in the 2D system and showed a leukemic predominance. In conclusion, our ""biomimetic osteoblast niche"" might provide a more adaptive microenvironment for leukemic stem/progenitor cell growth. The biological characteristics of leukemic stem/progenitor cells were partially maintained. It was suggested that the 3D biomimetic niche might be a new tool for studying the behaviors of leukemic hematopoietic stem cells/hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro.","['Hou, Li', 'Liu, Ting', 'Tan, Jing', 'Meng, Wentong', 'Deng, Li', 'Yu, Hongtao', 'Zou, Xingli', 'Wang, Yuchun']","['Hou L', 'Liu T', 'Tan J', 'Meng W', 'Deng L', 'Yu H', 'Zou X', 'Wang Y']","[""Department of Hematology, Hematology Research Laboratory, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 610041, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Hematology Research Laboratory, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 610041, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China. tingliu@mail.sc.cninfo.net."", ""Department of Hematology, Hematology Research Laboratory, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 610041, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Hematology Research Laboratory, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 610041, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory of Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 610041, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Hematology Research Laboratory, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 610041, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Hematology Research Laboratory, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 610041, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Hematology Research Laboratory, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 610041, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090811,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,['0 (Cadherins)'],IM,"['Biomimetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Cadherins/genetics', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Coculture Techniques/methods', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Osteoblasts/*cytology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/08/12 09:00,2010/04/09 06:00,['2009/08/12 09:00'],"['2008/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-009-0392-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-009-0392-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2009 Oct;90(3):281-291. doi: 10.1007/s12185-009-0392-4.

Furthermore, constitutive neutrophil apoptosis is inhibited by this interaction with CPPD so that the lifetime of the cells and the duration of the inflammatory response are extended. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of bcl-2 protein family members in the CPPD-induced prosurvival response. METHODS: Apoptosis was measured using DNA fragmentation and Caspase 3 assays. The expression and activation levels of the bcl-2 protein family members A1, Mcl-1, Bcl-xl, Bim, Bad and Bax-alpha were measured using western blot analysis. RESULTS: The prosurvival proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-xl were both found to be strongly expressed but unaffected by CPPD-induced neutrophil activation over 3 h. The expression of proapoptotic proteins Bim and Bax-alpha was found to decrease over the time course of a 3 h incubation of neutrophils with CPPD crystals (but not the bacterial chemoattractant fMLP). Furthermore, expression of the unphosphorylated (active, proapoptotic) form of Bim was dominant in control cells at 0.5 h, whereas the status of this protein switched to the phosphorylated form following cell activation by both CPPD and fMLP. For CPPD (but not fMLP) this phosphorylation effect reversed over a 3 h incubation. CONCLUSION: Upon stimulation by CPPD crystals, the expression of both Bim and Bax-alpha decreased after 3 h suggesting a reduced proapoptotic effect of these proteins so that the static expression of the prosurvival proteins Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 might allow for a temporary shift in the balance to a prosurvival state of the cells. Because a sudden (but transient) increase in the phosphorylated form of Bim was observed in CPPD-stimulated neutrophils it is possible that this species might act as a signaling intermediate, resulting in the observed downregulation of Bax-alpha.","['Higo, Tobi', 'Duronio, Vince', 'Tudan, Christopher', 'Burt, Helen M', 'Jackson, John K']","['Higo T', 'Duronio V', 'Tudan C', 'Burt HM', 'Jackson JK']","['University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090808,Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

Overexpression of aurora A has been observed in many solid tumors and some hematopoietic neoplasms, but little is known about its expression in myeloid diseases. Because cytogenetic abnormalities play an essential role in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies, we hypothesized that aurora A deregulation may be involved in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia and contribute to the chromosomal instability observed in these diseases. We assessed aurora A mRNA levels in CD34(+) bone marrow blasts from nine patients with acute myeloid leukemia, 20 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, and five normal patients serving as controls. CD34(+) blasts were isolated from bone marrow aspirate specimens using magnetic activated cell separation technology. RNA was extracted from purified CD34(+) cells, and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for aurora A was performed. Immunocytochemical analyses for total aurora A, phosphorylated aurora A, Ki-67, and activated caspase 3 were performed on cytospin slides made from purified CD34(+) cells in myelodysplastic syndrome patients using standard methods. Aurora A mRNA and protein levels were correlated, as was aurora A mRNA level, with blast counts, cytogenetic abnormalities, and International Prognostic Scoring System score. We found that CD34(+) cells in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia expressed aurora A at significantly higher levels (P = 0.01 and P = 0.01, respectively) than normal CD34(+) cells. Aurora A mRNA levels correlated with total and phosphorylated protein levels (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.02, respectively). No significant correlation was found between aurora A mRNA level and blast count, blast viability, cytogenetic abnormalities, or the International Prognostic Scoring System score in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. We conclude that aurora A is up-regulated in CD34(+) blasts from myeloid neoplasms.","['Ye, Dongjiu', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Xiao, Lianchun', 'Vadhan-Raj, Saroj', 'Fernandez, Michael H', 'Nguyen, Martin H', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E']","['Ye D', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Xiao L', 'Vadhan-Raj S', 'Fernandez MH', 'Nguyen MH', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Bueso-Ramos CE']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.
