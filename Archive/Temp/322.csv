In this study, it is shown that one particular MyD complementary DNA clone, expressed highly in normal precursor enriched bone marrow cells, encodes for interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), a positive transcription factor for expression of the beta-interferon (IFN-beta) gene. Using a clone of M1 cells inducible for terminal differentiation by both interleukin 6 (IL-6) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), two multifunctional cytokines recently identified as physiological inducers of hemopoietic cell differentiation, it has been shown that IRF-1 expression is rapidly induced by IL-6 and LIF in the absence of protein synthesis and is followed by a later increase in the levels of IFN-beta mRNA, observed to be largely dependent on protein synthesis. Also, it is shown that the growth inhibition associated with IL-6 or LIF induced terminal differentiation could be partially abrogated via the use of IRF-1 antisense oligomers or IFN-beta antiserum. Taken together, these findings imply a regulatory cascade, where induction of terminal myeloid differentiation by IL-6 or LIF triggers the immediate early activation of IRF-1, leading to the later induction of IFN-beta, in turn playing an autocrine role in growth inhibition.","['Abdollahi, A', 'Lord, K A', 'Hoffman-Liebermann, B', 'Liebermann, D A']","['Abdollahi A', 'Lord KA', 'Hoffman-Liebermann B', 'Liebermann DA']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Pennsylvania, School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects/genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Interferon-beta/*genetics', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphoproteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1991 Aug;2(8):401-7.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Irf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chemo-sensitivity profiles of these tumours have been compared with L1210 leukaemia lines resistant to either cisplatin (10-fold) or tetraplatin (34-fold). In cross-resistance studies, the L1210 and ADJ/PC6 resistant variants provided conflicting predictions of structures likely to circumvent cisplatin-acquired resistance. In particular, the L1210/cisplatin resistant model exhibited cross-resistance to carboplatin and iproplatin, whereas the diaminocyclohexane (DACH)-containing complex, tetraplatin, was even more active in the cisplatin resistant tumour than in the 'wild-type' tumour.

The technique of mobilisation-reconstruction of the posterior mitral leaflet with a pericardial patch should widen the indication of conservative surgery in this condition, in the presence of dominant mitral regurgitation in the child.","['Dervanian, P', 'Acar, C', 'Jebara, V A', 'Deloche, A', 'Fabiani, J N', 'Carpentier, A']","['Dervanian P', 'Acar C', 'Jebara VA', 'Deloche A', 'Fabiani JN', 'Carpentier A']","['Departement de chirurgie cardiovasculaire, hopital Broussais, Paris.']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Arch Mal Coeur Vaiss,Archives des maladies du coeur et des vaisseaux,0406011,IM,"['Child', 'Chordae Tendineae/surgery', 'Endomyocardial Fibrosis/*complications/surgery', 'Eosinophilia/*complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency/*etiology/surgery', 'Pericardium/transplantation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Mal Coeur Vaiss. 1991 Dec;84(12):1861-4.,,,Plastie mitrale pour fibrose endomyocardique chez un enfant atteint de leucemie aigue avec hypereosinophilie.,10,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has become a standard therapy for advanced cutaneous T cell lymphoma and shows promise in the treatment of four autoimmune disorders (pemphigus vulgaris, the progressive systemic sclerosis form of scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus) and in reversal of immunologic rejection of transplanted organs. Positive immunologic alterations observed in patients with AIDS-related complex merit further investigation, and preliminary trials in the management of patients with multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis and autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus have recently been initiated. The inability of the treatment to meaningfully alter the course of the B cell malignancy, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, suggests that B cell proliferations, at least those involving malignant cells, may be more resistant to this treatment. The mechanism of action of photopheresis is likely to be multifaceted, but at least in experimental systems appears to involve an immunization against the pathogenic T cells, in a highly specific manner. Photoactivated 8-MOP initiates a cascade of cellular events by forming covalent photoadducts with nuclear DNA, with cell surface molecules and possibly with other cytoplasmic components of the ultraviolet exposed leukocytes. For reasons not yet clear, exposure of populations of T cells containing expanding a clone(s) of pathogenic T cells to photoactivated 8-MOP alters these cells so that their reinfusion induces a therapeutically significant immunologic reaction that targets unirradiated T cells of the same pathogenic clone(s). It is suggested that the specificity of the induced immunologic reaction may result, in sequence, from the exquisitely titratable damage that 8-MOP inflicts upon cells of the pathogenic clone(s), the return of these cells to an immunocompetent individual, the removal of the photo-damaged cells from the blood by the reticuloendothelial system and the preferential induction of an immune response against cells of the pathologically expanded clone(s).","['Edelson, R L']",['Edelson RL'],"['Department of Dermatology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510-8059.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,IM,"['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', '*Leukapheresis', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*drug therapy', '*PUVA Therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1991/12/30 00:00,1991/12/30 00:01,['1991/12/30 00:00'],"['1991/12/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/30 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1991 Dec 30;636:154-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1991.tb33446.x.,['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1991.tb33446.x [doi]'],,,22,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, an unbiased stereological counting method, an optical disector/Cavalieri combination, was used to estimate the total number of motor neurons in the lateral motor column of the developing chick and to assess the effects of four growth factors on neuronal numbers. The total number of neurons in lateral motor columns at embryonic day 6 (E6), E8, E10 and E12 were 18,747 +/- 1,369 (mean +/- SD), 15,037 +/- 1,816, 10,245 +/- 940, and 8,802 +/- 797, respectively. Daily exposure from E6 to E9 to three of the growth factors (basic fibroblast growth factor, bFGF; leukemia inhibitory factor, LIF; nerve growth factor, NGF) had no effect on total neuron number at E10. However, exposure to ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) from E6 to E9 significantly increased (P less than 0.05) the number of neurons in the lateral motor column (13,610 +/- 725, compared with 10,058 +/- 204 in normal saline controls). These results are in agreement with previous reports of large scale neuronal death in the developing chick lumbar lateral motor column between E6 and E12 and confirm that exposure to growth factors such as CNTF can mitigate the course of normal ontogenetic cell death. The optical disector/Cavalieri combination is an efficient method for counting neurons: on average, following sectioning and staining, less than 30 min was required to estimate the total number of motor neurons in a lateral motor column with a coefficient of error of approximately 10%.","['Nurcombe, V', 'Wreford, N G', 'Bertram, J F']","['Nurcombe V', 'Wreford NG', 'Bertram JF']","['Department of Anatomy, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anat Rec,The Anatomical record,0370540,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Chick Embryo', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Histological Techniques', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mathematics', 'Motor Neurons/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/pharmacology']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anat Rec. 1991 Dec;231(4):416-24. doi: 10.1002/ar.1092310404.,['10.1002/ar.1092310404 [doi]'],"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We believe this is the first reported case of monosomy 7 syndrome in a child with NF in the United States, and that this case complements a recent report of two cases of NF, JCMMoL, and monosomy 7 in Japanese children. Since monosomy 7 syndrome is very difficult to differentiate from JCMMoL or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) unless appropriate chromosomal studies are obtained, we believe it is possible that monosomy 7 may occur with increased frequency in patients with NF-1.

Another goal was to determine the comparative effectiveness of shortened maintenance treatment (2 versus 6 courses) in the study population. Systemic induction therapy included vincristine, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, and intermediate-dose MTX with leucovorin rescue. Superimposed intrathecal (IT) therapy included cytosine arabinoside for 2 successive days followed on day 3 by MTX. Intrathecal MTX was given 3 times during induction. At the end of induction, 2 days of triple (hydrocortisone, MTX, and cytosine arabinoside) therapy were given intrathecally (TIT). All patients then received a consolidation course of 4 doses of TIT, 2 doses of cyclophosphamide, and 4 more courses of vincristine and MTX with leucovorin rescue. Patients were then randomized to receive either 2 or 6 cycles of vincristine plus MTX with leucovorin rescue. The TIT was given with each cycle.

To elucidate further the actions of LIF on bone we now report the effects of this cytokine on DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in isolated fetal rat osteoblasts and in the osteogenic sarcoma cell line, UMR-106. In both actively growing and growth-arrested rat osteoblasts, LIF stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in a dose-dependent manner. The increase in DNA synthesis was time dependent, was associated with an increase in the number of osteoblasts, and was not blocked by indomethacin. LIF-treated cells showed reduced [3H]thymidine incorporation in comparison with control, as they approached confluence, possibly because of the increased cell density in the LIF-treated cultures. In UMR-106 cells, treatment with LIF inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation in both actively growing and growth-arrested cultures. The effect was dose dependent and sustained with time. There was a corresponding decrease in cell numbers. It is concluded that although LIF causes an early stimulation of proliferation in isolated osteoblasts, it has opposing effects on UMR-106 cells. It is not possible to determine which of these effects is more relevant to the actions of LIF in vivo. The demonstration of a LIF effect on both these cell types, however, provides further evidence that this cytokine acts directly on osteoblasts.","['Lowe, C', 'Cornish, J', 'Callon, K', 'Martin, T J', 'Reid, I R']","['Lowe C', 'Cornish J', 'Callon K', 'Martin TJ', 'Reid IR']","['University of Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Osteoblasts/*cytology', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/physiology', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/metabolism/*pathology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 1991 Dec;6(12):1277-83. doi: 10.1002/jbmr.5650061203.,['10.1002/jbmr.5650061203 [doi]'],"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The differentiation of infections may be possible by using some supplementary measures and particular laboratory parameters.

Of these, 50 patients suffered from lymphogranulomatosis and 8 from acute leukemias. Levamisole (decaris, Hungary) and the Soviet drug tactivin were applied as immunocorrectors. The effects of levamisole and tactivin in chronic lymphoid leukemia are combined. They are related to immunologic differentiation of the cells. The patients showed an increase of the count of E-RFC, a decline of the B cell count with superficial immunoglobulins, Em-RFC, changes in the T mu: T gamma cell ratio, and the maintenance of the level of serum immunoglobulins. As a result of the continuous administration of immunocorrectors, there was a rise of the count of B cells with immunoglobulins in the cytoplasm. The continuous use of immunocorrectors favours stabilization of the course of the underlying disease, an increase of the patients' life expectancy. In patients with lymphogranulomatosis, the use of levamisole as part of the multimodality treatment leads to an increase of the count of E-RFC, augmentation of the life expectancy.

The levels were compared with the values obtained from 88 healthy individuals. Compared to the healthy controls, all the biomarkers were significantly elevated in patients with anemia as well as in those with leukemia. However, in leukemia patients significantly higher levels of TSA, LSA, FSA and LDH were observed compared to anemia patients. TSA levels were significantly higher in AML patients compared to CML and ALL patients. LSA levels were also significantly higher in AML patients compared to ALL patients. LSA was the most sensitive (84.6%) while FSA and RI levels were the most specific (78.0%) markers for leukemia. The combined use of the markers showed increased sensitivity and specificity (100.0% and 98.0%, respectively). The study suggested that the biomarkers investigated might be used for differentiating anemic from leukemic conditions, however, more in-depth studies are indicated to assess their utility in classifying various leukemias.","['Patel, P S', 'Adhvaryu, S G', 'Baxi, B R']","['Patel PS', 'Adhvaryu SG', 'Baxi BR']","['Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Department of Cancer Biology, Asarwa, Ahmedabad, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Biol Markers,The International journal of biological markers,8712411,IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/blood', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia/*blood/classification/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/diagnosis', 'Sialic Acids/blood']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Biol Markers. 1991 Jul-Sep;6(3):177-82.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (alkaline phosphatase, placental)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The precision of this approach can be improved by several methods including the investigation of chromosomal abnormalities by conventional cytogenetics, flow karyotyping, in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the analysis of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes by Southern blotting and PCR. Immunologic methods represent a reliable option for studying residual disease in approximately half of the patients with acute leukemia. This strategy is based on the observation that some marker combinations are expressed on leukemic blasts but are absent or rarely present in normal peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM) or cerebrospinal fluid cells. In patients with T cell-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, even one cell simultaneously expressing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and CD3, CD5 or CD1 amongst 10(5) PB or BM cells indicates residual disease. Some cases of B lineage and myeloid acute leukemias also exhibit phenotypes potentially useful for monitoring response to treatment. Such phenotypes are identified by double or triple color staining techniques using fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry. Independent studies have demonstrated that detection of cells with leukemia-associated phenotypes in BM samples of patients in clinic and morphologic remission heralds the recurrence of leukemia. It is likely that a combination of techniques will be needed to monitor the majority of patients with acute leukemia. Advantages and disadvantages of individual methods should be determined in comparative preclinic investigations.

The Yam 1B cells, which were derived from the peripheral blood of an adult T-cell leukemia patient, have been established and maintained in our laboratory since 1985. This cell line expressed mature B-cell surface antigens including surface immunoglobulin M (IgM), CD23, and HLA-DR; had cytoplasmic IgM; and secreted small amounts of IgM in the culture supernatants. Yam 1B was positive for Epstein-Barr virus-associated antigen (EBNA) but negative for adult T-cell-associated antigen (ATLA). The serum-free Yam 1B culture supernatants (SN) inhibited the expression of transferrin R, but neither the expression of interleukin 2 (IL-2) R(CD25) nor the production of IL-2 in the lymphocytes stimulated with phytohemagglutin. Yam 1B SN also inhibited DNA synthesis by human T and B lymphocytes and immunoglobulin generation by normal B cells as well as by Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B lymphoblastoid cell lines. The inhibitory activity of Yam 1B SN was inactivated at 56 degrees C and at pH 10 but was relatively stable at pH 2. It was abrogated by digestion with pronase and was partially stable by digestion with trypsin. Fractions collected from a Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration column (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden) were found to have a peak of inhibitory activity of cell proliferation associated with molecules of apparent MWr of 43,000 to 67,000. The inhibitory activity of Yam 1B SN was not blocked by the anti-transforming growth factor beta antibody.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Morikawa, K', 'Morikawa, S', 'Imai, K', 'Oseko, F']","['Morikawa K', 'Morikawa S', 'Imai K', 'Oseko F']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Shimane Medical University, Izumo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Phytohemagglutinins', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/metabolism', 'Suppressor Factors, Immunologic/*analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1991 Nov;3(6):609-10. doi: 10.1016/1043-4666(91)90488-y.,"['1043-4666(91)90488-Y [pii]', '10.1016/1043-4666(91)90488-y [doi]']","['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Suppressor Factors, Immunologic)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the basis of the present data we cannot determine if the low level of nucleoside transporter in AR MELC is due to an altered form of the protein or a decreased amount of the normal protein.

The information yielded by CT and that given by US overlapped in 8/9 cases: in the extant patient, US demonstrated multiple fungal microabscesses of liver, while CT was negative, probably due to low liver density. CT patterns were multiple, small and round nonenhanced areas. Since the indiscriminate administration of intravenous contrast medium is unsuitable, CT cannot be performed first. On the other hand, in several patients liver CT with no contrast medium gave the same results for venous and fungal lesions.

The transplantation immunity in our assay system was mediated primarily by allospecific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Our results showed that both CsA and CPM did not affect the process of inducing the immunity, but they inhibited the effector phase of that transplant immunity. The experiments using 51Cr-release assay in vitro on peritoneal exudate cells as effector cells showed that the effector phase of the transplantation immunity in vivo involved the maturation from immunological memory CTL-precursor cells to effector CTL with clonal expansion. Further, adoptive cell transfer experiments showed that CsA did not eliminate the immunological memory CTL nor induce the suppressor cells in donor mice. All the data suggested that the maturation of memory CTL precursor cells to effector CTL was inhibited by CsA which would block lymphokine production even in vivo, whereas CPM eliminated the CPM-sensitive memory CTL precursor cells. The findings that CsA and CPM act on the different sites of CTL maturation support the possibility of effectiveness of the combination therapy of the two agents for controlling the transplantation immunity.","['Hasegawa, Y', 'Isobe, K', 'Nagase, F', 'Shimokata, K', 'Nakashima, I']","['Hasegawa Y', 'Isobe K', 'Nagase F', 'Shimokata K', 'Nakashima I']","['Department of Immunology, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,IM,"['Animals', 'Cyclophosphamide/*pharmacology', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'Graft Rejection/drug effects', 'Immunologic Memory/drug effects', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L1210/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/immunology', 'Transplantation Immunology/*drug effects']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 1991 Nov;183(5):408-17. doi: 10.1016/s0171-2985(11)80525-5.,"['S0171-2985(11)80525-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0171-2985(11)80525-5 [doi]']","['83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Presentation of a novel magnetic separation system.,374-85,"Optimal conditions for removing leukemic cells from human bone marrow with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and magnetic immunobeads were investigated. Monodisperse 3 microns polystyrene microspheres containing magnetite were coated with affinity-purified rabbit antimouse IgG at 4 degrees C, pH 9.6 for 18 h. SKW-3 cells (T-CLL cell line) were marked with the supravital DNA stain Hoechst 33342, seeded into normal human bone marrow, and then incubated with the mAb CD1, CD6, and CD8 at 4 degrees C for 30 min. In preliminary experiments REH cells (cALL cells) and mouse anti-REH cell antibodies were used to find the most favorable conditions for the binding of magnetic beads to tumor cells. Optimal formation of cell-bead rosettes was achieved by rotating beads and tumor cells together at room temperature at a concentration of 1 x 10(7) cells/ml, a bead: tumor cell ratio of 100:1 and an incubation time of one hour. The novel magnetic separation apparatus consists of three polystyrene chambers connected by silicone rubber tubing. The chambers contain four steel inserts each equipped with 32 nickel wires, which are magnetized by permanent magnets in such a way that the inhomogeneous high gradient magnetic field could be established within the cell suspension containing the cells to be depleted. The fluid flow was established by a peristaltic pump. At a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min and a field strength of 160 kA/m, no beads could be detected in the purged marrow. A cocktail of the three mAb was more effective than any single antibody in forming bead-cell rosettes. Two sequential purging cycles were superior to one. The marrow recovered was highly viable as assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion and by growth of CFU-GM.","['Gruhn, B', 'Hafer, R', 'Muller, A', 'Andra, W', 'Danan, H', 'Zintl, F']","['Gruhn B', 'Hafer R', 'Muller A', 'Andra W', 'Danan H', 'Zintl F']","['Department of Pediatrics, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Bone Marrow Purging/instrumentation/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology/*surgery', '*Magnetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Rosette Formation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 1991 Nov;183(5):374-85. doi: 10.1016/S0171-2985(11)80522-X.,"['S0171-2985(11)80522-X [pii]', '10.1016/S0171-2985(11)80522-X [doi]']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The genome of MH2 consists of two oncogenes, v-mht/mil and v-myc. Most of the transforming activity of MH2 is attributed to the v-myc oncogene. In contrast, the v-mht/mil oncogene alone does not induce a fully transformed phenotype of avian primary fibroblasts in vitro. It was shown previously that v-mht/mil is the avian homology of the v-raf oncogene in murine sarcoma retrovirus 3611. Because the v-raf oncogene transforms murine fibroblasts very efficiently, the present study tested the hypothesis that an extra segment in the 5' end of v-mht/mil relative to v-raf suppressed the fibroblast-transforming activity of v-mht/mil. By introducing an in-frame deletion of 195 nucleotides into the 5' end of v-mht/mil, the results demonstrate that in the presence of an inactive v-myc oncogene, the 5'-deleted v-mht/mil oncogene fails to transform chicken embryo fibroblasts. Therefore, it is likely that avian primary fibroblasts lack a cellular component that serves as a critical substrate/target for v-mht/mil-induced cellular transformation.","['Kan, N C']",['Kan NC'],"['Department of Pharmacology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey 17033.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Avian Dis,Avian diseases,0370617,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Genes, myc', 'Immunoblotting', '*Mutagenesis', '*Oncogenes', 'Plasmids', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/analysis']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Avian Dis. 1991 Oct-Dec;35(4):941-9.,,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)']",,,,,,,"['gag', 'mil', 'v-mht', 'v-myc']",,,,,,,

In addition, IL-3 enhances mature myeloid cell functions such as phagocytosis and activation of basophils and eosinophils, as well as monocyte cytotoxicity. The first phase of clinical trials suggested that IL-3 may augment myelopoiesis in a number of clinical conditions. It may be efficacious for treatment of primary marrow disorders, including myelodysplastic syndromes and aplastic anemia. However, replacement therapy with IL-3 alone is probably not sufficient to obtain maximal stimulation of myelopoiesis.

The second malignant neoplasms (SMN) included brain tumors, basal cell carcinomas, thyroid cancer, leiomyosarcoma and finally rhabdomyosarcoma in a patient who also had suffered from Hodgkin's disease while still on antileukemic treatment. Cranial radiation had been given to 58.4% of the patients in the study group, which consisted of 895 ALL patients who had completed various chemotherapy protocols. With one exception, the SMN appeared after 7.5-16.5 years at a location previously exposed to radiotherapy (RT). The estimated cumulative risk of SMN appearing within 20 years after diagnosis was 2.9%, and the corresponding risk for cases with RT was 8.1% compared to 0.3% for those without (p = 0.05). In a Cox regression analysis, the incidence rate ratio of SMN between patients with and without RT was 6.7 (95% CI = 0.8, 57.7). Based on age-, year- and sex-specific cancer incidence figures for Norway, the overall standardized incidence rate ratio (SIR) of SMN after treatment for ALL was 5.9 (95% CI = 2.2, 12.9). The number of brain tumors among patients who had received cranial radiation was nearly 27 times greater than expected, whereas no such tumors were seen after chemotherapy. Individuals treated for childhood ALL are at increased risk of a new malignancy, and this seems mainly to be associated with previous irradiation.","['Nygaard, R', 'Garwicz, S', 'Haldorsen, T', 'Hertz, H', 'Jonmundsson, G K', 'Lanning, M', 'Moe, P J']","['Nygaard R', 'Garwicz S', 'Haldorsen T', 'Hertz H', 'Jonmundsson GK', 'Lanning M', 'Moe PJ']","['Department of Paediatrics, University Hospital of Trondheim, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Sweden,Acta Paediatr Scand,Acta paediatrica Scandinavica,0000211,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Norway/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Paediatr Scand. 1991 Dec;80(12):1220-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1651-2227.1991.tb11812.x.,['10.1111/j.1651-2227.1991.tb11812.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It induces fever and has profound endocrinologic metabolic and hematologic effects. Two structurally related forms of IL-1 have been described, termed IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. Both forms of IL-1 bind to a common receptor that is present on a variety of target cells. Recently, IL-1 has been recognized as a molecule that is important in the regulation of hematopoiesis. IL-1 induces the production of several different hematopoietic growth factors including granulocyte-macrophage, granulocyte and macrophage colony-stimulating factors and interleukin 6 by a variety of accessory cells. In addition, IL-1 acts synergistically with colony-stimulating factors in the proliferation of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells. In vivo, the administration of IL-1 accelerates hematopoietic reconstitution after chemotherapy or radiation induced myelosuppression.

The analog was active against a number of murine tumors, including colon adenocarcinoma 38 and multidrug resistant sublines of P-388 leukemia. Preclinical toxicity studies revealed that batracylin was much more toxic when administered orally to rats than to mice. The combined sex LD10 in mice was 5,655 mg/m2 while 576 mg/m2 was lethal to all rats treated at that dose. We determined that following oral administration of batracylin, systemic exposure of parent drug to the rat was only 14.9% of that to the mouse. It was subsequently noted that systemic exposure of a relatively non-polar metabolite was approximately 9 times greater in the rat than in the mouse. The metabolite was identified as N-acetylbatracylin by TLC, HPLC and mass spectral analyses. Observations by the National Cancer Institute that N-acetylbatracylin was not toxic following oral administration to mice or rats prompted evaluation of systemic exposure following oral administration to rats. Following oral administration of N-acetylbatracylin to rats, systemic exposure was almost nil. Indeed, exposure of rats to N-acetylbatracylin was several orders of magnitude greater following oral administration of six-fold lower doses of the parent drug, batracylin.

There is therefore increasing emphasis on incidence of relapse and treatment related morbidities rather than on survival alone when evaluating the role of different treatment for Hodgkin's disease. Radiotherapy has an essential part to play in any initial strategy aiming to keep relapse rate low, as chemotherapy alone has been demonstrated to be less effective in treating macroscopic disease. Late side-effects associated with radiation are largely associated with obsolete techniques involving very wide fields, high doses and large fraction size delivered to anterior structures within the thorax. The risk of second solid tumour appears related to the volume of radiation fields and the risk of cardiac damage is probably related to both total dose and dose per fraction delivered. There is still uncertainty as to the potential late toxicity of modern techniques, particularly in combination with chemotherapy. Increasingly numbers of patients are likely to be treated with initial CMT rather than RT alone to reduce relapse rates. The risk of leukaemia associated with CMT to patients with curable Hodgkin's disease appears to have been overestimated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Maher, E J']",['Maher EJ'],"['Mount Vernon Centre for Cancer Treatment, Mount Vernon Hospital, Northwood, Middlesex, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,IM,"['Combined Modality Therapy', 'Hodgkin Disease/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Staging']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 1991 Dec;5(4):214-9. doi: 10.1016/0268-960x(91)90011-z.,"['0268-960X(91)90011-Z [pii]', '10.1016/0268-960x(91)90011-z [doi]']",,,36,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was found that the total SH-group number in drug-resistant cells was increased (about 1.3-fold in comparison with sensitive cells) which seems to be due to the mechanisms of drug resistance. CHC 680578 induced less pronounced inhibition and more rapid restoration of DNA and RNA synthesis in resistant cells. No differences between the ribonucleotide reductase and thymidine kinase activities were found either in intact cells of the both strains or after drug administration. The efficiency of repair of DNA chloroethyl adducts by O6-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase in leukemia cells of various sensitivity was found to be identical. The differences in enzyme activities in intact cells of the both strains were insignificant. It was supposed that factors other than changes in the level of O6-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase in leukemia cells may be responsible for the resistance to CRC 680578.

The present study included 122 children with non-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with a median follow-up of 84 months. Leukopenia and hepatotoxicity were calculated as weighted means of all white cell counts and all serum aminotransferase measurements, respectively, registered for each patient. Forty-five patients relapsed (30 in bone marrow). Patients tolerating an average dose of MTX of more than 75% of the recommended protocol doses and having cumulated drug withdrawals of less than 1% of the period of maintenance therapy had an increased risk of hematological relapse (p = 0.008) as well as of any relapse (p = 0.03) when compared to the remaining patients. Patients with a cumulative withdrawal of MTX or of 6MP for greater than 10% of the maintenance therapy period had an increased risk of hematological relapse (MTX: p = 0.009, 6MP: p less than 0.0001) and of any relapse (MTX: p = 0.16, 6MP: p = 0.0002). Liver toxicity was the main reason for cumulative long-term drug withdrawals. However, patients with a mean aminotransferase level above the upper normal limit (40 IU/l) who were kept on therapy (cumulative withdrawals of neither drug for more than 5% of their maintenance therapy period) had a significantly lower risk of hematological relapse (p = 0.02) as well as of any relapse (p = 0.06) than the remaining children.

The current recommended conventional oral treatment regimen is a 4-drug combination of high-dose chloramphenicol, doxycycline and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole given for between 6 weeks and 6 months. We have evaluated prospectively the use of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid, to which Pseudomonas pseudomallei is consistently sensitive in vitro, for the oral maintenance treatment of melioidosis. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was used either as sole treatment of localized disease, or as maintenance therapy following either parenteral ceftazidime or the conventional 4-drug regime; 20 patients with localized infections and 26 with septicaemic melioidosis received a median of 7.5 (2-12) weeks treatment. After a mean follow-up period of 6 months (range 1-19), 31 patients (67%) remain free of disease. The drug was well tolerated. Three patients had fatal relapses, one other died suddenly at home, and another died from underlying promyelocytic leukaemia. The remaining 10 relapses were treated successfully. Resistance developed in one case. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid is a safe alternative to the conventional 4-drug antimicrobial combination for the oral treatment of melioidosis. It may be of particular value in children, pregnant women, and in infections with Ps. pseudomallei resistant to the potentially toxic conventional regimen, but the optimum dose and duration of therapy need to be established.","['Suputtamongkol, Y', 'Dance, D A', 'Chaowagul, W', 'Wattanagoon, Y', 'Wuthiekanun, V', 'White, N J']","['Suputtamongkol Y', 'Dance DA', 'Chaowagul W', 'Wattanagoon Y', 'Wuthiekanun V', 'White NJ']","['Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,7506129,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Amoxicillin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Amoxicillin-Potassium Clavulanate Combination', 'Bacteremia/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clavulanic Acids/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melioidosis/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 1991 Sep-Oct;85(5):672-5. doi: 10.1016/0035-9203(91)90391-b.,['10.1016/0035-9203(91)90391-b [doi]'],"['0 (Clavulanic Acids)', '74469-00-4 (Amoxicillin-Potassium Clavulanate Combination)', '804826J2HU (Amoxicillin)']",,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,

Carcinogenicity of motor fuels: gasoline.,143-52,"Studies in humans and animals have shown that gasoline contains a number of cancer-causing and toxic chemicals such as 1,3-butadiene, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, isoparaffins, methyltert-butylether, and others. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in its Monograph Supplement 7 (1987) concludes that ""in the absence of adequate data on humans, it is biologically plausible and prudent to regard agents for which there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals as if they present a carcinogenic risk to humans."" Epidemiological studies in humans provide important evidence of potential increased risk of leukemia, lymphatic tissue cancers, cancers of the brain, liver, and other organs and tissues. Recently (July, 1990) the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygiene (ACGIH) recommended that the TLV-TWA for benzene be reduced from 1 ppm to 0.1 ppm (ACGIH, 1990). The Collegium Ramazzini and others have also recommended that the exposure level for 1,3-Butadiene be reduced from 1,000 ppm to below 0.2 ppm. This recommendation is based on the findings that were presented at the Symposium on Toxicology, Carcinogenesis, and Human Health Aspects of 1,3-Butadiene (Environ. Health Perspec., 1990). Thus, studies on health effects resulting from very low levels of benzene, 1,3-butadiene, and other cancer-causing chemicals--components of gasoline--necessitate that all avoidable exposure to gasoline or gasoline vapors be avoided.","['Mehlman, M A']",['Mehlman MA'],"['UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Environmental and Community Medicine, Piscataway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Toxicol Ind Health,Toxicology and industrial health,8602702,IM,"['Benzene/adverse effects', 'Benzene Derivatives/adverse effects', 'Butadienes/adverse effects', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/*adverse effects', '*Chemical Industry', 'Gasoline/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Mutagens/adverse effects']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicol Ind Health. 1991 Sep-Nov;7(5-6):143-52. doi: 10.1177/074823379100700516.,['10.1177/074823379100700516 [doi]'],"['0 (Benzene Derivatives)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', '0 (Gasoline)', '0 (Mutagens)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cellular pharmacokinetics of ara-C are optimized at extracellular drug concentrations in the 10 to 15 mumol/L range. At these concentrations, transport rates are no longer rate-limiting, and ara-C phosphorylation capacity is saturated. The prime determinants of ara-C effect then shift to multiple intracellular events including anabolism to nucleotides, catabolism via deamination by Cyd-dCyd deaminase and dCMP deaminase, half-life of ara-CTP, the extent of incorporation into DNA, and the half-life of ara-CMP residues in DNA. It is postulated that at these high doses an additional effect of ara-C occurs on the cell membrane through affects on membrane phospholipid synthesis. This effect may contribute to the brisk cell lysis associated with HiDaC treatment. When administered as repetitive doses of 3 g/m2 over a 1- to 3-hour period, systemic deamination of ara-C gives rise to high plasma concentrations of ara-U. This metabolite has a long plasma half-life and, at least in the mouse, is concentrated in the liver and kidneys. High concentrations in these organs retard the further catabolism of ara-C and thus increase the systemic AUC providing a longer exposure period to the drug. A similar mechanism may obtain in patients treated with HiDaC. The observed decreased clearance of ara-C when administered in gram versus milligram doses and the long-terminal gamma-phase in plasma clearance of the drug associated with HiDaC usage quite probably reflects this effect of ara-U in patients. Additionally, by some as yet unknown mechanism, high concentrations of ara-U cause accumulation of leukemia cells in S-phase, the phase of the cell cycle wherein ara-C is maximally effective. This effect of ara-U may add to the cytokinetic effects initiated by rapid cytoreduction, which summate in the observed enhancement of the proliferative fraction of residual leukemia cells on day 8. The effect of a second course of therapy at this time is thereby enhanced. These dose-related and metabolite-drug interactions that occur when ara-C is given at high doses constitute a means for ""self-potentiation"" and may thus contribute to its overall therapeutic efficacy.","['Capizzi, R L', 'White, J C', 'Powell, B L', 'Perrino, F']","['Capizzi RL', 'White JC', 'Powell BL', 'Perrino F']","['Department of Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University, Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC. 27103.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,IM,"['Animals', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 1991 Jul;28(3 Suppl 4):54-69.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,100,['CA 12197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

More than 10(5) copies of DNA sequence ranging from 50 bp to 7 kb can be synthesized in a couple of hours. Ever since its development, PCR has attracted much attention because this strategy would allow the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) at a very low level. The first successful application of this ultra-sensitive technique was the detection of residual tumor cells carrying a 14;18 translocation in follicular lymphoma. The abnormal transcripts caused by 9;22 translocation in chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) was also exploited for the amplification to detect the MRD. These techniques have successfully shown the detection of one leukemic cell in 100,000 normal cells. Besides leukemic specific sequences caused by chromosome and gene translocations, unique sequences caused by rearrangements in IgH or TCR gamma, delta chain genes have been used as clonal markers for tumor cells. By targetting these sequences for PCR amplification, almost all ALL patients can be analyzed for MRD.

On the other hand, considerable progress has been made recently in treating acute leukemia with chemotherapy. Recent studies of intensive chemotherapy in adults with AML report approximately 40-50% 3-year disease-free survival (DFS). Accordingly, several prospective randomized clinical trials have been conducted on the use of BMT versus intensive chemotherapy in the treatment of AML. Significant differences in DFS were found only in a few studies though the results of BMT appear to be comparable or superior to chemotherapy. Therefore, the overall advantage of BMT in first remission AML is smaller than expected. We should know not whether to transplant or to perform chemotherapy, but rather whether to transplant in first remission or to perform chemotherapy first and reserve transplantation as salvage therapy. Recently acute promyelocytic leukemia has been successfully treated with differentiation therapy using all-trans retinoic acid. Low-dose aclarubicin has also been reported to be effective as differentiation therapy in some patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and atypical AML. With the advance of molecular biology of cytokines, several of them are now available for clinical use. G-CSF, GM-CSF and M-CSF are potent stimulators for the granulocyte-macrophage production; they are very effective for accelerating hematologic recovery after chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression or BMT. Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) has been used in the several studies.

Gene analysis is useful to determine the clonality and the lineage of malignant cells. However, 10-30% cases appeared bigenotype. In some cases, oligoclonalities were recognized. The relationship to the prognosis in these cases was discussed. The development of gamma delta- and alpha beta-cells on T-cell ontogeny was elucidated. Some T-cell leukemic lines were found to be pre-alpha beta T-cells with some consensus characteristics. We also analyzed the V beta family of 15 alpha beta T-cell leukemia cell lines using six V beta cDNA probes. This approach may be useful to determine the clonality of T-cell malignancies. The method of using a PCR system on immunoassociated genes has been described.

The Okinawan migrants have acquired fewer cancers than men from other prefectures (P = 0.12). No one primary site accounts for this difference. Stomach cancer rates showed the largest difference between the two migrant groups. This replicates the experience of Okinawans and non-Okinawans in Japan itself. Lymphosarcoma mortality rates are much higher in Okinawa than in all Japan, but this difference is not reproduced in Hawaiian migrants. This could be explained by a post migrational decrease in HTLV-I-related acute T-cell lymphoma/leukemia. Cancer of the mouth, pharynx and esophagus has decreased in all Japanese migrants, but the decrease is much greater among Okinawan migrants, suggesting they have escaped exposure to risk factors peculiar to the Okinawan environment.

Of 118 eligible patients, 114 attained complete remission and 82 maintained continuous complete remission (CCR) for at least 3 years, completing the entire S811 regimen. Among the latter, 74 patients received LIT with HD-MTX between 2-3 years after CCR onset. MTX (2,000 mg/m2 per dose per week) was administered by 24 h infusion and three doses were given every 12 weeks. Leucovorin rescue (15 mg/m2 i.v.) every 6 h was initiated 12 h after the end of MTX infusion for seven doses. As regular maintenance chemotherapy, intermittent (Regimen A) or continuous (Regimen B) MTX plus 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) combined with pulses of prednisolone and vincristine was administered (Koizumi S, Fujimoto T, Takeda T, et al. Cancer 1988; 61: 1292-1300). Retrospective analysis revealed that patients on Regimen A who started LIT earlier (within 2 years of CCR onset (n = 23)) showed a higher rate of event-free survival (EFS) at 8 years (95.5% +/- 4.4%, mean +/- S.E.) than patients who started LIT later (2.5 years after CCR onset (n = 18, 66.2% +/- 11.3%, p less than 0.01)). In addition, the superiority of four or five courses of the LIT (n = 39) as compared to 2 or 3 courses (n = 35) was noted for both regimens.

These results indicated that an isoprenoid pathway intermediate, very likely an isoprenylated protein, is importantly involved in the control of IgE receptor-mediated signal transduction. Here, we show that 20 h of pretreatment with lovastatin also inhibits antigen-induced secretion and membrane responses in streptolysin O-(SLO)-permeabilized cells. However, lovastatin does not inhibit secretion stimulated by the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, GTP gamma S. Furthermore, the membrane responses to GTP gamma S persist, although in an attenuated form, in lovastatin-treated permeabilized cells. The relative insensitivity of GTP gamma S-induced responses to lovastatin was one of several indications that antigen and GTP gamma S may activate separate pathways leading to transmembrane responses in permeabilized cells. Further experiments showed that the beta-thio derivative of GDP, GDPBAS, inhibits the secretory and membrane responses to GTP gamma S, as expected for a GTP-binding protein-dependent signaling pathway, while having little effect on antigen-induced responses. Conversely, genistein blocks the secretory and membrane responses to antigen, as expected for a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway, without altering the GTP gamma S-induced responses. From these results, and from additional data from cells treated with tyrphostins and sodium orthovanadate, we propose that IgE receptor-mediated secretion from permeabilized RBL-2H3 cells occurs by a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway that requires isoprenoid pathway activity for function. We propose further that RBL-2H3 cells contain a separate GTP-binding protein-mediated signaling pathway whose direct activation by GTP gamma S is either independent of isoprenoid pathway activity or depends on the activity of an isoprenylated protein that is not significantly depleted after 20 h of lovastatin treatment.","['Deanin, G G', 'Pfeiffer, J R', 'Cutts, J L', 'Fore, M L', 'Oliver, J M']","['Deanin GG', 'Pfeiffer JR', 'Cutts JL', 'Fore ML', 'Oliver JM']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque 87131, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Regul,Cell regulation,9005331,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/pharmacology"", 'Lovastatin/pharmacology', 'Mast Cells/drug effects', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Models, Biological', 'Polyisoprenyl Phosphates/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/metabolism']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Regul. 1991 Aug;2(8):627-40. doi: 10.1091/mbc.2.8.627.,['10.1091/mbc.2.8.627 [doi]'],"['0 (Polyisoprenyl Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,['GM-37202/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC361853,,,,,,,,,

These distinctions are vital to the entire spectrum of basic and clinical research involving hematologic malignancies and are assuming an increasingly important role in their diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.","['Vaickus, L', 'Ball, E D', 'Foon, K A']","['Vaickus L', 'Ball ED', 'Foon KA']","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/classification/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Lymphoma/classification/*immunology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/immunology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/immunology']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 1991 Dec;11(4):267-97. doi: 10.1016/1040-8428(91)90029-c.,"['1040-8428(91)90029-C [pii]', '10.1016/1040-8428(91)90029-c [doi]']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,385,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Ad-HL60 cells have a more differentiated phenotype than the non-adherent cells from which they were derived, and synthesized 1.88 +/- 0.07 (+/- S.E.M.) pmol 24,25-(OH)2D3/h per 10(6) cells following culture in RPMI-1640 medium containing less than 0.02 nM 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3. They also synthesized 1.66 +/- 0.05 pmol 24,25-(OH)2D3/h per 10(6) cells following culture in 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3-free medium supplemented with 1 g bovine serum albumin/l instead of 10% serum. In contrast, non-adherent HL60 cells required exposure to 10-100 nM 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 to induce equivalent 24,25-(OH)2D3 synthesis. The 25-(OH)D3-24-hydroxylase expressed by Ad-HL60 cells had an apparent Michaelis constant of 1 microM and maximal rate of 20 pmol/h per 10(6) cells with substrate concentrations from 0.012 to 1.2 microM/incubation (5-500 ng/ml). Furthermore, 24,25-(OH)2D3 synthesis was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by ketoconazole (0.01-10 microM), suggesting that the enzyme is cytochrome P-450 dependent. Ad-HL60 cells expressed approximately 3500 specific receptors for 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3/cell with a dissociation constant of 40 pM. Following exposure to 0.1-100 nM 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3, Ad-HL60 cell proliferation was significantly inhibited compared with controls grown in medium containing less than 0.02 nM 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 for 96 h. Expression of 25-(OH)D3-24-hydroxylase was also inhibited in a dose- and time-dependent manner; however, expression of nonspecific esterase was not induced. Both of these findings are contrary to those previously demonstrated for non-adherent HL60 cells, whereas the dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation by 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 occurs in both adherent and non-adherent phenotypes. These observations on Ad-HL60 cells represent the first description of a cell type in which 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 appears to inhibit 25-(OH)D3-24-hydroxylase activity. The Ad-HL60 cells also constitutively metabolized 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 in a manner consistent with formation of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 without previous exposure to 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3. In contrast, many other cell types, including non-adherent HL60 cells, require exposure to 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 to induce metabolism of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 to 1 alpha,24,25-(OH)3D3, a reaction that represents the initial step for catabolism of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 to calcitroic acid.","['Hayes, M E', 'Bayley, D', 'Mawer, E B']","['Hayes ME', 'Bayley D', 'Mawer EB']","['University Department of Medicine, Royal Infirmary, Manchester.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Endocrinol,Journal of molecular endocrinology,8902617,IM,"['Calcitriol/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ketoconazole/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Steroid Hydroxylases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Mol Endocrinol. 1991 Dec;7(3):185-95. doi: 10.1677/jme.0.0070185.,['10.1677/jme.0.0070185 [doi]'],"['0 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.- (Steroid Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.15.16 (Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'R9400W927I (Ketoconazole)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To be active, DNA must be double-stranded with an average size of 300 base pairs, but shows no apparent species- or sequence-specificity. NP-72 isolated from control or PMA-treated nuclei with 1 mM ATP lacked phosphorylating activity, suggesting it to be a substrate for a dsDNA-stimulated protein kinase(s). Simultaneous exposure of HL-60 cells to PMA and the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine diminished the phosphorylation of NP-72.

All remained in first remission and were treated with either 1800 or 2400 cGy of cranial irradiation. None had been treated with either testicular or spinal irradiation. Ninety three (51 boys, 42 girls) were treated with 2400 cGy and 89 (42 boys, 47 girls) were treated with 1800 cGy cranial irradiation. All patients were treated with standard chemotherapy including intrathecal methotrexate in similar dose regimens in either group. Mean age (SD) at diagnosis in the group treated with 2400 cGy was 4.8 (2.6) years and mean age in the group treated with 1800 cGy was 6.5 (3.3) years. Mean height SD score at diagnosis in the 2400 cGy group was +0.29 and final height achieved was -0.63. Mean height SD score at the start of treatment in the group treated with 1800 cGy was +0.40 and mean final height was -0.53. There was a similar reduction in height SD score in both groups during the pubertal growth spurt. The decrement in height SD score was greater when treatment was administered at less than 7 years of age in either dose regimen, both in prepubertal and pubertal growth. However, the decrease in height SD score was found to be greater in girls than boys. There was a trend in both sexes for the onset of puberty to be at a younger age with a lower treatment dose of radiotherapy. However, in girls treated with the lower dose regimen there was a significant reduction in the mean age of onset of puberty which was 9.9 years. Our data suggest that girls treated at less than 7 years of age have a severe impairment of pubertal growth, which is probably a combination of the dual endocrinopathy of premature puberty and growth hormone insufficiency.","['Uruena, M', 'Stanhope, R', 'Chessells, J M', 'Leiper, A D']","['Uruena M', 'Stanhope R', 'Chessells JM', 'Leiper AD']","['Institute of Child Health, London.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Body Height/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', 'Puberty/*radiation effects', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1991 Dec;66(12):1403-7. doi: 10.1136/adc.66.12.1403.,['10.1136/adc.66.12.1403 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC1793357,,,,,,,,,

Using the 51Cr release assay, the four compounds were endowed with cytotoxic activity, in a concentration-dependent fashion, against various human tumor cell lines of different histological origin. Two different mechanisms appear to be involved in the AALP-mediated cytotoxicity. A rapid membrane damaging effect was observed in less than one hour's incubation of tumor cells with AALP and cytotoxicity was temperature-independent when AALP were used at greater than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml. A slower cytotoxic mechanism was observed after 18 hours incubation at 37 degrees C when AALP were used at concentrations of 30-100 micrograms/ml. The pattern and magnitube of the cytotoxic activity achieved with all the 4 AALP compounds tested were similar and the cytotoxicity mediated by combination of two compounds was additive. In addition to the cytotoxic effect, the AALP compounds also exerted a cytostatic anti-tumor effect, as assessed by inhibition of 3H TdR incorporation. Using a variety of human tumor cell lines as targets, the cytotoxic effect observed with the AALP was noted with tumor cells that were either sensitive or resistant to TNF-alpha and/or chemotherapeutic drugs such as mitomycin C, adriamycin and cis-platinum. The LD50 toxicity in mice was 100-125 mg/kg. The present findings demonstrate that AALP are cytotoxic to a variety of human tumor cell lines and do not appear to discriminate between drug/cytokine sensitive or resistant cells.

It is located in both B and T lymphocytes and its study is of interest in chronic lymphoproliferative diseases. The present work compiles the cytochemical study of lymphocyte 5'-nucleotidase in a control group consisting of 277 haematologically normal subjects and a series of 77 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) patients; phenotypic studies had been carried out in 40 of these last. The results were expressed as percentage of 5'-nucleotidase positive lymphocytes, and the value (means +/- SD) for the control group was 25 +/- 7, that of the CLL group being 10.7 +/- 18.12. Increased lymphocyte 5'-nucleotidase was present in a minority of the cases (13%), but the significance of this finding is unknown and unrelated to any clinical or cytomorphological data. Although lacking any statistical value, those B-CLL lymphocytes expressing surface IgM and IgD (thus being more mature cells) showed higher 5'-nucleotidase values than those cells expressing only IgM. This finding suggests that a given lymphocytic population would be more immature the lower 5'-nucleotidase value it may express. The incorporation of 5'-nucleotidase determination into the cytochemical study of CLL is encouraged as it is frequently decreased in this disease; at the same time, the enzyme may provide some information on the maturity of the leukaemic population involved.","['Woessner, S', 'Almarcha, J', 'Marill, M R', 'Florensa, L', 'Besses, C', 'Sans Sabrafen, J']","['Woessner S', 'Almarcha J', 'Marill MR', 'Florensa L', 'Besses C', 'Sans Sabrafen J']","['Hospital Central La Alianca, Barcelona.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/*analysis"", 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*enzymology/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1991 Aug;36(4):301-4.,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)""]",Deteccion citoquimica de la 5'nucleotidasa linfocitaria en la leucemia linfatica cronica.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report 7 cases here of a more rare complication, that of bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). Between December 1979 and November 1989, 7 patients (3.4% of our cases of GMO) have developed over several months a chronic obstructive respiratory failure (a mean VEMS of 43% of the theoretical value) in the year following the transplantation (mean delay 190 days). 6 patients presented with cutaneous, digestive or hepatic signs of chronic graft v host illness (GVH) whereas the prevalence of this complication in the population studied was 17%. Treatment combining bronchodilators and immunosuppressants was only successful in 2 cases and the outcome was fatal in the 5 other cases as a result of respiratory failure (mean delay 208 days between the appearance of respiratory symptoms and death). The pathogenesis of BO after GMO remains poorly understood. It may rest on an immune process during the course of which the BO would be the result of a chronic pulmonary GVH. Another hypothesis is that the state of the immunosuppression in these patients would favour the appearance of a bronchiolitis of an infectious origin, particularly viral. The prognosis of BO after GMO is very poor and in the absence of specific effective treatment the therapeutic strategy remains essentially that of prevention by the early detection of respiratory anomalies.","['Philit, F', 'Wiesendanger, T', 'Guyotat, D', 'Troncy, J', 'Fiere, D', 'Cordier, J F']","['Philit F', 'Wiesendanger T', 'Guyotat D', 'Troncy J', 'Fiere D', 'Cordier JF']","['Service de Pneumologie, Hopital Louis-Pradel, Lyon.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Rev Mal Respir,Revue des maladies respiratoires,8408032,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Bronchiolitis Obliterans/diagnosis/*epidemiology/immunology', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/*epidemiology/immunology', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lung Diseases, Obstructive/diagnosis/*epidemiology/immunology', 'Male', 'Postoperative Complications/diagnosis/*epidemiology/immunology', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Radiography, Thoracic', 'Respiratory Function Tests', 'Survival Rate']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rev Mal Respir. 1991;8(6):567-73.,,['0 (Immunoglobulin G)'],Bronchiolite obliterante avec trouble ventilatoire obstructif severe apres allogreffe de moelle osseuse.

The velocity of flow was faster in precapillary arterioles, slower in capillaries, and again faster in postcapillary venules. The dots were much more numerous in an eye with leukemia and less numerous in an eye with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Staining of whole blood from three healthy persons with fluorescein sodium resulted in prompt and intense staining of leukocytes and platelets.

Role of a myc expression vector in rescuing pKC dependent mitogenesis.,1099-109,"The signaling pathways used by interleukin-3 (IL-3) and by active phorbol ester (12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate, TPA) to stimulate mitogenesis in the growth factor dependent myeloid cell line FDC-P1 were studied by 'reporter' analysis of nuclear proto-oncogene expression. These studies revealed that IL-3 strongly stimulated c-myc expression by a transcriptional mechanism but IL-3 poorly stimulated c-jun expression, a measure of protein kinase C dependent signals. On the other hand, the protein kinase C agonist, TPA, strongly activated c-jun expression but poorly promoted expression (transcription) of c-myc in FDC-P1. These findings appeared to correlate with the poor mitogenic capacity of TPA for FDC-P1. However, stable transfection of FDC-P1 with a c-myc expression vector driven by a human methallothionein IIA promoter containing the TPA responsive element (TRE), led to a cell clone, FDMT myc.A1, in which TPA mediated selective transcription of the transfected TRE driven c-myc vector and down-regulated expression of the endogenous c-myc gene. IL-3 selectively failed to stimulate expression of the TRE driven c-myc vector in FDMT myc.A1. Augmented TPA dependent vector derived c-myc expression was accompanied by enhanced mitogenesis of the cell line FDMT myc.A1 compared with FDC-P1. In addition, TPA mediated expression of the transfected c-myc gene in FDMT myc.A1 was accompanied by augmented transcription of c-jun and c-fos in response to TPA. These studies show the importance of a non-protein kinase C dependent pathway for IL-3 mediated c-myc transcription. However, these studies reveal that protein kinase C mediated pathways can be promitogenic, especially when complemented by unregulated c-myc expression (in this case driven by an alternative, TRE containing promoter).","['Nahreini, T S', 'Litz-Jackson, S', 'Burgess, G S', 'Helvering, L M', 'Manolagas, S C', 'Boswell, H S']","['Nahreini TS', 'Litz-Jackson S', 'Burgess GS', 'Helvering LM', 'Manolagas SC', 'Boswell HS']","['Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, jun', 'Genes, myc', 'Genetic Vectors', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Dec;5(12):1099-109.,,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,"['AI21761/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 45571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

There were 18 patients with refractory anemia (RA), eight RA with ringed-sideroblast (RARS), 30 RA with excess of blasts (RAEB), 18 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and 28 RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T). Patients with MDS had a significantly lower number of GM colonies and a significantly higher cluster to colony ratio than those of normal controls and patients with cytopenias of other causes. Six in vitro growth patterns were observed; 85% of patients with MDS showed various abnormal growth patterns, and 42% of all MDS patients exhibited a leukemic growth pattern at diagnosis. None of the 40 patients with cytopenias of other causes had a leukemic type growth. A leukemic growth pattern was rarely observed in patients with RA and RARS (4%), but was common in other subgroups (57%). The distribution of various growth patterns was not statistically different among patients with RAEB, CMML, and RAEB-T. Thirty-six patients developed acute leukemia during the follow-up period. The MDS patients with leukemic type growth were at increased risk of rapid progression to acute leukemia, and they also had a shorter survival time than patients with a non-leukemic pattern. These results showed that simply scoring the number of CFU-GM is of limited value for the diagnosis and the prediction of prognosis of MDS, whereas the in vitro marrow culture growth pattern is of prognostic significance independently of the FAB classification. It is concluded that the in vitro growth pattern of marrow CFU-GM is helpful in diagnosing patients with MDS as well as in predicting their clinical outcome.","['Shih, L Y', 'Chiu, W F', 'Lee, C T']","['Shih LY', 'Chiu WF', 'Lee CT']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung Medical College, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis', 'Preleukemia/diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Dec;5(12):1092-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seven of 23 patients with T-ALL had ganglioside immunophenotypes similar to that of pre-B-ALL, i.e. R24-M2590- or R24-M2590+. These subclasses could not be further characterized by additional cell surface immunophenotypic markers or by gene (immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor) rearrangement analysis. The ratio R24/M2590 was less than 1.0 in all patients with pre-B-ALL, and was greater than 1.0 in all patients with T-ALL who were R24 positive, but was not useful in characterizing the double negative T-ALL subclass. To assess whether cryptogenicity of gangliosides due to cell surface protein could account for the low binding of either R24 or M2590, blasts were treated with trypsin before antibody analysis. Whereas the binding of R24 was unchanged after trypsin treatment, binding of M2590 was increased in a number of samples, particularly in those samples which were originally M2590-positive. The results show that comparative staining of T-ALL and pre-B-ALL cells with both anti-GD3 and anti-GM3/SPG antibodies results in a further subclassification of ALL and provides a quantitative assessment of the expression of tumor-associated gangliosides on the blasts of this disease.","['Merritt, W D', 'Sztein, M B', 'Taylor, B', 'Reaman, G H']","['Merritt WD', 'Sztein MB', 'Taylor B', 'Reaman GH']","[""Center for Hematology/Oncology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC 20010.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Child', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G(M3) Ganglioside/*immunology', 'Gangliosides/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/analysis', 'Trypsin/pharmacology']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Dec;5(12):1087-91.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (G(M3) Ganglioside)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '62010-37-1 (ganglioside, GD3)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pharmacokinetics of all-trans RA given by mouth were studied in 15 AML3 patients. Blood samples were drawn for 24 h following a single oral dose of 45 mg/m2 and assayed for all-trans RA and 13-cis retinoic acid (13-cis RA) plasma concentrations by specific high-performance liquid chromatography. In one patient all-trans RA and 13-cis RA levels were below the detection limits at all times. In the other patients, the time to peak concentration of all-trans RA was between 60 and 210 min (median 90 min) after ingestion, with maximum concentrations between 0.03 and 2.5 micrograms/ml (median 0.4 micrograms/ml). These concentrations were within the in vitro differentiating concentration range of all-trans RA for these patients' cells. In nine patients, enterohepatic cycling was suggested by the presence on the concentration versus time curve of a secondary peak that occurred at meal times. The apparent plasma elimination half-life was between 16.8 and 77.4 min (median 30 min). Detectable plasma levels of 13-cis RA in 12 patients indicated in vivo isomerization of all-trans RA.

The percentage of cells in S-phase and the proliferative fraction (PF = %S + %G2M) were determined by flow cytometry after dual labeling with bromodeoxyuridine and propidium iodide. Prior to pheresis the median %S and PF were 5.4 and 15.4%, respectively. The median change in %S was +2.5% (range -5.5 to +18.8) with increases greater than or equal to 3.7% in 4/8 patients. The median change in PF was +6.1% (range -13.8 to +25.3) with an increase of greater than or equal to 3.6% in 6/8 patients. The median absolute changes of 2.5 and 6.1% represent increases of 47% for %S and 40% for PF compared to the day 1 (pre-pheresis) median values. As the number of nucleoside transporters in the cell membrane [nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside (NBMPR) binding sites] has been related to the percentage of cells in S-phase and to cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) cellular pharmacology, these were also measured before and after leukapheresis. Changes in the number of NBMPR binding sites varied widely with a median increase of 365 sites per cell (range -26,061 to +10,396). The change in NBMPR sites was significantly and positively correlated with changes in %S (r = 0.829, p = 0.042). These data suggest that mechanical cytoreduction by leukapheresis can increase the fraction of leukemia cells in S-phase and the PF in some patients with AML. The increase in %S is accompanied by an increase in NBMPR binding sites per cell. These changes in leukemia cell characteristics would be expected to result in an increase in efficacy of ara-C or other S-phase specific agents.","['Powell, B L', 'Gregory, B W', 'Evans, J K', 'White, J C', 'Lyerly, E S', 'Chorley, H M', 'Russell, G B', 'Capizzi, R L']","['Powell BL', 'Gregory BW', 'Evans JK', 'White JC', 'Lyerly ES', 'Chorley HM', 'Russell GB', 'Capizzi RL']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University, Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157-1082.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/*therapy', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins', 'Thioinosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Dec;5(12):1037-42.,,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)']",,,"['CA-12197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-03596/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Compound 2 was also end-capped with 4-hydroxythiophenol, thus introducing a terminal moiety suitable for radio-iodination using the chloramine T method (4). Such polymers behave as bases in aqueous solution, and their net average charge alters considerably as the pH changes from 7.4 to 5.5. This results in a change in polymer conformation which may prove useful in the design of polymeric drug delivery systems. However, their suitability for use in the organism will depend on polymer toxicity and also on their rate of biodegradation. Here we studied the biological properties of the above poly(amidoamine)s with a view to optimizing the synthesis of novel drug carriers. The general cytotoxicity of compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 was examined in vitro using two human cell lines, hepatoma (HepG2) and a lymphoblastoid leukaemia (CCRF). Several different methods [the tetrazolium (MTT) test, [3H]leucine or [3H]thymidine incorporation, or counting cell numbers] were used to measure cell viability. Compounds 1, 2, and 4 were much less toxic to both cell lines than equivalent concentrations of the polycationic poly-L-lysine, and in no case did viability fall below 50% (concentrations up to 2 mg/ml). Although compound 2 was not markedly toxic to HepG2 cells, concentration-dependent toxicity was observed against CCRF cells. In this case, the polymer concentration decreasing viability by 59% (ID50) was approximately 50 micrograms/ml for compound 2 compared with an ID50 of approximately 10 micrograms/ml for poly-L-lysine. The rate of hydrolytic degradation of compound 2 was examined using viscometric measurements and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). After incubation at pH 7.5 and 8.0 for 24 h, polymer intrinsic viscosity was decreased by approximately 50% and GPC elution profiles showed a simultaneous increase in polymer retention time, indicating a fall in molecular weight. Hydrolytic degradation progressed much more slowly at pH 5.5. Compound 4 was also incubated with a mixture of isolated rat liver lysosomal enzymes (tritosomes) at pH 5.5, but no increase in the rate of degradation was observed.","['Ranucci, E', 'Spagnoli, G', 'Ferruti, P', 'Sgouras, D', 'Duncan, R']","['Ranucci E', 'Spagnoli G', 'Ferruti P', 'Sgouras D', 'Duncan R']","['Dipartimento di Ingegneria Meccanica, Universita di Brescia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biomater Sci Polym Ed,Journal of biomaterials science.

A report by the EBMT Leukaemia Working Party.,567-74,"Ninety second bone marrow transplants (BMT) for relapsed leukaemia were carried out in 30 European BMT centres. At second BMT, after further treatment in 64 cases, 43 patients were in complete remission or in chronic phase of CML, and 47 were in continuing relapse, accelerated phase or blast crisis of CML. Seventy patients died, 37 from early transplant-related toxicity and relapse or failure to eradicate leukaemia which occurred in 23. There were 20 survivors. The actuarial disease-free survival was 11% with a relapse probability of 69% at 3 years. Associated with reduced graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis during second BMT, the incidence and severity of acute and chronic GVHD, was increased when compared with the first BMT (P = 0.02, and 0.002 respectively for acute and chronic GVHD). In multivariate analysis survival was shown to be favoured by a prolonged interval between first and second BMT (relative risk 1.3/year, P = 0.02), and no or mild chronic GVHD following first BMT (relative risk 2.3, P = 0.02).

We have studied 14 acute myeloid (AML) and four acute lymphoid (ALL) leukaemias. All ALL and the vast majority of AML (12/14) had a high sensitivity to quercetin with more than 50% growth inhibition at 2 x 10(-6) M quercetin. One M3-AML was partially quercetin-sensitive displaying 60% surviving AML-colony forming units (CFU-AML) at a quercetin concentration of 10(-5) M. One M1-AML was resistant to the growth inhibitory effect of quercetin at a concentration of 2 x 10(-5) M. The clonogenic efficiency of both AML and ALL positively correlated with leukaemic colony-forming unit (CFU-L) sensitivity to quercetin suggesting that this parameter can be useful in predicting quercetin responsiveness of leukaemic cells. We have also studied the effect of various quercetin concentrations on colony formation by normal bone marrow cells. At a quercetin concentration of 10(-5) M, we observed (in five different experiments) a mean recovery of 53% and 65% of erythroid blast-forming units (BFU-E) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM), respectively. Thus, normal bone marrow appeared partially resistant to quercetin, being inhibited less than 50% by quercetin concentration higher than 2 x 10(-5). When normal bone marrow were deprived in CD34+ haematopoietic progenitors the resultant population became highly sensitive to quercetin, with a mean recovery of BFU-E and CFU-GM of 5% and 12% of controls respectively in the presence of 2 x 10(-5) M quercetin. Furthermore, CD34 progenitors, positively selected, appeared fully resistant to quercetin concentrations as high as 2 x 10(-5) M. Thus, CD34+ progenitors are a quercetin-resistant component in normal bone marrow. In conclusion, our results further provide a biological basis for the therapeutic use of quercetin, considering that this compound could inhibit leukaemic cell growth without suppressing normal haematopoiesis.","['Larocca, L M', 'Teofili, L', 'Leone, G', 'Sica, S', 'Pierelli, L', 'Menichella, G', 'Scambia, G', 'Benedetti Panici, P', 'Ricci, R', 'Piantelli, M']","['Larocca LM', 'Teofili L', 'Leone G', 'Sica S', 'Pierelli L', 'Menichella G', 'Scambia G', 'Benedetti Panici P', 'Ricci R', 'Piantelli M', 'et al.']","['Istituti di Anatomia Patologica, Universita Cattolica S.

PAI-1 and PAI-2 antigens were measured by an enzyme-linked immunoassay. The PAI-1 antigen, however, became detectable only after stimulation. The presence of PAI-2 antigen was further verified by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody against PAI-2 purified from a PL-21 culture medium. PAI activity both in the culture medium and in the cell lysate increased approximately 70-fold after exposure to PMA. Both PAI-1 and PAI-2 antigens increased, but the amount of the latter in the culture medium and in the cell lysate was approximately 10 times and 2,500 times, as much, respectively, as that of the former. Dex also increased the intracellular PAI activity approximately 6-fold, parallel with PAI-2 antigen. PAI-1 antigen increased only slightly in the culture medium but not in the cell lysate after Dex-stimulation. As with the case of PMA, TNF-alpha and IL-6 induced PL-21 cells to macrophage-like cells, but did not affect the PAI activity.

Pentoxifylline (PTX) is a non-toxic methylxanthine used clinically for the treatment of intermittent claudication. It is an active haemorheological agent, used for the treatment of defective microcirculation. In the present study, we employed PTX as a drug response modulator in combination with DOX to achieve increased cytotoxicity in human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. Inhibition of 3H-TdR incorporation was used as a measure of cytotoxicity. PTX at 100 microM concentration significantly (P less than 0.001) potentiated DOX-mediated DNA biosynthesis inhibition in CML cells in vitro. Significant synergistic inhibition was seen in 13 out of 22 CML samples. Decreased DOX accumulation is a characteristic feature of DOX resistant tumor cell lines. Drug accumulation studies demonstrated that PTX significantly (P less than 0.02) increased the intracellular accumulation of DOX in the CML cells. The enhanced DOX accumulation can be a mechanism of increased cytotoxicity by DOX-PTX combination.","['Viladkar, A', 'Juvekar, A', 'Chitnis, M', 'Advani, S']","['Viladkar A', 'Juvekar A', 'Chitnis M', 'Advani S']","['Chemotherapy Division, Tata Memorial Hospital, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Bombay, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Sel Cancer Ther,Selective cancer therapeutics,8912502,IM,"['Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Pentoxifylline/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Sel Cancer Ther. 1991 Fall;7(3):119-26. doi: 10.1089/sct.1991.7.119.,['10.1089/sct.1991.7.119 [doi]'],"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'SD6QCT3TSU (Pentoxifylline)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both drugs have been used for the treatment of gastric complications of chemotherapy. Using a randomized, double-blind, crossover study design, we have now evaluated the potential interaction of ranitidine with cyclophosphamide in seven cancer patients, who received two courses of cyclophosphamide, one with ranitidine and one with placebo. Four patients received ranitidine in the first course, and three received placebo. Ranitidine or placebo was started 3 days before a single dose of cyclophosphamide and given for 17 consecutive days. Ranitidine or placebo was given orally (300 mg/d), and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) was given intravenously with [3H]cyclophosphamide (1000 muCi). Cyclophosphamide treatment was repeated at 4 weeks plus or minus 4 days. Blood samples were collected at intervals from 5 minutes to 24 hours after cyclophosphamide treatment and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography and radioassay for the drug and its metabolites. On days 0, 7, 14, and 21 after cyclophosphamide administration, complete blood cell counts, white blood cell differential counts, platelet counts, and SMA-17 were determined. The differences in mean nadir white blood cell counts, granulocyte counts, hemoglobin levels, and hematocrit values during ranitidine versus placebo treatment were not statistically significant. In a statistical but not a clinical sense, mean nadir platelet counts were significantly lower with ranitidine. There was a statistically significant increase in area under the curve for drug concentration in plasma x time (AUC) with ranitidine as well as a statistically significant decrease in the total-body clearance rate of the cyclophosphamide molecule. However, the effect on AUC for the major oncolytic metabolites 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide and phosphoramide mustard was not statistically significant. The lack of toxicologic or metabolic interaction between ranitidine and cyclophosphamide suggests that ranitidine can be used safely with cyclophosphamide.","['Alberts, D S', 'Mason-Liddil, N', 'Plezia, P M', 'Roe, D J', 'Dorr, R T', 'Struck, R F', 'Phillips, J G']","['Alberts DS', 'Mason-Liddil N', 'Plezia PM', 'Roe DJ', 'Dorr RT', 'Struck RF', 'Phillips JG']","['Department of Medicine, Arizona Cancer Center, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona, Tucson.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Cell Count/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cyclophosphamide/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Humans', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Ranitidine/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use']",1991/12/04 00:00,1991/12/04 00:01,['1991/12/04 00:00'],"['1991/12/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/04 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/04 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1991 Dec 4;83(23):1739-42. doi: 10.1093/jnci/83.23.1739.,['10.1093/jnci/83.23.1739 [doi]'],"['884KT10YB7 (Ranitidine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,"['CA-17094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-46951/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Increased enzyme activity was not due to nonspecific leukocyte stimulation or to the presence of a malignancy, since normal enzyme activity was observed in subjects with either viral illnesses or solid tumors. Increased HMG-CoA reductase activity accompanying hematologic malignancy could also not be attributed to alterations in enzyme-substrate kinetic parameters (Km), or to alterations in the phosphorylation state or thiol-disulfide status of the enzyme, nor was it correlated with differences in serum lipid or lipoprotein concentrations. The increase (3.6-fold) in HMG-CoA reductase activity in leukocytes from patients with preleukemia was due entirely to a rise in enzyme catalytic efficiency (specific activity), whereas the increase (4.3-fold) observed in leukocytes from patients with overt leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was due to a concomitant increase in both enzyme catalytic efficiency (2.5-fold) and enzyme protein concentration (1.6-fold). Similar increases in HMG-CoA reductase activity and catalytic efficiency were also noted for both transformed, nonmalignant, and malignant cultured leukocytes, suggesting that increased enzyme catalytic efficiency is not a nonspecific consequence of physiological changes occurring in response to the malignancy but may be an integral aspect of the malignant phenotype. HMG-CoA reductase protein concentrations, however, were not elevated in either transformed, nonmalignant, or malignant cultured leukocytes, suggesting that increases in enzyme protein levels may be secondary to other physiological changes that occur during the development of overt leukemia. Taken together, these observations suggest that an increase in the activity of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-controlling enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, is a common occurrence in human hematologic malignancies and that a biphasic elevation of enzyme activity may exist in malignant leukocytes, such that changes in catalytic activity may occur early in tumorigenesis and may be followed by secondary changes in enzyme levels.","['Harwood, H J Jr', 'Alvarez, I M', 'Noyes, W D', 'Stacpoole, P W']","['Harwood HJ Jr', 'Alvarez IM', 'Noyes WD', 'Stacpoole PW']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, University of Florida, College of Medicine Gainesville 32610.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Lipid Res,Journal of lipid research,0376606,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases/analysis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Lipids/blood', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Microsomes/enzymology', 'Middle Aged', 'Preleukemia/*enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology']",1991/08/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1991/08/11 19:15'],"['1991/08/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1991/08/11 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Lipid Res. 1991 Aug;32(8):1237-52.,['S0022-2275(20)41954-6 [pii]'],"['0 (Lipids)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases)']",,,"['CA-40495/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-40439/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-32550/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Exogenously added 5-, 12-, and 15-HETE were rapidly incorporated as esters in RBL cells, reaching plateau levels within 25 min. In incubations in culture medium with protein added, all three HETEs were essentially completely metabolized within 24 h. 5-HETE was esterified more rapidly and to a greater extent than 12-HETE or 15-HETE when these were incubated together with RBL cells, indicating some degree of selectivity in the esterification pathways. When arachidonic acid (AA) was incubated in increasing concentrations with constant concentrations of 15-HETE and RBL cells, the free 15-HETE concentration increased and esterified 15-HETE concentration decreased markedly at AA: 15-HETE molar ratios above 9. 15-HETE esterification in RBL cells was also markedly inhibited by the polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosatetraynoic and eicosapentanoic acids, but not by oleic or linoleic acids. In separate experiments with unlabeled and radiolabeled substrates, the extent of incorporation of esterified HETE in RBL cells decreased at higher concentrations of 15-HETE and AA, which showed that the pathway was saturable. The shapes of the curves for these fatty acid inhibitors suggest a concentration-dependent two-compartment pathway of esterification.

It is established that benzene requires metabolism to induce its effects. Benzene exposure in humans and animals has also been shown to result in structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes and bone marrow cells, indicating that benzene is genotoxic. In this review we have attempted to compile the available evidence on the role of increased free radical activity in benzene-induced myelotoxic and leukemogenic effects. Benzene administration to rodents has been associated with increased lipid peroxidation in liver, plasma, and bone marrow, as shown by an increase in the formation of thiobarbituric-acid reactive products that absorb at 535 nm. Benzene administration to rodents also results in increased prostaglandin levels indicating increased arachidonic acid peroxidation. Other evidence includes the fact that bone marrow cells and their microsomal fractions isolated from rodents following benzene-treatment have a higher capacity to form oxygen free radicals. The bone marrow contains several peroxidases, the most prevalent of which is myeloperoxidase. The peroxidatic metabolism of the benzene metabolites, phenol and hydroquinone, results in arachidonic acid peroxidation and oxygen activation to superoxide radicals, respectively. These metabolites, upon co-administration also produce a myelotoxicity similar to that observed with benzene. Recently, we have found that exposure of human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells (a cell line rich in myeloperoxidase), to the benzene metabolites, hydroquinone and 1,2,4-benzenetriol results in increased steady-state levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine a marker of oxidative DNA damage. Peroxidatic metabolism of benzene's phenolic metabolites may therefore be responsible for the increased free radical activity and toxicity produced by benzene in bone marrow. We thus hypothesize that free radicals contribute, at least in part, to the toxic and leukemogenic effects of benzene.","['Subrahmanyam, V V', 'Ross, D', 'Eastmond, D A', 'Smith, M T']","['Subrahmanyam VV', 'Ross D', 'Eastmond DA', 'Smith MT']","['Department of Biomedical and Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley 94720.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', '*Free Radicals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*chemically induced']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 1991;11(5):495-515. doi: 10.1016/0891-5849(91)90063-9.,"['0891-5849(91)90063-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0891-5849(91)90063-9 [doi]']","['0 (Free Radicals)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",,199,"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES01896/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R0 IES 04112/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Variation with age and in childhood leukemia.,47-56,"Analyses of the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 55 children and five young adults without any structural central nervous system (CNS) lesion are reported. The concentration was age-dependent, in that infants and small children had quite high values, whereas the concentration remained relatively constant after the age of 1.5 years. The concentrations of PIIINP in the CSF of 44 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were prospectively determined at the time of diagnosis and during treatment, since deposition of type III collagen is known to occur during fibroproliferative responses triggered by inflammation. Chemical arachnoiditis is known to be associated with intrathecal methotrexate therapy in children with leukemia. The mean concentration in these children at diagnosis (5.8 micrograms/l +/- SD 2.8 micrograms/l) did not differ from that in age-matched controls (6.7 micrograms/l +/- SD 3.2 micrograms/l). Depending on type of the disease, the children were treated according to two different protocols. PIIINP concentrations were significantly higher during the therapy phases which included intrathecally administered methotrexate (P less than 0.001) than at diagnosis of the disease. Corticosteroid treatments were always associated with a significant decrease in PIIINP concentrations (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.001 in the two groups, respectively), irrespective of the therapy phase. The results suggest that an increase in PIIINP concentration in the CSF of children with ALL is an indicator of a fibroproliferative response in the arachnoid. Corticosteroids may repress this response and possibly also prevent the development of adhesions in the arachnoid.","['Vainionpaa, L', 'Risteli, L', 'Lanning, M', 'Myllyla, V', 'Risteli, J']","['Vainionpaa L', 'Risteli L', 'Lanning M', 'Myllyla V', 'Risteli J']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Oulu, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aging/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Peptide Fragments/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*cerebrospinal fluid/drug therapy', 'Procollagen/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Radioimmunoassay']",1991/11/09 00:00,1991/11/09 00:01,['1991/11/09 00:00'],"['1991/11/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/09 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 1991 Nov 9;203(1):47-56. doi: 10.1016/0009-8981(91)90155-6.,"['0009-8981(91)90155-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0009-8981(91)90155-6 [doi]']","['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Procollagen)', '0 (procollagen Type III-N-terminal peptide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although a history of prior hepatitis moderately increases the risk of VOD, reliable screening methods for identifying high risk patients are not available. New approaches to managing patients who develop serious VOD are needed. One approach may be the use of orthotopic liver transplantation in selected patients who are likely to die of the disease. In this report we describe a patient who underwent liver transplantation for life-threatening VOD following allogeneic transplantation for CML. Although this patient died early from interstitial pneumonitis, the orthotopic liver functioned well up to her death. Other reports describing successful liver transplants in patients with advanced VOD or graft-versus-host disease of the liver are discussed and the possible indications for liver transplantation for VOD after marrow transplantation are considered. Taken together, these reports suggest that orthotopic liver transplantation may be a feasible and potentially effective approach to managing select patients with life-threatening liver dysfunction after marrow transplantation.","['Rapoport, A P', 'Doyle, H R', 'Starzl, T', 'Rowe, J M', 'Doeblin, T', 'DiPersio, J F']","['Rapoport AP', 'Doyle HR', 'Starzl T', 'Rowe JM', 'Doeblin T', 'DiPersio JF']","['Hematology Unit, University of Rochester Medical Center, NY 14642.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/*etiology/pathology/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/surgery', '*Liver Transplantation/physiology', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/etiology']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1991 Nov;8(5):421-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A retrospective review of recipients of 239 BMTs given CSP-based prophylactic regimens revealed that 10 patients (4.2%, 95% confidence interval 0% to 10.4%) experienced a syndrome characterized by hypertension, severe visual disturbances, seizures and occipital lobe density changes on brain computed tomography (nine patients) or nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (one patient). Neurologic findings were reversible in all cases, usually after temporary discontinuation of CSP. Univariate analysis identified the following risk factors for neurotoxicity: use of unrelated or HLA-mismatched related donors, administration of etoposide (VP-16) or total body irradiation as part of conditioning, use of corticosteroids for prophylaxis or treatment of acute GVHD, or development of either acute GVHD or clinically significant microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) post-BMT. In multivariate analysis, the most important predictors were the use of VP-16 (p = 0.008), the use of a continuous infusion CSP plus MP prophylactic regimen for GVHD (p = 0.003) and the development of MAHA after BMT (p less than 0.001).

The biosynthesis of histamine is catalyzed by the enzyme, L-histidine decarboxylase (HDC). We have previously reported the cloning and sequence of the cDNA encoding rat HDC. Utilizing the rat HDC cDNA as probe the full-length cDNA encoding human HDC was identified and characterized. The encoded protein of 662 amino acid residues has a molecular weight of 74,148. Homology comparisons of the deduced amino acid sequence with rat HDC and dopa decarboxylases from three species have revealed highly related regions. These comparisons have identified domains of amino acid decarboxylases that are highly conserved and are likely important for enzyme-substrate interaction. A dissimilar region in human and rat HDC primary translated protein near the C-terminus would appear not to be important for catalysis and may be removed by proteolysis.

Recombinant interleukin-4 inhibits spontaneous DNA synthesis suggesting that it also interferes with the autocrine proliferation of these cells. Kinetic studies indicate that IL-4 suppresses rather than shifts the peak of cytokine-induced DNA synthesis. Moreover, IL-4 blocks the progression of B-CLLs in or into G1 stage of the cell cycle as shown by the inhibition of cytokine-induced [3H]uridine incorporation. Finally, IL-4 pretreatment of B-CLLs prevents their subsequent proliferative response to the above cytokines, indicating that IL-4 confers to the B-CLLs a state of resistance to numerous stimulatory cytokines. The antiproliferative effects of IL-4 suggest that this lymphokine may have important therapeutic implications for the B-CLL patients.","['Luo, H Y', 'Rubio, M', 'Biron, G', 'Delespesse, G', 'Sarfati, M']","['Luo HY', 'Rubio M', 'Biron G', 'Delespesse G', 'Sarfati M']","['Notre Dame Hospital Research Centre, University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunother (1991),Journal of immunotherapy : official journal of the Society for Biological Therapy,9102704,IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunother (1991). 1991 Dec;10(6):418-25. doi: 10.1097/00002371-199112000-00005.,['10.1097/00002371-199112000-00005 [doi]'],"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The HTLV-I and -II Tax proteins have been shown to activate the promoter of both the human and mouse granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) genes in mature T-cell lines. T-cell-specific Tax-responsive sequences were previously localized to the 90-bp region extending from base pairs -53 to +37 in the human GM-CSF promoter. In this study, a series of site-directed and deletion mutations were created in the human GM-CSF promoter, which was linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, and the constructs were assayed for their response to Tax by using a Tax-expressing plasmid in transient cotransfection assays. The results demonstrated that both copies of the repeated sequence CATTA (A/T), located between base pairs -48 and -36, are required for Tax responsiveness in T cells and that these sequences bind nuclear factors present in T cells. The Tax-responsiveness of other sequences located 5' of base pair -53 was also examined, including an NF-kappa B consensus sequence and the CK1, CK2, and GC-rich regions identified in both the mouse and human GM-CSF promoters.

Cancers were typed with both immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry using a panel of antibodies. Cocktails of up to six antibodies were selected based on total binding of greater than 80% of the malignant cells in the biopsy specimen. These mAb cocktails were then drug conjugated, safety tested, and administered intravenously. The Adriamycin immunoconjugates were well tolerated in 22/24 patients, with 17/24 having significant side effects. Fever, chills, pruritus, and skin rash were by far the most common transitory reactions. All were well controlled with premedication. A total of up to 1 g Adriamycin and 5 g mAb were administered to each patient. The limiting factor appeared to be a variable dissociation of active Adriamycin from the antibody that unpredictably caused hemopoietic depression. Similar findings were noted among 19 patients treated with mitomycin-C conjugates. Thrombocytopenia at a 60-mg dose of mitomycin-C in this schedule was dose limiting. Serological evidence suggested that the development of an immunoglobulin M antibody specific against the mouse mAb had the specificity and sensitivity to predict clinical reactions. These antibodies were quantitatively less in mitomycin-C-treated patients. Selected patients were retreated. One patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia was treated on three occasions with regression of peripheral lymph nodes. Two patients with breast carcinoma had definite improvement in ulcerating skin lesions, and two patients with tongue carcinoma had shrinkage of their lesions. No responses were seen with mitomycin-C conjugates but binding was noted to tumors. Drug-induced colitis was seen at higher doses with some binding of these conjugates to normal colon epithelium. This study demonstrated the feasibility of preparing individually specified drug immunoconjugate cocktails for patients with refractory malignancies.

The ribosome-lamella complex has been associated with hairy-cell leukemia, and can be visualized by light microscopy using l-micron sections of plastic-embedded bone marrow specimens stained with toluidine blue. We describe the findings in a case in which bone marrow and liver biopsy specimens were positive for hairy cells containing ribosome-lamella complex, which were visualized with both electron microscopy and light microscopy.

Since interferon (IFN) can inhibit the growth of cells that are not infected with virus, natural non-viral dsRNAs should be present in these cells which can activate 2-5A synthetase. If such nuclear dsRNAs are associated with the mechanism of growth control, cells inherently sensitive to growth inhibition by IFN should contain significant levels of 2-5A synthetase-activating dsRNAs. We measured the ability of size fractionated nuclear dsRNAs isolated from patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) to activate purified 2-5A synthetase. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HCL patients were utilized because of the inherent sensitivity of these patients to IFN treatment. The heterogeneous nuclear RNA fraction from four out of five HCL patients showed high levels of 2-5A synthetase-activating dsRNAs. The 2-5A formed contained biologically active trimers, tetramers, pentamers and hexamers as demonstrated by HPLC analysis and their ability to activate RNase L. In contrast, the nuclear RNA fraction from three out of four healthy controls were unable to activate 2-5A synthetase.

I think the first thing to say is that there is a well-established excess around Sellafield of childhood leukaemia, although excesses around other nuclear sites are of a lower magnitude. The excess near Sellafield is strongly associated with fathers having high exposure to external whole-body penetrating radiation while working at the installation before their child's conception. But is this association pointing towards a causal mechanism? One possibility is genetic damage, but most geneticists and radiobiologists would consider that the levels of occupational exposure, even at Sellafield, are too low for this to be a plausible pathway on current knowledge. This is based to some extent on the lack of any similar effect among children born subsequently to Japanese survivors of the atomic bombs--however, the scenario is somewhat different contrasting a high short-term exposure with a lower long-term exposure. As well, some workers at Sellafield will also be exposed to radionuclides, such as plutonium, which we have not yet been able to analyse for. In addition, there are other exposures in a complex environment which may or may not be relevant. One experimental study in the laboratory using animals supports the idea that a pathway through irradiation of the parents is plausible, although this one result needs replication. Other causes have been suggested for the excess childhood leukaemia levels in particular around nuclear establishments--these include population movement, implicating viruses that have long been considered to be associated with childhood leukaemia, high rates in isolated communities, and also selection of areas for nuclear sites that have a natural propensity to high rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Gardner, M J']",['Gardner MJ'],"['MRC Environmental Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Public Health,Public health,0376507,IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'England/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', '*Nuclear Reactors', '*Residence Characteristics']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Public Health. 1991 Jul;105(4):277-85. doi: 10.1016/s0033-3506(05)80212-4.,"['S0033-3506(05)80212-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0033-3506(05)80212-4 [doi]']",,,22,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very early diagnosis is a mandatory prerequisite to successful therapeutic intervention. Of great importance besides the clinical findings and bronchoalveolar lavage is the analysis of the x-ray morphology of pneumonic infiltrates to narrow down the differential diagnostic spectrum. Since the patients are at high risk of infection, they are under isolated care, so that x-ray examinations can only be performed by means of projection radiography using mobile units. Due to these difficulties in performing relevant radiography the required optimal and constant image quality cannot be achieved by means of conventional x-ray film, so that very early detection of pulmonary complications is not always possible. The use of digital luminescence radiography (DLR) with luminescent storage foils enables a highly constant and hence comparable image quality thanks to increased image dynamics, a larger area of the examined object, and histogram evaluation of the image data for determining the optimal parameters for assessment. In addition, details can be better identified to supply answers to specific questions, because the image can be reprocessed to select relevant image parameters by monitoring. Pulmonary complications in 86 patients were analysed retrospectively. These patients had received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant for acute myeloic leukaemia, after they had been treated with high-dose radio-/chemotherapy.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is one of the best examples of malignant proliferation that has benefited by considerable advances of molecular cytogenetics for the ten past years. Three types of chromosome abnormalities may be considered in ALL. Clonal anomalies may be more or less specific for a cellular type of leukemia, such as the t(8;14)(q24;q32) and t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocations related with Burkitt type of leukemia and Philadelphia-positive ALL (Ph1+ ALL) respectively, and for this reason are often designated as recurrent abnormalities. They are mainly structural chromosomal abnormalities, often translocations. A second type of clonal abnormalities consists of nonrandom alterations which are not apparently related with the differentiation type. They are the solely detected chromosomal changes (trisomy for instance) or may be associated with other anomalies and have been often considered as ""secondary"" abnormalities. Finally, nonclonal cytogenetic anomalies are the third type of anomalies. They may be present even prior any treatment and characterize a minority of ALL.

For patients with ALL or NHL who relapse, transplantation in second remission represents a reasonable therapeutic option. The role of marrow transplantation for patients in the advanced stages of their disease will continue to be explored to develop promising new therapies, which may improve results of transplantation earlier in the disease course. Development of transplant preparative regimens that have the same or improved therapeutic efficacy with less late effects is especially important for growing and developing children. In the meantime, all children who have received a marrow transplant must be followed for development of delayed effects, which may not appear until years after the transplant procedure. Children who are cured of their leukemia continue to occasionally visit the pediatric hematologist/oncologist, but they do so less often with increasing time after curative therapy. Thus, it is necessary for the primary care pediatrician to be familiar with the details regarding the child's previous therapy in order to anticipate and to be prepared to treat the delayed effects. Attention to school performance is of particular importance for early identification of those children who may need special educational attention.

Transformation is apparently due to a more than fivefold enhancement in myc expression, attributable to stabilization of mRNA. The rearranged allele of myc also contains a point mutation in a region upstream of the gene, identified previously as a potential negative regulator of myc expression. The mutation may increase expression of myc, but not sufficiently to cause cellular transformation.

Difficulties in detecting any association of Tax1 with the viral enhancer have hampered elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of Tax1-mediated transcriptional activation. By constructing a fusion protein with the heterologous DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4, Tax1 was shown to be a potent transcriptional activator dependent on the presence of GAL4-binding sites. Deletions of the Tax1 portion of the fusion protein revealed that almost the entire region of Tax1 (amino acids 2-337) is required for activation, and the activity correlated well with that of the viral enhancer. The GAL/Tax1 mutant lacking 41 residues of the C-terminus of Tax1, GAL/Tax1(2-312), was inactive for the viral enhancer, but activity was recovered by adding the heterologous activation domain of herpes simplex virus VP16. These results indicate that Tax1 has two distinct but overlapping functional domains for transcriptional activation and for enhancer specificity. Thus, Tax1 is thought to be a transcription factor acting in the enhancer complex rather than as a catalytic or allosteric modifier of pre-existing cellular transcription factors.","['Fujii, M', 'Tsuchiya, H', 'Seiki, M']","['Fujii M', 'Tsuchiya H', 'Seiki M']","['Department of Virology, Cancer Research Institute, Ishikawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Fungal Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'TATA Box', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1991 Dec;6(12):2349-52.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (GAL4 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incorporation rate of the radiolabeled thymidine into DNA was used as a measure of cell growth. When the CML cells were exposed to MITO (1 microgram/ml) in the presence of bepridil (1 and 5 micrograms/ml), an enhancement in the inhibition of DNA biosynthesis was observed in 14 out of 17 human CML samples studied. This significant inhibition (p less than 0.001) of 3H-thymidine incorporation due to the combination was found to be completely irreversible. Bepridil was identified predominantly in the octanol phase in the octanol/water partitioning studies. This lipophilic property of drug response modulators was implicated in the observed increase in the intracellular uptake of anticancer drugs, which in turn led to an enhanced cytotoxicity correlating well with the MITO activity observed in this study.

Treatment recommendations remain unclear; however, C difficile and cytomegalovirus are important pathogens that should be identified and treated promptly.

The bulk of infection in this group probably occurs with HTLV-II, with a lower prevalence of HTLV-I. HTLV-I is known to cause adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and tropical spastic paraparesis. HTLV-II has not been proven to cause any human pathology, but may be immunosuppressive and is almost indistinguishable serologically from HTLV-I. As with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), infection with these viruses is likely to be lifelong and the disease may have a latent period of many years. Unlike HIV, HTLV-I and/or HTLV-II are not likely to be transmitted from mother to child prenatally, and usually require breast-feeding for vertical transmission. It is likely that HTLV-I and/or HTLV-II has been prevalent in IDUs for far longer than the HIV epidemic. HTLV-I and/or HTLV-II are relevant to the AIDS epidemic in that they may function as biologic markers of behavioral risk status for HIV infection in IDUs or their sexual partners, and they may accelerate the course of HIV infection in persons coinfected with HTLV-I and/or HTLV-II and HIV. Coinfection will be more likely as the HIV epidemic progresses.

The tumorigenic behavior of the different FLC types strongly depended on the site of tumor injection. Both WR FLC and in vitro passaged FLC did not grow as ascites (when injected intraperitoneally) and developed large solid tumors (when injected subcutaneously), without forming any spleen or liver metastasis. In contrast, in vivo passaged FLC rapidly formed hemorrhagic ascites when injected intraperitoneally; the subcutaneous injection of these cells resulted in the development of solid tumors, which were smaller than the other FLC tumors, but capable of metastasizing to the liver and to the spleen. No significant differences were observed in the in vitro growth characteristics and cell cycle parameters among the different FLC types under various experimental conditions (i.e., FCS concentration or cell seeding densities). Similarly to the metastatic in vivo passaged parental cells, WR FLC exhibited a much lower erythroid differentiation after in vitro addition of either dimethyl sulfoxide or hexamethylene bisacetamide than the in vitro passaged FLC. High levels of c-myc oncogene mRNA were expressed in all FLC variants; no major variations in the c-myc expression were observed in FLC cultivated in medium supplemented with different FCS concentrations and/or seeded at various cell densities. In addition, no changes in the expression of H-ras or K-ras were observed between the different FLC types.","['Sala, A', 'Benedetto, A', 'Elia, G', 'Pulciani, S', 'Ciotta, C', 'Parlanti, E', 'Santodonato, L', 'Belardelli, F']","['Sala A', 'Benedetto A', 'Elia G', 'Pulciani S', 'Ciotta C', 'Parlanti E', 'Santodonato L', 'Belardelli F']","['Laboratory of Virology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Invasion Metastasis,Invasion & metastasis,8202435,IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', '*Genes, myc', '*Genes, ras', 'Hematopoiesis', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', '*Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Invasion Metastasis. 1991;11(4):192-203.,,"['0 (Acetamides)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The viral sequence, however, is oriented anti-sense relative to the ODC sequence. This orientation makes it unlikely to be a cloning artifact mediated by reverse transcriptase, but rather a recombination between genomic DNA and a MuLV-like provirus. In the cell line, from which the cDNA clone originated, Katz and Kahana [EMBO J. 8 (1989) 1163-1167] have shown that an intragenic deletion and amplification of the ODC gene had taken place. We believe that an additional recombination also has occurred in this cell line. The cDNA clone studied was obtained after selecting for high ODC expression. It is conceivable that the retroviral sequence contains an intragenic enhancer which is also functional in the anti-sense orientation. The inserted sequence contains two repeats which share homology with known enhancer elements.

We report here that the factor known as LIF (leukaemia inhibitory factor), which regulates the differentiation and growth of embryonic-stem (ES) and other cells in culture, has little effect in vitro on growth or on ureteric-bud morphogenesis other than to stimulate the bifurcation process. It does however exert a striking effect on the mesenchyme. At about four times the concentration required to inhibit ES-cell differentiation, LIF strongly but reversibly blocks the effects of metanephric mesenchyme induction: although mesenchyme condenses around growing duct tips, the number of mature nephrons that form over 6 days is reduced by 75% or more. The few nephrons that do develop in the presence of LIF probably come from mesenchyme already induced at the time of culture and are indistinguishable from those that form in controls as assayed by morphology, by X-gal staining of endogenous galactosidase and by antibodies to brush-border and CD15 antigens. There is a further unexpected feature of rudiments cultured in LIF which is absent in controls: they contain an unexpectedly high number of stable epithelialised aggregates that express laminin around their periphery and which do not develop further. These results argue that the process of nephrogenesis involves at least two distinct stages which can be blocked by LIF: the effect of the initial induction and the future development of epithelialised aggregates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Bard, J B', 'Ross, A S']","['Bard JB', 'Ross AS']","['MRC Human Genetics Unit, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,IM,"['Animals', 'Culture Techniques', 'Embryonic Induction/*drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kidney/*embryology/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Morphogenesis/drug effects', 'Nephrons/ultrastructure', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Development. 1991 Sep;113(1):193-8.,,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now report the production of immunity to L1210 leukaemia by the addition of CsA to VP-16 therapy of leukaemic BDF/1 mice. VP-16/cyclosporin A tumour immunity induction arises as a consequence of active therapy independently of immunisation with modified tumour cells. The addition of CsA to VP-16 prolongs survival of BDF/1 host mice bearing L1210 leukaemia beyond that produced by equivalent dose VP-16 alone. A subpopulation of 60-day surviving mice after combined VP-16/CsA are immune to rechallenge with the same leukaemia inoculum to which they were originally exposed. Spleen cells from immune mice adoptively transfer anti-L1210 leukaemia immunity to untreated BDF/1 mice in a dose dependent, statistically significant manner. Adoptive transfer experiments additionally suggest active recruitment of immunologic response in recipient animals: (1) We have been able to perpetuate leukaemia immunity in four sequential cohorts of naive recipient mice. This propogation of adoptive immunity is accomplished by use of spleen cells harvested from each preceeding passively-protected animal cohort; (2) Cyclophosphamide pretreatment of adoptive transfer recipient mice abrogates the ability of their splenocytes to perpetuate passive protection in sequential adoptive transfer experiments.","['Slater, L M', 'Wetzel, M', 'Cho, J', 'Sweet, P']","['Slater LM', 'Wetzel M', 'Cho J', 'Sweet P']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, Irvine 92717.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Animals', 'Cyclosporine/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/*administration & dosage', 'Immunity/drug effects', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Mice', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Survival Analysis']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1991 Dec;64(6):1098-102. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1991.471.,['10.1038/bjc.1991.471 [doi]'],"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",,,,,PMC1977840,,,,,,,,,

In a successfully treated leukemic patient, pathologic sideroblastosis in otherwise normal bone marrow after therapeutic hypoplasia suggested clonal remission.

To determine whether the beneficial effects of chronic energy-intake restriction (CEIR) can be extended to an organ site of retrovirus-induced tumorigenesis where the dynamics of growth and sexual maturity are not paramount as they are in breast tissue, calorie restriction of 40% was imposed on thymic lymphoma-prone AKR mice when 4 weeks old. Recombination between various murine leukemia virus (MuLV) mRNAs, resulting in the generation of an 8.4-kilobase genomic-length transcript with mink cytopathic focus-forming (MCF) characteristics, is considered the proximal retroviral event in AKR lymphomagenesis. Thymic expression of subgenomic MCF MuLV mRNA was uniformly suppressed among 6- and 8-week-old CEIR mice (P less than 0.02). This suppression of MuLV transcription preceded a 25% reduction in the appearance of genomic-length MCF transcripts among CEIR mice and a 28% reduction in cumulative lymphoma mortality. The latency to median tumor incidence was extended greater than 3 months by calorie restriction, and median lifespan was extended approximately 50%. Survival curves for the full-fed and CEIR dietary cohorts were found to be significantly different (P less than 0.0001), with full-fed mice experiencing a 3 times greater risk of lymphoma mortality. These findings extend the known range of pathologic states influenced by CEIR in inbred mice and show that retroviral mechanisms involved in generation of lymphoid malignancy can be significantly impaired by calorie restriction.","['Shields, B A', 'Engelman, R W', 'Fukaura, Y', 'Good, R A', 'Day, N K']","['Shields BA', 'Engelman RW', 'Fukaura Y', 'Good RA', 'Day NK']","[""Department of Pediatrics, All Children's Hospital, College of Medicine, University of South Florida, St. Petersburg 33701.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight', '*Diet, Reducing', 'Energy Intake', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genome, Viral', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Lymphoma/*microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'RNA Probes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Thymus Gland/microbiology', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1991/12/15 00:00,1991/12/15 00:01,['1991/12/15 00:00'],"['1991/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1991 Dec 15;88(24):11138-42. doi: 10.1073/pnas.88.24.11138.,['10.1073/pnas.88.24.11138 [doi]'],"['0 (RNA Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,"['AG05633/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41061/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC53089,,,,,,,,,

These cells metabolized 1,2-DiC8 very rapidly, and 1,2-DiC8 available to protein kinase C (PKC) activation was removed from the incubation medium at a rate proportional to cell density. However, increasing the duration of exposure of HL-60 cells to this DAG either by its repeated addition or by decreasing the cell density greatly enhanced their differentiation to macrophages as measured by CD11b expression. During this differentiation induced by DAG, neither measurable translocation nor depletion (down-regulation) of PKC was observed. When the cells were exposed to PMA, on the other hand, some PKC subspecies were instantaneously translocated to membranes and subsequently disappeared very quickly, whereas the alpha-subspecies was decreased to the level of approximately 60% of the resting cell, but thereafter its activity was maintained at a nearly constant level in membranes. After approximately 4 hr, the PKC subspecies, once depleted, reappeared gradually in the membrane fraction. The results suggest that sustained activation of PKC is essential to differentiation of HL-60 cells to macrophages, and depletion of the enzyme is not needed. Perhaps translocation of PKC represents an extreme state of the active form of the enzyme, which may result from PMA action, and the alpha-subspecies presumably plays a key role in HL-60 cell differentiation.","['Aihara, H', 'Asaoka, Y', 'Yoshida, K', 'Nishizuka, Y']","['Aihara H', 'Asaoka Y', 'Yoshida K', 'Nishizuka Y']","['Department of Biochemistry, Kobe University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Biological Transport', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Diglycerides/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/analysis', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Protein Kinase C/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1991/12/15 00:00,1991/12/15 00:01,['1991/12/15 00:00'],"['1991/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1991 Dec 15;88(24):11062-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.88.24.11062.,['10.1073/pnas.88.24.11062 [doi]'],"['0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '1069-87-0 (1,2-dioctanoylglycerol)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,PMC53073,,,,,,,,,

Southern blot analysis using immunoglobulin (Ig) and T cell receptor (TcR) genes revealed the presence of monoclonal components in some cases of angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy (AILD), in which demonstration of monoclonality was difficult by conventional methods. In preB-ALL, many cases had rearranged IgH and TcR genes simultaneously. These ""dual genotype"" cases were found to be of accidental involvement of TcR gene in the process of making effective IgH gene rearrangements by the precise analysis of rearranged IgH gene structures. The rearranged TcR gene which was detected in initial lymphoblastic lymphoma cells, was observed in relapsed blasts after lineage conversion to myeloid leukemia, which indicates the same clonal origin. Diagnosis and detection of minimal residual disease by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are now recognized as sensitive methods. PCR using oligonucleotides common to each VH and JH gene detects the rearranged IgH gene sensitively. PCR using primers located on the translocation boundary, such as bcr and abl in CML, is very useful in the diagnosis and pursuit of the disease course. PCR study also can be applied to the detection of alteration of some particular genes such as tumor suppressor genes.","['Miwa, H', 'Kita, K', 'Masuya, M', 'Nishii, K', 'Morita, N', 'Shirakawa, S']","['Miwa H', 'Kita K', 'Masuya M', 'Nishii K', 'Morita N', 'Shirakawa S']","['2nd Department of Internal Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

The most recent findings regarding cancer mortality during the period 1950-85 in this cohort, based on the DS86 doses are as follows: 1) The dosimetry change does not alter the list of radiation-related cancers. Some city differences in dose-response previously thought to be real are no longer significant with the DS86 doses. Assuming a linear dose-response, and using estimated organ-absorbed doses, the risk coefficients derived from the two dosimetries are very similar. If larger RBE values are assumed, the disparity between the two dosimetries increases because the neutron dose is much greater in the T65 dosimetry. 2) Besides the well-known increase of leukemia, there also have been demonstrated increases in cancers of the lung, breast, esophagus, stomach, colon, ovary, urinary bladder, and of multiple myeloma, but no increase has yet been observed in mortality from cancer of the rectum, gallbladder, pancreas, prostate and uterus, and of malignant lymphoma. In general, radiation-induced solid cancer begins to appear after attaining the age at which the cancer is normally prone to develop (the so-called ""cancer age""), and continues to increase proportionately with the increase in mortality in the control group as it ages. Sensitivity to radiation, in terms of cancer induction, is higher generally for persons who were young at the time of the bomb (ATB) than for those who were older ATB. Non-cancer mortality in the period 1950-78, based on the T65 doses, which is the most recent published report, did not show an increase with dose, but now, with the accumulation of seven more years of follow-up, there seems to be an excess in the very high dose range, particularly for the younger age ATB cohort. Further follow-up is called for to confirm this suggestion.","['Shimizu, Y', 'Kato, H', 'Schull, W J']","['Shimizu Y', 'Kato H', 'Schull WJ']","['Department of Epidemiology, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology/*mortality', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Survival']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Radiat Res. 1991 Mar;32 Suppl:212-30. doi: 10.1269/jrr.32.supplement_212.,['10.1269/jrr.32.supplement_212 [doi]'],,,38,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the chromosomal aberrations in the survivors were observed to be of a more complex nature and had characteristic findings of secondary leukemia. These observations therefore suggest that patients with a history of heavy exposure to atomic bomb radiation exhibit leukemic cells that originated from a stem cell which had been damaged by irradiation at the time of bombing and had been involved in the complex chromosome abnormalities. Molecular biological studies on transforming genes in acute and chronic leukemia and the bcr gene in chronic myelocytic leukemia have been performed in exposed and non-exposed groups. So far, no distinctive differences have been observed in the frequency and the sites of point mutations in N- and K-ras genes or in the rearrangement of the bcr gene, for a final conclusion of the specificity of radiation induced leukemia.

Little however is known for certain concerning the distribution of such random errors. This paper gives an overview of recent work at the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) using multivariate analysis of biological data, including acute effects of radiation exposure, late effects (eg leukemia mortality) and stable chromosome aberrations, for the purpose of evaluating the extent of random error in the estimation of individual doses using DS86. The emphasis here is on analyses of apparent association between biological endpoints, in light of a dosimetry error model framework proposed recently by Pierce et al. Analyses performed to date appear to be consistent with the view that lognormal random dosimetry errors with a standard deviation of 40% or greater of true dose may exist in DS86. Association between radiogenic outcomes in A-bomb survivors, after adjustment for DS86 estimated dose level, has been detected for such widely varying pairs of outcomes as mutant T-cell frequencies and chromosome aberrations, epilation and leukemia mortality, and epilation and chromosome aberrations. The motivation for examining association between pairs of biological endpoints has usually been to determine the extent to which radiation sensitivity varies between individual survivors. Recognizing, however, that random error in dose estimates results in apparent association between biological outcomes is crucial to interpreting studies, such as these, which use data on multiple biological endpoints. To go one step further, in situations where there is a prior knowledge about the biological plausibility of such associations in outcome data the amount of association between radiogenic outcomes (remaining after adjustment for estimated dose), to the extent that they are greater than that assumed to be reasonable, is an important potential source of information concerning the magnitude of random errors in the DS86 dose estimates.","['Stram, D O', 'Sposto, R']","['Stram DO', 'Sposto R']","['Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Hair/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology/mortality', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Injuries/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Survival']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Radiat Res. 1991 Mar;32 Suppl:122-35. doi: 10.1269/jrr.32.supplement_122.,['10.1269/jrr.32.supplement_122 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The increased enzyme activity was found to be concomitant with constant Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase mRNA and immunoreactive protein levels and was accompanied by a rise in intracellular copper and glutathione. Incubation of K562 cell homogenates with copper caused an increase of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase activity which reached the levels observed after differentiation in the presence of sodium butyrate. The same treatment led to no significant activity increase in homogenates derived from differentiated cells. Externally added ceruloplasmin increased both intracellular copper levels and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase activity in undifferentiated cells to a level comparable with that observed after induction of differentiation. Both increments were abolished by depletion of cell glutathione. Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase purified from control cells had both a lower kcat and a lower copper content than the enzyme purified from differentiated cells. From these data we conclude that: 1) Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase is present in K562 cells also under the form of a less active copper-deficient enzyme, 2) the extent of enzyme activation is regulated post-translationally by differential delivery of copper as a function of differentiation stage, and 3) glutathione is likely to play a role in delivering copper to the copper-deficient protein in intact K562 cells.","['Steinkuhler, C', 'Sapora, O', 'Carri, M T', 'Nagel, W', 'Marcocci, L', 'Ciriolo, M R', 'Weser, U', 'Rotilio, G']","['Steinkuhler C', 'Sapora O', 'Carri MT', 'Nagel W', 'Marcocci L', 'Ciriolo MR', 'Weser U', 'Rotilio G']","['Department of Biology, University of Rome, Tor Vergata, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Catalase/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Ceruloplasmin/metabolism', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Copper/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Metallothionein/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/12/25 00:00,1991/12/25 00:01,['1991/12/25 00:00'],"['1991/12/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/25 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Dec 25;266(36):24580-7.,['S0021-9258(18)54268-X [pii]'],"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', '9038-94-2 (Metallothionein)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.16.3.1 (Ceruloplasmin)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although NKT-01 showed strong life prolonging effect on P388 leukemia-bearing mice, significant excretion of 125I was not observed within 4 days after the start of treatment with NKT-01. Thereafter, the remaining 125I was reduced gradually and reached about half of control level on day 7. Colony forming ability in soft agar media of peritoneal tumor cells taken after completion of 5-day treatment with NKT-01 was markedly reduced to less than 3%. These results suggested that life prolongation of NKT-01 was produced both by a cytostatic effect, which lasts for an extraordinarily long period, and by a subsequent cytotoxic effect. Cell cycle distribution analysis using flow cytometry showed the cytostatic action of NKT-01 caused G0/G1 arrest of the tumor cells. Therefore, the drug-sensitive cycling population of the tumor cells was reduced, and combination with other antitumor agents was antagonistic, if they were administered simultaneously or consecutively with NKT-01. In contrast, if the other drugs such as cyclophosphamide, cisplatin and cytosine arabinoside, were administered prior to NKT-01, a synergistic combination effect was obtained. This synergism might be due to prolongation of the period of cell cycle perturbation caused by other drugs (such as G2 arrest by cisplatin) by the cytostatic effect of NKT-01. Although the precise mechanisms of the cytostatic action of NKT-01 remain unclear, it might play an important role in the combination with other antitumor drugs.","['Nishikawa, K', 'Shibasaki, C', 'Uchida, T', 'Takahashi, K', 'Takeuchi, T']","['Nishikawa K', 'Shibasaki C', 'Uchida T', 'Takahashi K', 'Takeuchi T']","['Research Laboratories, Pharmaceuticals Group, Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Antibiot (Tokyo),The Journal of antibiotics,0151115,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Guanidines/*therapeutic use', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Antibiot (Tokyo). 1991 Nov;44(11):1237-46. doi: 10.7164/antibiotics.44.1237.,['10.7164/antibiotics.44.1237 [doi]'],"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', 'UJ0ZJ76DO9 (gusperimus)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxic synergism of drugs cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cis-DDP) and arabinosylcytosine (araC) was studied both on the level of interaction with DNA in chemically determined conditions and on leukemia L1210 bearing mice. 2. AraC and its structural natural precursor cytidine were tested for the modulation of kinetics of bifunctional adducts production induced by cis-DDP in DNA. 3. This process plays the basic role in cytotoxic mechanism and antitumor activity of cis-DDP. 4. No interaction was seen between cis-DDP and araC. Further, presence of araC in reaction mixture had no effect on cis-DDP-DNA interaction. 5.

We have examined the possibility that diurnal variation in methotrexate pharmacokinetics may contribute to this improvement. In 6 children with leukaemia there was a significant fall in methotrexate plasma clearance at night (from 5.6 to 4.7 ml.kg-1.min-1). Renal clearance of methotrexate tended to fall at night and unbound renal clearance fell significantly (from 17.5 to 8.5 ml.min-1.kg-1 P less than 0.05). Creatinine clearance did not exhibit diurnal variation, whereas there was a significant fall in the non-glomerular clearance of methotrexate (from 14.8 to 6 ml.min-1.kg-1). Since methotrexate is a weak organic acid, its tubular secretion depends on urinary pH. At night urinary pH is more acidic, and this may result in more reabsorption and hence reduced renal clearance.","['Ferrazzini, G', 'Sohl, H', 'Robieux, I', 'Johnson, D', 'Giesbrecht, E', 'Koren, G']","['Ferrazzini G', 'Sohl H', 'Robieux I', 'Johnson D', 'Giesbrecht E', 'Koren G']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Hospital of Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Humans', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacokinetics', 'Time Factors']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 1991;41(5):425-7. doi: 10.1007/BF00626363.,['10.1007/BF00626363 [doi]'],['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of five recombinant human cytokines - interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon-alpha, interferon-beta and interferon-gamma on cytarabine-induced growth inhibition and differentiation of K562 cells was studied in liquid suspension cultures. GM-CSF and to a lesser extent IL-3 enhanced the antiproliferative effect of cytarabine in K562 cells, whereas the three interferons reduced it. The efficacy of cytarabine in inhibiting the growth of K562 cells was doubled by its combination with GM-CSF or IL-3 but was halved by its combination with interferons. The five cytokines did not significantly affect cytarabine-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells.

At 3-4 h after the beginning of the 4-h simultaneous infusions of teniposide and cytarabine, these patients experienced somnolence, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis. The adverse events were associated with elevated teniposide plasma concentrations during the infusions compared with those in patients receiving similar doses without toxicity, and clinically significant ethanol concentrations, presumably from the teniposide formulation. Blood concentrations of cremophor and histamine, which are also constituents of the teniposide formulation, were not measured. In addition, concomitant therapy with antiemetic agents in patients who may have been mildly volume-depleted due to emesis may also play a contributory role.

Fundamental to this approach is the measurement of the cytotoxicity, against a ""target"" cell line, of patient plasma collected at different times after administration of the anticancer agent(s). To illustrate this approach, we have studied the plasma cytotoxic activity (PCA), against HL-60 cells, of plasma from 11 acute myeloblastic leukemic patients treated with daunorubicin (DNR). Plasma, obtained before and serially for 24 h after DNR treatment, was assayed by HPLC for DNR and daunorubicinol (DNRol), its active metabolite. The corresponding observed PCA values (PCAobs) against HL-60 cells were also measured with a flow-cytometric cell-survival assay that we had developed previously. The pharmacodynamics, i.e. PCA, were co-modeled (dual Hill equation with an interaction term to allow synergism or antagonism) with the pharmacokinetics. The integration of the PCA profile provided the area under the observed PCA versus time curve (AUCobs). For each patient, we also generated an ""interaction panel"", by adding known amounts of DNR and DNRol to his or her pretreatment plasma. The corresponding cytotoxicities were measured, and then applied to the pharmacodynamic model. This provided a standard surface from which the PCA of each sample obtained after therapy was predicted (PCAprd), on the basis of assayed concentrations of DNR and DNRol in that sample. For plasma samples obtained after treatment, the model simultaneously fit all three outputs, i.e. PCA and DNR/DNRol concentration, very well. We observed substantial interpatient variability in HL-60 growth rate in medium containing patient pretreatment plasma, in DNR activity in pretreatment plasma, and in the in vitro activity (PCA) of plasma obtained after DNR treatment. We also compared the AUCprd to the AUCobs for each patient, and we identified a subset of 4/11 acute myeloblastic leukemic patients who had developed much more PCA after DNR administration that could be explained by the measured concentrations of DNR and DNRol. This may be due to unidentified active metabolites or to factors produced in the plasma in response to the treatment. This pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model is promising to describe pharmacodynamics and interactions of anticancer drugs in cancer patients.","['de Valeriola, D L', 'Ross, D D', 'Forrest, A', 'Cuddy, D P', 'Egorin, M J']","['de Valeriola DL', 'Ross DD', 'Forrest A', 'Cuddy DP', 'Egorin MJ']","['Division of Developmental Therapeutics, University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore 21201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cytarabine/antagonists & inhibitors/blood', 'Daunorubicin/blood/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1991;29(2):133-40. doi: 10.1007/BF00687323.,['10.1007/BF00687323 [doi]'],"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,['R0-1-CA40188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Two systems were developed. PLAGA-coated albumin microspheres and microspheres consisting of PLAGA only. PLAGA-coated microspheres displayed a mean diameter of 31.8 +/- 0.9 microns and a payload of 7.5% cDDP (w/w). Solid PLAGA microspheres exhibited a mean diameter of 19.4 +/- 0.6 microns and a payload of 20% cDDP. Release characteristics and in vitro effects on L1210 leukemia and B16 melanoma cell lines were investigated. Both types of microsphere overcame the initial rapid release of cDDP (burst effect), and PLAGA-coated albumin microspheres also showed a lag phase of approximately 30 min before cDDP release began. PLAGA-coated albumin microspheres released most of their payload through diffusion, and the coating eventually cracked after 7 days' incubation in saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween at 37 degrees C, enabling the release of any cDDP remaining. Effects of platinum, pre-released from PLAGA-coated albumin microspheres on the in vitro growth of L1210 cells were comparable with those of standard formulations (dissolved) of cDDP. Material released from non-drug-loaded PLAGA microspheres had no effect on L1210 cell growth, suggesting the absence of cytotoxic compounds in the matrix. The colony-forming ability of B16 cells was also equally inhibited by standard cDDP and pre-released drug. These studies show that formulation of cDDP in PLAGA-based microspheres prevents the rapid burst effect of cDDP seen in previous preparations and offers an improved system of administration for hepatic artery infusion or adjuvant therapy, enabling better clinical handling and the promise of a higher ratio of tumour tissue to normal tissue.","['Verrijk, R', 'Smolders, I J', 'McVie, J G', 'Begg, A C']","['Verrijk R', 'Smolders IJ', 'McVie JG', 'Begg AC']","['Division of Experimental Therapy, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Animals', 'Cisplatin/*administration & dosage', 'Delayed-Action Preparations', 'Drug Compounding', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Melanoma, Experimental', 'Microspheres', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1991;29(2):117-21. doi: 10.1007/BF00687320.,['10.1007/BF00687320 [doi]'],"['0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells are potentially immunogenic but fail to elicit an immune response in the host because of the appearance of virus-specific suppressor T cells. We have studied the effect of polysaccharide K (PSK) on the generation of RadLV-specific cell-mediated immune responses in vitro. Long-term exposure to PSK in culture potentiated the ability of immunized T cells to respond to a RadLV-induced lymphoma. It also abrogated the suppressive activity of suppressor T cells and simultaneously boosted the ability of reactive T cells to respond. The dual immunostimulating activity of PSK resulted in the generation of T cytotoxic lymphocytes that could lyse lymphoma cells in vitro. The results suggest that PSK could be used as a prophylactic immune response modifier in preleukemia.,"['Yefenof, E', 'Einat, E', 'Klein, E']","['Yefenof E', 'Einat E', 'Klein E']","['Lautenberg Centre for General and Tumour Immunology, Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Female', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Proteoglycans/*pharmacology', '*Radiation Leukemia Virus', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1991;34(2):133-7. doi: 10.1007/BF01741348.,['10.1007/BF01741348 [doi]'],"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '3X48A86C8K (polysaccharide-K)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of this treatment on serum neopterin, beta 2-microglobulin, (2'-5')oligoadenylate [(2'-5')An] levels, intracellular (2'-5')An values and human Mx protein synthesis was analysed. There were significant rises in serum neopterin and (2'-5')An levels during both induction and maintenance, whereas beta 2-microglobulin levels rose only during induction. Rises in intracellular (2'-5')An were documented mainly during induction, but they were not significantly higher than pretherapy values. IFN beta provoked an increase in human Mx protein synthesis over the entire induction-maintenance period, but was only significantly higher than baseline during induction. All markers proved useful for monitoring the effects of IFN beta dose schedules, but were not predictive of clinical outcome. Natural killer activity and IFN gamma production, which were initially defective, followed a different trend from that of the other factors studied, in that increases were documented only late in the course of therapy when the disease was already in remission.","['Liberati, A M', 'Horisberger, M', 'Schippa, M', 'Di Clemente, F', 'Fizzotti, M', 'Filippo, S', 'Proietti, M G', 'Arzano, S', 'Berruto, P', 'Palmisano, L']","['Liberati AM', 'Horisberger M', 'Schippa M', 'Di Clemente F', 'Fizzotti M', 'Filippo S', 'Proietti MG', 'Arzano S', 'Berruto P', 'Palmisano L', 'et al.']","['Istituto di Clinica Medica Ia-Policlinico Monteluce, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/blood"", 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Biopterin/analogs & derivatives/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-beta/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neopterin', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/analysis']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1991;34(2):115-22. doi: 10.1007/BF01741345.,['10.1007/BF01741345 [doi]'],"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '22150-76-1 (Biopterin)', '670-65-5 (Neopterin)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This would be a further test of the hypothesis that childhood leukaemia can originate in an infection, the transmission of which is facilitated by an increased number of unaccustomed contacts in the community. DESIGN: Rural and urban districts, aggregated by county, were ranked by proportion of servicemen, and five groups containing similar numbers of children were created. In addition, individual local authority districts were ranked and grouped in tenths. Mortality from childhood leukaemia 1950-3 was examined in these groups. Data on infectious diseases were also examined, as well as data on leukaemia in later periods. SETTING: England and Wales. SUBJECTS: Children aged under 15 years. RESULTS: In 1950-3 but not subsequently a significant excess of leukaemia in children under 15 was found in the fifth of county groupings with the highest proportions of servicemen. This was due mainly to a significant excess in children under 2 years (and especially in those under 1 year) in rural districts. It was confirmed among the tenth of local authority districts with the highest proportion of servicemen. These rural areas showed significantly more notifications of, and deaths from, poliomyelitis among children than the rural average. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the infection hypothesis. That the excess of leukaemia was greatest in children under 1 year suggests transmission of infection among adults and thence to the fetus. The pattern of spread of poliomyelitis may also have been influenced by the presence of large numbers of servicemen.","['Kinlen, L J', 'Hudson, C']","['Kinlen LJ', 'Hudson C']","['Department of Public Health Medicine, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Infirmary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,IM,"['England/epidemiology', 'Fathers', 'Leukemia/etiology/*mortality', '*Military Personnel', 'Poliomyelitis/*mortality/transmission', 'Rural Population', 'Urban Population', 'Wales/epidemiology']",1991/11/30 00:00,1991/11/30 00:01,['1991/11/30 00:00'],"['1991/11/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/30 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,BMJ. 1991 Nov 30;303(6814):1357-62. doi: 10.1136/bmj.303.6814.1357.,['10.1136/bmj.303.6814.1357 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC1671618,,,,,,,,,

Hepatocytes were isolated from 70-90 grams Wistar-Lewis rats. Free or microencapsulated hepatocytes in alginate matrix were cultured separately. Cell free supernatant was collected from the culture medium in which was cultured free hepatocytes; microencapsulated hepatocytes or control microcapsules containing no microcapsules. This was tested in the galactosamine rats. A galactosamine dose of 2.7 g/Kg of body weight given intraperitoneally to Wistar-Lewis rats resulted in reproducible hepatic necrosis with 90% mortality. Cell free supernatant from one day old free hepatocyte cultures was able to increase survival time and incorporation of 3H-thymidine in liver of galactosamine induced fulminant hepatic failure rats at the time of maximal liver damage. The cell free supernatant of one day old microencapsulated hepatocyte cultures did not have the same stimulatory effect either on survival time or incorporation of thymidine. Another study was carried out as follows. The microcapsules containing hepatocytes were ruptured. The supernatant of the microcapsule contents was collected. This was found to have hepatic stimulatory effect as shown by survival time and incorporation of thymidine. This suggests that hepatocytes are a source of a factor(s) which is capable of stimulating liver regeneration in the galactosamine induced fulminant hepatic failure rats at the time of maximal liver damage. Since the molecular weight cut off of this particular preparation of microcapsule is molecular larger than albumin, this suggests that the molecular weight of this factor is in the macromolecular range.","['Kashani, S A', 'Chang, T M']","['Kashani SA', 'Chang TM']","['Artificial Cells and Organ Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University Montreal, P.Q., Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biomater Artif Cells Immobilization Biotechnol,"Biomaterials, artificial cells, and immobilization biotechnology : official journal of the International Society for Artificial Cells and Immobilization Biotechnology",9111988,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Galactosamine', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Liver/cytology', 'Liver Diseases/*physiopathology', 'Liver Regeneration/*physiology', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Survival Rate', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biomater Artif Cells Immobilization Biotechnol. 1991;19(3):565-77. doi: 10.3109/10731199109117837.,['10.3109/10731199109117837 [doi]'],"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '7535-00-4 (Galactosamine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such early mu- pre-B cells express an intracellular protein complex of the pre-B cell specific 22 kDa protein lambda 5 and a 16 kDa protein designated p16. Late pre-B cell lines which carry a rearranged IgM-H chain gene in which a continuous translational reading frame has been established in the fused V-D-J element express intact mu-protein, which forms an intracellular complex with lambda 5 and p16. We show here that both the lambda 5/p16 or the mu/lambda 5/p16 complexes can be immunoprecipitated from lysates of cells surface labeled with 125I. Thus early pre-B cells express the lambda 5/p16 complex on the cell surface in the absence of mu protein, while mu+ late pre-B cells express a surface mu/lambda 5/p16 complex. To investigate a possible signal transduction function of the lambda 5/p16 and mu/lambda 5/p16 complexes on the surface of pre-B cell lines we measured the changes in intracellular free Ca2+ after treatment of cells with anti-lambda 5 or anti-mu antibodies. Two mu- early pre-B cell lines showed a rapid and transient increase in intracellular free Ca2+ when incubated with anti-lambda 5 antibodies but not when incubated with anti-mu, while the mu+ late pre-B cell line CB32 showed a rapid and transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ after incubation with anti-lambda 5 or anti-mu. These results show that both the lambda 5/p16 and the mu/lambda 5/p16 cell surface protein complexes can transduce an external signal to the inside of the cell, which implicates these complexes in the regulation of pre-B cell physiology.","['Misener, V', 'Downey, G P', 'Jongstra, J']","['Misener V', 'Downey GP', 'Jongstra J']","['Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/*immunology/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 1991 Nov;3(11):1129-36. doi: 10.1093/intimm/3.11.1129.,['10.1093/intimm/3.11.1129 [doi]'],"['0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transcription of germline C gamma and C alpha was observed in every surface IgM+ or surface IgM+/IgD+ B cell stage cell line and malignancy. In contrast, such transcription could not be detected in pre-B cells and only low levels of C alpha but not C gamma transcription were evident in IgM-secreting plasmablast cells. Transcriptional activity of germline IgH C epsilon was singularly absent at all stages of B cell development. Our results suggest that germline transcription of the C gamma and C alpha regions may be a constitutive feature of the human B cell differentiation program.

The presence of HIV-1 and HIV-2 trans-activator proteins, tat1 and tat2, respectively, greatly increases viral gene expression from their homologous LTRs. It is unclear if the cellular factors that support tat1-directed trans-activation of the HIV-1 LTR are the same for tat2 trans-activation of the HIV-2 LTR. Human-Chinese hamster ovary hybrid cell clones were used to probe for human chromosomes involved in regulating HIV-1 and HIV-2 tat-directed transactivation. DNA transfection experiments showed that the presence of human chromosome 12 in human-hamster hybrid clones was necessary for high-level tat-directed trans-activation of the HIV-1 and -2 LTR. Cross-trans-activation of the HIV-2 LTR by tat1 was found to be chromosome 12 independent. In addition, chromosome 12 did not support trans-activation of another human retrovirus (human T-cell leukemia virus type I). Our results suggest that HIV-1 and -2 have evolved to employ a cellular pathway(s) encoded on human chromosome 12 for supporting homologous tat-directed trans-activation. Trans-activation of the HIV-2 LTR by tat1 in chromosome 12-minus cells suggests that multiple cellular pathways can be recruited to trans-activate the HIV-2 LTR and that these pathways may have been important in an HIV-like progenitor virus.","['Hart, C E', 'Westhafer, M A', 'Galphin, J C', 'Ou, C Y', 'Bacheler, L T', 'Petteway, S R Jr', 'Wasmuth, J J', 'Chen, I S', 'Schochetman, G']","['Hart CE', 'Westhafer MA', 'Galphin JC', 'Ou CY', 'Bacheler LT', 'Petteway SR Jr', 'Wasmuth JJ', 'Chen IS', 'Schochetman G']","['Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA 30333.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CHO Cells', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Female', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'HIV-2/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",1991/11/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1991/11/11 19:15'],"['1991/11/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1991/11/11 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1991 Nov;7(11):877-82. doi: 10.1089/aid.1991.7.877.,['10.1089/aid.1991.7.877 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The donor's DNA 3.5 kb band appeared in 1-10% of male DNA by Southern blot hybridization in the peripheral blood 21 days after BMT. The Y-chromosome DNA band decreased day by day, and disappeared 110 days after BMT. The Y-chromosome DNA band could be detected, even though few metaphases were obtained immediately after BMT. Thus this method is very sensitive for determining which cells contain the Y-chromosome, and is therefore useful for detecting mixed chimerism after sex-mismatched BMT.

This derangement in cytokine expression may contribute to the panoply of disease states associated with HTLV-I infection such as the adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-I associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). We wished to determine if there was a correlation between the expression of an array of cytokines and the diverse clinical manifestations of ATL and HAM/TSP. Utilizing the techniques of specific mRNA amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as well as Northern blotting, we analyzed the ex vivo mRNA expression of gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) in the peripheral blood of HAM/TSP and ATL patients as well as asymptomatic seropositive carriers. IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta transcripts were up-regulated in patients with HAM/TSP and seropositive carriers when compared to their levels in ATL and normal controls. In contrast, the ATL patients constitutively expressed higher levels of TGF-beta 1 mRNA than HAM/TSP and seropositive carriers. In addition, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta serum levels were elevated in HAM/TSP, but not in ATL patients nor seropositive carriers. However, the circulating leukemic cells from ATL patients secreted increased levels of TGF-beta 1 protein into the culture medium than T-cells derived from HAM/TSP patients. Collectively these results suggest that induction of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta in HAM/TSP may initiate an inflammatory cascade with subsequent events leading to immune mediated destruction of the central nervous system in these patients. Expression of osteoclast activators such as TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta is not associated with hypercalcemia in ATL. Finally, impaired cellular and humoral immune responses present in ATL, but not in HAM/TSP, may be related to elevated levels of TGF-beta 1 produced by the leukemic cells. These differences in retroviral-induced host cytokine expression in ATL and HAM/TSP suggest alternate roles in disease pathogenesis.","['Tendler, C L', 'Greenberg, S J', 'Burton, J D', 'Danielpour, D', 'Kim, S J', 'Blattner, W A', 'Manns, A', 'Waldmann, T A']","['Tendler CL', 'Greenberg SJ', 'Burton JD', 'Danielpour D', 'Kim SJ', 'Blattner WA', 'Manns A', 'Waldmann TA']","['Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Central Nervous System/pathology', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'DNA, Single-Stranded', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/complications/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Retroviridae/*pathogenicity', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1991 Aug;46(4):302-11. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240460405.,['10.1002/jcb.240460405 [doi]'],"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although SCL mRNA is not detectable in normal thymocytes or peripheral T-lymphocytes, transcriptional activation occurs in T-cell tumours. A clue to the normal function of SCL has come from demonstration of high levels of SCL mRNA in erythroid cells. To illuminate the function of SCL in the erythroid lineage, an antisense SCL construct was introduced into the human erythroleukaemia cell line, K562. Cells electroporated with a vector containing antisense SCL grew more slowly than control cells which had received vector alone. Non-specific toxicity was excluded by showing that antisense SCL did not influence growth of Raji cells, a B-cell line that does not express endogenous SCL mRNA. Suppression of K562 growth was accompanied by increased spontaneous erythroid differentiation as measured by benzidine staining. K562 cells containing antisense SCL produced smaller colonies in agar and exhibited reduced clonogenicity compared with control cells. In addition, experiments in which K562 colonies were recloned showed that antisense SCL profoundly suppressed self-renewal of K562 cells.

The key symptoms of the disease are high spiking fever, arthritis and a macular or maculopapular, salmon-pink evanescent rash, almost always accompanied by neutrophilic leukocytosis and frequently by sore throat, intense myalgias, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and signs of serositis. Tests for IgM rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody are characteristically negative. With respect to haematologic abnormalities, the disease may give rise to several problems. First, there is a neutrophilic leukocytosis, which currently is unexplained, and often a normocytic normochromic anaemia, that may be profound. The anaemia has the characteristics of anaemia of chronic inflammatory disease. Both abnormalities disappear after effective treatment of the disease or at spontaneous remission. Secondly, there might be a problem to differentiate AOSD from malignant haematological disorders, including malignant lymphoma and leukaemia, especially when the picture is dominated by lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, fever and leukocytosis. Although in rare cases the differential diagnosis is extremely difficult, diagnosis can mostly be made or excluded by peripheral blood smear staining, bone marrow biopsies and occasionally lymph node biopsy. Finally, like the juvenile counterpart, AOSD is occasionally complicated by sometimes life-threatening diffuse intravascular coagulation. Factors that might be important in the development of this complication include severe disease activity, liver abnormalities and particular drugs including salicylates, other NSAIDs and some slow-acting antirheumatic drugs. Prompt therapy, including withdrawal of the drug, corticosteroids and sometimes anticoagulant therapy have been successfully applied to most patients.","['van de Putte, L B', 'Wouters, J M']","['van de Putte LB', 'Wouters JM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Rheumatol,Bailliere's clinical rheumatology,8805770,IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use', 'Arthritis, Infectious/microbiology', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Prognosis', ""*Still's Disease, Adult-Onset/complications/diagnosis/physiopathology""]",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Baillieres Clin Rheumatol. 1991 Aug;5(2):263-75. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3579(05)80283-3.,"['S0950-3579(05)80283-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0950-3579(05)80283-3 [doi]']","['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",,47,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antitumor activity of peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) from mice receiving either treatment was nonspecific, and inhibition of their target cell growth increased for up to 24 h. Macrophage toxin, silica and trypan blue abrogated the activity in vitro and in vivo, respectively. The activity of the PEC was inhibited with inhibitors of the arachidonic acid cascade, such as dexamethasone, 4-bromophenacyl bromide and nordihydroguaiaretic acid but not esculetin, ibuprofen, indomethacin and BW755C. NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, a specific competitive inhibitor of the L-arginine-dependent nitric oxide synthesis, also inhibited the activity. These results and morphological observations indicated that antitumor cells in the PEC from mice receiving either treatment were macrophages, and that their activity was closely related to the arachidonic acid cascade and to nitric oxide. Antitumor activity of the PEC spontaneously decayed in vitro and this decay was inhibited by the addition of OK-432 or lipopolysaccharide. On the other hand, cyclophosphamide sustained the appearance of antitumor cells in mice treated with EL4MMC plus OK-432. Therefore, cyclophosphamide treatment did not modify cell types and cytotoxic mechanisms of antitumor cells elicited with EL4MMC plus OK-432, but did modify the induction kinetics of such antitumor macrophages.","['Ryoyama, K', 'Ryoyama, C']","['Ryoyama K', 'Ryoyama C']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Kanazawa University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cyclophosphamide/*pharmacology', 'Exudates and Transudates/*drug effects/immunology/physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/immunology/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Macrophages/drug effects/physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitomycin/pharmacology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology/pathology', 'Peritoneal Cavity/cytology', 'Picibanil/*pharmacology', 'Spleen/drug effects/physiology', 'Toxins, Biological/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1991;34(3):143-9. doi: 10.1007/BF01742304.,['10.1007/BF01742304 [doi]'],"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Toxins, Biological)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '39325-01-4 (Picibanil)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serial translocations or a concerted genomic rearrangement?,143-51,"Joining of the BCR and ABL genes is an essential feature of the group of human leukemias characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome and there is recent evidence that the human BCR-ABL fusion gene induces leukemia in experimental animals. Joining of these two genes is the result of cytogenetic translocation, usually the t(9;22)(q34;q11), but sometimes of more complex translocations involving one or more chromosomes in addition to chromosomes 9 and 22. The leukemic cells of some patients carry the BCR-ABL fusion gene but have an apparently normal karyotype. Recent studies show that these cells conceal complex chromosome rearrangements. Because the BCR-ABL fusion gene appears to be the result of cytogenetic rearrangement in all cases of these leukemias, the causes and mechanism of chromosome rearrangement will be relevant to the development of leukemia in man. We examine mechanisms of chromosome rearrangement and propose that both simple and complex chromosome translocations result from a single, though sometimes complex, interchange event.","['Fitzgerald, P H', 'Morris, C M']","['Fitzgerald PH', 'Morris CM']","['Cytogenetic and Molecular Oncology Unit, Christchurch School of Medicine, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Oncogenes', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Proto-Oncogenes', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1991 Dec;57(2):143-51. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(91)90145-k.,"['0165-4608(91)90145-K [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(91)90145-k [doi]']","['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",,38,,,,,"['ABL', 'BCR']",,,,,,,

From our data, karyotype evolution during advanced phases in Ph+ CML patients after BMT differs from the evolution seen in conventionally treated patients, by the presence of numerous structural unusual abnormalities, possibly related to radiochemotherapy conditioning to BMT.

In this study, the combined effects of IFN and hyperthermia on the growth of L-CFU and human granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM) were examined to determine if this combination resulted in a greater selective killing of L-CFU than that obtained by heat treatment alone. The survival of normal CFU-GM without IFN decreased at elevated temperatures (42-44 degrees C). However, IFN added during heating (42 and 43 degrees C) appeared significantly to protect against the hyperthermic killing of CFU-GM in vitro leaving over 50% of CFU-GM surviving. The optimal dose to protect CFU-GM in vitro dropped to a rather low dose (100 U/ml). On the other hand, the addition of IFN to leukemic cell suspensions enhanced the hyperthermic killing of myeloid leukemic cell lines (HEL and KG-1) as well as a T lymphoblastic cell line (CEM) in a dose-related manner. In addition, similar results were observed in the study of L-CFU from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. These results suggest that IFN can be used to broaden the difference between surviving fractions of CFU-GM and L-CFU by heat. Thus, this combination could be applied effectively and safely for the elimination of residual clonogenic leukemic cells in autologous remission marrow graft before autologous bone marrow transplantation.","['Moriyama, Y', 'Goto, T', 'Nikkuni, K', 'Aoki, A', 'Furukawa, T', 'Narita, M', 'Koyama, S', 'Kishi, K', 'Takahashi, M', 'Shibata, A']","['Moriyama Y', 'Goto T', 'Nikkuni K', 'Aoki A', 'Furukawa T', 'Narita M', 'Koyama S', 'Kishi K', 'Takahashi M', 'Shibata A']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Niigata University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Survival', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Interferon-alpha', 'Leukemia/pathology/*surgery', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1991 Oct;8(4):301-5.,,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was the aim of the present study to evaluate the efficacy of the cyclophosphamide derivative mafosfamide as a marrow purging agent in a group (n = 15) of CML patients. Chemical purging was followed by a short-term liquid culture phase supplemented with recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF). Mafosfamide (100 micrograms/ml) incubation induced a marked inhibition of progenitor cell growth, the percentages of surviving CFU-GEMM, BFU-E, and CFU-GM being 3.4, 5.4, and 4.9, respectively. At the cytogenetic level, the purging procedure failed to show any modulating effect on Ph1-negative clones in 9/15 cases. In contrast, 6/15 cases showed a significant increase in the mean (+/- SD) percentage of Ph1-negative metaphases in response to rGM-CSF (46 +/- 26, p less than or equal to 0.05), mafosfamide incubation (53 +/- 12, p less than or equal to 0.01), and the combination of mafosfamide incubation plus rGM-CSF (63 +/- 29, p less than or equal to 0.025). Immunological analysis revealed that mafosfamide incubation induced a significant enrichment of MY10 (28 +/- 9, 0.05) B73.1-positve cells (25 +/- 9, p less than or equal to 0.05). Four mafosfamide-responsive patients with CML in second chronic phase have been autografted with mafosfamide purged marrow. In all patients a Ph1-negative phase lasting 5-14 months was observed. In conclusion, it appears that (a) in a subgroup of CML patients mafosfamide purging is effective in reducing the size of the malignant clone and might induce through its cytotoxic and immune actions a modification of the balance between leukemic and normal clones, and (b) this experimental approach may be used as a screening test to select patients to undergo marrow harvest and ABMT with mafosfamide purged marrow.","['Carlo-Stella, C', 'Mangoni, L', 'Piovani, G', 'Almici, C', 'Garau, D', 'Caramatti, C', 'Rizzoli, V']","['Carlo-Stella C', 'Mangoni L', 'Piovani G', 'Almici C', 'Garau D', 'Caramatti C', 'Rizzoli V']","['Department of Hematology, University of Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/pathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', '*Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/classification/pathology/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/classification/pathology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1991 Oct;8(4):265-73.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eighteen patients were studied; 11 received marrow from a fully HLA A, B and DR matched sibling donor, and six from matched unrelated donors or a partially matched sibling (one patient). Two of the unrelated donor transplant recipients received marrow depleted of T lymphocytes, and the remainder received unmanipulated marrow and cyclosporin with or without methotrexate as prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Donor cells tested before BMT did not generate CTL against the patients' leukaemia, but up to 9 months after BMT a low frequency of CTLp directed against the patients' CML cells (Lk-CTLp) was detected in all patients. The Lk-CTLp frequency was significantly lower than the frequency of CTLp directed against the recipients' PHA transformed pretransplant lymphocytes (Ly-CTLp) (p less than 0.05). Lk-CTLp showed MHC restricted cytotoxicity and did not demonstrate cytotoxicity in an NK assay. The Lk-CTLp frequency correlated with both GVHD severity and relapse: severe GVHD was only seen with Lk-CTLp frequencies greater than 1:400,000, while leukaemic relapse was only observed in two patients with Lk-CTLp frequencies less than 1:400,000. These results show that a low frequency of alloreactive cells of presumed donor origin with cytotoxic potential against residual leukaemia normally circulate after BMT. Their relationship with the graft-versus-leukaemia phenomenon and their cross-reaction with GVHD reacting cells remain to be determined.","['Jiang, Y Z', 'Kanfer, E J', 'Macdonald, D', 'Cullis, J O', 'Goldman, J M', 'Barrett, A J']","['Jiang YZ', 'Kanfer EJ', 'Macdonald D', 'Cullis JO', 'Goldman JM', 'Barrett AJ']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Reaction/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/immunology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1991 Oct;8(4):253-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study presents evidence for the expression of this protein during dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) induced differentiation of human promyelocytic leukemia HL 60 cells. The expression had been followed at two levels: as antigen, using a specific antimitotin monoclonal antibody and as mRNA, using a specific cDNA probe. The results from the immunofluorescent study show a gradual disappearance of mitotin in differentiating HL 60 cells starting from the fourth day after DMSO induction. On the other hand, the changes in the expression of mitotin mRNA were much more dramatic. This mRNA is expressed at a high level during the first three days of differentiation but shows a striking decrease after the fourth day. This correlates with the rapid changes in the number of blast cells in the differentiating HL 60 cell population. Therefore, the expression of mitotin mRNA can serve as a marker for the changes accompanying the termination of cell proliferation in differentiating cells.","['Philipova, R N', 'Vassilev, A P', 'Kaneva, R P', 'Andreeva, P', 'Todorov, I T', 'Hadjiolov, A A']","['Philipova RN', 'Vassilev AP', 'Kaneva RP', 'Andreeva P', 'Todorov IT', 'Hadjiolov AA']","['Institute of Cell Biology and Morphology, Sofia, Bulgaria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biol Cell,Biology of the cell,8108529,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'DNA Probes', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*isolation & purification', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Cell. 1991;72(1-2):47-50. doi: 10.1016/0248-4900(91)90077-z.,"['0248-4900(91)90077-Z [pii]', '10.1016/0248-4900(91)90077-z [doi]']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Italian Cooperative Study Group on Chronic Myeloid Leukemia.,307-14,"A simple prognostic classification of Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) was proposed in 1984 by an international study Group and is now widely used for clinical purposes. That study was retrospective, and was based on disease features at diagnosis. To test prospectively and to check the value of the classification, and to investigate if additional information on the early course of leukemia can help in refining the prognosis, 505 Ph+, nonblastic and nontransplanted patients first registered between 1984 and 1986 were followed up to June 1990. It was found that the prognostic formulation predicted survival in that series exactly the same way as in the original series (median survival: greater than 60 months for low-risk patients, 46 months for intermediate-risk patients, and 32 months for high-risk ones). It was also found that several objective or subjective assessments of disease course during the first 8 months after diagnosis were significantly related to survival length within any risk group. This study provides full confirmation of Sokal's international prognostic classification, and shows that the definition of prognosis can be improved some months after diagnosis by taking into account the course of the disease and the response to therapy. These conclusions apply to patients receiving conventional treatment. The course of Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is rigidly programmed to progress to an acute phase, which is called blastic metamorphosis (BM) and which can develop either suddenly (blastic crisis) or by a slow progression (accelerated phase). In all recent series, 2-year survival ranged between 65% and 80%, median survival was slightly shorter than 4 years, and the proportion of patients who were still alive after 10 years was less than 10%. However, a number of prognostic variables were identified and a prognostic formulation that was elaborated by an international study was shown to provide a reliable estimate of survival length and is currently used for that purpose. The value of that formulation, and the formulation itself, require periodical controls and revisions. For that purpose, the Italian Cooperative Study Group on CML registered and followed up all CML patients who were first seen between 1984 and 1986. A very preliminary analysis of that cohort of patients has already been performed, but it was limited to the first 2 years after diagnosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*classification/diagnosis/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1991 Dec;63(6):307-14. doi: 10.1007/BF01709652.,['10.1007/BF01709652 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monocytes were required for optimal rapid proliferation of cells with LAK activity. They had no influence on the expression of tumoricidal activity by the LAK cells. The effector cells killed K562 erythroleukemia cells and WiDr colon cells differently, i.e. contact areas with WiDr cells were limited, whereas the contact areas between effector cells and K562 cells were much longer. Using mixtures of hot and cold target cells it was shown that effector cells preferably bind with K562 cells, impeding the binding of WiDr cells. Differences in expression of cytotoxicity of LAK cells against WiDr and K562 cells respectively was also observed after culturing the LAK cells for a relatively longer period. Cytotoxicity against WiDr was maximal at 3-16 days after starting LAK cell generation, whereas cytotoxicity against K562 was kept constantly high for at least 21 days. The addition of biological response modifiers [PHA and anti-CD3 antibody (OKT3)] during the LAK cell induction also had different effects on the expression of LAK activity against WiDr and K562 cells. Whereas PHA, in combination with rIL-2 had no significant influence on the cytotoxicity against WiDr cells, the cytotoxicity against K562 was significantly inhibited. Addition of anti-CD3 antibody diminished the cytotoxicity against WiDr target cells and had no influence on the cytotoxicity against K562 cells.","['Dullens, H F', 'Wind, J C', 'Maas, R A', 'Bernsen, M R', 'Vulto, I M', 'Rademakers, L H', 'Den Otter, W']","['Dullens HF', 'Wind JC', 'Maas RA', 'Bernsen MR', 'Vulto IM', 'Rademakers LH', 'Den Otter W']","['Pathologie/AZU, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,IM,"['Carcinoma/*immunology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 1991 Oct;3(10):959-64. doi: 10.1093/intimm/3.10.959.,['10.1093/intimm/3.10.959 [doi]'],"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic cells in each case initially showed metachromasia with toluidine blue and various degrees of positivity for astra blue. Other cytochemical results showed considerable variety among cases. The number of granules increased in short-term culture in every case. Ultrastructurally, small membrane-bound granules with or without myelinoid bodies or glycogen particles were present in immature blasts, followed by production of other granule types. In some cases, leukemic cells before and after liquid culture contained the typical basophil granules with or without myelinoid bodies, but the matrix was more loose than normal. Granules showing whorl or scroll matrix profiles, which were typical for mast cells, were present in two cases. In one case, immature leukemic cells contained theta granules, and some mature forms after short-term culture contained typical basophil/mast cell granules as well as theta granules. Leukemic cells occasionally contained multivesicular granules predominantly. These results indicate that leukemic cells with basophil/mast cell features show a heterogeneous configuration and contain abnormal granules differing from normal ones. This abnormal granulopoiesis may be attributable to the results of leukemic events and may be a hallmark for recognition of leukemic basophils/mast cells.","['Fukuda, T', 'Kakihara, T', 'Ohnishi, Y', 'Sato, K', 'Hasegawa, T', 'Momozaki, S', 'Kishi, K', 'Shibata, A', 'Abe, A', 'Kurokawa, I']","['Fukuda T', 'Kakihara T', 'Ohnishi Y', 'Sato K', 'Hasegawa T', 'Momozaki S', 'Kishi K', 'Shibata A', 'Abe A', 'Kurokawa I']","['Second Department of Pathology, Niigata University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Acta Pathol Jpn,Acta pathologica japonica,0372637,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Basophils/chemistry/*ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/*pathology', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/chemistry/*ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Pathol Jpn. 1991 Jul;41(7):531-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.1991.tb02518.x.,['10.1111/j.1440-1827.1991.tb02518.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, these experiments correlated disease resistance with changes in H-2 expression occurring very early after virus inoculation. In the present study, we have begun to study at the molecular level this stimulation of H-2Dd class I expression in thymocytes of resistant mouse strains following infection by RadLV. The resistant strain of B10.T(6R) mice is used in these studies. When these infected thymocytes are assayed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, we can detect increased levels of H-2Dd expression on the surface of the thymocytes as early as 12 days following intrathymic injection of RadLV. RNA was prepared and examined by Northern blot analysis; H-2 mRNA levels are shown to be elevated on the order of four-fold. Nuclei were prepared from normal and infected thymocytes and the run-off transcripts were analysed by slot-blot hybridization. The rate of H-2 mRNA transcription is shown to be two- to three-fold higher in RadLV-infected thymocytes at 14 days post-infection when compared to that of normal thymocytes. These data demonstrate that elevation of H-2 surface expression following RadLV infection is the result of transcriptional activation. Extracts have been prepared from both normal and infected B10.T(6R) thymocytes and have been used in gel mobility assays in order to detect the interaction of potential trans-acting regulatory factors with sequences 5' of the H-2Dd gene. Specific binding occurs in both extracts, but the assay shows that the extracts differ both quantitatively and qualitatively; the extracts from infected thymocytes bind to additional sequences and to a higher degree than that from normal thymocytes. DNase I protection analysis locates a number of protein-binding sites, some of which are protected by extracts of either origin and some of which are only protected by extracts from infected cells. Two of these sequences are similar to the previously recognized consensus recognition sequences for the binding of AP-1 and NF-chi B. Oligonucleotides have been synthesized for both the genomic sequences being protected from DNase I digestion as well the published consensus sequences. While the DNA-binding activity in infected thymocytes for both AP-1 and NF-chi B-binding sites is increased, the binding to the genomic ""AP-1 like"" binding site is activated to a considerably greater level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Brown, G D', 'Nobunaga, T', 'Morris, D R', 'Meruelo, D']","['Brown GD', 'Nobunaga T', 'Morris DR', 'Meruelo D']","['Department of Pathology, New York University Medical Center, NY 10016.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",France,Res Immunol,Research in immunology,8907467,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Radiation Leukemia Virus/*growth & development', 'T-Lymphocytes/*microbiology', 'Transcription Factors/analysis', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Res Immunol. 1991 Jun-Aug;142(5-6):431-40. doi: 10.1016/0923-2494(91)90043-i.,"['0923-2494(91)90043-I [pii]', '10.1016/0923-2494(91)90043-i [doi]']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,"['CA22247/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35482/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Although he had no mucocutaneous lesions, hepatitis caused by a herpes virus was suspected, and high dose intravenous acyclovir (10 mg/kg x 3/day) was immediately started. His GOT, GPT and total bilirubin reached peaks of 2,870 U/l on day +26, 1,830 U/l on day +27 and 10.3 mg/dl on day +39, respectively, and rapidly improved thereafter. Serological analyses on IgG antibody titers to herpes simplex virus type 1 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed specific increases (454-fold before transplantation to 3,830-fold on day +46). Antiviral antibody titers to cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus and Epstein-Barr virus showed no significant changes. The serologic markers of hepatitis B virus, hepatitis A virus and hepatitis C virus were all negative. The results indicate the patient's severe icteric hepatitis to have been caused by a reactivation of herpes simplex virus type 1 due to immunosuppression after high dose chemotherapy with ABMT.

Preliminary splenic artery ligation did not reduce the operative blood loss in patients with massive spleens. Drainage of the splenic bed was not associated with postoperative bleeding or intra-abdominal abscess. The low morbidity (22%) and mortality (3.4%) compares favorably to other published studies, demonstrating that splenectomy for hematologic disorders may be safely performed in the community hospital setting.","['Hoefer, R A', 'Scullin, D C Jr', 'Silver, L F', 'Weakley, S D']","['Hoefer RA', 'Scullin DC Jr', 'Silver LF', 'Weakley SD']","['Department of Surgery, Baptist Hospital East, Louisville, KY.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Ky Med Assoc,The Journal of the Kentucky Medical Association,7505615,IM,"['Blood Loss, Surgical', 'Hematologic Diseases/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Lymphoma/surgery', 'Postoperative Complications/epidemiology/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Splenectomy/adverse effects/mortality']",1991/09/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1991/09/11 19:15'],"['1991/09/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1991/09/11 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Ky Med Assoc. 1991 Sep;89(9):446-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, dramatic cytopathic effects characterized by syncytium formation in various CD4+ T-cell lines were observed upon their cocultivation with HTLV-II infected T-cells. The HTLV-II infected T-cells, however, did not die as a result of syncytium formation. HTLV-II also transformed CD4+ T-cells and CD8+ T-cells at various coculture ratios. Furthermore, sera from anti-HTLV-II antibody-positive specific carriers inhibited syncytium formation in the CD4+ T-cells.

A detailed analysis of the age-specific mortality rates for solid tumors as a group using the widely accepted linear-quadratic cum cell-killing dose-effect model reveals that the Hiroshima-Nagasaki data are statistically consistent with a limiting, low-dose neutron RBE of about 70. This value, although consistent with a wide range of neutron RBEs, is about 3.5 times higher than the current effective quality factor for neutrons. The data on leukemia mortality do not support the notion of a difference in effectiveness between neutron and gamma radiation; however, these two radiation sources appear to act synergistically. For both types of tumors, the commonly used concepts of constant, dose-independent RBE and ""gamma effective dose"" cannot be justified other than at very low neutron doses.","['Zaider, M']",['Zaider M'],"['Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,IM,"['Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*mortality', '*Neutrons', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Relative Biological Effectiveness']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Health Phys. 1991 Nov;61(5):631-6. doi: 10.1097/00004032-199111000-00006.,['10.1097/00004032-199111000-00006 [doi]'],,,,"['CA12536/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA15307/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

While rGM-CSF was found to be able to stimulate both leukemia cell proliferation and araC incorporation, for individual leukemia specimens there was no consistent relationship among these effects. In some specimens proliferation was stimulated without an increase in araC incorporation. The reverse was also observed.

Because the dose of BUDR that is needed to label cells is not toxic, cell labeling can be accomplished in vivo by infusing the substance into patients. A monoclonal antibody against BUDR is then used to identify BUDR-labeled cells. The same cell population can also be stained for DNA content with propidium iodide (PI). Using bivariate flow cytometry (FCM) for measurements, both the percentage of BUDR-labeled cells and their total DNA content can be evaluated. This technique allows one to obtain the labeling index (LI) and the DNA synthesis time (TS). The potential doubling time (Tpot) and the fractional turnover rate (FTR) can be mathematically derived. During a 15-month period, in vivo BUDR infusion to study cell kinetics was used in 112 consecutive patients with various types of malignant tumors: acute leukemia (50), gastric cancer (42), and brain gliomas (20). The procedure took 6 to 9 h to complete and there was no immediate toxicity from BUDR administration. Successful LI and TS determinations were obtained in 89 (80%) and in 80 (72%) of the 112 patients, respectively. Proliferative activity in 34 patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemias who were uniformly treated for remission induction and maintenance was measured from Tpot and FTR. It was greater in responsive than in nonresponsive patients, and in those who experienced remission for over 8 months than in those who had a shorter remission. Proliferative activity was also greater in patients with advanced gastric cancers than in those with more limited disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Giordano, M', 'Riccardi, A', 'Danova, M', 'Brugnatelli, S', 'Mazzini, G']","['Giordano M', 'Riccardi A', 'Danova M', 'Brugnatelli S', 'Mazzini G']","['Istituto di Clinica Medica II, Dipartimento di Medicina Interna e Terapia Medica, Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Detect Prev,Cancer detection and prevention,7704778,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Bromodeoxyuridine/immunology', 'Cell Division', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*pathology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Detect Prev. 1991;15(5):391-6.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, supernatants recovered from cultures of unstimulated hairy cells were tested for the capability to induce the proliferation of allogeneic hairy cells. We demonstrated that TNF-alpha and BCGF were able to induce the in vitro growth of hairy cells (stimulation index (SI) ranging, at different concentrations, from 1.6 to 10.7 and from 1.6 to 25.1 for TNF-alpha and BCGF, respectively). IL-4 did not show any proliferative effect on hairy cells. When unstimulated hairy cell supernatants were tested for the proliferative activity on allogeneic hairy cells, we demonstrated a low proliferative effect that was not inhibited by an anti-TNF-alpha antibody. Our findings demonstrate that unstimulated hairy cells proliferate in vitro in response to TNF-alpha and BCGF, thus suggesting that these cytokines could be involved in an autocrine model of cell proliferation.","['Trentin, L', 'Zambello, R', 'Pizzolo, G', 'Vinante, F', 'Ambrosetti, A', 'Chisesi, T', 'Vespignani, M', 'Feruglio, C', 'Adami, F', 'Agostini, C']","['Trentin L', 'Zambello R', 'Pizzolo G', 'Vinante F', 'Ambrosetti A', 'Chisesi T', 'Vespignani M', 'Feruglio C', 'Adami F', 'Agostini C', 'et al.']","['Department of Clinical Medicine, Padua University School of Medicine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Detect Prev,Cancer detection and prevention,7704778,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Growth Substances/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Detect Prev. 1991;15(5):385-90.,,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that purified, soluble Tax1 protein can be taken up by, and stimulate proliferation of, uninfected human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) that have been stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Tax1 was 40 to 70% as active as interleukin-2 (IL-2) in stimulating proliferation of PBLs. Heat inactivation, chloroform extraction, and immunoprecipitation with antisera specific for Tax1 each abolished the ability of the protein to stimulate lymphocyte proliferation. Tax1 failed to stimulate PBL proliferation in the absence of PHA. After an initial round of cell division, Tax1-treated PBLs exhibited prolonged sensitivity to IL-2-induced proliferation. These results indicate that Tax1 can stimulate lymphocyte proliferation in culture and imply that extracellular Tax1 may be involved in the spontaneous proliferation of TSP/HAM lymphocytes and the IL-2-dependent proliferation of ATL lymphocytes.","['Marriott, S J', 'Lindholm, P F', 'Reid, R L', 'Brady, J N']","['Marriott SJ', 'Lindholm PF', 'Reid RL', 'Brady JN']","['Laboratory of Molecular Virology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,New Biol,The New biologist,9000976,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis', 'Chloroform/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Hot Temperature/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Phytohemagglutinins', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,New Biol. 1991 Jul;3(7):678-86.,,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '7V31YC746X (Chloroform)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas RB expression was normal in a primary breast carcinoma and its metastases from one member of this family, overexpression of RB was found in an adrenocortical carcinoma from another family member. This was in contrast to normal RB expression in normal tissue of this patient, the adrenocortical adenocarcinoma cell line SW-13, and the fibroblast cell line MRC-5, and low level RB expression in normal adrenal tissue. The overexpression in the adrenocortical carcinoma resulted in increased synthesis of the RB-encoded protein and did not appear to be associated with RB amplification or rearrangement. This result is novel as it is usually the loss of expression or production of an altered RB transcript exhibiting deletions that is associated with carcinogenesis. In light of the recent discovery of p53 point mutations in the affected Li-Fraumeni syndrome family members tested, RB overexpression may constitute a secondary event in Li-Fraumeni syndrome tumorigenesis.","['Warneford, S', 'Townsend, M', 'Rowe, P B', 'Dalla-Pozza, L', 'Symonds, G']","['Warneford S', 'Townsend M', 'Rowe PB', 'Dalla-Pozza L', 'Symonds G']","[""Leukemia Research and Viral Pathology Unit, Children's Hospital, Camperdown, Sydney, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Adult', 'Bone Neoplasms/secondary', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Carcinoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Li-Fraumeni Syndrome/*genetics', 'Male', 'Pedigree', 'Retinoblastoma/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1991 Sep;2(9):439-45.,,,,,,,,,['RB'],,,,,,,

In two patients with acute myeloid leukaemia who showed a progressive and severe fall in platelet count during daily continuous i.v. infusion of IL2, we assessed whether peripheral blood IL2-generated lymphokine activated killer (LAK) lymphocytes could affect growth of the autologous bone marrow megakaryocytic progenitor cell compartment (CFU-MK) in vitro. Following overnight pre-incubation in liquid culture of the marrow cells with autologous LAK effectors, there was an almost complete abrogation of the CFU-MK colony growth (97% and 89% inhibition). Pre-incubation in the presence of a monoclonal antibody to tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF) completely reversed the inhibitory effect. The role played by TNF was confirmed by the finding that recombinant TNF caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the growth of CFU-MK. IL2 alone was ineffective. These results suggest that the often severe thrombocytopenia observed in patients with acute leukaemia treated with IL2 is at least partly due to autologous LAK cells activated in vivo following the administration of IL2.","['Guarini, A', 'Sanavio, F', 'Novarino, A', 'Gillio Tos, A', 'Aglietta, M', 'Foa, R']","['Guarini A', 'Sanavio F', 'Novarino A', 'Gillio Tos A', 'Aglietta M', 'Foa R']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche ed Oncologia Umana, University of Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*adverse effects', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/blood/*therapy', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/adverse effects', 'Thrombocytopenia/*etiology/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 Nov;79(3):451-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08054.x.,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08054.x [doi]'],"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

None of the patients had reported infectious episodes or been under treatment with cytotoxic agents and/or cytokines within the previous 3 months. Significant differences in sIL-2R levels between RA (median 368 U/ml). RAEB (median 675 U/ml) and RAEBt (median 971 U/ml) and between RA and CMML (median 723 U/ml) were detected. Six patients, who had been under treatment with rhGM-CSF for at least 2 weeks, demonstrated a three- to sevenfold increase of sIL-2R expression compared to pretreatment levels. In kinetic evaluation of serum samples for 24 h, the increase of sIL-2R expression begins within 4 h after subcutaneous application of GM-CSF and reaches its maximum after 12 h. Our data cannot suggest whether increased sIL-2R expression is a primary event due to involvement of lymphocytes in the malignant clone or whether it results from secondary alteration of the cytokine network. Application of GM-CSF in MDS may result in improvement of altered lymphocyte function. As GM-CSF induces sIL-2R expression, a down regulation of the immune response caused by neutralization of free IL-2 cannot be excluded.","['Zwierzina, H', 'Herold, M', 'Schollenberger, S', 'Geissler, D', 'Schmalzl, F']","['Zwierzina H', 'Herold M', 'Schollenberger S', 'Geissler D', 'Schmalzl F']","['Medizinische Universitatsklinik Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory/immunology', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/immunology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*analysis']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 Nov;79(3):438-43. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08052.x.,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08052.x [doi]'],"['0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SB positivity was also weakly predictive of remission duration (P = 0.05). A low complement of maturing granulocytes was associated with early induction death and a high percentage of blasts with shorter remissions. The few patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (FAB M3) had a high haemorrhagic death rate during induction and a low relapse rate. Apart from this, lineage involvement was not predictive of outcome. Multiple lineage leukaemias, in particular those with megakaryocytic and/or erythroid involvement, which had been reported previously to have a poor prognosis, did not have any worse remission rates in this series. When more than one cell line was involved, no combination with particularly good or poor prognosis could be identified. Multivariate analysis suggested that percentage SB positivity was adequate on its own to divide granulocytic leukaemias into poorly differentiated (less than 50% SB +ve) and well-differentiated groups (50% or more SB +ve) without the need for further measurements. This simple and reproducible test was strongly predictive of resistant disease but not of induction deaths. It was of considerably greater prognostic value--and was less open to inter-observer disagreement--than the FAB criteria which are usually used to classify granulocytic lineage leukaemias into the M1 and M2 subgroups. It is proposed that greater than or equal to 50% of blasts with SB positivity should replace blasts greater than 10% of maturing myeloid cells for this sub-categorization between M1 and M2.","['Hoyle, C F', 'Gray, R G', 'Wheatley, K', 'Swirsky, D', 'de Bastos, M', 'Sherrington, P', 'Rees, J K', 'Hayhoe, F G']","['Hoyle CF', 'Gray RG', 'Wheatley K', 'Swirsky D', 'de Bastos M', 'Sherrington P', 'Rees JK', 'Hayhoe FG']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Azo Compounds', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Coloring Agents', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/*pathology', 'Naphthalenes', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 Nov;79(3):398-407. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08047.x.,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08047.x [doi]'],"['0 (Azo Compounds)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '9YDL1Q990E (Sudan Black B)']",,,,,,,,['Br J Haematol. 1992 Jul;81(3):449-50.

We conducted a pilot study of a regimen designed to overcome these two types of treatment failure. Patients were carefully selected for therapy on the basis of their likelihood of surviving. Chemotherapy consisted of high dose cytosine arabinoside (HDaraC) with the doses modified on the basis of patient age so as to reduce the risk of toxicity. Finally, daunorubicin was administered only to those patients for whom HDaraC was not likely to produce sufficient antileukaemia effects to produce a remission. The median patient age was 67 years and 69/88 (78%) patients had a history of preleukaemia and/or toxic exposure.

The authors have studied the tissue distribution and intracellular localization of bovine scavenger receptors using monoclonal antibovine receptor antibody IgG-D2. The receptor proteins were detectable in macrophages of various organs and tissues, particularly Kupffer cells, alveolar macrophages, and macrophages in the spleen and lymph nodes. In the brain, perivascular macrophages were immunoreactive with IgG-D2. Fibroblasts, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and dendritic cells such as epidermal Langerhans cells, interdigitating cells, or follicular dendritic cells, however, showed no immunoreactivity to IgG-D2. Immunoelectron microscopy showed localization of reaction products for these receptors on the cell surface, vesicles, and endosomes of macrophages. Transient expression of bovine scavenger receptors on cultured cells shows that scavenger receptors are mainly expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum, nuclear envelope, and Golgi apparatus of nonmacrophage cells and moved to the cell surface and endosomes of macrophagelike cells. These results indicate that efficient intracellular transport of scavenger receptors in macrophages is mediated by a macrophage-specific transport system.","['Naito, M', 'Kodama, T', 'Matsumoto, A', 'Doi, T', 'Takahashi, K']","['Naito M', 'Kodama T', 'Matsumoto A', 'Doi T', 'Takahashi K']","['Second Department of Pathology, Kumamoto University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,"['Acetic Anhydrides/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cattle', 'Endocytosis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intracellular Membranes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism/physiology', '*Receptors, Lipoprotein', 'Receptors, Scavenger', 'Scavenger Receptors, Class B', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1991 Dec;139(6):1411-23.,,"['0 (Acetic Anhydrides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Lipoprotein)', '0 (Receptors, Scavenger)', '0 (Scarb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Scavenger Receptors, Class B)', '2E48G1QI9Q (acetic anhydride)']",,,,,PMC1886471,,,,,,,,,

Reviews of the literature and retrospective studies in a single institution have defined features that may be associated with a poor prognosis, but prospective studies have been lacking. Therefore, we prospectively analyzed the relationship between clinical, laboratory, and hematopathologic findings and clinical outcome in a series of 46 patients with mast cell disease. This analysis was employed to both define clinically useful prognostic variables and describe the histologic evolution of bone marrow mast cell infiltration and its relationship to hematologic neoplasia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-six adult patients were referred to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with clinical and/or pathologic evidence of mast cell proliferation. All patients had bone marrow examinations, and 10 patients underwent serial bone marrow biopsies. The diagnosis of SMCD required pathologic documentation of bone marrow mast cell infiltrates. The patients were followed for up to 13 years at the NIH (up to 30 years after the initial pathologic diagnosis of mast cell disease). Statistical analysis defined the correlation between variables and the presence of diagnostic bone marrow lesions. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to construct survival curves, and the effects of various variables on the survival time were examined. RESULTS: Thirty-two of 46 patients (74%) had a bone marrow biopsy diagnostic for SMCD. The remaining 14 patients were considered to have cutaneous mast cell disease (CMCD). Univariate analysis showed that hepatosplenomegaly, alkaline phosphatase level, absolute lymphocyte count, and age at onset of symptoms were positively correlated with SMCD, whereas hemoglobin level was negatively associated with diagnostic bone marrow lesions. With multivariate analysis, only hemoglobin and absolute lymphocyte count remained as significant independent predictors of bone marrow findings. No CMCD patient died or had significant clinical deterioration in the 1- to 30-year period of follow-up (median = 8.5 years), whereas 10 of 32 SMCD patients (31%) died from 1 to 22 years after diagnosis (median = 2.5 years) (p less than 0.0001). Univariate analysis revealed the following variables as significantly increasing the risk of death in patients with SMCD: later onset of symptoms, absence of cutaneous mastocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, anemia, bone marrow hypercellularity, qualitative peripheral blood smear abnormalities, elevated alkaline phosphatase level, and hepatosplenomegaly. Multivariate analysis showed that only the age at onset of symptoms and LDH levels were significant independent predictors of survival. Eight of the 10 SMCD patients who died had myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic syndromes or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSION: Our prospective study has defined a number of important variables in patients with clinical evidence of mast cell proliferation that can predict both the presence of SMCD and the likelihood of fatal disease. Since recent evidence suggests that mast cells derive from a bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor, SMCD may represent a myeloproliferative condition with the propensity to evolve into a neoplastic granulocytic disorder in a significant minority of patients.","['Lawrence, J B', 'Friedman, B S', 'Travis, W D', 'Chinchilli, V M', 'Metcalfe, D D', 'Gralnick, H R']","['Lawrence JB', 'Friedman BS', 'Travis WD', 'Chinchilli VM', 'Metcalfe DD', 'Gralnick HR']","['Clinical Pathology Department, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/pathology', 'Mastocytosis/*blood/complications/mortality/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Skin/pathology', 'Survival Analysis']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1991 Dec;91(6):612-24. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(91)90214-i.,"['0002-9343(91)90214-I [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(91)90214-i [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intriguingly, mRNA splicing patterns changed in 5 patients following BMT, with complete loss of mRNA containing bcr exon 3 (n = 2) or new appearance of mRNA not containing bcr exon 3 (n = 2). A single patient transiently lost evidence of bcr exon 3 expression while persistently expressing the bcr exon 2/abl exon 2 splice. Our data suggest that the majority of patients harbor small numbers of malignant cells following transplantation, and that such persistence may not inevitably predict clinical relapse. Complete elimination of the malignant CML clone post-BMT may rely on immunological mechanisms (e.g., graft-vs-leukemia).","['Ely, P', 'Miller, W J']","['Ely P', 'Miller WJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Exons', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*surgery', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis/physiology']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 1991 Dec;52(6):1023-8. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199112000-00017.,['10.1097/00007890-199112000-00017 [doi]'],"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,"['P01 CA 21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 45814/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['BCR/ABL'],,,,,,,

Synergistic inhibition of proliferation is observed with the combination of methotrexate and gamma-interferon. Enhanced cytotoxic effect of methotrexate with alpha- or gamma-interferon is removed by adding thymidine to the growth medium. The depletion of folate pools caused by methotrexate is enhanced in presence of interferons, this depletion is also removed by adding thymidine to the growth media. Synchronization of HL-60 cells in 'S' phase of cell cycle caused by methotrexate is enhanced in the presence of interferons. These results suggest that specially gamma-interferon changes the cellular environment of HL-60 cells in such a way as to make methotrexate more potent cytotoxic agent to HL-60 cells causing cell death.

Macrophages from inflammatory peritoneum expressed a markedly enhanced cytostasis, irrespective of the nature of the tumor cell. Endotoxin (LPS) challenge of inflammatory macrophages failed to further reinforce the cytostasis towards MOPC-315 plasmacytoma, but reinforced the cytostasis towards WEHI-3B leukemia (sensitive to inhibition by IL-1) and towards L929 (sensitive to TNF alpha). Cytostasis by supernatants of human peritoneal macrophages against L929 was markedly inhibited by anti-rHuTNF alpha and against WEHI-3B by anti-rHuIL-1 beta.

In the present study we have demonstrated that erythropoietin's signal is transduced rapidly to the cytosol resulting in specific phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events. Erythropoietin treatment of Rauscher murine erythroleukemia cells previously labeled with [32P]orthophosphate results in a rapid increase in phosphorylation of two cytosolic proteins, designated pp96 and pp80, and a decrease in phosphorylation of another protein, designated pp90. The relative molecular mass and pI of pp80 are virtually identical to those reported for the protein kinase C substrate p80, or ""MARCKS protein."" Treatment of the cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate also increases pp80 but not pp96 phosphorylation, suggesting that erythropoietin triggers a protein kinase C-dependent pathway to pp80 and a protein kinase C-independent pathway to pp96. The effect of erythropoietin on pp96 phosphorylation was also shown in nontransformed erythroid cells isolated from the spleens of phenylhydrazine-treated mice. In contrast, almost no 32P labeling of pp80 or pp90 was detected, and pp80 and pp90 protein were nearly absent from these normal cells. These differences in expression and phosphorylation of erythropoietin-sensitive phosphoproteins may be related to the growth factor independence or dependence of the erythroid cells.","['Bailey, S C', 'Spangler, R', 'Sytkowski, A J']","['Bailey SC', 'Spangler R', 'Sytkowski AJ']","['Laboratory for Cell and Molecular Biology, New England Deaconess Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02215.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptide Fragments/isolation & purification', 'Phosphates/metabolism', 'Phosphopeptides/isolation & purification', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Spleen/physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1991/12/15 00:00,1991/12/15 00:01,['1991/12/15 00:00'],"['1991/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Dec 15;266(35):24121-5.,['S0021-9258(18)54402-1 [pii]'],"['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphopeptides)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,['DK 38841/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with blastic CML received intensive 5-day courses of IDAra-C 600 mg/m2 every 12 h as a 2-h infusion. Of 15 patients, three achieved complete response (CR) and three partial response (PR), for an overall response rate of 40 per cent. All patients developed severe leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, and two died in hypoplasia. Except nausea and vomiting requiring medication, other nonhematologic toxicities were uncommon. Median response duration was 4 months (range 1 to 7 months). Survival was 5 months for responders and 1.5 months for nonresponders. Patients with CML in accelerated phase were treated with two-day courses of IDAra-C 600 mg/m2 every 12 h by 2-h infusion, every two-three weeks. Daily hydroxyurea 1-1.5 g/day was administered between courses. Of 20 patients, 15 (75 per cent) achieved a good PR with rapid improvement of the symptoms of disease acceleration. The median duration of response was 11 months (range 3 to 38 months); duration was over 24 months in five patients. The median survival from the start of IDAra-C was 13 months for responders and 3.5 months for nonresponders. We conclude that IDAra-C is an effective approach for CML in terminal phase. Its use in 5-day induction courses for blast crisis CML has a response rate comparable to that achieved with high-dose Ara-C. In patients in accelerated phase, the combination of short courses of IDAra-C with hydroxyurea is a well-tolerated treatment able to improve substantially the clinical and hematologic symptoms of disease progression.","['Lazzarino, M', 'Morra, E', 'Brusamolino, E', 'Alessandrino, E P', 'Orlandi, E', 'Pagnucco, G', 'Castagnola, C', 'Bernasconi, P', 'Merante, S', 'Bonfichi, M']","['Lazzarino M', 'Morra E', 'Brusamolino E', 'Alessandrino EP', 'Orlandi E', 'Pagnucco G', 'Castagnola C', 'Bernasconi P', 'Merante S', 'Bonfichi M', 'et al.']","['Chair of Hematology, University of Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1991 Nov-Dec;9(6):299-305. doi: 10.1002/hon.2900090604.,['10.1002/hon.2900090604 [doi]'],"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined the effect of the dach and en carrier ligands on the ability of Pt-DNA adducts to inhibit DNA replication. Alkaline sucrose gradient sedimentation was used to determine the influence of both carrier ligands on the inhibition of replicon initiation and DNA chain elongation. Initiation of replicons was inhibited by Pt-DNA adducts to a greater extent than chain elongation in all three cell lines. Inhibition of replicon initiation was affected by the nature of the platinum carrier ligands only in the L1210/DACH cells in which 7.8-fold more dach-Pt adducts than en-Pt adducts were required to reach 63% inhibition. However, a strong carrier ligand effect was observed on the inhibition of DNA chain elongation in both the L1210/DDP and L1210/DACH cell lines. The L1210/DDP cell line required 4-fold more en-Pt adducts than dach-Pt adducts to inhibit DNA chain elongation by 63%. In the L1210/DACH cell line, 2.7-fold more dach-Pt adducts than en-Pt adducts were required for 63% inhibition. The L1210/0 cell line demonstrated no carrier ligand specificity for inhibition of chain elongation. Significant replicative bypass of Pt-DNA adducts was observed even in the L1210/0 cell line in that greater than 50 Pt-DNA adducts per 100 kb were required for 63% inhibition. The same level of inhibition was reached with 1.25 adducts of benzo[a]pyrene diolepoxide I per 100 kb. These data suggest that L1210 cells are capable of substantial replicative bypass of Pt-DNA adducts. Furthermore, the bypass of Pt-DNA adducts is increased in resistant L1210 cells and is markedly dependent on the nature of the platinum carrier ligand.","['Gibbons, G R', 'Kaufmann, W K', 'Chaney, S G']","['Gibbons GR', 'Kaufmann WK', 'Chaney SG']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Benzopyrenes/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cisplatin/analysis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'DNA/analysis', '*DNA Adducts', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects/*physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Replicon/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1991 Dec;12(12):2253-7. doi: 10.1093/carcin/12.12.2253.,['10.1093/carcin/12.12.2253 [doi]'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzopyrenes)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (cisplatin-DNA adduct)', '14096-51-6 (platinum ethylenediamine dichloride)', '52691-24-4 (dichloro-1,2-diaminocyclohexane platinum complex)', '60268-85-1 (benzo(a)pyrene diolepoxide I)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,"['CA34082/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to assess (1) the psychological symptom profile of patients consenting to BMT and (2) the relationship of behavioral and psychological factors to patients' perceptions of the quality of communication between physician and patient. The results indicated that adult BMT patients experienced significant psychological distress at the time at which they provided written consent for BMT. Two factors were positively related to perceived quality of communication between physician and patient: problem-focused coping style and perceived autonomy in decision making.

In contrast, no significant differences were observed for the other 13 drugs. There was also a significant difference in sensitivity within the relapsed group--13 having good clinical response and 15 showing no response to chemotherapy--with regard to four drugs, mitomycin C, neocarzinostatin, L-ASP, and teniposide. Cells in the relapsed group had more heterogeneous chemosensitivity than those in the untreated group, and divided into sensitive and resistant types, but large interindividual differences existed.

We have used mAb and polyclonal antibodies against an intracytoplasmic epitope on one of these polypeptides (previously identified in murine B cells as the product of the B cell specific mb-1 gene) to study the distribution of the IgM-associated dimer in human cells. By immunocytochemical staining of normal and neoplastic B cells, we show that the human mb-1 protein appears early in B cell differentiation, probably before expression of cytoplasmic mu-chain, and persists until the plasma cell stage, where it is seen as an intracytoplasmic component. According to immunohistologic analysis of reactive lymphoid tissue and lymphoma samples, mb-1 protein is completely B cell specific. Anti-mb-1 also labels B cell areas in tissues from seven different mammalian species.

Pertussis toxin at 50 ng/ml completely inhibited the activation of Na(+)-dependent uridine transport and consequently prevented the formation of intracellular pools of free uridine which occurs in HL-60 cells induced to differentiate by DMSO. The inhibition of Na(+)-dependent uridine transport by pertussis toxin in cells exposed to DMSO was associated with a 14-fold decrease in affinity, with no change in Vmax. Pertussis toxin, however, had no effect on Na(+)-dependent uridine transport in PMA-induced HL-60 cells. Furthermore, 500 ng of cholera toxin/ml had no effect on the Na(+)-dependent uptake of uridine in DMSO-treated HL-60 cells. These results suggest that the activation of the Na(+)-dependent transport of uridine in HL-60 cells induced to differentiate along the granulocytic pathway by DMSO is coupled to a pertussis-toxin-sensitive guanine-nucleotide binding protein (G-protein).","['Sokoloski, J A', 'Sartorelli, A C', 'Handschumacher, R E', 'Lee, C W']","['Sokoloski JA', 'Sartorelli AC', 'Handschumacher RE', 'Lee CW']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism/pathology', '*Pertussis Toxin', 'Sodium/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uridine/*metabolism', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/*pharmacology']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1991 Dec 1;280 ( Pt 2):515-9. doi: 10.1042/bj2800515.,['10.1042/bj2800515 [doi]'],"['0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-45303/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC1130578,,,,,,,,,

We studied the effects of prolonged metal deprivation (Fe, Cu, Zn) on cell growth and RR activity of murine leukemic lymphocytes in culture in metal-depleted media. Intracellular metals, cell growth and RR activity were decreased in related and interdependent ways. A metal-chelator (deferoxamine, DFX) had similar effect. In all cases these effects were reversible by metal supplementation. We conclude that it is possible to control RR activity and growth of leukemic cells in vitro by exposing them to a metal-poor environment (eg. through the action of a chelator).

Four patients presenting with primary splenic lymphoma of plasmacytic type associated with a high level of monoclonal IgM and a lupus anticoagulant (LA) are described. This association has not previously been reported. In contrast with the usual heterogeneity of LA, this LA is relatively homogeneous with an important prolongation of the prothrombin time (greater than 18 sec for a control of 12), more prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of the mixture patient + control plasma than PTT of the patient plasma. Despite the important coagulation abnormalities, none of these four patients has presented any hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications, even during major surgery such as splenectomy. The lupus-like anticoagulant effect ran parallel with the monoclonal IgM. Survival, after splenectomy and chemotherapy, appears to be favourable: three patients are alive with survivals of greater than or equal to 7 years.

Histological and immunohistochemical studies of morphology and differential diagnosis].,1-265,"450 splenectomy specimens showing involvement by all save a few very infrequently occurring types of malignant lymphomas (ML) recognized by the updated Kiel classification of ML were investigated by conventional histologic and immunohistochemical methods. The results confirm and augment the findings of previous studies and facilitate a comparison of infiltration patterns of different ML in the spleen. These studies in conjunction with immunohistochemical detection of neoplastic cells may thus contribute to the diagnosis of minimal, i.e. early, splenic infiltration by ML and to the differential diagnosis of ML with advanced splenic involvement. Initially, most low grade NHL lead to nodular involvement of the splenic white pulp which may evolve into larger tumor nodules and/or diffuse red pulp involvement by invasion of adjacent red pulp structures. As a rule, the infiltrates are angiotropic, i.e. neoplastic cells accumulate in the vicinity of arterial and venous blood vessels both in the white and in the red pulp. Sinus involvement is frequently associated with leukemic generalisation of the neoplasm. High grade NHL are also localized predominantly in the splenic white pulp. However, their intrasplenic spread is characterized by the formation of large nodular and/or diffuse infiltrates which may efface the splenic architecture. Hodgkin lymphomas (HL), in contrast, cause coalescing tumor nodules which show expansive growth rather than progressive infiltration of the splenic parenchyma. These infiltration patterns of ML in the spleen are a constant finding. In conjunction with cytologic features and immunophenotype of the neoplastic cells they thus constitute reliable criteria for the differential diagnosis of ML in the spleen, although their anatomical and functional basis has not yet been fully elucidated. B and T cell lymphomas initially tend to show selective involvement of the original B and T cell areas of the spleen. Most high grade ML exhibit a similar behavior, although the size of the splenic lesions usually does not permit an exact identification of the ML's primary manifestation in the spleen. They thus exhibit a ""homing phenomenon"" to the two large lymphoid compartments of the spleen which is most conclusively illustrated by the ""organoid"" ML such as CB-CC or T zone lymphoma. This behavior has been interpreted to reflect the histogenesis of the neoplastic cells of the ML under study. In addition, specialised types of accessory cells such as CD35+ FDC and CD1/S100+ IDRC appear to be essential for the creation of conditions which are suitable for B and T lymphocytes, respectively. Progressive infiltration by neoplastic cells will lead to destruction of the normal microenvironment, i.e. alterations of FDC networks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Falk, S']",['Falk S'],"['Senckenbergisches Zentrum der Pathologie, Klinikum der J.-W.-Goethe-Universitat Frankfurt.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Veroff Pathol,Veroffentlichungen aus der Pathologie,7504167,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Mycosis Fungoides/pathology', 'Spleen/anatomy & histology/physiology', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*pathology/physiopathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Veroff Pathol. 1991;136:1-265.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",Maligne Lymphome in der Milz.

METHODS: The clinical and hematological characteristics of 54 patients in blastic crisis (BC) of a CMPD were analyzed: 40 chronic myelogenous leukemias (CML), 9 idiopathic myelofibroses (IMF), 4 polycythemia vera (PV), and one essential thrombocythemia (ET). The results were analyzed by the BMDP statistical program. RESULTS: The BC of CML appeared in younger patients (p less than 0.05). Only in this group did some patients achieve complete remission. Moreover, in this BC a greater incidence of visceromegalies and leukocytoses were observed. The BC of the IMF patients led to marked anemia (p less than 0.01) and bone marrow infiltration (p less than 0.05); these leukemias were more frequent in males and began with lymphadenopathies and visceromegalies. The transformations of PV were preceded by a longer chronic phase and had a lower incidence of visceromegalies and a nearly normal hemoglobin count value. The patient with acute leukemia secondary to ET did not display visceromegalies but did have anemia, leukopenia and a normal platelet count. None of the four groups responded to therapy, and their survival was short.

Nevertheless, HIV-1 activates complement via the classical pathway independent of antibody, and C3b deposition facilitates infection of complement receptor-bearing cells. Using gel exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-1000, purified virions were found to bind 125I-labeled C1q, but not 125I-labeled dimeric proenzyme C1s. Virions activated the C1 complex, reconstituted from C1q, proenzyme C1r, and 125I-labeled proenzyme C1s, to an extent comparable with that obtained with immunoglobulin G-ovalbumin immune complexes. To determine the activating viral component, recombinant viral proteins were used: in the solid phase, soluble gp41 (sgp41) (the outer membrane part of gp41, residues 539-684 of gp160) bound C1q, but not dimeric proenzyme C1s, while gp120 was ineffective. In the fluid phase, sgp41 activated the C1 complex in a dose- and time-dependent manner, more efficiently than aggregated Ig, but less efficiently than immune complexes. To localize the C1 activating site(s) in gp41, synthetic peptides (15-residue oligomers spanning amino acids 531-695 of gp160) were used. Peptides covering positions 591-605 and 601-620 and, to a lesser extent, positions 561-575, had both the ability to bind C1q and to induce C3 deposition. These data provide the first experimental evidence of a direct interaction between the C1 complex and HIV-1, and indicate that C1 binding and activation are mediated by specific sites in gp41.","['Ebenbichler, C F', 'Thielens, N M', 'Vornhagen, R', 'Marschang, P', 'Arlaud, G J', 'Dierich, M P']","['Ebenbichler CF', 'Thielens NM', 'Vornhagen R', 'Marschang P', 'Arlaud GJ', 'Dierich MP']","['Institut fur Hygiene, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Complement C1/*metabolism', '*Complement Pathway, Classical', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120/metabolism', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp41/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Polymyxin B/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1991 Dec 1;174(6):1417-24. doi: 10.1084/jem.174.6.1417.,['10.1084/jem.174.6.1417 [doi]'],"['0 (Complement C1)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp120)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp41)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'J2VZ07J96K (Polymyxin B)']",,,,,PMC2119058,,,,,,,,,

Because this processed component (gp55P) contains larger and more complex oligosaccharides, it can be separated from RER gp55. In nonreducing conditions, gp55P is a unique disulfide-bonded dimer, whereas RER gp55 consists of monomers and dimers with diverse intrachain and interchain disulfide bonds. This suggests that gp55 folds heterogeneously and that only one homodimer is competent for export from the RER. Pulse-chase analyses of gp55 components labeled with radioactive amino acids indicated that formation of diverse disulfide-bonded components occurred within minutes of polypeptide synthesis and that malfolded components did not later isomerize to generate dimers competent for export from the RER. Chemical studies suggested that all 12 cysteines of gp55 were oxidized within 5 min after synthesis of the protein. In contrast, the envelope glycoprotein precursor (gPr90) encoded by a replication-competent murine leukemia virus folds more homogeneously, and it is then processed and cleaved to form an extracellular glycoprotein gp70 plus a transmembrane protein p15E. The fully processed glycoprotein contains an unoxidized cysteine sulfhydryl that isomerizes reversibly with a disulfide bond that links gp70 to p15E. Consequently, only a proportion of gp70 and p15E is disulfide-bonded, and dissociation occurs when the environment becomes even slightly reducing. The gp55 glycoprotein appears to be an extreme example of protein malfolding associated with imprecise and irreversible disulfide bonding. We discuss evidence that folding inefficiencies are common for retroviral proteins that have newly evolving pathogenic functions.","['Gliniak, B C', 'Kozak, S L', 'Jones, R T', 'Kabat, D']","['Gliniak BC', 'Kozak SL', 'Jones RT', 'Kabat D']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201-3098.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Disulfides/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Protein Conformation', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*metabolism']",1991/12/05 00:00,1991/12/05 00:01,['1991/12/05 00:00'],"['1991/12/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/05 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Dec 5;266(34):22991-7.,['S0021-9258(18)54452-5 [pii]'],"['0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,,['CA25810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Based on this evidence, the efforts of most investigators are aimed at providing rapid identification of AL features predictive of distinct prognostic outcomes. A considerable number of reagents (including MoAb and molecular probes) available from commercial sources has been widely used for diagnostic purpose, leading to the identification of ""inappropriate"" antigen expression and to diagnoses of ""mixed"" AL (M-AL). The latter still lacks adequate definition and identification criteria, but is frequently reported as a novel entity associated with poor clinical outcome. The use of more accurate methodologic approaches, as well as a better elucidation of normal hemopoietic cell characteristics suggest that true M-AL occur quite rarely: the features of normal precursor counterparts are more frequently conserved.

Further elucidation of normal stem cell features, and adequate standardization of AL immunophenotyping--to be performed under proper technical conditions--are needed for a better evaluation of M-AL, both in terms of diagnosis and classification, as well as regarding their clinical significance.","['Lo Coco, F']",['Lo Coco F'],"['Dipartimento di Biopatologia Umana, Universita La Sapienza, Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*classification/epidemiology/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Terminology as Topic']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1991 May-Jun;76(3):215-25.,,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,166,,,,,,,,,,,,

Substitution therapy was aimed at increasing the reduced AT III concentration usually found in these patients, since AT III deficiency is thought to be associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Two schedules of AT III administration, different in dosage, timing and duration were evaluated. The first 7 patients (group A) received a fixed dose of 2,000 U every day for 6 times, starting with the second L-asparaginase (L-ase) infusion, independently of their plasma AT III levels. In the following 10 patients (group B), 20-25 U/Kg b.w. were administered daily for 7 times only when the plasma AT III level was lower than 60% with plasma fibrinogen higher than 100 mg/dl and platelet count higher than 50 x 10(9)/l, or when AT III was below 40%. Thirteen patients who received L-ase without AT III substitution served as controls. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Both substitution regimens resulted in mean plasma AT III nadir values significantly (p less than 00.1) higher than in the controls. Our data suggest that, in ALL patients receiving L-ase according to the L20 protocol, satisfactory plasma AT III levels may be assured with infusions of 20-25 U/Kg b.w./day for 7-10 days, starting by day 2 of L-ase treatment.","['Mattioli Belmonte, M', 'Gugliotta, L', 'Delvos, U', 'Catani, L', 'Vianelli, N', 'Cascione, M L', 'Belardinelli, A R', 'Mottola, L', 'Tura, S']","['Mattioli Belmonte M', 'Gugliotta L', 'Delvos U', 'Catani L', 'Vianelli N', 'Cascione ML', 'Belardinelli AR', 'Mottola L', 'Tura S']","['Istituto di Ematologia, L. e A.

Previous work has suggested that the activation of protein kinase C by TPA contributes to the decrease in c-myc expression during differentiation of these cells. The present studies demonstrate that the decline in c-myc mRNA levels following exposure of HL-60 cells to TPA is preceded by an increase in expression of this gene. In contrast, exposure of HL-60 cells to inhibitors of protein kinase C activity is associated with down-modulation of c-myc expression. Similar findings have been obtained in U-937 myeloid leukemia cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that phorbol esters have a biphasic effect on c-myc expression. Whereas the activation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters may be associated with an increase in c-myc gene expression, the subsequent partial down-regulation of kinase activity may initiate a cascade of events resulting in the down-modulation of c-myc expression.","['Bernstein, S H', 'Kharbanda, S M', 'Sherman, M L', 'Stone, R M', 'Kufe, D W']","['Bernstein SH', 'Kharbanda SM', 'Sherman ML', 'Stone RM', 'Kufe DW']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', '*Genes, myc/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrimidine Nucleosides/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Staurosporine', '*Sulfonamides', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1991/12/02 00:00,1991/12/02 00:01,['1991/12/02 00:00'],"['1991/12/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/02 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1991 Dec 2;294(1-2):73-6. doi: 10.1016/0014-5793(91)81346-a.,"['0014-5793(91)81346-A [pii]', '10.1016/0014-5793(91)81346-a [doi]']","['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidine Nucleosides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '18417-89-5 (sangivamycin)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', '91742-10-8 (N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,"['CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08CA01092/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['c-myc'],,,,,,,

Cytotoxicity in vitro against granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) was determined in normal cells from 7 donors, and in vitro toxicity against leukemic cells was determined by a clonogenic technique in cells from 6 patients and by vital dye staining (DiSC) following 4 days' culture in cells from 15 patients.

As analyzed by the DiSC assay, 0.2 microM epirubicin was slightly more toxic to leukemic cells than was the same concentration of doxorubicin (47% vs 61% survival, P less than or equal to 0.01), but the clonogenic assay revealed no difference in toxicity to leukemic cells.

We studied the plasma and CSF pharmacokinetics of 600 mg/m2 ara-C in ten healthy male dogs after its administration as a rapid i.v. bolus (six dogs) or as a 12-h i.v. infusion (four dogs). Ara-C concentration in blood and CSF samples was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

Similar findings were obtained for other leucine zipper encoding genes, including jun-B. These results suggest that 20(S)-camptothecin, 9-amino-20(S)-camptothecin, and 9-nitro-20(S)-camptothecin activate a cellular response involving the induction of early response genes. Finally, we demonstrate that induction of c-jun expression occurs in association with internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, a characteristic of programmed cell death.","['Kharbanda, S', 'Rubin, E', 'Gunji, H', 'Hinz, H', 'Giovanella, B', 'Pantazis, P', 'Kufe, D']","['Kharbanda S', 'Rubin E', 'Gunji H', 'Hinz H', 'Giovanella B', 'Pantazis P', 'Kufe D']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genes, fos', '*Genes, jun', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/12/15 00:00,1991/12/15 00:01,['1991/12/15 00:00'],"['1991/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Dec 15;51(24):6636-42.,,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,"['CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA50529/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['c-jun'],,,,,,,

The reason for this phenomenon is not known. After heat shock (or other environmental stresses), mammalian cells preferentially synthesize a set of proteins known as heat shock proteins (HSPs). HSP-28 and the various isoforms of HSP-70 have been suggested as being responsible for the development of thermotolerance. In these studies, we have attempted to determine by their expression with HSPs positively correlate with the development and decay of thermotolerance and whether the expression of these genes could explain the differing thermotolerance response observed between leukemic and nonleukemic tumor cells. Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression of HSP-28 and several HSP-70 genes. Our data indicate that the expression of all three heat-inducible HSP-70 genes, 70A (Hunt and Morimoto, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82: 6455-6459, 1985), 70B (Voellmy et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82: 4949-4953, 1985), and 70B' (Leung et al., Biochem J., 267: 125-132, 1990) correlate with the development and decay of thermotolerance in nonleukemic tumor cell lines after heat or arsenite treatment. HSP-28 (Hickey et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 4: 4127-4145, 1986) failed to correlate with thermotolerance development; it was not induced after 45 degrees C primary heat shock. In leukemic cells, however, none of the HSPs were induced for extended periods of time. The lack of coordinate expression of HSP genes in cells of myeloid origin may explain the poor induction and maintenance of thermotolerance that is observed in these cells.","['Mivechi, N F', 'Monson, J M', 'Hahn, G M']","['Mivechi NF', 'Monson JM', 'Hahn GM']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Stanford University School of Medicine, California 94305.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Arsenic/pharmacology', '*Arsenites', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Survival', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Gene Expression', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*genetics', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Hyperthermia, Induced', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Sodium Compounds', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/12/15 00:00,1991/12/15 00:01,['1991/12/15 00:00'],"['1991/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Dec 15;51(24):6608-14.,,"['0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Sodium Compounds)', '48OVY2OC72 (sodium arsenite)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",,,"['CA54093/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA44665/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,"['HSP-28', 'HSP-70A', 'HSP-70B']",,,,,,,

In studies of the pharmacological effects of ASNase, investigators have reported prolonged reduction in the serum concentration of Asn after the administration of ASNase. Such measurements may not be valid because ASNase present in the blood sample may hydrolyze Asn before its determination. We examined recovery of [U-14C]Asn from blood samples with and without various concentrations of added ASNase. In the presence of greater than or equal to 0.01 IU/ml of ASNase, the amount of [U-14C]Asn recovered was less than 15% of that without ASNase. Utilizing this assay, we studied the effect of 2 known inhibitors of ASNase in an attempt to improve Asn recovery. In the presence of aspartic beta semialdehyde (ASA), or 5-diazo-4-oxo-L-norvaline (DONV), and up to 1.0 IU/ml ASNase, Asn levels remained at greater than 90% of control. ASA prevented the hydrolysis of exogenous Asn in blood samples drawn from patients after ASNase injection. We also developed a method to determine Asn in serum utilizing high pressure liquid chromatography. Using this method, we found that the Asn level was greater than 90% of a normal level in the presence of 40 mM DONV and 1.0 IU/ml ASNase. Examination of serum from 4 patients treated with ASNase showed that Asn is detectable 7-19 days sooner when DONV is present in the blood collection system than in its absence. We conclude that: (a) as little as 0.01 IU/ml ASNase can hydrolyze Asn added to blood; (b) continued hydrolysis of Asn by ASNase ex vivo can result in falsely low serum Asn measurements; (c) ASA or DONV present in the collection tubes obviates the problem of continued ASNase activity; and (d) the degree and duration of Asn depletion after ASNase therapy is much less than previously believed. Thus, for accurate measurements of the duration and degree of Asn depletion by ASNase, an ASNase inhibitor such as ASA or DONV should be present in the blood collection system.","['Asselin, B L', 'Lorenson, M Y', 'Whitin, J C', 'Coppola, D J', 'Kende, A S', 'Blakley, R L', 'Cohen, H J']","['Asselin BL', 'Lorenson MY', 'Whitin JC', 'Coppola DJ', 'Kende AS', 'Blakley RL', 'Cohen HJ']","[""Strong Children's Research Center, University of Rochester, New York 14642.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Aminolevulinic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Asparaginase/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Asparagine/*blood', 'Aspartic Acid/analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans']",1991/12/15 00:00,1991/12/15 00:01,['1991/12/15 00:00'],"['1991/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Dec 15;51(24):6568-73.,,"['17808-06-9 (5-diazo-4-oxonorvaline)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '498-20-4 (aspartic semialdehyde)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,"['00199-03/PHS HHS/United States', '5P01CA34183-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-0044/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Interferon (IFN) has shown antiproliferative activity in several malignant hematologic diseases and potentially may be of benefit when administered early after BMT when the number of residual cells is minimal. We tested in a phase I study the maximum tolerated daily dose of recombinant IFN alpha-2b in patients who had received a transplant for a disease at high risk for relapse (acute myeloid leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma beyond first remission, advanced myelodysplastic syndrome, acute lymphoblastic leukemia at any stage, chronic myeloid leukemia in accelerated or blast phase. Recombinant IFN alpha-2b was started at a dose of 0.5 x 10(6) IU/m2 and escalated by 0.5 x 10(6) IU/m2 in groups of three or four patients. The intention was to administer IFN as soon as stable engraftment after BMT was achieved (defined as an absolute neutrophil count of greater than 2.0 x 10(9)/L and platelet count greater than 100 x 10(9)/L for 5 consecutive days) and continued for 2 months. A total of 14 patients were enrolled after autologous (n = 3) or allogeneic (n = 11) BMT. Dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression. Significant (grade 2 to 4) neutropenia and thrombocytopenia led to discontinuation or dose reduction in five of eight patients receiving 1.5 x 10(6) or 2 x 10(6) IU/m2 IFN. Mild to moderate (grade 1 or 2) anorexia, weight loss, and fatigue occurred in the majority of patients independent of the IFN dose. De novo acute GVHD responsive to steroid treatment developed in 3 of 11 allograft recipients. Natural killer (NK) cell function was low before IFN treatment and was not improved with the cytokine. Conversely, interleukin-2-activated NK cells showed normal function even before starting IFN and no change was seen during IFN treatment. Clonogenic hematopoietic progenitor studies showed depression of all progenitor lines (colony-forming unit [CFU]-granulocyte, erythroid, monocyte, megakaryocyte, CFU granulocyte-macrophage, burst-forming unit-erythroid) by IFN at all dose levels except at 0.5 x 10(6) IU/m2.

Undifferentiated ML-1 or THP-1 cells produced trace amounts of eicosanoids via the cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways. Upon differentiation induced by phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate [PMA]), metabolites via the COX pathway were increased by 100-fold in ML-1 and THP-1 cells, while the LOX products remained barely detectable. All the COX metabolites were elevated, but thromboxane A2 (TXA2) formation was threefold higher in ML-1 cells than in THP-1 cells. Similar time-related increases in COX metabolites were observed in THP-1 cells induced to differentiate with retinoic acid. Undifferentiated U937 cells were capable of generating a much higher quantity of COX products than ML-1 or THP-1 cells, but, upon PMA-induced differentiation, COX products were increased by only two-fold to threefold over the undifferentiated cells and the total COX products in differentiated U937 cells were only one-seventh of those produced by differentiated ML-1 or THP-1 cells. KG-1 cells had an entirely different metabolic profile. They produced a large quantity of a metabolite coeluted with prostaglandin D2, and PMA had no effect on inducing changes in arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism. Increased COX metabolite formation in differentiated THP-1 and ML-1 cells was due to an enhanced level of prostaglandin H synthase enzyme mass, as measured by Western blot analysis. The TXA synthase activity was also increased by approximately 100-fold in PMA-induced ML-1 cells and 10-fold in THP-1 cells.

TPA (10(-7) mol/L) completely inhibited cellular division in MEG-O1, but did not suppress de novo DNA synthesis. Two days' culture with 10(-7) mol/L TPA was sufficient for MEG-O1 cells to initiate an irreversible commitment process. These cells could not resume cell growth and expressed GP IIb/IIIa antigen; some of them showed multinuclear form and DNA polyploidy even after removal of TPA from the culture medium. DNA histogram analysis showed that, upon treatment with TPA, the percentage of cells whose DNA ploidy was more than 8N was 5 to 10 times higher than that of control cells. Precise analysis using cell size fractionation by centrifugal elutriation method showed that there was strong correlation between the percentage of multinuclear cells and DNA polyploidy in TPA-treated cells. The percentage and staining intensity of GP IIb/IIIa and other megakaryocytic phenotypes such as von Willebrand factor and PAS staining were highest in large multinuclear cell populations, suggesting that these cells are the most differentiated population in this system. In TPA-treated cells, the activity of DNA polymerase alpha, a marker for cell growth, remained at the same level as in control cells. Aphidicolin, a specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha, completely inhibited the differentiation induction of MEG-O1 cells with TPA measured by either GP IIb/IIIa expression or multinuclear cell formation. Therefore, DNA replication appears to be involved in the process of phenotypic expression as well as endomitosis in megakaryocyte differentiation of MEG-O1 cells. Aphidicolin was also effective in inhibiting megakaryocytic differentiation of other leukemia cell lines such as human erythroleukemia (HEL) and K562 cell lines induced with TPA, suggesting the close interplay of DNA replication and phenotypic expression in megakaryopoiesis.","['Murate, T', 'Hotta, T', 'Tsushita, K', 'Suzuki, M', 'Yoshida, T', 'Saga, S', 'Saito, H', 'Yoshida, S']","['Murate T', 'Hotta T', 'Tsushita K', 'Suzuki M', 'Yoshida T', 'Saga S', 'Saito H', 'Yoshida S']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Aphidicolin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA/analysis', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Ploidies', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/12/15 00:00,1991/12/15 00:01,['1991/12/15 00:00'],"['1991/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1991 Dec 15;78(12):3168-77.,['S0006-4971(20)65795-0 [pii]'],"['0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wellcome HCL Study Group.,3133-41,"One hundred thirty-eight patients with hairy cell leukemia were randomized to receive either a dose of 2.0 megaunits (MU)/m2 or a 10-fold lower dose of 0.2 MU/m2 of a highly purified natural alpha-interferon, administered daily for 28 days followed by a three times a week schedule. Ninety-seven of these patients had previously undergone splenectomy, but otherwise none of the patients had received prior therapy for their leukemia. The two doses were comparable in their effect on improving the neutrophil and platelet count, whereas the higher dose had a greater beneficial effect on the hemoglobin level and a greater antileukemic effect on the marrow. Acute toxicity in the form of a flu-like syndrome, neurologic side effects, neutropenia, and the need for platelet transfusions was observed less frequently in the low-dose group, as was the chronic fatigue syndrome. No neutralizing antibody activity was seen in the sera from 61 patients examined. Because of its beneficial effect on the neutrophil and platelet count and a lower degree of toxicity (ie, a superior therapeutic/toxicity ratio), the low dose is recommended as initial therapy in patients with hairy cell leukemia. This therapy may be followed by dose escalation once clinical improvement is observed.","['Smalley, R V', 'Anderson, S A', 'Tuttle, R L', 'Connors, J', 'Thurmond, L M', 'Huang, A', 'Castle, K', 'Magers, C', 'Whisnant, J K']","['Smalley RV', 'Anderson SA', 'Tuttle RL', 'Connors J', 'Thurmond LM', 'Huang A', 'Castle K', 'Magers C', 'Whisnant JK']","['University of Wisconsin, Madison.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies/blood', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Platelet Count', 'Splenectomy']",1991/12/15 00:00,1991/12/15 00:01,['1991/12/15 00:00'],"['1991/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1991 Dec 15;78(12):3133-41.,['S0006-4971(20)65790-1 [pii]'],"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The position of the breakpoint within the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) on Ph1 chromosome and the splicing pattern determine the species of the fused bcr-abl messenger RNA (mRNA). We tried to detect the two types of fused mRNAs in 57 chronic-phase cases of Ph1-positive CML using the polymerase chain reaction procedure (RT-PCR). The bcr exon 2/abl exon 2 fused mRNA (b2-a2) was detected in 17 patients, the bcr exon 3/abl exon 2 fused mRNA (b3-a2) was detected in 34 patients, and both types of mRNA were detected in six patients. The platelet counts of patients who expressed b3-a2 mRNA or both types were significantly higher than those of patients who expressed only b2-a2 (841.5 v 373.5 x 10(9)/L; P less than .015), although there was no significant difference in the white blood cell counts or hemoglobin.

In normal B lymphocytes and lymphocytes from five patients with B-CLL, TPA stimulation increased lymphocyte fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (fructose 2,6-P2) content and activity of 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase (PFK-2), which is the enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of fructose 2,6-P2. This effect was evident after 6 h and maximal after 12-24 h of TPA exposure. In three patients, lymphocytes seemed to be refractory to TPA stimulation in the conditions described here. Lymphocyte stimulation by TPA was associated with the translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) from the soluble to the particulate membrane fraction, except in B-CLL lymphocytes refractory to the TPA effect. These results give further support to the existence within B-CLL of subsets of cells which are refractory to the stimulation by TPA and demonstrate that the tumor promoter TPA induces important metabolic changes in lymphocytes of some patients with B-CLL.","['Colomer, D', 'Vives Corrons, J L', 'Bartrons, R']","['Colomer D', 'Vives Corrons JL', 'Bartrons R']","['Haematology Laboratory Department, Hospital Clinic i Provincial, Faculty of Medicine, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Fructosediphosphates/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactates/metabolism', 'Lactic Acid', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/chemistry', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1991/11/21 00:00,1991/11/21 00:01,['1991/11/21 00:00'],"['1991/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/21 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1991 Nov 21;1097(4):270-4. doi: 10.1016/0925-4439(91)90080-s.,"['0925-4439(91)90080-S [pii]', '10.1016/0925-4439(91)90080-s [doi]']","['0 (Fructosediphosphates)', '0 (Lactates)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '79082-92-1 (fructose 2,6-diphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, ALDH-1 immunoreactive protein could be detected only in the L1210/CPA cells.

Rather, a qualitative abnormality in the regulation of this gene appears to exist in the L1210/CPA cells, which distinguishes them from L1210/O cells and from normal murine lymphocytes.","['Radin, A I', 'Zhoa, X L', 'Woo, T H', 'Colvin, O M', 'Hilton, J']","['Radin AI', 'Zhoa XL', 'Woo TH', 'Colvin OM', 'Hilton J']","['Division of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Biotransformation', 'Cyclophosphamide/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Drug Resistance', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/10/24 00:00,1991/10/24 00:01,['1991/10/24 00:00'],"['1991/10/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/24 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1991 Oct 24;42(10):1933-9. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(91)90592-s.,"['0006-2952(91)90592-S [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(91)90592-s [doi]']","['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)']",,,['CA36966/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Of 124 patients under 15 years of age, 18 of whom were infants, 118 were evaluable. Of these, 58 were treated before 1980 and, although complete remission (CR) was attained in 75%, the median duration was lower than 12 months and no patient survived in CR more than 6 years. From 1981 to 1987, 40 patients received one or two induction treatments followed by three consolidations and then blocks of sequential intensive chemotherapy for 12-15 months. CR was attained in 87.5% and event-free survival (EFS) was 22.5% at 8 years: 14% for those treated from 1981 to 1983 and 33% for those included in the ANLL-84 protocol. In 1988, a post-remission protocol with intensification therapy (two high-dose ARA-C treatments combined with mitoxantrone in the first and amsacrine in the second) followed by allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) was initiated. Of 20 patients included, 17 reached CR (85%) and 16 underwent BMT. EFS of the 20 patients was 65% at 2 years and post-BMT relapse-free survival was 75%. These results are compared with those obtained separately with present intensive chemotherapy protocols and with BMT and it is concluded that intensification treatment followed by BMT (allogeneic or autologous) might constitute an advance in the treatment of children with ANLL.","['Ortega Aramburu, J J', 'Olive Oliveras, T', 'Javier Manchon, G', 'Bastida Vila, P']","['Ortega Aramburu JJ', 'Olive Oliveras T', 'Javier Manchon G', 'Bastida Vila P']","[""Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital M-Infantil Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona.""]",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Spain,An Esp Pediatr,Anales espanoles de pediatria,0420463,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy/history', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/history/*therapy', 'Remission Induction']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,An Esp Pediatr. 1991 Sep;35(3):157-63.,,,Evolucion del tratamiento de las leucemias agudas no linfoblasticas en el nino (1968-1990).,39,,,,,,,,,,,,

The genes affected by these chromosomal translocations appear to play an important role in oncogenesis. The mechanism underlying the formation of chromosomal translocation is a subject under extensive study. In chromosomal translocations involving the Ig and TCR loci, complete heptamer-spacer-nonamer signal motifs are usually present at the break of the Ig and TCR genes, indicating the involvement of V-D-J recombinase(s). On the other hand, in only about 50% of the cases signal motif sequences have been found at the break in the other participating chromosome, suggesting that different mechanisms may be involved in the scission of the corresponding chromosome. Here we report the identification of an oligopurine/oligopyrimidine DNA in the t(10;14) breakpoint cluster region associated with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. S1 nuclease mapping revealed multiple S1 hypersensitive sites in the oligopurine/oligopyrimidine DNA.

Using a clonogenic culture system, cytogenetic aberrations in individual colonies of haemopoietic cells derived from irradiated stem cells have been studied. Exposure to alpha-particles (but not X-rays) produced a high frequency of non-clonal aberrations in the clonal descendants, compatible with alpha-emitters inducing lesions in stem cells that result in the transmission of chromosomal instability to their progeny.

Thus, we designed a phase I study to maximize the accumulation of dFdCTP by leukemia cells by administering dFdC at 10 mg/m2/min, a dose rate calculated to produce steady-state plasma dFdC levels that exceed 15 to 20 mumol/L. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The treatment intensity was increased in patients (n = 22) with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in blast crisis by prolonging the infusion duration but maintaining the same rate. Doses of dFdC between 1,200 mg/m2 and 6,400 mg/m2 were administered weekly for 3 weeks. RESULTS: The maximum-tolerated dose was 4,800 mg/m2 infused over 480 minutes. The mean steady-state dFdC level in plasma of all infusions was 26.5 +/- 9 mumol/L (n = 19). The accumulation rates of dFdCTP in circulating leukemia cells varied greatly among patients but remained linear in eight patients infused for 120 to 240 minutes, and up to or beyond 360 minutes in five of eight additional patients. Elimination of dFdCTP was significantly related to its cellular concentration: blasts with greater than 450 mumol/L dFdCTP exhibited biphasic elimination, whereas blasts with lower dFdCTP concentrations exhibited linear kinetics. Biphasic elimination was associated with higher dFdCTP areas under the concentration-times-time curve (AUCs) and greater inhibition of DNA synthesis. CONCLUSION: Studies of the cellular pharmacology and pharmacodynamics of dFdC may be useful in optimizing protocol designs for leukemia.","['Grunewald, R', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Du, M', 'Faucher, K', 'Tarassoff, P', 'Plunkett, W']","['Grunewald R', 'Kantarjian H', 'Du M', 'Faucher K', 'Tarassoff P', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1992 Mar;10(3):406-13. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1992.10.3.406.,['10.1200/JCO.1992.10.3.406 [doi]'],"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",,,['CA32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients were treated with daunorubicin 120 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, cytarabine (ara-C) 1.5 g/m2/d by continuous infusion over 24 hours for 4 days, and Solu-Medrol (methylprednisolone; The Upjohn Co, Kalamazoo, MI) 100 mg/d for 5 days, followed on day 5 by GM-CSF 125 micrograms/m2/d over 6 hours until recovery of granulocyte count above 2.0 x 10(3)/microliters. Twenty-four patients had CML-BP, and 24 had CML-AP. RESULTS: During remission induction, 45 patients (94%) developed febrile episodes (fever of unknown origin, 23 patients [48%]; documented infections, 22 patients [46%]). The median time to recovery of granulocyte count above 0.5 x 10(3)/microliters was 29 days and to platelet count above 30 x 10(3)/microliters, 28 days. Overall, 14 of 48 patients (29%) achieved a complete hematologic remission (CHR), and seven (15%) reverted to a second chronic phase. CHR was noted in eight of 24 patients with CML-BP (33%), and in six of 24 patients with CML-AP (25%). Cytogenetic responses were observed in 11 patients (23%), but were transient. Sixteen patients developed either fluid retention, hypotension, pleuropericardial effusions, or pericarditis, or a combination of these side effects. These side effects were severe in four patients and are likely to be disease-associated, as a similar regimen of intensive chemotherapy and GM-CSF at the same dose and schedule in acute lymphocytic leukemia was not associated with these side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The results pertinent to remission rates, induction mortality, myelosuppression profile and related complications, and overall survival were not significantly improved compared with previous experience. In summary, the results of intensive chemotherapy in CML-transformed phases remain poor, despite the addition of GM-CSF as a supportive measure.","['Kantarjian, H M', 'Talpaz, M', 'Kontoyiannis, D', 'Gutterman, J', 'Keating, M J', 'Estey, E H', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Rios, M B', 'Beran, M', 'Deisseroth, A']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Talpaz M', 'Kontoyiannis D', 'Gutterman J', 'Keating MJ', 'Estey EH', ""O'Brien S"", 'Rios MB', 'Beran M', 'Deisseroth A']","['Department of Hematology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1992 Mar;10(3):398-405. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1992.10.3.398.,['10.1200/JCO.1992.10.3.398 [doi]'],"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,['CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The LIF gene from a number of mammalian species is highly conserved. The ovine and porcine LIF genes were cloned, sequenced and compared to the previously published murine and human LIF gene sequences. While the coding regions of the LIF gene are highly conserved, the non-coding regions are largely non-conserved. In a region of approximately 340 bp, the 5' end of the translational initiation codon is highly conserved (84%). This region includes four conserved TATA boxes, two transcriptional start-sites identified in the murine gene and the minimal region required to function as the LIF promoter. A sequence in the murine gene adjacent to this highly conserved region which appears to contain a negative control element is, however, poorly conserved between the four species compared, except for a sequence of 16 conserved nucleotides. Within the largely non-conserved first intron, there is a block of approximately 150 nucleotides which is highly conserved between all four species (approximately 72%). However, a sequence in intron 1 of the murine LIF gene which corresponds to an alternative exon of a putative variant LIF transcript is very poorly conserved between species, with only relics of this exon evident in the other three species. A comparison of the five LIF protein sequences available (murine, rat, human, ovine and porcine) revealed that the protein displays a high degree of similarity, ranging from 74% between mouse and sheep to 92% between rat and mouse. Several large blocks of absolutely conserved amino acid sequence were identified. The ovine LIF gene was modified to allow production of recombinant ovine LIF in yeast cells, which was shown to be biologically active on murine cells.","['Willson, T A', 'Metcalf, D', 'Gough, N M']","['Willson TA', 'Metcalf D', 'Gough NM']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Codon', 'DNA/chemistry', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/chemistry/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Introns', 'Kluyveromyces/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/chemistry/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Sheep', 'Species Specificity', 'Swine', 'Transformation, Genetic']",1992/02/15 00:00,1992/02/15 00:01,['1992/02/15 00:00'],"['1992/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1992 Feb 15;204(1):21-30. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1992.tb16601.x.,['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1992.tb16601.x [doi]'],"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,['CA22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

At or above a critical C x T product value (CPV) (e.g., 0.5-1.0 microM TBT, 6 hr), exposed MELC exhibit severe, irreversible toxicity: decreased membrane integrity (viability, measured by propidium iodide [PI] exclusion), grossly perturbed cell-cycle distributions, and fixation of the plasma membrane/cytoplasm complex. Below the CPV, exposed cells exhibit retention of carboxyfluorescein (CF) fluorescence (indicative of decreased plasma membrane permeability) and decreased cell proliferation, a result of retardation of progression into, through, and out of the S (DNA synthetic) phase of the cell cycle. However, following washout and recovery, mean CF fluorescence, cell proliferative capacity, and cell-cycle kinetics return to control levels. These results suggest that the toxic changes induced by TBT exposure may be reversible if exposure conditions do not exceed the CPV.

A statistically significant trend toward an increased incidence of soft tissue sarcomas was identified. Statistically insignificant trends included an increased incidence of brain tumors (probably reflecting improved diagnostic procedures) and a decreased incidence of thyroid tumors. Incidence rates of leukemias in the first year of life tended to decrease. As expected, survival rates of some childhood cancers dramatically improved throughout the 20-year period; this occurred in leukemias, brain tumors, soft tissue sarcomas, and renal tumors.

Lymph node biopsy specimens from all the patients showed a diffuse obliteration of lymph node architecture, prominent vascular proliferation, a polymorphous cellular infiltrate, including immunoblasts, and varying degrees of clear cell proliferation. The patients were eight males and six females, with a median age of 58.5 years. All but one were in an advanced stage at the time of diagnosis. Bone marrow involvement was observed in eight patients. Thirteen patients had a negative serologic reaction for antibody to human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), and one patient was considered to be a HTLV-I carrier. Polyclonal hypergamma-globulinemia was observed in 6 patients, and 6 of the 12 patients showed elevated IgE levels. Immunophenotyping of the involved lymph nodes revealed a preponderance of T-cells in all the patients. Eleven of these patients showed a predominance of CD4+ over CD8+ T-cells, and only one patient showed a predominance of CD8+ over CD4+ T-cells. Two of five patients whose gene analysis was carried out showed clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta chain gene without rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes. Twelve patients received doxorubicin-containing combination chemotherapy; of these, 7 patients achieved complete response, and the other 5 had partial response. Nine patients are still alive with a median follow-up period of 21 months, and five patients died during the follow-up period. Progression to high-grade T-cell lymphoma with systemic infiltration was ascertained in two of three cases for which autopsy was performed. From our experience, we recommend doxorubicin-containing combination chemotherapy as initial therapy for AIL-related lesions.","['Ohsaka, A', 'Saito, K', 'Sakai, T', 'Mori, S', 'Kobayashi, Y', 'Amemiya, Y', 'Sakamoto, S', 'Miura, Y']","['Ohsaka A', 'Saito K', 'Sakai T', 'Mori S', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Amemiya Y', 'Sakamoto S', 'Miura Y']","['Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Tochigiken, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblastic Lymphadenopathy/*drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1992 Mar 1;69(5):1259-67. doi: 10.1002/cncr.2820690531.,['10.1002/cncr.2820690531 [doi]'],"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'CHOP protocol', 'COP protocol 2', 'VMCP protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptors were elevated significantly in the serum of all four patients with CD4+ CD45R+ T-CLL. Moreover, the CD4+ CD45R+ T-CLL patients' T-cells, after in vitro stimulation with phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A, expressed elevated percentages of interleukin-2 receptors on cells and secreted high interleukin-2 activity. The B-cell growth factor (BCGF) activity from three patients with CD4+ CD45R+ T-CLL was enhanced, but B-cell differentiation factor (BCDF) activity of the all T-CLL patients was decreased. Reduced BCGF and BCDF activity of the leukemic T-cells was one possible mechanism of hypogammaglobulinemia detected in two patients with T-CLL. All T-CLL patients' leukemic T-cells had diminished immunoregulatory functional activity in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions. These observations suggest that leukemic T-cells from T-CLL patients have many immunologic functional defects that may be important in their proliferative potential.","['Raziuddin, S', 'Sheikha, A', 'Latif, A A']","['Raziuddin S', 'Sheikha A', 'Latif AA']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, King Saud University, College of Medicine, Abha, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Interleukin-4/immunology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1992 Mar 1;69(5):1146-52. doi: 10.1002/cncr.2820690514.,['10.1002/cncr.2820690514 [doi]'],"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: United Kingdom. SUBJECTS: 95,217 radiation workers at major sites of the nuclear industry. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cause of death. RESULTS: Most standardised mortality ratios were below 100: 83 unlagged, 85 with a 10 year lag for all causes; 84 unlagged, 86 lagged for all cancers; and 80 for all known other causes, indicating a ""healthy worker effect."" The deficit of lung cancer (75 unlagged, 76 lagged) was significant at the 0.1% level. Standardised mortality ratios were significantly raised (214 unlagged, 303 lagged) for thyroid cancer, but there was no evidence for any trend with external recorded radiation dose. Dose of external radiation and mortality from all cancers were weakly correlated (p = 0.10), and multiple myeloma was more strongly correlated (p = 0.06); for leukaemia, excluding chronic lymphatic, the trend was significant (p = 0.03; all tests one tailed). The central estimates of lifetime risk derived from these data were 10.0% per Sv (90% confidence interval less than 0 to 24%) for all cancers and 0.76% per Sv (0.07 to 2.4%) for leukaemia (excluding chronic lymphatic leukaemia). These are, respectively, 2.5 times and 1.9 times the risk estimates recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection, but 90% confidence intervals are large and the commission's risk factors fall well within the range. The positive trend with dose for all cancers, from which the risk estimate was derived, was not significant. The positive association between leukaemia (except chronic lymphatic leukaemia) was significant and robust in subsidiary analyses. This study showed no association between radiation exposure and prostatic cancer. CONCLUSION: There is evidence for an association between radiation exposure and mortality from cancer, in particular leukaemia (excluding chronic lymphatic leukaemia) and multiple myeloma, although mortality from these diseases in the study population overall was below that in the general population. The central estimates of risk from this study lie above the most recent estimates of the International Commission on Radiological Protection for leukaemia (excluding chronic lymphatic leukaemia) and for all malignancies. However, the commission's risk estimates are well within the 90% confidence intervals from this study. Analysis of combined cohorts of radiation workers in the United States indicated lower risk estimates than the commission recommends, and when the American data are combined with our analysis the overall risks are close to those estimated by the commission. This first analysis of the National Registry for Radiation Workers does not provide sufficient evidence to justify a revision in risk estimates for radiological protection purposes.","['Kendall, G M', 'Muirhead, C R', 'MacGibbon, B H', ""O'Hagan, J A"", 'Conquest, A J', 'Goodill, A A', 'Butland, B K', 'Fell, T P', 'Jackson, D A', 'Webb, M A']","['Kendall GM', 'Muirhead CR', 'MacGibbon BH', ""O'Hagan JA"", 'Conquest AJ', 'Goodill AA', 'Butland BK', 'Fell TP', 'Jackson DA', 'Webb MA', 'et al.']","['National Radiological Protection Board, Chilton, Didcot.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality', 'Neoplasms/mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', '*Nuclear Energy', 'Occupational Diseases/*etiology/mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Radiation Dosage', '*Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1992/01/25 00:00,1992/01/25 00:01,['1992/01/25 00:00'],"['1992/01/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/25 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,BMJ. 1992 Jan 25;304(6821):220-5. doi: 10.1136/bmj.304.6821.220.,['10.1136/bmj.304.6821.220 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC1881453,,,,,,,,,

However, certain lessons have been learned. First, cure can be permanent but the complexity and cost of curative treatment currently restricts its accessibility; prevention or simple curative treatment is needed. Secondly, cure of the child demands that the risk of adverse sequelae of treatments be carefully balanced with known therapeutic benefits. Thirdly, preventive meningeal irradiation is no longer required. Fourth, treatment intensification is self-limiting. Adverse reactions can cancel out or exceed therapeutic benefits, resulting in a lower cure rate or a similar cure rate with lower quality of cure. Finally, morphology, immunophenotype and genotype of acute leukaemia are important criteria for selecting and scheduling drug therapy. Genotype may be the most important since leukaemia is a genetic disorder for which morphology and immunophenotype are mere reflections. However, none of these features, individually or together, are sufficient to explain all the difference in outcome among children on a given treatment plan or to completely fulfill the need of criteria for selection of treatment. Acute leukaemia remains an unsolved problem demanding considerably more basic and clinical research to meet the need for prevention and simple dependable curative treatment.","['Pinkel, D']",['Pinkel D'],"['Kana Research Chair in Pediatric Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/pathology/*therapy']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1992 Feb;65(2):148-53. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1992.32.,['10.1038/bjc.1992.32 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC1977749,,,,,,,,,

The availability of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ceftazidime and imipenem has made it possible to initiate therapy with a single agent (monotherapy). The objectives of this trial were to compare ceftazidime and imipenem as single agents for the therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients and to ascertain whether the addition of an aminoglycoside (amikacin) to either of these agents would provide an advantage. METHODS: A prospective clinical trial was conducted in which eligible neutropenic patients with cancer were randomized to one of four treatment arms: ceftazidime alone; imipenem alone; ceftazidime plus amikacin; and imipenem plus amikacin. Efficacy analysis was done for 750 assessable episodes. A multivariate logistic-regression analysis was also performed to examine the unique contribution of various prognostic factors. RESULTS: The overall response rates were 76% with imipenem plus amikacin, 72% with imipenem, 71% with ceftazidime plus amikacin, and 59% with ceftazidime alone. Single-organism gram-positive infections occurred in 101 of 750 episodes. Without a change in antibiotics, the response rates were 50% with imipenem, 40% with imipenem plus amikacin, 39% with ceftazidime plus amikacin, and 38% with ceftazidime. Most responded to vancomycin or other antibiotics, and the mortality associated with gram-positive infections was only 5%. Regardless of the antibiotic regimen, the majority of uncomplicated gram-negative infections responded to therapy and the majority of complicated gram-negative infections failed to respond. Multivariate logistic-regression analysis showed that recovery of the neutrophil count was the most favorable prognostic factor in a patient's response to infection, whereas the presence of gram-positive infection, acute leukemia, pulmonary or enteric infection, and therapy with ceftazidime were unfavorable factors. CONCLUSIONS: Single-agent therapy with imipenem is as effective as more conventional combination antibiotic therapy for the empirical treatment of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients with cancer.","['Rolston, K V', 'Berkey, P', 'Bodey, G P', 'Anaissie, E J', 'Khardori, N M', 'Joshi, J H', 'Keating, M J', 'Holmes, F A', 'Cabanillas, F F', 'Elting, L']","['Rolston KV', 'Berkey P', 'Bodey GP', 'Anaissie EJ', 'Khardori NM', 'Joshi JH', 'Keating MJ', 'Holmes FA', 'Cabanillas FF', 'Elting L']","['Department of Medical Specialties, University of Texas M.

Group 1 consisted of 21 children who had had cranial irradiation as part of their treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia; group 2, 18 normal children; and group 3, 12 boys with constitutional delay in growth and puberty who were in early puberty. Children in groups 1 and 2 each had a 24 hour serum growth hormone profile (sampling every 20 minutes) and concurrent urine collection. The 12 boys in group 3 had a total of 21 profiles (sampling every 15 minutes for 12 hours) and concurrent urine collections. In the prepubertal children (n = 17), in both groups 1 and 2, there was a significant correlation between mean serum growth hormone and total uGHng/g creatinine. There were also significant correlations between total uGHng/g creatinine and both peak serum growth hormone and mean amplitude of the pulses in the growth hormone profile. In the pubertal children (n = 22), in groups 1 and 2, whether combined or in separate groups, there was no significant correlation between total uGHng/g creatinine and mean serum growth hormone, peak serum growth hormone, or mean amplitude of the pulses in the growth hormone profile. In group 3 there were significant correlations between total uGHng/g creatinine and both the mean serum growth hormone and mean amplitude of the pulses in the profile. Therefore uGH estimations appear to correlate well with serum growth hormone profiles in children who are prepubertal or in early puberty, but not in those further advanced in pubertal development. These results may reflect a variation in the renal handling of growth hormone during pubertal development. uGH estimation may be an unreliable screening investigation for growth hormone sufficiency in mid to late puberty.","['Crowne, E C', 'Wallace, W H', 'Shalet, S M', 'Addison, G M', 'Price, D A']","['Crowne EC', 'Wallace WH', 'Shalet SM', 'Addison GM', 'Price DA']","[""Royal Manchester Children's Hospital.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Creatinine/urine', 'Female', 'Growth Disorders/metabolism', 'Growth Hormone/*blood/*urine', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/radiotherapy', 'Puberty/*metabolism', 'Urea/urine']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1992 Jan;67(1):91-5. doi: 10.1136/adc.67.1.91.,['10.1136/adc.67.1.91 [doi]'],"['8W8T17847W (Urea)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)']",,,,,PMC1793552,,,['Arch Dis Child. 1992 Oct;67(10):1318.

Analysis was by linkage of abstracts of routine records of hospital inpatient care in six districts in southern England covered by the Oxford record linkage study. The total time spend in hospital in the acute specialties each year was calculated by summing the lengths of stay of all episodes of care for each child in each year. First, admissions with long median times in hospital per child admitted were identified. These included, notably, fracture of femur and, in the later years, leukaemia, other malignant neoplasms, and congenital disorders of metabolism. Second conditions were identified which accounted for large numbers of children with lengths of stay of five days or more. These included, in particular, congenital anomalies, asthma, and appendicitis. Third, conditions were identified which accounted for the largest numbers of bed days used. These included congenital anomalies, hypertrophy of tonsils and adenoids, asthma, otitis media, appendicitis, and head injury. Median time spent in hospital per child admitted declined for most conditions but increased for leukaemia, other malignant neoplasms, and congenital disorders of metabolism. Admission rates for children who spent five days or more in hospital each year declined for all common conditions except asthma which increased. Total numbers of beds used increased for asthma and otitis media but declined for all other common conditions.","['Henderson, J', 'Goldacre, M J', 'Fairweather, J M', 'Marcovitch, H']","['Henderson J', 'Goldacre MJ', 'Fairweather JM', 'Marcovitch H']","['Unit of Clinical Epidemiology, University of Oxford.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Appendicitis/epidemiology', 'Asthma/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Hospitalized/*classification', 'Child, Preschool', 'Congenital Abnormalities/epidemiology', 'Cystic Fibrosis/epidemiology', 'Diagnosis-Related Groups/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Femoral Fractures/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Length of Stay/*statistics & numerical data', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Medical Record Linkage', 'Metabolism, Inborn Errors/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1992 Jan;67(1):83-6. doi: 10.1136/adc.67.1.83.,['10.1136/adc.67.1.83 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC1793565,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND SETTING: Survey of 342 institutions in 47 countries. MEASUREMENTS: Numbers of patients receiving bone marrow transplantation for specific disease categories at institutions with active allogeneic bone marrow transplant programs. MAIN RESULTS: Patients (14,745) received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation between 1988 and 1990; of these, 1153 (8%) were from unrelated donors. Reasons for transplantation were acute leukemia (47%), chronic myelogenous leukemia (27%), lymphoma and other malignancies (10%), severe aplastic anemia (9%), and other nonmalignant diseases (7%). The number of allogeneic bone marrow transplants per million persons differed among countries, averaging 7.7 per million in North America and 5.7 per million in western Europe. CONCLUSIONS: The use of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation continued to increase at a rate of more than 600 additional patients and 25 new transplant teams annually. This rise is due in part to increasing use of unrelated volunteers as donors. Resources allocated for transplants vary widely among countries.","['Bortin, M M', 'Horowitz, M M', 'Rimm, A A']","['Bortin MM', 'Horowitz MM', 'Rimm AA']","['International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, Milwaukee, WI.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*statistics & numerical data/trends', 'Humans', 'Registries', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Transplantation, Autologous/statistics & numerical data', 'Transplantation, Homologous/statistics & numerical data', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic/statistics & numerical data']",1992/03/15 00:00,1992/03/15 00:01,['1992/03/15 00:00'],"['1992/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1992 Mar 15;116(6):505-12. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-116-6-505.,['10.7326/0003-4819-116-6-505 [doi]'],,,,['P01-CA-40053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Studies performed in vitro indicate that AM1 retains only 10-20% of the biological activity of the parent compound, but very little is known about its in vivo immunosuppressive effects. We therefore developed a rapid and sensitive method, based on the rejection of allogeneic L1210 (H-2d) leukemia cells by C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice, to assess the immunosuppressive activity of AM1 in vivo. Rejection of the leukemia allograft was determined by analyzing the spleens from mice injected intravenously with 10(5) L1210 cells for the presence of H-2Kd-positive cells by flow cytometry using an FITC-conjugated monoclonal anti-H-2Kd antibody. Nonimmunosuppressed mice rejected the allogeneic cells and survived indefinitely. Spleens from these mice were virtually free of H-2Kd-positive cells (0.51 +/- 0.21%) by day 7. In contrast, C57BL/6 mice treated with 10 mg/kg/day s.c. of CsA all died from the L1210 challenge (mean survival time of 9 +/- 1 days). Spleens from mice treated in this manner contained 11.02 +/- 3.31% H-2Kd-positive cells on day 7. There was a direct correlation between the dose of CsA administered (7.5-50 mg/kg/day) and the percentage of H-2Kd-positive cells in the spleen. We then compared the immunosuppressive activity of AM1 and CsA in this model. AM1 was purified from the urine of CsA-treated renal allograft recipients by a combination of preparative adsorption-desorption chromatography and preparative elution high-performance liquid chromatography. AM1 at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day exhibited no demonstrable immunosuppressive effect, and trough levels of AM1 on day 7 were only 36 +/- 4 ng/ml. Increasing the dose of AM1 to 50 mg/kg/day resulted in only 1.05 +/- 0.16% H-2Kd-positive cells in the spleens (P = NS) and a mean trough level of 221 +/- 27 ng/ml. In contrast, mice treated with 50 mg/kg/day of CsA exhibited 17.7 +/- 2.9% H-2Kd-positive cells in their spleens and a mean trough CsA level of 3036 +/- 277 ng/ml. The half-life of a single subcutaneous dose of 10 mg/kg of AM1 (4.6 hr) was significantly shorter than that of CsA (9.7 hr) in mice. Compared with CsA, the lack of immunosuppressive effect of AM1 in vivo therefore appears to be due to a combination of decreased immunosuppressive activity and increased rate of clearance in mice.","['Freed, B M', 'Bennett, J A', 'Rosano, T G', 'Brooks, C A 3rd', 'Cramer, S M', 'Lempert, N']","['Freed BM', 'Bennett JA', 'Rosano TG', 'Brooks CA 3rd', 'Cramer SM', 'Lempert N']","['Department of Surgery, Albany Medical College, NY 12208.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,IM,"['Animals', 'Cyclosporine/blood/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft Rejection/drug effects/*immunology', 'Half-Life', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*metabolism', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 1992 Feb;53(2):456-60. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199202010-00036.,['10.1097/00007890-199202010-00036 [doi]'],"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",,,"['AI25551/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI26484/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Pulse-chase experiments revealed that C33 antigen was synthesized as a 35-kDa precursor that was then processed to 41 to 50 kDa in MOLT-4 and to 44 to 70 kDa in C91/PL. In the presence of tunicamycin, a 28-kDa protein was synthesized. The conversion from 35 kDa to 41 to 50 kDa in MOLT-4 and to 44 to 70 kDa in C91/PL was inhibited by monensin. Treatment with N-glycanase alone, but not with sialidase and O-glycanase in combination, completely removed the sugar moiety of C33 antigen from both HTLV-1-negative Jurkat and HTLV-1-positive C91/PL. Therefore, C33 antigen has only N-linked carbohydrates, the modification of which appears to be substantially altered in the presence of the HTLV-1 genome.","['Fukudome, K', 'Furuse, M', 'Imai, T', 'Nishimura, M', 'Takagi, S', 'Hinuma, Y', 'Yoshie, O']","['Fukudome K', 'Furuse M', 'Imai T', 'Nishimura M', 'Takagi S', 'Hinuma Y', 'Yoshie O']","['Shionogi Institute for Medical Science, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Surface/*chemistry', 'Cell Fusion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Glycosylation', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Kangai-1 Protein', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Virus/chemistry/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*microbiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/*physiology']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Mar;66(3):1394-401. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.3.1394-1401.1992.,['10.1128/JVI.66.3.1394-1401.1992 [doi]'],"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD82 protein, human)', '0 (Kangai-1 Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)']",,,,,PMC240862,,,,,,,,,

To study the role of provirus insertional mutagenesis in the development of these neoplasias, we searched for common provirus integration sites in BL/VL3 radiation leukemia virus-induced tumors. Using cellular sequences flanking a provirus cloned from one of these thymomas, we found that the viral genome was integrated into a common region, designated Vin-1, in a low percentage (5%) of these tumors. The proviruses found in this locus were integrated in the same orientation, close to a CpG-rich island, at proximity of a transcriptional unit encoding a 6-kb RNA. Vin-1 RNA was detected in several organs of the adult mouse. Vin-1 RNA levels were high in tumors having a provirus inserted within the Vin-1 region but were also high in some other tumors whose Vin-1 region was not found to be rearranged. Vin-1 was found to be well conserved among mammalian species and was mapped to mouse chromosome 6, between raf and K-ras-2.

Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that purified, extracellular Tax1 protein induced the nuclear accumulation of NF-kappa B binding activity in lymphoid cells. Since HTLV-I infection causes increased levels of lymphotoxin tumor necrosis factor-beta [TNF-beta] and immunoglobulin secretion, we have studied the interaction of NF-kappa B proteins from Tax1-stimulated cells with the TNF-beta and immunoglobulin kappa (Ig kappa) light chain genes. Tax1 induction of NF-kappa B occurred in the presence of cycloheximide, and Tax1 stimulation did not result in increased levels of NF-kappa B or c-rel RNA. These results indicate that new synthesis of NF-kappa B proteins was not required for induction of NF-kappa B-binding activity. With use of the Ig kappa NF-kappa B-binding site as a probe, two distinct NF-kappa B gel shift complexes were induced by the Tax1 protein. A slower-migrating complex, C1, was inhibited by the addition of purified I kappa B. In contrast, the faster-migrating C2 complex was not inhibited by I kappa B, but C2 was increased by detergent treatment of cytoplasmic extracts, suggesting that its binding activity was also regulated by an inhibitor. The Tax1-stimulated proteins that interacted with the NF-kappa B-binding sites in the Ig kappa and TNF-beta promoters were distinct. A 75-kDa protein preferentially associated with the Ig kappa NF-kappa B-binding site. In contrast, a 59-kDa protein associated with the TNF-beta NF-kappa B-binding site. Tax1 stimulation led to increased levels of TNF-beta and Ig kappa mRNA, as measured by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction analysis. These results represent the first experimental evidence that extracellular Tax1 can regulate the expression of endogenous cellular genes.","['Lindholm, P F', 'Reid, R L', 'Brady, J N']","['Lindholm PF', 'Reid RL', 'Brady JN']","['Laboratory of Molecular Virology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/*pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Mar;66(3):1294-302. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.3.1294-1302.1992.,['10.1128/JVI.66.3.1294-1302.1992 [doi]'],"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,PMC240850,,,,,,,,,

A review of recently published experimental data indicates that cisplatin is mutagenic, clastogenic, capable of inducing cell transformation, able to act as an initiator in classical mouse skin initiation/promotion experiments, and carcinogenic in laboratory animals. Notably, it causes myeloid leukemia in BD IX rats. These observations demonstrate that cisplatin should be considered a potent carcinogen in experimental settings. A review of the literature identified 65 instances of subsequent cancer in patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy for an initial malignancy. The majority of second cancers were acute nonlymphocytic leukemias or myelodysplasia. In only one instance was cisplatin the sole antineoplastic drug given to patients. The routine use of cisplatin in conjunction with other known or suspected human carcinogens makes it impossible to use these anecdotal reports as a basis for assessing cisplatin's carcinogenicity in humans. Two quantitative epidemiologic studies have addressed this question: One suggested that the combination of cisplatin and doxorubicin is leukemogenic in humans, while the other implicated etoposide rather than cisplatin as the leukemogen. Formal epidemiologic studies of appropriate cohorts of cisplatin-treated patients are needed to resolve the question of its carcinogenicity in humans.","['Greene, M H']",['Greene MH'],"['Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic Scottsdale, AZ 85259.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens/toxicity', 'Chromosomes/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*adverse effects/toxicity', 'DNA/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mutagens/toxicity', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced']",1992/03/04 00:00,1992/03/04 00:01,['1992/03/04 00:00'],"['1992/03/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/04 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/04 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1992 Mar 4;84(5):306-12. doi: 10.1093/jnci/84.5.306.,['10.1093/jnci/84.5.306 [doi]'],"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Mutagens)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,90,,,,,,,,,,,,

This antigen was shown to be expressed sporadically on hemopoietic tumor cell lines and on ex vivo tumors. However, using antibody staining, the molecule was undetectable on normal tissues. Further biochemical characterization showed this molecule (hek) to be a phosphoroprotein. This observation taken together with the tumor-associated nature of hek expression suggested that hek might be a receptor-type protein tyrosine kinase. This was demonstrated by affinity purification of hek. In in vitro kinase experiments the purified hek protein was autophosphorylated on tyrosine and also mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of casein. Purified hek was subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis which showed that hek had a unique N terminus. Amino acid sequence determination of peptides from a V8 protease digest of hek yielded one 21-amino acid stretch of sequence which showed close homology with the eph subfamily of protein tyrosine kinases.

Molecular characterization and cellular distribution.,3214-22,"Radioiodinated recombinant human interleukin DA (HILDA)/leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) purified from conditioned medium of Chinese hamster ovary transfected cells enabled the identification of specific receptor sites on a variety of human cell types. Using low concentrations (up to 500 pM) of the ligand iodinated at a high specific radioactivity, high affinity receptors (equilibrium dissociation constant Kd in the range of 30-100 pM) were first demonstrated. They were expressed at low levels by human peripheral blood monocytes but not by lymphocytes, NK cells, granulocytes, and platelets. The myelomonocytic cell line THP1 as well as the T lymphoma cell line HSB2 and the lymphoblastoid B cell line DAB were also receptor-negative. In contrast, most of the non-lymphoid tumoral cell lines tested, including melanomas, neuroblastomas, and carcinomas, expressed high affinity HILDA/LIF receptors at variable levels (Bmax from 20 to 600 sites/cell). The kinetics of HILDA/LIF high affinity binding to the choriocarcinoma JAR cell line were characterized at 4 degrees C with association and dissociation rate constants of k1 = 2.2 10(9) M-1 min-1 and k-1 = 0.0084 min-1, respectively, corresponding to a steady-state dissociation constant k1/k-1 = 3.8 pM. The subsequent use of higher concentrations of HILDA/LIF labeled at a lower specific radioactivity enabled the identification of a low affinity component on several cell lines (Kd in the range of 1-4 nM; Bmax from 1,000 to 5,000 sites/cell). On JAR cells, this low affinity component was characterized by association and dissociation rate constants at 4 degrees C of k1 = 7.3 10(7) M-1 min-1 and k-1 = 0.19 min-1, respectively (k-1/k1 = 2.6 nM).

The patient had required no therapy for his CLL until August, 1988, when he developed hemolytic anemia and was treated with oral chlorambucil, 4 mg/day, and a tapering course of prednisone. By December, 1988, the prednisone therapy had been discontinued, but the patient required hospital admission for pneumococcal pneumonia, which responded well to intravenous antibiotic therapy. One day prior to the current admission the patient complained of persistent fevers, sore throat, productive cough, and headache. He noted a new cutaneous eruption on the day of admission in February, 1989. The past history was positive for occasional herpes stomatitis. The patient did not know if he had previously been infected with varicella.

At a concentration of 20 nM, camptothecin caused significant DNA strand breakage and decreased the growth activity by accumulating cells preferentially at the G2 phase of the cycle. The growth arrest occurred concomitantly with an increase in cell size. Under those conditions, camptothecin induced differentiation, as demonstrated by (a) the capacity of the cells to generate reactive oxygen species, (b) the increase in the surface expression of the leukocyte integrins CD11b/CD18 and CD11c/CD18, (c) the increase in the cellular content of the intermediate filament protein vimentin, and (d) the decrease in the surface expression of the transferrin receptor. Camptothecin also induced the expression of differentiation markers in other human myeloid cells, namely, the promonocytic THP-1 and the myelomonocytic HL-60 cell lines. Northern blot assays revealed that camptothecin stimulated the expression of CD11b, CD11c, and vimentin at the mRNA level.

To understand the mechanistic basis for its tumorigenic activity, it is essential to elucidate the metabolic pathways of 2-NP in vivo. Such knowledge will also assist in developing analytical methods for monitoring human exposure to nitropolynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons in ambient air. Thus, 2-nitro[U-4,5,9,10-14C]pyrene was synthesized and administered to male F344 rats by intragastric gavage at a dose of 30 mg (0.4 mCi/mM)/kg body weight. During the first 48 h, 57.5% of the dose was eliminated in the feces and 9.7% was eliminated in the urine. Correspondingly, after 168 h, 58.9 and 10.6% were excreted in feces and urine, respectively. Fecal metabolites (isolated amounts) included 6-hydroxy-2-acetylaminopyrene (19.5%), 6-hydroxy-2-aminopyrene (10.4%), 2-aminopyrene (10.0%), 2-acetylaminopyrene (0.8%), and unmetabolized 2-nitropyrene (10.0%). 6-Hydroxy-2-acetylaminopyrene, 6-hydroxy-2-aminopyrene, and 2-aminopyrene were identified as their acetyl derivatives by comparison of their chromatographic retention times, mass spectra, and UV spectra to those of synthetic standards. Urinary metabolites included 6-hydroxy-2-acetylaminopyrene (2.0%); glucuronide conjugates were tentatively identified (3.2%). The results of this study indicate that nitroreduction and ring oxidation are metabolic pathways in vivo. For DNA binding studies, rats were treated with 2-nitro[4,5,9,10-3H]pyrene [1.6 mg (598 mCi/mM)/kg body weight]. The levels of binding (pM bound/mg DNA) were as follows: 1.3, liver; 1.14, mammary tissue; 0.65, lung; 1.67, kidney; and 1.8, bladder. Upon high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of the DNA hydrolysate (liver, mammary, and kidney), approximately 2.0% of the radioactivity coeluted with the synthetic markers derived from nitroreduction, N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-aminopyrene and N-(deoxyadenosin-8-yl)-2-aminopyrene. Thus, simple nitroreduction of 2-NP does not significantly contribute to the total DNA binding of 2-NP metabolites in vivo. The significance of each pathway for the tumorigenic effects of 2-NP remains to be examined.","['Upadhyaya, P', 'Roy, A K', 'Fu, P P', 'el-Bayoumy, K']","['Upadhyaya P', 'Roy AK', 'Fu PP', 'el-Bayoumy K']","['American Health Foundation, Valhalla, New York 10595.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Air Pollutants/*metabolism/urine', 'Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Feces/chemistry', 'Male', 'Pyrenes/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Mar 1;52(5):1176-81.,,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Pyrenes)', '789-07-1 (2-nitropyrene)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,['CA-35519/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

However, interferon-resistant disease occurs in a consistent patient subset (primary resistance) and develops during therapy in additional patients (secondary resistance). Several alpha-interferon-inducible genes have been characterized. In interferon-resistant cell line variants, defects in these genes have been implicated in the mechanisms mediating resistance. We have, therefore, evaluated mRNA expression of four interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) following alpha-interferon therapy. Twenty-seven chronic myelogenous leukemia patients (ten interferon-sensitive patients, 17 interferon-resistant patients) were studied. Peripheral blood samples were collected prior to and 1 to 7 days after starting interferon therapy and analyzed for the expression of 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase, ISG-15, ISG-54, and 6-16 transcripts. Following therapy with alpha-interferon, 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase, ISG-54, and 6-16 transcripts were discerned in all patients regardless of their response to interferon. The ISG-15 message was detected in eight of nine interferon-sensitive and in 15 of 16 interferon-resistant patients, as well. Overall, no consistent defect in the ISG system could be identified. Therefore, lack of induction of these genes cannot explain resistance to alpha-interferon in chronic myelogenous leukemia patients. Other mechanisms such as posttranslational modification, leading to defects in the ISG corresponding proteins, may play a role in the development of resistance.","['Talpaz, M', 'Chernajovsky, Y', 'Troutman-Worden, K', 'Wetzler, M', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Gutterman, J U', 'Kurzrock, R']","['Talpaz M', 'Chernajovsky Y', 'Troutman-Worden K', 'Wetzler M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Gutterman JU', 'Kurzrock R']","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Biological Therapy, University of Texas M.

However, the mechanisms of action of this agent in vivo have been the subject of much debate; in particular, the issue of whether clinical improvement in IFN-alpha-treated HCL patients is dependent upon enhancement of host defenses or upon direct actions of IFN alpha upon the hairy cell remains unresolved. In this review, we examine the evidence supporting both lines of argument and synthesize this information within the framework of clinical studies of IFN alpha in HCL, the purpose being to determine which proposed mechanisms of IFN alpha action are indeed effective in vivo. From our analysis, it appears that the beneficial effects of IFN alpha upon immune function are important in decreasing the frequency of infectious complications of HCL but that these effects are probably not responsible for hairy cell elimination and cannot therefore account for major responses to IFN alpha therapy. We conclude that the primary mechanism of action of IFN alpha in HCL involves the induction of hairy cell differentiation towards a stage less responsive to growth factor stimulation, the primary consequence being proliferative inhibition. These effects may mimic events that occur during normal lymphocyte development, suggesting that the benefits of biotherapeutic agents might best be harnessed via studies of the effects of multiple and sequential biological response modifiers upon the growth and differentiation patterns of normal and malignant cells. Hairy cell leukemia could thus serve as an excellent model in which to investigate combined cancer biotherapy; the implications of our present understanding of IFN alpha in HCL to the biotherapy of cancer are discussed.","['Vedantham, S', 'Gamliel, H', 'Golomb, H M']","['Vedantham S', 'Gamliel H', 'Golomb HM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medical Center, Pritzker School of Medicine, Illinois 60637.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunity/drug effects', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Oncogenes/drug effects']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Mar 1;52(5):1056-66.,,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",,130,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once begun, the process of apoptosis proceeds in an ordered fashion. In the earliest phase DNA fragmentation occurs, accompanied by cell shrinkage and dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum. This is followed by cell fragmentation with the formation of sealed membrane vesicles, termed apoptotic bodies. In the present study we have demonstrated that the fungal metabolite cytochalasin B inhibits cell fragmentation and the formation of apoptotic bodies, probably by its ability to interfere with actin polymerization. This effect was seen when HL-60 cells were pretreated with cytochalasin B and then exposed to one of a number of apoptosis-inducing agents, including UV irradiation, camptothecin, aphidocholin, or PMA plus ionomycin. The observed effect was not peculiar to HL-60 cells, inasmuch as it was also seen for both Molt-4 and U-937 cell lines. Cytochalasin B had no effect on DNA fragmentation occurring in the earliest stage of apoptosis, and it appeared to have no inhibitory effects on nuclear fragmentation. Staurosporin had an effect similar to that seen with cytochalasin B, probably due to its ability to inhibit protein kinase C, which is a known potentiator of microfilament assembly. These data demonstrate that microfilament assembly is necessary for the formation of apoptotic bodies in the later stages of the apoptotic process.","['Cotter, T G', 'Lennon, S V', 'Glynn, J M', 'Green, D R']","['Cotter TG', 'Lennon SV', 'Glynn JM', 'Green DR']","['Division of Cellular Immunology, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/drug effects/radiation effects/*ultrastructure', 'Aphidicolin/*pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', '*Cell Death/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochalasin B/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Ionomycin/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', '*Ultraviolet Rays']",1992/02/15 00:00,1992/02/15 00:01,['1992/02/15 00:00'],"['1992/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Feb 15;52(4):997-1005.,,"['38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,['31591/PHS HHS/United States'],['Cancer Res 1992 Jun 15;52(12):3512'],,,,,,,,,,

Since the cytoskeleton may be involved in modulating signal transduction and in the morphological and structural changes that occur during cellular proliferation and differentiation, cytoskeletal changes were measured by immunofluorescence microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis during the differentiation of HL-60 leukemia cells induced by retinoic acid (RA). Differentiated HL-60 cells exhibited increased staining intensity and altered organization of MT and IF, as visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody and anti-vimentin antibody, respectively. A new procedure was developed and used to measure the content of the cytoskeletal components of HL-60 cells during the process of maturation. HL-60 cells were fixed with formaldehyde in an MT-stabilizing buffer, permeabilized using L-lysophosphatidylcholine, stained for immunofluorescent measurement with antibodies specific for particular cytoskeletal components, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Terminally differentiated cells produced by exposure to RA contained larger amounts of MT and the IF vimentin. During the course of the maturation process, a transient increase in the amounts of the microtubule-associated proteins, (MAPs) MAP2 and tau, occurred. An RA-supersensitive clone, designated HL-60/S4, and an RA-resistant clone, designated HL-60/R3, were developed by mutagenization and selection. Use of these clones supported the concept that the observed changes in MT, MAPs, and vimentin were associated with the differentiation process rather than being due to other effects produced by the retinoid. Thus, the findings suggest that changes in MT, MAPs, and IF are important to the terminal maturation of leukemia cells.","['Leung, M F', 'Sokoloski, J A', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Leung MF', 'Sokoloski JA', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Intermediate Filaments/drug effects/*ultrastructure', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Microtubules/drug effects/*ultrastructure', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Vimentin/metabolism']",1992/02/15 00:00,1992/02/15 00:01,['1992/02/15 00:00'],"['1992/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Feb 15;52(4):949-54.,,"['0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Vimentin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test the biochemical modulation of ara-CTP in a clinical setting, we designed a protocol to administer fludarabine (Fludara, F-ara-AMP) and ara-C in a pharmacologically directed sequence for patients with CLL refractory to conventional fludarabine therapy. ara-C was infused in seven patients with progressive CLL at a dose rate that maximizes ara-CTP accumulation (0.5 g/m2 during 2 h). Fludarabine (30 mg/m2 during 30 min) was infused 20 h later, followed by a second, identical dose of ara-C at 24 h, when the concentration of F-ara-A 5'-triphosphate (F-ara-ATP) was maximal in CLL cells. Comparison of ara-CTP pharmacokinetics in circulating CLL cells demonstrated that the ara-CTP area under the curve increased by a median of 1.5-fold (range, 1.1- to 1.7-fold) after fludarabine infusion. Plasma pharmacokinetics indicated that neither the median steady-state ara-C concentrations nor the levels of its deamination product arabinosyluracil were significantly affected by fludarabine infusion. The median rate of ara-CTP elimination was slightly faster after fludarabine treatment (t1/2, 6.7 versus 5.8 h), suggesting that catabolism of ara-CTP was not responsible for the increased ara-CTP area under the curve. The rate of ara-CTP accumulation by CLL cells after fludarabine infusion, however, was increased by a median of 1.3-fold in seven of the eight patients (range, 1.2- to 1.8-fold); the peak occurred within 1 h of the end of the infusion.

The cytotoxicity of this drug is thought to result from the formation of DNA intrastrand cross-links. The present work demonstrates that treatment of human myeloid leukemia cells (HL-60, U-937, and KG-1) with CDDP is associated with increased expression of the c-jun gene and that this effect is related to activation by a transcriptional mechanism. The results also demonstrate that treatment with CDDP is associated with increases in protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Furthermore, the finding that pretreatment with H7, an inhibitor of PKC, abrogates the effect of CDDP on c-jun expression suggested the involvement of PKC in this process. Down-regulation of PKC by prolonged pretreatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate was also associated with inhibition of CDDP-induced c-jun expression. The results further demonstrate that there is a temporal relationship between the CDDP-induced increase in c-jun expression and the occurrence of internucleosomal DNA cleavage characteristic of programmed cell death. These findings suggest that c-jun may be involved in the cellular response to DNA-damaging agents, such as CDDP, and that this effect may be mediated by a PKC-dependent pathway.","['Rubin, E', 'Kharbanda, S', 'Gunji, H', 'Weichselbaum, R', 'Kufe, D']","['Rubin E', 'Kharbanda S', 'Gunji H', 'Weichselbaum R', 'Kufe D']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Genes, fos/drug effects', 'Genes, jun/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1992/02/15 00:00,1992/02/15 00:01,['1992/02/15 00:00'],"['1992/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Feb 15;52(4):878-82.,,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,"['CA 34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,"['c-fos', 'c-jun']",,,,,,,

The initiating event would be expected to exist in all leukemic cells, but subsequent events may be subclonal. If several genetic events occur, they may cooperate within the same cell or be alternatively acquired by different subclones. These possibilities cannot be adequately analyzed in DNA prepared directly from patient specimens. In this study, N-ras mutations demonstrable in DNA prepared from peripheral blood of 10 patients with AML were examined in primary in vitro colonies (AML-colony-forming units [CFU]) grown from these patients. Both colonies containing the mutant gene and colonies containing normal allele only were obtained from each patient. The proportion of colonies containing no mutant allele varied among patients (5% to 57%). A subset of mutation containing colonies appeared to have lost the normal allele in nine of 10 AML cases analyzed. In the four cases with two N-ras mutations, the two mutations were found to exist in different subclones. In these cases, macroscopic colonies (AML-MCFU) were also obtained using an assay system designed to select for earlier clonogenic cells than in the AML-CFU assay. The N12cys mutation in AML10 was found in the CFU, but not in the MCFU, and the N12asp mutation in AML43 was found in the MCFU, but not in the CFU. These results suggest that N-ras mutation is a postinitiation event in AML that contributes to the outgrowth of more malignant subclones. Where two mutations are found in a case of AML, they appear to have been acquired by separate subclones, which may show different degrees of differentiation.","['Bashey, A', 'Gill, R', 'Levi, S', 'Farr, C J', 'Clutterbuck, R', 'Millar, J L', 'Pragnell, I B', 'Marshall, C J']","['Bashey A', 'Gill R', 'Levi S', 'Farr CJ', 'Clutterbuck R', 'Millar JL', 'Pragnell IB', 'Marshall CJ']","['Section of Cell and Molecular Biology, Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/02/15 00:00,1992/02/15 00:01,['1992/02/15 00:00'],"['1992/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Feb 15;79(4):981-9.,['S0006-4971(20)73791-2 [pii]'],,,,,,,,['N-ras'],,,,,,,

In the present studies, the mechanism of this toxicity was examined. A concentration of NH4Cl known to neutralize lysosomal pH and to block conversion of Leu-OMe to the dipeptide condensation product Leu-Leu-OMe inhibited Leu-OMe- or Glu-(OMe)2- but not Leu-Leu-OMe-mediated M phi toxicity. Leu-OMe-, Glu-(OMe)2-, or Leu-Leu-OMe-mediated killing of M phi was prevented by Gly-Phe-CHN2, a specific inhibitor of the thiol protease, dipeptidyl peptidase I (DPPI). Neither NH4Cl nor Gly-Phe-CHN2 prevented Phe-OMe-mediated M phi toxicity. In contrast, inhibition of M phi serine esterase activity prevented Phe-OMe- but not Leu-OMe- or Glu-(OMe)2-mediated killing of M phi. The myeloid tumor lines U937, HL60, and THP-1 were found to be uniformly enriched in DPPI and susceptible to Leu-Leu-OMe but not Leu-OMe toxicity. Whereas HL60 were resistant to Phe-OMe, THP-1 cells were killed by this agent. Incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with Leu-OMe resulted in loss of natural killer (NK) functions and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) precursors, a process that requires the DPPI-dependent generation of membranolytic polymerization products. Phe-OMe had no toxic effects on NK cells or CTL precursors. These results indicate that Leu-OMe and Glu-(OMe)2 toxicity for M phi is related to the production of higher molecular weight hydrophobic polymerization products via the sequential action of two nonserine esterase lysosomal enzymes. In contrast, Phe-OMe toxicity for myeloid cells was found to correlate with serine esterase-mediated intracellular trapping of high concentrations of the free amino acid Phe. These distinct enzymatic mechanisms may provide a unique means of targeting agents capable of selectively deleting cells of myeloid lineage.","['Thiele, D L', 'Lipsky, P E']","['Thiele DL', 'Lipsky PE']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235-8887.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Ammonium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Cathepsin C', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Esterases/metabolism', 'Glutamates/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leucine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phagocytes/drug effects', 'Phenylalanine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/02/15 00:00,1992/02/15 00:01,['1992/02/15 00:00'],"['1992/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Feb 15;79(4):964-71.,['S0006-4971(20)73789-4 [pii]'],"['0 (Glutamates)', '01Q9PC255D (Ammonium Chloride)', '2577-90-4 (phenylalanine methyl ester)', '2666-93-5 (leucine methyl ester)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', '6525-53-7 (glutamic acid dimethyl ester)', 'EC 3.1.- (Esterases)', 'EC 3.1.- (serine esterase)', 'EC 3.4.14.- (Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases)', 'EC 3.4.14.1 (Cathepsin C)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",,,['5 RO1 AI24639/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The Ph chromosome constitutes the earliest detectable chromosome abnormality in chronic myelogenous leukemia and is also found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Mice transgenic for a P190 BCR/ABL-producing DNA construct develop lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and provide an opportunity to study early stages of the disease as well as progression. In this study, we have karyotyped the bone marrow of 10 19-day-old BCR/ABL P190 transgenic mice from a line that reproducibly develops leukemia/lymphoma. Leukemic cells from 17 terminally ill transgenic founders and progeny were also karyotyped as well as bone marrow transplant recipients of leukemic donor marrow. Karyotypically visible aberrations were absent from the early stages of BCR/ABL P190-generated leukemia and normal metaphases could be found even in the terminal stages of the disease. A high frequency of aneuploidy was found in advanced leukemia, with a marked preference for the gain of mouse chromosomes 12, 14, or 17.

Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of antimetabolites. Antimetabolites are administered in the form of a base or its riboside, which is incorporated into the cell and converted to an active or inactive metabolite. The active metabolite remain in the cell inhibiting the enzymes to catalyze nucleotide synthesis for nucleotide triphosphate formation, but the inactive metabolites are rapidly excreted out of the cell. The inhibitory effect of antimetabolites on nucleotide formation is correlated with factors, such as maintenance of drug blood level, incorporation of the drug into the cell, activation and inactivation of the drug, affinity of the active form to the corresponding enzyme, and change in pool size of the intermediate metabolites in nucleotide synthesis. The salvage synthesis occurring at the higher level of the enzymes catalyzing nucleotide synthesis to counteract the inhibition by the drug is also correlated with the nucleotide formation. II. Pyrimidine antagonists 1. Cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) and its derivatives Ara-C is rapidly converted to ara-CTP and ara-U. The former remains in the cell and inhibits DNA polymerase, but the latter is excreted rapidly out of the cell. A small portion of ara-C is incorporated into DNA, which results in the degradation of DNA as demonstrated by reduced sedimentation of bulk DNA in alkaline sucrose gradient centrifugation and the ladder DNA fragmentation with a minimum fragment of approximately 180 base pairs and its conjugates in agarose gel electrophoresis. Behenoyl ara-C (BHAC) is highly lipophilic and highly distributed in the erythrocyte stroma and membrane fraction of leukocytes after iv infusion. The incorporated BHAC is released after the plasma BHAC level decreases, which suggests that erythrocytes can be a drug reservoir after iv infusion. Therefore, severe anemia should be treated before BHAC chemotherapy for longer maintenance of the plasma BHAC level. 2. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and its derivatives Activation of 5-FU in the cells is metabolized by uracil metabolizing enzymes to FUMP and FdUMP. FUMP is further metabolized to FdUMP and is also incorporated to RNA. FdUMP produces a ternary complex with thymidylate synthetase and leucovorin; subsequently, conversion of dUMP to dTMP is strongly inhibited. Thus, FUMP and FdUMP inhibit RNA and DNA metabolism, respectively. Enzyme activity during 5-FU metabolism and consequently the degree of inhibition of DNA and RNA syntheses markedly differ with the tumor cell species. This should be taken into consideration when performing chemotherapy of malignancies.","['Nakamura, T', 'Uchida, M', 'Ueda, T']","['Nakamura T', 'Uchida M', 'Ueda T']",['First Dept. of Internal Medicine Fukui Medical School.'],['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

A high percentage of patients with 2 degrees MDS/AL convert to 2 degrees AL. Survival of either is less than 1 year. A constellation of morphologic abnormalities from all 3 cell lines produces a unique appearance. Both 2 degrees MDS and 2 degrees AL are difficult to classify by the FAB system. With the exception of the identification of karyotypic abnormalities, the biology of 2 degrees MDS/AL remains largely unexplored. Alterations of chromosomes 5 and 7 predominate, but other associated cytogenetic abnormalities are being increasingly recognized. A synthesis of data regarding 2 degrees MDS/AL resulting from the treatment of several primary malignancies generates the tentative conclusions that (a) many of the alkylating agents, and the nonclassic alkylating agent procarbazine, are leukemogens; (b) melphalan is a more potent leukemogen than cyclophosphamide. None of the other alkylating agents has been clearly established to be more or less potent than another; (c) increasing duration or amount of alkylator-based chemotherapy increases the risk of leukemogenesis; (d) low doses of radiation delivered to large volumes of bone marrow are weakly leukemogenic. High doses of radiation delivered to small volumes are not. Due to the latter, there is minimal additive risk for 2 degrees MDS/AL among studies using alkylator-based chemotherapy and radiotherapy, either concurrently or sequentially; (e) the older patient (greater than 40) is at increased risk for 2 degrees MDS/AL, at least in Hodgkin's disease. Children may be at lesser risk than adults, and younger children at lesser risk than older children; (f) the risk of 2 degrees MDS/AL peaks within the first decade after treatment for the primary malignancy. The incidence rates during the second decade are low. Identified occupational/environmental risks for 2 degrees MDS/AL include benzene, ambient and diagnostic radiation exposure, and perhaps ethylene oxide. The similarities in karyotype abnormalities among leukemic cells of those whose occupations expose them to chemical hazard, and those who are exposed to cytotoxic agents, suggest that many more environmental leukemogens have yet to be discovered. Karyotype is an important prognostic factor for both achievement of CR and for survival. Nonaggressive treatment approaches have not proven useful, although the use of hematopoietic growth factors offers promise in this area. Combination chemotherapy is justified in patients with adequate performance statuses and ""favorable"" karyotypes. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is currently the only curative approach, and can be applied without attempts to first reduce the leukemic burden.","['Levine, E G', 'Bloomfield, C D']","['Levine EG', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/blood/etiology/genetics/pathology/therapy', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/etiology/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary/blood/etiology/genetics/pathology/therapy']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1992 Feb;19(1):47-84.,,,,229,,,,,,,,,,,,

The HTLV-I genome encodes a protein, Tax1, that transactivates viral gene transcription. CD4-positive T helper lymphocytes express the proenkephalin gene, and enkephalins have been implicated as neuroimmunomodulators. We have investigated the effect of Tax1 on the proenkephalin gene promoter in C6 rat glioma cells and demonstrated its transactivation. Analysis using 5' deletion mutants of the promoter region showed that sequences upstream of base pair -190 are necessary for maximal transactivation. Forskolin, a cAMP modulator, synergistically increased Tax1-mediated transactivation of the proenkephalin promoter.

To the well known FAB classification of MDS a supplementary group of patients with pure sideroblastic anemia (PSA) was added, characterized by the absence of dysplastic features of non-erythroid cells. Accordingly, the morphological subtypes were refractory anemia (RA), n = 55; PSA, n = 40; RA with ring sideroblasts (RARS), n = 33; RA with excess of blasts (RAEB), n = 53; RAEB in transformation (RAEB/T) n = 29; and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), n = 25. Having screened 28 clinical, cytological, and laboratory parameters by univariate analysis, multiple regression analysis identified six variables with independent prognostic value: percentage of bone marrow blasts, serum LDH activity, PSA, hemoglobin concentration, age, and platelet count. If patients with PSA were excluded, the FAB classification no longer contributed independent prognostic information. Based on the results of this multivariate analysis, a simple scoring system was devised for predicting the survival of patients with MDS. A score of unity was allocated to each of the following parameters: bone marrow blasts greater than or equal to 5%, LDH greater than 200 U/I, hemoglobin less than or equal to 9 g/dl, and platelets less than or equal to 100 x 10(9)/I. As a function of their total score, patients were divided into three risk groups (group A, score 0; group B, score 1-2; group C, score 3-4), which differed significantly in both survival and rates of leukemic transformation. The cumulative survival 2 years after diagnosis was 91% in group A, 52% in group B, and 9% in group C (p less than 0.00005). The actuarial risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia at 2 years was 0, 19, and 54%, respectively (p less than 0.05). The inclusion of LDH enzyme levels qualified this scoring system for an accurate assessment of patients with CMML whose prognosis is viewed too favorably when rated by other scores. Furthermore, this score was able to identify those patients with RA and RARS who, without showing an excess of marrow blasts, have an unfavorable prognosis.","['Aul, C', 'Gattermann, N', 'Heyll, A', 'Germing, U', 'Derigs, G', 'Schneider, W']","['Aul C', 'Gattermann N', 'Heyll A', 'Germing U', 'Derigs G', 'Schneider W']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/enzymology/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Jan;6(1):52-9.,,['EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used a recombinant murine retrovirus, based on the truncated genome of Moloney murine leukemia virus and containing a chimeric gag-v-erb-B gene, to determine the murine hematopoietic cells transformed by v-erb-B. Infection of day 16.5 murine embryonal cells in liquid culture with this virus resulted in the outgrowth of foci of loosely to non-adherent hematopoietic cells which grew in close association with an adherent monolayer. After several weeks in culture a clonal population of transformed pre-B-lymphocytes emerged from this transformation initiated, though still growth factor dependent, population. These transformed cells were growth factor independent, and were tumorigenic in syngeneic mice. The results indicate that although v-erb-B can initiate transformation of murine hematopoietic cells, additional events are required for establishment of the fully transformed growth factor independent, tumorigenic phenotype.

Light density bone marrow cells (LDBMs) were depleted of adherent cells, pre-incubated for 15 h with the appropriate oligomer at a concentration of 14 microns, and then plated in methylcellulose for the evaluation of colony formation. Both anti-exon Ia and anti-exon Ib antisense oligomers produced a significant inhibition of normal day 14 CFU-GM growth in vitro (n = 5, 41 +/- 11%, and 36 +/- 7%, respectively; p less than 0.01). In contrast, normal BFU-E growth was not significantly influenced by antisense oligomers (n = 5, 14 +/- 21% and 7 +/- 19%, respectively; p less than 0.05). These findings were confirmed by plating CD34 positive progenitors. When interleukin 3 (IL-3) (100 ng/ml) was added to the culture medium during the preincubation of LDBMCs, the inhibitory effects of antisense oligomers on normal CFU-GM growth were abolished. Seven patients with CML were also studied, all of whom had cytogenetic evidence of 100% clonal hematopoiesis. In five patients in the chronic phase, antisense oligomers were inhibitory on in vitro growth of both day 14 CFU-GM (37 +/- 20% and 37 +/- 15%, p less than 0.05) and BFU-E (45 +/- 15% and 41 +/- 11%, p less than 0.05), and this inhibition was not removed by pre-incubation with IL-3. No significant effect was observed on cluster or colony formation in two patients with CML in accelerated or blastic phase, and on in vitro growth of clonogenic cells from the Ph1-positive K-562 cell line. These findings (i) confirm previous observations showing a lineage specific requirement of c-abl function in normal hematopoiesis, and (ii) suggest that the residual c-abl expression has a role in chronic phase CML hematopoiesis, as its inhibition impairs both myeloid and erythroid colony formation in vitro.","['Rosti, V', 'Bergamaschi, G', 'Ponchio, L', 'Cazzola, M']","['Rosti V', 'Bergamaschi G', 'Ponchio L', 'Cazzola M']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Therapy, University of Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Erythrocytes', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*physiology', 'Genes, abl/*physiology', 'Granulocytes', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Jan;6(1):1-7.,,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",,,,,,,['c-abl'],,,,,,,

Rats are less susceptible to M-MSV oncogenesis, but the few rhabdomyosarcomas that do develop after viral inoculation of newborn animals closely resemble conventional malignancies: they develop after a long latency, grow progressively, and metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lungs. Southern blot analysis with a v-mos-specific probe of M-MSV-induced tumours in both species demonstrated an oligo-, monoclonal pattern of exogenous v-mos integration only in the rat system, while mouse tumours were not clonal in origin. Furthermore, the same type of analysis of lymph node and lung metastases showed that cell clones already present in the primary rat lesion colonized secondary sites during tumour progression.

In order to understand how PL cells are retained in the thymus for a prolonged period of time we determined whether RadLV infected cells secrete and/or respond to a T-cell growth factor that may be involved in the long-term maintenance of a thymic PL-cell pool. We have previously found that in vitro proliferation of RadLV-infected PL cells is IL-4-dependent. Here we show that RadLV induces IL-4 secretion and IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) expression in normal thymic lymphocytes. RadLV-infected PL thymocytes express IL-4R and secrete IL-4. Their IL-4 secretion could be enhanced if incubated in the presence of RadLV and this enhancement was inhibited by anti-RadLV antibodies. Several RadLV-induced lymphoma lines secreted IL-4 and/or expressed IL-4R, but these features were not essential for their continuous growth. The results suggest that RadLV induces IL-4-dependent autocrine growth which maintains a population of PL T cells in the thymus. Transition from a PL state to overt thymic lymphoma involves emancipation of a PL cell from IL-4 dependency.","['Yefenof, E', 'Ela, C', 'Kotler, M', 'Vitetta, E S']","['Yefenof E', 'Ela C', 'Kotler M', 'Vitetta ES']","['Lautenberg Center for General & Tumor Immunology, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis', 'Cell Division', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Preleukemia/*physiopathology', 'Radiation Leukemia Virus/*pathogenicity', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4', 'Receptors, Mitogen/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/pathology']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1992 Feb 1;50(3):481-5. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910500325.,['10.1002/ijc.2910500325 [doi]'],"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,"['AI-11851/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-21229/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

High concentrations of TPA (greater than 1 nM) cause the expected inhibition of proliferation and induction of macrophage-like differentiation. In contrast, in cells deprived of insulin, which continue to grow at a slow rate, lower concentrations of TPA stimulate proliferation without inducing differentiation. A TPA concentration between 0.03 and 0.3 nM will approximately double the long-term rate of thymidine incorporation into DNA and the rate of increase in cell density. Low-TPA becomes progressively less able to stimulate further proliferation as the insulin concentration is increased and is virtually without effect on cells stimulated by an optimal insulin concentration (5 micrograms ml-1). Insulin itself stimulates proliferation to a greater extent than low-TPA, increasing the long-term rate of thymidine incorporation and the rate of increase in cell density by three- to fourfold. The ability of higher concentrations of TPA to induce differentiation is independent of the presence of insulin. Low-TPA also stimulates the short-term incorporation of thymidine (during a 1-h pulse after 1 or 2 days incubation) by three- to fourfold, as compared to a sevenfold stimulation by insulin. The proliferation response to low TPA concentrations provides a useful model for dissecting the signalling pathways that control cell proliferation following stimulation by insulin and activators of protein kinase C.","['Trayner, I D', 'Clemens, M J']","['Trayner ID', 'Clemens MJ']","[""Department of Cellular and Molecular Sciences, St. George's Hospital Medical School, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Cell Division/*drug effects', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Insulin/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Mitogens', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transferrin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1992 Mar;199(1):154-61. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(92)90473-l.,"['0014-4827(92)90473-L [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(92)90473-l [doi]']","['0 (Insulin)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Transferrin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present report, we describe the affinity purification of a rat intestinal lactose-specific lectin which binds murine IgE antibodies. This binding most likely occurs via the immunoglobulin carbohydrate chains, as it is inhibited by lactose. This intestinal lectin molecule is also immunologically related to the previously described IgE-binding protein (epsilon BP) isolated from RBL cells, since it is recognized by antibodies raised against recombinant epsilon BP. This intestinal form of epsilon BP has a molecular mass of 17.5 kDa, which is much lower than that of its RBL cell analogue (31 kDa). The attachment of IgE to the mouse intestinal epithelium was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, along with the presence of a corresponding mouse intestinal epsilon BP. The carbohydrate-dependent nature of this attachment was established by demonstrating that IgE binding to mouse epithelium was specifically abolished by lactose (4 mM) and by a blood-group-A-active tetrasaccharide (0.2 mM), but not by mannose (10 mM). Finally, the association of IgE with the mouse intestinal epithelium was prevented by competition with the purified IgE-binding lectin isolated from rat intestine. Although the physiological function of this intestinal protein is still unknown, the finding that IgE binds to a lectin in the intestinal epithelium pinpoints a possible novel mechanism for the regulation of IgE-mediated disorders, such as food allergy.","['Brassart, D', 'Kolodziejczyk, E', 'Granato, D', 'Woltz, A', 'Pavillard, M', 'Perotti, F', 'Frigeri, L G', 'Liu, F T', 'Borel, Y', 'Neeser, J R']","['Brassart D', 'Kolodziejczyk E', 'Granato D', 'Woltz A', 'Pavillard M', 'Perotti F', 'Frigeri LG', 'Liu FT', 'Borel Y', 'Neeser JR']","['Nestle Research Centre, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Duodenum/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Galactose/*metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism', 'Lectins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Rats']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1992 Feb 1;203(3):393-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1992.tb16563.x.,['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1992.tb16563.x [doi]'],"['0 (Lectins)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study demonstrated the independent expression of M-rosettes and SIg in SLL and their complementary role in diagnosis. It showed that positive results for M-rosettes and weak fluorescence are characteristic of SLL, that M-rosette negativity and strong fluorescence are characteristic of other B-NHL, and that M-rosette negativity and polyclonal SIg are characteristic of RLA. In 26 cases with paired data for CD5, M-rosettes, and SIg, a positive result for M-rosettes was superior to CD5 in differentiating SLL from other B-NHL.

Graft versus leukemia (GVL) effects were studied in a model mimicking minimal residual disease following bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Lethally irradiated (BALB/c x C57BL/6)F1 recipients were reconstituted with 20 x 10(6) T-lymphocyte-depleted C57BL/6 bone marrow cells mixed with 10(4) to 10(6) BCL1 cells followed by administration of sequential increments of allogeneic C57BL/6 spleen cells; 10(6) cells on Day +1, 10(7) cells on Day +5, and 5 x 10(7) cells on Day +9, with or without concomitant IL-2 treatment (intraperitoneal injections of 20,000 U twice daily for 3 days) together with each spleen cell administration. All mice receiving 10(4)-10(6) BCL1 cells developed marked splenomegaly by Day +21 and all adoptive recipients of 10(5) spleen cells obtained from these mice developed leukemia within 21-36 days. Treatment of mice which received 10(4) BCL1 cells by either three courses of low dose IL-2 or three increments of allogeneic spleen cells alone and certainly by a combination of both resulted in normalization of splenomegaly on Day +21, but only adoptive recipients of 10(5) spleen cells obtained from mice treated by both allogeneic spleen cells and IL-2 (10/10) or allogeneic spleen cells alone (8/10) were disease free (greater than 100 days). Mice inoculated with 10(5) BCL1 cells developed mild splenomegaly on Day +21 after IL2 treatment alone, but showed no clinical evidence of disease following administration of allogeneic spleen cells or both allogeneic spleen cells and IL-2. Following adoptive transfer of 10(5) spleen cells obtained from each treated group no leukemia (greater than 100 days) was evident in recipients of spleen cells obtained from mice treated with both allogeneic spleen cells and IL-2 (10/10) whereas a partial effect was observed in mice treated by allogeneic spleen cells only (4/10). Mice inoculated with a high dose of BCL1 cells (10(6] showed some delay in onset of splenomegaly, but no curative antileukemic effects could be observed even following a synergistic combination of IL-2 and allogeneic spleen cells. Our data suggest that immunocompetent allogeneic lymphocytes may play an important role against leukemic relapse and thus cell therapy may be used therapeutically to treat minimal residual disease after BMT even following initial reconstitution with T-cell-depleted bone marrow cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Weiss, L', 'Reich, S', 'Slavin, S']","['Weiss L', 'Reich S', 'Slavin S']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hebrew University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Purging', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chimera', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Invest. 1992;10(1):19-26. doi: 10.3109/07357909209032785.,['10.3109/07357909209032785 [doi]'],"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Naturally occurring and recombinant interferons (IFNs), specifically of the alpha subtype, have shown a significant anti-tumor effect in HCL patients, with improvement of hematologic parameters within the first few months of treatment. The mechanisms responsible for the beneficial action of IFN-alpha in HCL patients are unclear, but several hypotheses have been suggested. Recently, a continuous line of cells (Eskol) from a patient diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia was established and shown to have several properties of a leukemic hairy cell. In the present study, we investigated the direct effect of IFN-alpha and interleukin (IL-2) on the Eskol cell line, and lymphokine regulation of natural killing (NK) activity against these cells. It was found that IFN-alpha has a direct antiproliferative effect on Eskol cells. Furthermore, Eskol cells were found to be completely resistant to NK-cell mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) but were somewhat sensitive to either IFN-alpha-primed NK or lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells-CMC. The resistance of Eskol cells to NK-CMC is due to a low binding ability to effector cells. Moreover, it was found that like IFN, IL-2 can protect Eskol cells from activated NK-CMC. Both cytokines reduced the ability of Eskol cells to induce NK-cytotoxic factor (NKCF) release from NK cells following conjugate formation between Eskol cells and effector cells. Moreover, cycloheximide treatment abolished the protective effect against NK-CMC induced by IFN-alpha or by IL-2. Therefore, it seems that the protective effect against NK-CMC induced by both cytokines is mediated via the same mechanism.","['Reiter, Z', 'Ozes, O N', 'Blatt, L M', 'Taylor, M W']","['Reiter Z', 'Ozes ON', 'Blatt LM', 'Taylor MW']","['Department of Biology, Indiana University, Bloomington 47405.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunother (1991),Journal of immunotherapy : official journal of the Society for Biological Therapy,9102704,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunother (1991). 1992 Jan;11(1):40-9. doi: 10.1097/00002371-199201000-00005.,['10.1097/00002371-199201000-00005 [doi]'],"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,['CA53783/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

No planned irradiation was performed except in cases of initial tests (2 patients) or CNS (5 patients) involvement and residual mass (2 patients). Sixty patients had mediastinal involvement; for the others, primaries were in the head and neck (7), nodes (2), (sub)cutaneous (4), bone (7), and elsewhere (2). According to Murphy's staging system, there were 2 stage I, 6 stage II, 33 stage III, and 43 stage IV. Among the stage IV patients, 41 had bone marrow involvement, 24 of them with more than 25% blast cells in bone marrow and 19 with blast cells in blood; 7 had CNS involvement. Three patients did not achieve complete remission, 4 died in remission (two measles, one post-transfusion AIDS, one unexplained definitive aplasia) and 13 relapsed at 2 to 29 months (median-13 months). Among the 77 patients without initial CNS involvement, there was only one isolated CNS relapse. With a median follow-up of 57 months (10-106 months), the event-free survival is 75% (SE 2.5) for the 84 patients with a plateau at 29 months, 73% (SE 8) for stage I and II patients, 79% (SE 4) for stage III, and 72% (SE 4) for stage IV patients. Survival was similar in each stage group. Reasons for failure of treatment, however, were different, being toxic deaths in stage II; initial therapy resistance, early relapses, and toxic deaths in stage III; and tumor failures in stage IV. In conclusion, this protocol is efficacious on T and non-T, non-B childhood lymphoma with a low incidence of CNS relapse. A future study will seek to diminish toxicity and long-term sequellae while at least maintaining the same cure rate of patients.","['Patte, C', 'Kalifa, C', 'Flamant, F', 'Hartmann, O', 'Brugieres, L', 'Valteau-Couanet, D', 'Bayle, C', 'Caillaud, J M', 'Lemerle, J']","['Patte C', 'Kalifa C', 'Flamant F', 'Hartmann O', 'Brugieres L', 'Valteau-Couanet D', 'Bayle C', 'Caillaud JM', 'Lemerle J']","['Department of Pediatrics, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1992;20(2):105-13. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950200204.,['10.1002/mpo.2950200204 [doi]'],"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'LSA2-L2 protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The protocol was associated with unexpected acute neurotoxicity. There are few reports of such toxic effects during therapy for ALL. PURPOSE: This report describes these toxic effects and outlines our successful approach to the problem. METHODS: The standard four-drug induction regimen consisted of vincristine, L-asparaginase, daunorubicin, and prednisone. In consolidation therapy, oral MTX was given in divided doses (dMTX) of 25 mg/m2 every 6 hours four times daily in four weekly courses concomitant with weekly triple intrathecal therapy--MTX, ARA-C, and hydrocortisone--plus one dose of leucovorin 24 hours after triple intrathecal therapy. Consolidation treatment ended with three daily doses of intravenous VP-16 and ARA-C. The first 16 months of continuation therapy included 6-week cycles of dMTX and L-asparaginase, both given every other week for 5 weeks, with 6-mercaptopurine nightly, and then two doses of VP-16 plus ARA-C and one dose of triple intrathecal therapy. RESULTS: Twenty-five of the 138 patients evaluated had acute neurotoxicity. Ten of the first 72 experienced a seizure or episode of transient neurological deficit 9-11 days following the administration of intravenous ARA-C, VP-16, and triple intrathecal therapy. Despite discontinuation of intrathecal ARA-C, which eliminated simultaneous intravenous and intrathecal treatment with ARA-C, acute neurotoxicity was observed in six previously unaffected patients and six of 42 patients treated after the elimination of intrathecal ARA-C. Therefore, as a second amendment, oral leucovorin was given 24 and 36 hours after dMTX and intrathecal MTX in continuation therapy. No acute neurotoxicity has been seen in 24 patients subsequently entered in the study. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that folate replacement due to administration of leucovorin modulated MTX toxicity and/or modified an interaction among VP-16, ARA-C, intrathecal therapy, and the central nervous system.","['Winick, N J', 'Bowman, W P', 'Kamen, B A', 'Roach, E S', 'Rollins, N', 'Jacaruso, D', 'Buchanan, G R']","['Winick NJ', 'Bowman WP', 'Kamen BA', 'Roach ES', 'Rollins N', 'Jacaruso D', 'Buchanan GR']","[""Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Children's Medical Center, Dallas 75235-9063.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",1992/02/19 00:00,1992/02/19 00:01,['1992/02/19 00:00'],"['1992/02/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/19 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1992 Feb 19;84(4):252-6. doi: 10.1093/jnci/84.4.252.,['10.1093/jnci/84.4.252 [doi]'],"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,['CA-33625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Cells of line 707 were induced for differentiation by 5 mM hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA). TfR expression increased in the course of induction, as judged by increased TfR mRNA synthesis, increased cytoplasmic TfR mRNA level, and by the increased number of cellular 125I-Tf binding sites. Addition of 0.1 mM succinylacetone (SA) decreased cellular TfR to the level comparable with the uninduced cells. The decrease was reverted by the iron chelator desferrioxamine (DFO) but not by exogenous hemin. In short-term (1-2 hours) incubation, SA inhibited 59Fe incorporation from transferrin into heme, whereas total cellular 59Fe uptake was increased. A decrease in TfR mRNA synthesis was apparent after 2 hours of SA treatment. Conversely, glutathione peroxidase mRNA synthesis, previously shown to be inducible by iron, was increased by SA treatment. Cells of heme deficient line Fw did not increase the number of Tf binding sites after the induction of differentiation by 5 mM sodium butyrate. SA had no effect on TfR expression in Fw cells. The results suggest that the depletion of cellular non-heme iron due to the increase in heme synthesis maintains a high level of transferrin receptor expression in differentiating erythroid cells even after the cessation of cell division.","['Hradilek, A', 'Fuchs, O', 'Neuwirt, J']","['Hradilek A', 'Fuchs O', 'Neuwirt J']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czechoslovakia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/genetics', 'Glycine/metabolism', 'Heme/*biosynthesis', 'Heptanoates/pharmacology', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Transferrin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1992 Feb;150(2):327-33. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041500216.,['10.1002/jcp.1041500216 [doi]'],"['0 (Heptanoates)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '51568-18-4 (succinylacetone)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

De novo synthesis of phospholipid and its catabolism in human leukemia monocytic THP-1 cells were investigated. 2. Radiolabelled precursors: [methyl-3H]chloride, [1,2-14C]ethanolamine and myo-[2-3H]inositol were readily incorporated into CHCl3-MEOH extractable lipid fraction as a function of time. 3. The radiolabels derived from choline, ethanolamine and inositol were preferentially incorporated into PC, PE and PI fraction, respectively. The data indicate that de novo PL synthesis takes place, and the CDP-choline pathway is operative as a major pathway for PC synthesized in THP-1 cells. 4. Bacterial endotoxin dose-dependently stimulated the incorporation of radiolabelled precursors. Approximately 50% stimulation in PC and PE synthesis was obtained in 20 hr, while the incorporation of [3H]inositol was rapidly stimulated by 170% within 4 hr, and the stimulation declined drastically thereafter. 5. LPS did not alter the radiolabel distribution into PL in any of the three cases. 6. In pulse-chase studies, the cells prelabelled with radioactive PL were exposed to LPS (1 micrograms/ml). The breakdown of PC was enhanced about 30% within the first 2 hr followed by a stimulated PC synthesis observed in the next 4 hr. In contrast, LPS did not induce the hydrolysis of PE and PI. 7.

DP significantly increased the mean t1/2 for [3H]-ara-CTP from 102 to 136 min (P less than 0.01), but this effect was much less pronounced than that obtained for total tritium and the increase was quite variable (0-70%; median, 19%). The presence of DP in the washout medium also increased the incorporation of ara-C into DNA and the formation of ara-CDP-choline. The level of ara-CDP-choline continued to increase in both DP-containing and DP-free media for the first 4 h following drug removal and the formation of ara-CDP-choline continued during the first few hours in ara-C-free medium. At the end of the 8-h wash in DP-containing medium, the cellular concentration of ara-CDP-choline was equivalent to that found at the beginning of the washout period. Although statistically significant, the effect of DP on ara-CTP retention in AML blasts was much less pronounced than that previously observed in L5178Y leukemia. The former cells exhibited only 10% as many nucleoside transport carriers as did the L5178Y cells as measured by their capacity to bind [3H]-nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside (NBMPR). The effect of DP in prolonging ara-CTP retention was proportional to the number of [3H]-NBMPR binding sites. This suggests that in patients cells that exhibit extremely low transport capacity, most of the net catabolism occurs via deamination, and further inhibition of transport by DP in an effort to improve cellular retention of ara-C has little effect on ara-CTP catabolism.","['Yang, J L', 'White, J C', 'Capizzi, R L']","['Yang JL', 'White JC', 'Capizzi RL']","['Department of Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University, Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27103.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism', 'Dipyridamole/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Models, Biological', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/metabolism']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1992;29(3):236-40. doi: 10.1007/BF00686258.,['10.1007/BF00686258 [doi]'],"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)']",,,['CA 12197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

As observed with clinically useful drugs, the development of clinical resistance to NSC 370147 will probably be encountered. Information concerning resistance to NSC 370147 should aid in the design of strategies for the optimal clinical use of the drug. A P388 leukemia resistant to NSC 370147 (P388/NSC 370147) was isolated and its in vivo cross-resistance profile was determined. The P388/NSC 370147 line was cross-resistant to vincristine but was not cross-resistant to doxorubicin, etoposide, cisplatin, melphalan, methotrexate, or 5-fluorouracil. This information plus other in vivo cross-resistance data [Waud et al.

The lack of cross-resistance of P388/NSC 370147 to doxorubicin and etoposide shows that resistance to NSC 370147 does not involve multidrug resistance and suggests that the mdr1 gene is not involved in resistance to NSC 370147.","['Waud, W R', 'Harrison, S D Jr', 'Temple, C G Jr', 'Griswold, D P Jr']","['Waud WR', 'Harrison SD Jr', 'Temple CG Jr', 'Griswold DP Jr']","['Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, AL 35255-5305.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Pyrazines/*therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/*therapeutic use']",1992/01/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/01/11 19:15'],"['1992/01/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/01/11 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1992;29(3):190-4. doi: 10.1007/BF00686251.,['10.1007/BF00686251 [doi]'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '83269-10-7 (NSC 350386)']",,,['P01-CA34200/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

We recorded whole cell and single-channel currents through the inwardly rectifying K+ channel, a major resting conductance of cells, using the patch-clamp technique, and we examined interactions between channel activity and [Ca2+]i. With 10 microM Ca2+ in the pipette, the amplitude of whole cell currents gradually declined within 5 min to 48 +/- 13% of that immediately after rupture of the patch membrane, in the presence of 1 mM ATP which minimized intrinsic rundown. In inside-out patches, activity of the channel was reduced by increasing the concentration of Ca2+ in the internal medium, both in the presence and absence of 1 mM ATP, with no apparent change in single-channel conductance. Time-averaged mean current activity in inside-out patches in the presence of 5 microM Ca2+ was less than 50% of that with Ca2+ of 100 nM or less. These results suggest that a rise in [Ca2+]i leads to a closure of the inwardly rectifying K+ channel. In some inside-out patches, inward currents characterized by burst composed of rapid transitions between open and closed states were observed (flickering currents). Single-channel properties of the flickering currents are similar to the inwardly rectifying K+ channel except for kinetics (single-channel conductance of 24.5 +/- 7.9 pS, inward rectification, and permeability to K+).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Mukai, M', 'Kyogoku, I', 'Kuno, M']","['Mukai M', 'Kyogoku I', 'Kuno M']","['Department of Physiology, Osaka City University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*pharmacology', 'Electrophysiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Potassium Channels/*drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1992 Jan;262(1 Pt 1):C84-90. doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.1992.262.1.C84.,['10.1152/ajpcell.1992.262.1.C84 [doi]'],"['0 (Potassium Channels)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This indicates that the two activation effects are likely to operate via the same mechanism. Activation by ICP27 is dependent on the 3' LTR and adjacent region of MoMuLV but is independent of the promoter in the 5' LTR which can be replaced by a heterologous promoter such as that of SV40 without affecting activation by ICP27.

To examine the molecular regulation of the LT gene in a constitutively expressing cell line, we studied the Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed lines PD and PD31. As demonstrated by primer extension analysis, constitutively expressed pre-B-cell-derived and inducibly expressed T-cell-derived LT mRNA were initiated at the same cap sites and predominant cap site utilization was conserved. Furthermore, we delineated an upstream activating sequence that was an important functional component of lymphotoxin transcriptional activation in PD and PD31 cells. The upstream activating sequence was localized to an essentially homopolymeric A + T-rich region (LT-612/-580), which was bound specifically by recombinant human high-mobility group I protein (HMG-I) and a PD/PD31 nuclear extract HMG-I (HMG-I-like) protein. The nuclear extract-derived HMG-I-like protein was recognized by anti-HMG-I antibody and bound to LT DNA to effect an electrophoretic mobility shift identical to that of bound recombinant human HMG-I. These findings implicate HMG-I in the regulation of constitutive lymphotoxin gene expression in PD and PD31 cells. HMG-I and HMG-I-like proteins could facilitate the formation of active initiation complexes by altering chromatin structure and/or by creating recognition sites for other activator DNA-binding proteins, some of which may be unique to or uniquely modified in these constitutive LT mRNA producers.","['Fashena, S J', 'Reeves, R', 'Ruddle, N H']","['Fashena SJ', 'Reeves R', 'Ruddle NH']","['Department of Biology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06511.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'High Mobility Group Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Poly dA-dT/genetics/metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1992 Feb;12(2):894-903. doi: 10.1128/mcb.12.2.894-903.1992.,['10.1128/mcb.12.2.894-903.1992 [doi]'],"['0 (High Mobility Group Proteins)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '26966-61-0 (Poly dA-dT)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",,,"['R01-AI26356/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-16885/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-AI-07019/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC364323,,['LT'],,,,,,,

The basis for ara-C-induced control of gene expression remains unclear. However, down-regulation of H1 histone mRNA levels has been reported as one of the earliest changes in specific gene expression associated with ara-C treatment. In this report, we describe the mechanisms responsible for H1 histone expression by this agent. Treatment of HL-60 cells with ara-C resulted in a decrease in H1 histone mRNA levels that was detectable by 15 min. In contrast, this down-regulation by ara-C was completely blocked by treatment of the cells with cycloheximide. Nuclear run-on analyses demonstrated that ara-C treatment is associated with inhibition of H1 histone gene transcription. The results also demonstrate that cycloheximide abrogates the transcriptional down-regulation by ara-C but alone has no detectable effect. We also show that ara-C treatment is associated with a decrease in stability of the H1 histone transcript and that this effect is also reversed by inhibition of protein synthesis. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that ara-C regulates H1 histone expression at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. The results also indicate that control of this gene by ara-C involves the activation of at least two signaling events that require de novo protein synthesis.","['Datta, R', 'Kharbanda, S', 'Kufe, D W']","['Datta R', 'Kharbanda S', 'Kufe DW']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects/physiology', 'Histones/drug effects/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/genetics', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1992 Jan;41(1):64-8.,,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",,,['CA29431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

NF-kappa B binding was activated at 30 min and reached maximal levels of binding at 1-2 hr of ara-C treatment. The NF-kappa B consensus sequence was ligated to the heterologous thymidine kinase (TK) promoter and the human growth hormone (GH) reporter gene to determine whether ara-C-induced NF-kappa B activity includes an enhancer function. Ara-C treatment had little effect on transient expression of pTKGH in KG-1 cells but increased transcription of the p (NF-kappa B) TKGH vector by 8-fold. The results also demonstrate that ara-C transiently increases NF-kappa B mRNA levels. However, the finding that ara-C-induced binding of NF-kappa B to DNA occurs in the presence of cycloheximide indicates that this agent activates preexisting NF-kappa B protein.

The former leads to less hospitalisation and fewer side effects, but the latter gives a greater chance of a complete remission.

DATA SOURCE: Twelve-year retrospective review from a tertiary-care cancer center. STUDY SELECTION: One hundred forty patients, constituting 142 cases, with morphologically proved P carinii pneumonia. DATA SYNTHESIS: Hematologic malignancy (47%) (including lymphoma [27%] and leukemia [18%]), solid tumor (31%), or bone marrow transplantation (18%) was the underlying condition in the majority of cases. Twenty-five cases (18%) were diagnosed at autopsy. All but seven patients had previously established predisposing factors for P carinii pneumonia, including corticosteroid use in 87%. The attack rate for hospitalized patients with primary or metastatic brain tumor increased during the 12-year interval. The attack rates for hospitalized patients with hematologic neoplasm or bone marrow transplantation were stable. The overall mortality rate did not change during the period reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the availability of effective prophylaxis, P carinii pneumonia continues to occur among patients with neoplastic disease. In addition to patients with certain hematologic neoplasms, those with primary or metastatic brain neoplasm who receive corticosteroids are at risk for the development of P carinii pneumonia and should receive P carinii pneumonia prophylaxis.","['Sepkowitz, K A', 'Brown, A E', 'Telzak, E E', 'Gottlieb, S', 'Armstrong, D']","['Sepkowitz KA', 'Brown AE', 'Telzak EE', 'Gottlieb S', 'Armstrong D']","['Infectious Disease Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Cornell University Medical College, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,IM,"['*Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Cancer Care Facilities', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/*etiology/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",1992/02/12 00:00,1992/02/12 00:01,['1992/02/12 00:00'],"['1992/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,JAMA. 1992 Feb 12;267(6):832-7.,,,,,['5 UO1 AI27669-04/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Bromomethyl intermediate 15 was prepared from the corresponding hydroxymethyl precursor 14 by treatment with 48% HBr. Hydroxymethyl compound 14 was obtained by deamination of reported 2,4-diaminopyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-methanol (12a) in refluxing 1 N NaOH. Both 12a and its 5-methyl-substituted analogue 12b were converted to versatile 6-bromomethyl intermediates 13a and 13b from which important antifolates may be readily derived. Alkylation of 7 by 13a,b led to 10-propargyl-5-deazaaminopterin (5) and 5-methyl-10-propargyl-5-deazaaminopterin (6). As an inhibitor of TS from H35F/F cells, 4 gave an IC50 value showing it to be approximately 6-fold less inhibitory than PDDF (90 nM for 4 vs 14 nM for PDDF). In in vitro studies, IC50 (microM) values obtained for 4 vs L1210 and S180 of 1.50 and 2.35, respectively, were similar to those obtained for PDDF (2.61 and 1.97). Against HL60 cells, 4 was about 7-fold more cytotoxic than PDDF (IC50 values 0.72 and 5.29 microM). Inclusion of thymidine did not establish TS as the site of cytotoxic action for either 4 or PDDF in the cell lines used. In in vivo tests against L1210 in mice, 4 failed to show therapeutic effect.

Ditercalinium is characterized by a high DNA affinity and bisintercalating ability, associated with potent antitumor properties, involving an original mechanism of action. Unfortunately as ditercalinium is hepatotoxic, its clinical evaluation has been interrupted. In order to eliminate or at least minimize the serious drawbacks related to its toxic effects, several chemical modifications have been made to the structure of ditercalinium, and their influence has been evaluated by measuring the DNA affinities, intercalation properties, and toxicity toward leukemia cells of the newly synthesized dimers. Reduction of the pyridinic moieties of ditercalinium, in order to suppress the permanent charges provided by the quaternizing chain, led to an almost complete loss of activity, although the DNA bisintercalating property of the dimer was preserved. Dimerization of the 7H-pyrido[4,3-c]carbazole rings by introduction of the rigid spacer on the N7- or C6-positions corresponding to the convex face of the pyridocarbazole, instead of the N2-position in ditercalinium, led to DNA bisintercalating dimers practically devoid of antitumor properties. However after quaternarization of the N2 atoms, the dimer linked by the N7 atoms exhibited a very high DNA affinity (greater than 10(9) M-1) and recovered antitumor activity, supporting the requirement of positive charges for the emergence of antitumor activity in these dimers. Introduction on the C6 of the 7H-pyridocarbazole ring of an aminomethyl or carboxyl group, a sugar residue, or C or N free amino acids such as Lys or Glu has also been carried out, in order to increase the hydrophilic properties of the molecules or to enable them to use amino acid transport systems.

RESULTS: The mean systemic clearance (range) for the six anticonvulsant-treated patients studied during 22 courses of therapy was 32 mL/min/m2 (range, 21 to 54 mL/min/m2), significantly higher (P less than .001) than the mean value of 13 mL/min/m2 (range, 7 to 17 mL/min/m2) for the control patients studied during 26 courses of therapy. Clearance estimates for control patients were similar to previously published values for pediatric patients. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that the systemic clearance of teniposide is consistently increased two- to three-fold by concomitant phenobarbital or phenytoin therapy. The consequent substantial reduction in systemic exposure may reduce teniposide's efficacy.","['Baker, D K', 'Relling, M V', 'Pui, C H', 'Christensen, M L', 'Evans, W E', 'Rodman, J H']","['Baker DK', 'Relling MV', 'Pui CH', 'Christensen ML', 'Evans WE', 'Rodman JH']","[""Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Section, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anticonvulsants/*pharmacology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate/drug effects', 'Phenobarbital/pharmacology', 'Phenytoin/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Teniposide/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1992 Feb;10(2):311-5. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1992.10.2.311.,['10.1200/JCO.1992.10.2.311 [doi]'],"['0 (Anticonvulsants)', '6158TKW0C5 (Phenytoin)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'YQE403BP4D (Phenobarbital)']",,,"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients aged 15 to 42 years underwent transplantation at three different centers from November 1984 through November 1990. All patients received 16 mg/kg busulfan and 120 mg/kg cyclophosphamide as preparative therapy. Cyclosporine plus methotrexate or cyclosporine plus corticosteroids with or without methotrexate were given for prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). RESULTS: Twelve patients died of treatment-related complications, 12 patients relapsed, and 15 patients are leukemia-free survivors. For 27 patients in group 1 (first remission, second remission, first relapse), the estimated leukemia-free survival (LFS) rate is 42.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.9% to 71.7%) at 3 years. For 12 patients with more advanced disease (group 2), the 1-year LFS rate is 13.5% (95% CI, 0% to 37.1%). Chronic GVHD occurred at an estimated incidence of 63.3% and developed significantly more frequently among patients who received corticosteroids for prevention of acute GVHD. Chronic GVHD was associated with a significantly lower incidence of relapse and with improved LFS rates. CONCLUSION: LFS rate in this study is comparable to that obtained with radiation-containing regimens; however, the effectiveness of this preparative regimen in ALL requires further study.","['Copelan, E A', 'Biggs, J C', 'Avalos, B R', 'Szer, J', 'Cunningham, I', 'Klein, J P', 'Atkinson, K', 'Kapoor, N', 'Klein, J L', 'Downs, K']","['Copelan EA', 'Biggs JC', 'Avalos BR', 'Szer J', 'Cunningham I', 'Klein JP', 'Atkinson K', 'Kapoor N', 'Klein JL', 'Downs K', 'et al.']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1992 Feb;10(2):237-42. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1992.10.2.237.,['10.1200/JCO.1992.10.2.237 [doi]'],"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",,,['2P30 CA 16058-16A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Study population comprised 107 patients with Hodgkin's disease treated with combination chemotherapy at the National Cancer Institute who relapsed after achieving a complete remission. RESULTS: Half of the relapses occurred within the first year of achieving complete remission; among patients in remission 5 years or longer, only 4% relapsed. The overall survival of the relapsed patients is projected to be 17% at 20 years, calculated from the date of relapse. Primary treatment regimen, presence of B symptoms, stage, sex, liver involvement, pleural involvement, marrow involvement, and histologic subtype did not affect the survival of relapsed patients. Only age at diagnosis (older or younger than 30 years) and length of initial remission (shorter or longer than 1 year) made a significant impact on survival. Patients whose initial remission was longer than 1 year had significantly higher complete response rates to salvage therapy, significantly more durable second remissions, and significantly longer survival than patients whose initial remission was shorter than 1 year. Survival beyond 11 years from relapse of patients with long initial remissions was 24%; for those with short initial remissions, 11% (P2 = .027). Despite the fact that with salvage therapy, patients with long initial remission had an 85% complete response rate to mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) with a disease-free survival of 45% at 20 years, acute leukemia and other treatment-related complications combined to lower the survival rate of this more favorable subset.

The protein, which we have called ""fragmentin,"" was capable of causing DNA from intact YAC-1 cells to be cleaved into oligonucleosomal-sized fragments and producing severe chromatin condensation within 1 h. Amino acid sequence of tryptic peptides indicated that fragmentin was highly homologous to the NK and T cell granule serine proteases RNK protease 1 and mouse cytotoxic T cell protease I (CCPI)/granzyme B. Preincubation with the serine esterase inhibitor 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin blocked fragmentin-induced DNA damage, but had no effect on cytolysin. Fragmentin activity against four lymphoma target cells was completely dependent on the presence of cytolysin. Fragmentin produced rapid membrane damage as well as DNA fragmentation at nonlytic cytolysin doses, suggesting that fragmentin activity was not limited to its effects on the nucleus. Fragmentin and cytolysin activity were completely inhibited by EGTA, indicating the process was Ca2+ dependent. A role for cytolysin in endocytosis of fragmentin was suggested by the observation that treatment of YAC-1 with cytochalasin B or sodium azide and 2-deoxyglucose blocked DNA fragmentation but not cytolysin activity. A 30-kD N alpha-CBZ-L-lysine thiobenzyl esterase, which copurified with fragmentin, was inactive on its own but was able to synergistically amplify the DNA damage induced by fragmentin in the presence of cytolysin. Fragmentin activity was not dependent on protein synthesis, as cycloheximide treatment of YAC-1 cells did not prevent DNA damage. We postulate that fragmentin is the molecular mediator of NK cell-mediated DNA fragmentation and apoptosis.","['Shi, L', 'Kraut, R P', 'Aebersold, R', 'Greenberg, A H']","['Shi L', 'Kraut RP', 'Aebersold R', 'Greenberg AH']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Coumarins/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Deoxyribonucleases/genetics/*isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Granzymes', 'Isocoumarins', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*chemistry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Serine Endopeptidases/genetics/*isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Serine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1992 Feb 1;175(2):553-66. doi: 10.1084/jem.175.2.553.,['10.1084/jem.175.2.553 [doi]'],"['0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Isocoumarins)', '0 (Serine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '51050-59-0 (3,4-dichloroisocoumarin)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Gzmb protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Gzmb protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (RNK protease 1)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (fragmentin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,PMC2119135,,,,,,,,,

Capillary blood cell velocity (CBV) in fingernail-fold capillaries was measured by videophotometric capillaroscopy. After a 1-min arterial occlusion at the finger base, the post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia was evaluated by measuring the peak (p) CBV and the time to pCBV. In patients with ANLL/GGL, both resting CBV and pCBV were lower than in healthy control subjects. In the CLL patients these values were not significantly different compared to controls. In a few patients the time to pCBV was markedly prolonged. Symptoms attributable to hyperviscosity were more common in patients with ANLL/CGL and low CBV values.

We examined neoplastic and normal B cells for phosphorylation and activation of Raf-1 protein in response to anti-immunoglobulin antibody (anti-Ig). Anti-Ig induced rapid phosphorylation of Raf-1 protein in both neoplastic B-cells of hairy cell leukemia and normal tonsillar B-cells which proliferated well in response to anti-Ig. The increase in phosphorylation was due primarily to an increase in phosphoserine. The immune complex kinase assay using Histone V-S as an exogenous substrate also showed an increase in Raf-1-associated kinase activity. An inhibitor of protein kinase C, H7, inhibited the proliferation as well as the Raf-1 phosphorylation in response to the proliferative signal of anti-Ig. Further, downregulation of protein kinase C by the treatment with 12-phorbol 13-myristic acid significantly abrogated the induction of Raf-1 phosphorylation.

We examined the values for elimination kinetics of cellular dFdCTP and found they were dependent on cellular concentration after incubation of CCRF-CEM cells with dFdC and washing into drug-free medium. When the drug was washed out at low cellular dFdCTP levels (less than 50 microM), dFdCTP elimination was linear (t1/2 = 3.3 h), but it became biphasic at intracellular dFdCTP levels greater than 100 microM. Although the initial elimination rate was similar at all concentrations, at higher concentrations the terminal elimination rate increased with increasing cellular dFdCTP concentration, with a nearly complete inhibition of dFdCTP elimination at 300 microM. The deamination product 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine was the predominant extracellular catabolite at low cellular dFdCTP concentrations, whereas at high dFdCTP concentrations dFdC was the major excretion product. The dCMP deaminase inhibitor 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrodeoxyuridine transformed the monophasic dFdCTP degradation seen at low dFdCTP levels into a biphasic process, whereas the deoxycytidine deaminase inhibitor 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrouridine had no effect on dFdCTP elimination. An in situ assay indicated that dCMP deaminase activity was inhibited in whole cells, an action that was associated with a decreased dCTP:dTTP value. In addition, dFdCTP inhibited partially purified dCMP deaminase with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.46 mM. We conclude that dFdC-induced inhibition of dCMP deaminase resulted in a decrease of dFdCTP catabolism, contributing to the concentration-dependent elimination kinetics. This action constitutes a self-potentiation of dFdC activity.","['Heinemann, V', 'Xu, Y Z', 'Chubb, S', 'Sen, A', 'Hertel, L W', 'Grindey, G B', 'Plunkett, W']","['Heinemann V', 'Xu YZ', 'Chubb S', 'Sen A', 'Hertel LW', 'Grindey GB', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.

A limited sampling strategy developed earlier, capable of predicting the AUC based on the plasma concentrations at 3 and 6 h after an oral dose, was prospectively tested in this trial and proved to be highly predictive of the AUC (r = 0.98, P = 0.0001). Pharmacodynamic-pharmacokinetic correlations were obtained after combining data from this and the prior phase I pediatric trial. Trough plasma piritrexim concentration strongly correlated with DLT (P = 0.0016). A trough plasma piritrexim concentration greater than 0.5 microM appeared to be predictive of toxicity. Eleven of 15 patients with trough concentrations exceeding this threshold experienced DLTs. Therapeutic drug monitoring may thus play an important role in adjusting the dose and schedule of piritrexim in future trials.","['Adamson, P C', 'Balis, F M', 'Miser, J', 'Arndt, C', 'Wells, R J', 'Gillespie, A', 'Aronson, L', 'Penta, J S', 'Clendeninn, N J', 'Poplack, D G']","['Adamson PC', 'Balis FM', 'Miser J', 'Arndt C', 'Wells RJ', 'Gillespie A', 'Aronson L', 'Penta JS', 'Clendeninn NJ', 'Poplack DG']","['Pediatric Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Glioma/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count/drug effects', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Platelet Count/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Sarcoma/drug therapy']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Feb 1;52(3):521-4.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'MK2A783ZUT (piritrexim)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of the beta-globin genes has not been previously detected in this cell line. In this report, we describe the isolation of a variant of the K562 cell line that actively expresses beta-globin messenger RNA (mRNA) and polypeptide and shows greatly reduced expression of the delta-globin genes. This phenotype developed spontaneously in culture while two other K562 isolates grown under the same culture conditions have not undergone the same delta- to beta-globin switch. Analysis of this unique K562 variant shows that a construct containing a beta-globin promoter is quite active upon transient transfection into these cells. This finding suggests that the activation of the endogenous beta-globin genes results from changes in the trans-acting environment of these cells. The regulation of the beta-globin genes in this variant is characterized by a paradoxical decrease in the level of beta-globin mRNA after exposure to hemin. Other globin genes of this variant are appropriately regulated and show increased expression after hemin induction. Further study of this variant may shed light on mechanisms of gene regulation that are involved in hemoglobin switching.","['Mookerjee, B', 'Arcasoy, M O', 'Atweh, G F']","['Mookerjee B', 'Arcasoy MO', 'Atweh GF']","['Department of Medicine, State University of New York Health Science Center, Brooklyn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Feb 1;79(3):820-5.,['S0006-4971(20)75015-9 [pii]'],"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",,,"['HL-16008/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-42919/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Similar to TGF-beta, activin A can have different biologic activities, depending on the target tissues. We used recombinant activin A to demonstrate a possible regulatory role of this protein in modulating human erythroid differentiation in the human erythroid cell line, K562. Using genomic probes containing the second exon of alpha, beta, gamma, and epsilon globins, relative abundance of various types of globin transcripts in untreated and activin-treated K562 cells was examined with S1 nuclease analysis. Despite considerable homology amongst various globin sequences, these globin probes were highly specific for their unique mRNA species in the analyses. It was shown that the abundance of specific globin probe fragments for gamma and epsilon globins (209 nucleotides) as well as alpha (180 nucleotides), which were protected from S1 digestion, increased many fold in K562 cells treated with activin A. In contrast, there were no specific transcripts of beta globin detected in either the control or activin-treated cells. The increases in the level of fetal and embryonic beta-like and alpha globin transcripts also confirmed earlier studies of Northern and slot-blot analyses using globin cDNA as probes. In addition, nuclear run-off transcription assay using isolated nuclei indicated that most of the increase in the globin transcripts after activin treatment could be attributed to the stimulation of transcription rate for globin genes. Transient transfection assays also provide evidence that activin A significantly stimulated transcriptional activity of an epsilon globin promoter in K562, but not in the nonerythroid Chinese hamster ovary cells. Therefore, it was concluded that activin A exerts its effects on globin gene expression at the level of transcription in erythroid cells.","['Frigon, N L Jr', 'Shao, L', 'Young, A L', 'Maderazo, L', 'Yu, J']","['Frigon NL Jr', 'Shao L', 'Young AL', 'Maderazo L', 'Yu J']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Activins', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Inhibins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/02/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/02/11 19:15'],"['1992/02/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/02/11 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Feb 1;79(3):765-72.,['S0006-4971(20)75007-X [pii]'],"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",,,['DK40218/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of HL-60 cells to noncytotoxic concentrations of HQ for 3 hours before induction with phorbol myristate acetate (TPA) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the acquisition of characteristics of monocytic differentiation, such as adherence, nonspecific esterase (NSE) activity, and phagocytosis, but had no effect on cell proliferation. HQ appeared to be affecting maturation beyond the monoblast/promonocyte stages. HQ also prevented differentiation induced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3]; however, the block occurred after the acquisition of adherence. HQ at concentrations that inhibited monocytic differentiation had no effect on differentiation to granulocytes, suggesting that the block in the differentiation of these bipotential cells is a step unique to the monocytic pathway.

CSA efficiently inhibited IL-4 secretion from RadLV-induced PL and leukemic cells, and its administration to PL mice caused a significant delay in their death. An ITx consisting of anti-RadLV glycoprotein-70 (gp70) antibody coupled to ricin A chain efficiently inhibited protein synthesis in virus-infected cells in vitro and, when injected into PL mice, also delayed their death.

These results show that the development of malignancy from a premalignant state can be averted by a combination of therapeutic modalities that decrease the size and growth rate of the premalignant cell population.","['Yefenof, E', 'Abboud, G', 'Epszteyn, S', 'Vitetta, E S']","['Yefenof E', 'Abboud G', 'Epszteyn S', 'Vitetta ES']","['Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, Hebrew University-Hadassa Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Cyclosporine/*therapeutic use', 'Gene Products, env/immunology', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Preleukemia/*therapy', '*Radiation Leukemia Virus/immunology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thymus Gland/physiology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/15 00:00,1992/01/15 00:01,['1992/01/15 00:00'],"['1992/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Jan 15;89(2):728-32. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.2.728.,['10.1073/pnas.89.2.728 [doi]'],"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",,,"['CA-28149/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-41081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC48312,,,,,,,,,

The conformation of the Psi domain (nucleotides 215 to 565) was investigated in solution by chemical probing. The four bases were monitored at one of their Watson-Crick positions with dimethylsulfate at cytosine N3 and adenosine N1, and with a carbodiimide derivative at guanosine N1 and uridine N3. Position N7 of adenine residues was probed with diethylpyrocarbonate. The analyses were conducted on in vitro transcribed fragments corresponding either to the isolated Psi domain or to the 5'-terminal 725 nucleotides. The RNA fragments were analyzed in their monomeric and dimeric forms. A secondary structure model was derived from probing data, computer prediction and sequence analysis of related murine retroviruses. One major result is that Psi forms an independent and highly structured domain. Dimerization induces an extensive reduction of reactivity in region 278 to 309 that can be interpreted as the result of intermolecular interactions and/or intramolecular conformational rearrangements. A second region (around position 215) was shown to display discrete reactivity changes upon dimerization. These two regions represent likely elements of dimerization. More unexpectedly, reactivity changes (essentially enhancement of reactivity) were also detected in another part of Psi (around position 480) not believed to contain elements of dimerization. These reactivity changes could be interpreted as dimerization-induced allosteric transitions.","['Tounekti, N', 'Mougel, M', 'Roy, C', 'Marquet, R', 'Darlix, J L', 'Paoletti, J', 'Ehresmann, B', 'Ehresmann, C']","['Tounekti N', 'Mougel M', 'Roy C', 'Marquet R', 'Darlix JL', 'Paoletti J', 'Ehresmann B', 'Ehresmann C']","['Unite de Biochimie, URA 158 CNRS, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Structure', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*ultrastructure', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/*ultrastructure', 'Sequence Alignment']",1992/01/05 00:00,1992/01/05 00:01,['1992/01/05 00:00'],"['1992/01/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/05 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 1992 Jan 5;223(1):205-20. doi: 10.1016/0022-2836(92)90726-z.,"['0022-2836(92)90726-Z [pii]', '10.1016/0022-2836(92)90726-z [doi]']","['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study evaluated the clearance and pharmacodynamics of total and unbound teniposide in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia who were either in first complete remission or who had relapsed and achieved a subsequent complete remission. When compared to values of patients in first remission, the mean total systemic clearance of teniposide in relapsed patients was significantly lower at the time remission reinduction therapy was initiated, but increased to values greater than first remission patients after a subsequent remission was achieved. However, the mean clearance of unbound teniposide (ml/min/m2) was 3-fold lower in relapsed patients during reinduction therapy (1224 vs. 4261, P less than .0001), and improved but remained low after these patients achieved a subsequent remission (1965, P = .025). Changes in plasma protein binding accounted for the increase in total clearance when unbound clearance decreased. Continuous therapy with L-asparaginase was the major treatment difference in those patients with hypoalbuminemia and lower clearance of unbound teniposide. In 15 evaluable patients in complete remission, there was a statistically significant (P = .039) linear correlation between the percentage decrease in white blood cell count and the systemic exposure (AUC) to unbound teniposide, with higher exposure associated with a greater decrease in white blood cell count.

Rapid fusion was induced upon mild acidification of the medium. At pH 5, all virus particles were capable of fusing with the cells. The initial rate and the extent of fusion were maximal between pH 4.9 and 5.2 and declined sharply below and above this range. The rate constants of adhesion of influenza virus to cells or erythrocyte ghosts were large, indicating a diffusion-controlled process. The rate constants of fusion of the virus with cells were smaller than those found previously for fusion with various liposomes. Although preincubation of the virus at acidic pH in the absence of target membranes almost completely inactivated the virus in its ability to fuse with erythrocyte ghosts, it reduced the extent of fusion with cultured cells by only 20 to 40%.

First, this same pattern of CTL reactivity was observed using a variety of immunization protocols indicating that the TAA-specific CTL population was not an artifact of the original immunization protocol but was a reproducible component of the MoMuLV CTL response. Moreover, CTL precursor frequency analysis indicates that the MuLV:TAA-specific CTL represent approximately 60% of the CTL detected in in vitro cytotoxicity assays. However, when the role of MuLV:TAA CTL in the in vivo rejection of MoMuLV-induced tumors was examined, no role for the MuLV:TAA-specific CTL response could be determined. Immunization protocols that had been shown to give rise to both CTL populations were capable of protecting mice from tumor development after a challenge with the parental MBL-2 tumor cell line but not the virus-negative variant MBLv cell line.

To examine the low level of c-myb mRNA expression in the murine B cell lymphoma cell line BCL1, nonessential amino acid starvation was used to block these cells in a G1 state. When BCL1 cells were released from this block, a 7- to 10-fold increase in c-myb mRNA was detected in late G1 and S phase cells relative to that detected in exponentially growing BCL1 cells. This increase was not inhibited by aphidicolin. To determine whether cell cycle regulation of c-myb mRNA expression occurred during exponential growth in both murine pre-B cell lymphoma and B cell lymphoma cell lines, elutriation was used to separate exponentially growing cell populations. An increase in c-myb mRNA expression was seen in late G1 and S phase fractions from B cell lymphoma cell lines. In contrast, c-myb mRNA levels remained constant in elutriation fractions isolated from pre-B cell lymphoma cell lines. Expression of c-myb mRNA was not detected in exponentially growing or in Go serum-stimulated murine fibroblasts.

It was originally identified in rat basophilic leukemia cells and is now known to be identical to a macrophage surface Ag, Mac-2, and lectins designated as CBP 35/L-34/RL-29. It has also been related to a nonintegrin laminin-binding protein isolated from mouse macrophages. In this report we have shown the following: epsilon BP is present in variable amounts in several mast cell lines, and the surface expression of epsilon BP in these cell lines is quite variable and does not correlate with the total amount of epsilon BP in the cell. epsilon BP is displayed on the cell surface in a manner that is reversible by lactose, most likely through attachment to yet unidentified glycoconjugates. The putative epsilon BP binding sites on the cell surface can be readily demonstrated by using radiolabeled epsilon BP, and the sites are present in comparable amounts in various cell lines. Expression of epsilon BP on the cell surface can be regulated; the most notable example is the upregulation of surface epsilon BP on RBL cells activated through the high-affinity IgE receptor by IgE immune complexes.

In this study we investigated the molecular regulation of expression of the CD11a subunit during myeloid differentiation of HL-60 cells. Induction of monocyte/macrophage differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells with PMA results in an increase in CD11a surface Ag expression and the acquisition of CD11a/CD18-mediated homotypic adherence. These changes are accompanied by a 40-fold increase in CD11a mRNA levels. Nuclear run-on transcription assays indicate that the increase in CD11a mRNA in PMA-induced HL-60 cells is not caused by an increase in CD11a RNA transcription. We assessed the posttranscriptional regulation of CD11a using two methods. By using actinomycin D to block RNA transcription, we demonstrate that the CD11a mRNA half-life in HL-60 cells is prolonged after PMA treatment. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide also results in enhanced expression of CD11a mRNA in HL-60 cells without increasing CD11a transcription. These findings indicate that, in HL-60 cells induced with PMA to differentiate along the monocyte/macrophage pathway, CD11a expression is regulated primarily at the posttranscriptional level by a labile protein. Identification of the specific CD11a RNA sequences, and the proteins that bind to these sequences may provide insight into lineage commitment during human monocyte/macrophage differentiation.","['Back, A L', 'Gollahon, K A', 'Hickstein, D D']","['Back AL', 'Gollahon KA', 'Hickstein DD']","['Medical Research Division, Seattle Veterans Administration Medical Center, WA 98108.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*genetics', 'Macrophages/*physiology', 'Monocytes/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Feb 1;148(3):710-4.,,"['0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NF-kappa B activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and interleukin-1 was inhibited by staurosporin. Staurosporin treatment hardly affected the TNF-alpha-induced increase in mRNA for the p51 subunit of NF-kappa B but interfered with any phorbol ester (PMA)-induced increase in p51 mRNA. Thus, induction of NF-kappa B and p51 mRNA by TNF-alpha was not mediated by a staurosporin-sensitive factor, but NF-kappa B activation by TNF-alpha was even reduced by action of a staurosporin-sensitive factor. Decreased levels of phosphorylation of TNF-R alpha (TNF receptor type alpha) after staurosporin-treatment correlated with increased induction of NF-kappa B by TNF-alpha. Staurosporin-treatment did not affect TNF-R levels. Although protein kinase C stimulation by PMA inhibited NF-kappa B activation by TNF-alpha, its action mechanism may be different from that of the staurosporin-sensitive factor. PMA induced disappearance of TNF-R alpha by shedding into the surrounding medium, with kinetics similar to those of its inhibition of NF-kappa B activation by TNF-alpha. Phosphorylation may not mediate receptor shedding, since PMA treatment did not detectably affect TNF-R alpha phosphorylation.","['Hohmann, H P', 'Remy, R', 'Aigner, L', 'Brockhaus, M', 'van Loon, A P']","['Hohmann HP', 'Remy R', 'Aigner L', 'Brockhaus M', 'van Loon AP']","['Pharmaceutical Research Department, F.

After complete tryptic digestion, peptides containing cystine were identified by comparison of the reversed-phase HPLC profile of the digest with that of a reduced aliquot which had been subjected to affinity chromatography on thiol-Sepharose. The locations of the 10 disulfide bonds were determined by isolation, further digestion and analysis of peptides containing cystine. The first cysteine residue of the sequence (Cys46) was shown to be coupled to the sixth (Cys98), leading to a large loop containing four additional cysteine residues. Computer model building and energy calculations led to the assignment of Cys72 to Cys87 and Cys73 to Cys83. The following four cysteine residues of the sequence also constitute a structural unit, with Cys121 bonded to Cys141 and Cys133 to Cys146, and the last two cysteine residues in the amino-terminal domain of glycoprotein 71 form a small loop (Cys178 to Cys184).

Exposure to ADR concentrations of 100-5000 ng simultaneously with 1 microM vitamin K3 elicited an enhanced inhibition of tumor cell survival. The effect of treatment with ADR alone, or in combination with vitamin K3 on DNA and RNA biosynthesis in the sensitive and resistant tumor cells, was also assessed. DNA and RNA biosynthesis inhibition was increased in P388/S (the parental cell line) and P388/ADR cells (the ADR resistant cell line which exhibits the multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype) exposed to ADR after pretreatment for 3 h with vitamin K3. Concurrent administration in vivo of vitamin K3 and ADR illustrated a therapeutically significant increase (P less than 0.05) in the life span of sensitive and resistant tumor cell bearing animals. Vitamin K3 caused a depletion of the intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels in P388/S and P388/ADR leukemia cells but at concentrations greater than those that enhanced ADR cytotoxicity. Pretreatment of the tumor cells with 1 microM vitamin K3 induced a 35-50% (P less than 0.001) elevation in the intracellular ADR accumulation in MDR P388 leukemia cells, while such an effect was absent in P388/S tumor cells. DNA binding studies performed utilizing calf thymus DNA, indicated that vitamin K3 enhanced the intercalation potential of ADR and also altered the equilibrium between the free and bound form of ADR in a cell free system. These factors and their possible effects on the potentiation of ADR cytotoxicity and the therapeutic significance of utilizing vitamin K3 as an adjuvant in the chemotherapy of MDR tumors is discussed.","['Parekh, H K', 'Mansuri-Torshizi, H', 'Srivastava, T S', 'Chitnis, M P']","['Parekh HK', 'Mansuri-Torshizi H', 'Srivastava TS', 'Chitnis MP']","['Chemotherapy Division, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Bombay, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia P388', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin K/*pharmacology']",1992/01/10 00:00,1992/01/10 00:01,['1992/01/10 00:00'],"['1992/01/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/10 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1992 Jan 10;61(2):147-56. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(92)90173-s.,"['0304-3835(92)90173-S [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(92)90173-s [doi]']","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '12001-79-5 (Vitamin K)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, disease relapse may occur despite BMT. Studies in animal models and clinical experience have provided evidence that immunologic factors play an important role in preventing relapse post-BMT. To stimulate immunologic activity in patients post-BMT, we administered prolonged uninterrupted continuous infusions of low-dose recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2). Thirteen marrow recipients (seven autologous BMT, six CD6 T-depleted allogeneic BMT) received rIL-2 at a dose of 2 x 10(5) U/m2/d for a scheduled period of 90 days. rIL-2 was administered through a Hickman catheter with a portable pump beginning a median of 85 days after BMT. Toxicity was minimal and all treatment could be undertaken in the outpatient setting. No patient developed any signs of graft-versus-host disease, hypotension, or pulmonary capillary leak syndrome. Treatment did not affect the absolute neutrophil count or hemoglobin level, but eosinophils increased substantially in most patients. Platelet counts decreased by 20% in 10 of 13 individuals within 2 weeks, but stabilized thereafter. Despite the low dose of rIL-2 administered, significant immunologic changes were noted. Specifically, all 13 patients experienced a marked increase (fivefold to 40-fold) in natural killer (NK) cell number. Phenotypic characterization showed that the majority of NK cells were CD56bright+ CD16+ CD3-. In contrast, a minor increase in T-cell number was noted in only 4 of 13 patients. Low-dose rIL-2 treatment resulted in augmentation of in vitro cytotoxicity against K562 and COLO tumor targets. This cytotoxic activity could be dramatically enhanced by incubation with additional rIL-2 in vitro. The immunologic effects of rIL-2 treatment were similar in both autologous and allogeneic marrow recipients. Our data suggest that prolonged infusion of rIL-2 at low doses is safe and can selectively increase NK cell number and activity after BMT. Further studies to assess the impact these changes may have on disease relapse post-BMT will be undertaken.","['Soiffer, R J', 'Murray, C', 'Cochran, K', 'Cameron, C', 'Wang, E', 'Schow, P W', 'Daley, J F', 'Ritz, J']","['Soiffer RJ', 'Murray C', 'Cochran K', 'Cameron C', 'Wang E', 'Schow PW', 'Daley JF', 'Ritz J']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Breast Neoplasms/immunology/therapy', 'Cell Separation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-2/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/pathology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/prevention & control', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/immunology/therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', '*T-Lymphocytes']",1992/01/15 00:00,1992/01/15 00:01,['1992/01/15 00:00'],"['1992/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jan 15;79(2):517-26.,['S0006-4971(20)75056-1 [pii]'],"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,"['AI 29530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR05526/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

In summary, we show that p53 is frequently mutated in the acute phase of ATL and one informative case suggests that p53 mutations may be associated with the transition from chronic to acute ATL.","['Sakashita, A', 'Hattori, T', 'Miller, C W', 'Suzushima, H', 'Asou, N', 'Takatsuki, K', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Sakashita A', 'Hattori T', 'Miller CW', 'Suzushima H', 'Asou N', 'Takatsuki K', 'Koeffler HP']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine 90024-1678.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'Codon', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry', 'Female', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1992/01/15 00:00,1992/01/15 00:01,['1992/01/15 00:00'],"['1992/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jan 15;79(2):477-80.,['S0006-4971(20)75050-0 [pii]'],"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,"['CA26038-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK41936/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Particularly in HL-60 cells that undergo granulocyte or macrophage differentiation depending on inducers, NF-IL6 mRNA was specifically upregulated during macrophage differentiation but not granulocyte differentiation. It was also shown that the functional NF-IL6 protein increased during the differentiation of U937 cells. Furthermore, recombinant NF-IL6 was found to bind to the regulatory regions of the IL-1, tumor necrosis factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and lysozyme genes, which are expressed in mature macrophages. These results suggest that NF-IL6 may possibly be involved as an important transcription factor in the process of activation and/or differentiation of macrophages.","['Natsuka, S', 'Akira, S', 'Nishio, Y', 'Hashimoto, S', 'Sugita, T', 'Isshiki, H', 'Kishimoto, T']","['Natsuka S', 'Akira S', 'Nishio Y', 'Hashimoto S', 'Sugita T', 'Isshiki H', 'Kishimoto T']","['Institute for Molecular and Cellular Biology, Osaka University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Western', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Macrophages/*cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/15 00:00,1992/01/15 00:01,['1992/01/15 00:00'],"['1992/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jan 15;79(2):460-6.,['S0006-4971(20)75047-0 [pii]'],"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-two sites provided 214 previously untreated adults with AML aged 15 years or more who were randomized to receive for induction therapy cytarabine 100 mg/m2/d as a continuous 7-day infusion plus either daunorubicin 45 mg/m2/d (A + D) or idarubicin 13 mg/m2/d (A + I), daily on the first three days of treatment. Postremission therapy consisted of two courses of the induction regimen at the same daily doses, with the anthracycline administered for 2 days and cytarabine for 5. The complete response (CR) rates for evaluable patients were 70% (A + I) and 59% (A + D) (P = .08). The difference in CR rates was significant in patients aged 18 to 50 years (88% for A + I, 70% for A + D, P = .035). Resistant disease was a significantly more frequent cause of induction therapy failure with A + D than with A + I. Hyperleukocytosis (white blood cell count greater than 50,000/microL) unfavorably affected the attainment of CR with A + D but not with A + I. CR duration was significantly greater after A + I. CR duration was significantly greater after A + I treatment, and the survival of all randomized patients treated with A + I was significantly better than that observed after A + D treatment (median 12.9 months v 8.7 months, respectively, P = .038). Toxicity of the two treatments was similar, although A + I patients experienced more prolonged myelosuppression during consolidation therapy, and a greater incidence of mild chemical hepatitis was observed in the A + I group. It is concluded that, at the doses and schedule used in this study, A + I is superior to A + D for induction therapy of AML in adults.","['Wiernik, P H', 'Banks, P L', 'Case, D C Jr', 'Arlin, Z A', 'Periman, P O', 'Todd, M B', 'Ritch, P S', 'Enck, R E', 'Weitberg, A B']","['Wiernik PH', 'Banks PL', 'Case DC Jr', 'Arlin ZA', 'Periman PO', 'Todd MB', 'Ritch PS', 'Enck RE', 'Weitberg AB']","['Albert Einstein Cancer Center, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY 10467.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocytosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction']",1992/01/25 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/01/25 19:15'],"['1992/01/25 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/01/25 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jan 15;79(2):313-9.,['S0006-4971(20)75029-9 [pii]'],"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peak III activity was markedly enhanced (up to 20-fold) by phosphatidylserine, diolein, and Ca2+, whereas addition of these cofactors to the reaction mixture stimulated peak II activity only 2- to 4-fold.

The human T-cell lymphotropic virus Type I (HTLV-I) is associated with adult T-cell leukemia and myelopathy, whereas HTLV-II infection has uncertain clinical consequences. We assessed the seroprevalence of these retroviruses among intravenous drug users and among patients seen at clinics for sexually transmitted diseases (STD clinics). METHODS: We used serum samples that were collected in eight cities in 1988 and 1989 during surveys of human immunodeficiency virus infection among intravenous drug users entering treatment and persons seen in STD clinics. The serum samples were tested for antibodies to HTLV, and positive specimens were tested further by a synthetic peptide-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to differentiate between HTLV-I and HTLV-II. RESULTS: Among 3217 intravenous drug users in 29-drug-treatment centers, the median seroprevalence rates of HTLV varied widely according to city (range, 0.4 percent in Atlanta to 17.6 percent in Los Angeles). Seroprevalence increased sharply with age, to 32 percent in persons over 44 years of age. HTLV infection was more common among blacks (15.5 percent) and Hispanics (10.7 percent) than among whites (4.1 percent), and it was strongly associated with a history of heroin injection (P less than or equal to 0.001). Among 5264 patients in 24 STD clinics, the median rates of HTLV infection were much lower (range, 0.1 percent in Atlanta and Newark to 2.0 percent in Los Angeles). Again, this infection was more common among intravenous drug users (7.6 percent) than among non-drug users (0.7 percent). Eighty-four percent of the seropositive samples from drug-treatment centers and 69 percent of those from STD clinics were due to HTLV-II infection (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: HTLV infections are common among intravenous drug users and are primarily caused by HTLV-II. Among patients seen at STD clinics, HTLV is strongly associated with intravenous drug use, but the retrovirus is also prevalent among non-drug users.","['Khabbaz, R F', 'Onorato, I M', 'Cannon, R O', 'Hartley, T M', 'Roberts, B', 'Hosein, B', 'Kaplan, J E']","['Khabbaz RF', 'Onorato IM', 'Cannon RO', 'Hartley TM', 'Roberts B', 'Hosein B', 'Kaplan JE']","['Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA 30333.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*analysis', 'HTLV-I Infections/epidemiology', 'HTLV-II Antibodies/*analysis', 'HTLV-II Infections/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases/*immunology', '*Substance Abuse, Intravenous', 'United States']",1992/02/06 00:00,1992/02/06 00:01,['1992/02/06 00:00'],"['1992/02/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/06 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/06 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1992 Feb 6;326(6):375-80. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199202063260604.,['10.1056/NEJM199202063260604 [doi]'],"['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (HTLV-II Antibodies)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor-promoting phorbol esters inhibited spontaneous DNA fragmentation and cell death including that induced by colchicine, etoposide, and methylprednisolone, indicating that they act on an event common to apoptosis caused by diverse stimuli. Phorbol esters probably act through protein phosphorylation, since they were effective at concentrations which modulated protein kinase C (PKC) and their action was prevented by H-7, which binds to and inactivates the catalytic site of PKC. In the absence of phorbol ester, H-7 itself induced some apoptosis. These findings implicate PKC in the suppression of apoptosis, but its precise role requires systematic investigation.","['Forbes, I J', 'Zalewski, P D', 'Giannakis, C', 'Cowled, P A']","['Forbes IJ', 'Zalewski PD', 'Giannakis C', 'Cowled PA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woodville, South Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Aurintricarboxylic Acid/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Colchicine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Methylprednisolone/pharmacology', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1992 Feb;198(2):367-72. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(92)90393-m.,['10.1016/0014-4827(92)90393-m [doi]'],"['0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '4431-00-9 (Aurintricarboxylic Acid)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a retrospective review of 25 long-term irradiated survivors of Ewing's sarcoma, the incidence of second cancers was determined. The patients were free of disease for more than three years (except for one patient who developed a second cancer 2.5 years after diagnosis), with a median follow-up period of 7.6 years. All received megavoltage radiation to the primary tumor. Twenty-four of the 25 patients were treated with chemotherapy. Second cancers developed in two patients. Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) developed in a seven-year-old 15 months after treatment. An osteosarcoma developed within an irradiated field in a 13-year-old three years after treatment. The actuarial risk of developing a second cancer at five years is 8% whereas the actuarial risk of developing a bone sarcoma is 4%. Genetic factors may play a role in the development of AML in patients with Ewing's sarcoma. Megavoltage radiation, particularly doses greater than 60 Gy, as well as alkylating agent chemotherapy may contribute to the risk for bone sarcoma. The risk of a second cancer after successful treatment of Ewing's sarcoma is similar to that expected for survivors of all childhood cancers.","['Smith, L M', 'Cox, R S', 'Donaldson, S S']","['Smith LM', 'Cox RS', 'Donaldson SS']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Stanford University Medical Center, California 94305.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Orthop Relat Res,Clinical orthopaedics and related research,0075674,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Neoplasms/drug therapy/epidemiology/radiotherapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Osteosarcoma/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Sarcoma, Ewing/drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Orthop Relat Res. 1992 Jan;(274):275-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although these agents are varied and exceptions exist, in general they lack lineage specificity although they may express lineage-predominant activity. They act at multiple levels of hemolymphopoietic cell differentiation, demonstrate additive or synergistic effects when combined in vitro, require surface receptors on target cells to directly express their activity, and may be produced by a variety of cells. This framework of behavioral generalizations, completed by the specifics of each factor's activity, despite the artifactual and simplified nature of in vivo systems, forms the basis for concepts of in vitro activity and for clinical applications. Hemolymphopoietic growth factors studied in the clinic have demonstrated impressive and important activity, validating much of the in vitro data. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) have clearly reduced neutropenia and infection rates when administered following conventional chemotherapy and high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation. To a varying degree, similar results with G-CSF and/or GM-CSF have been described in other diseases including acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) treated following induction chemotherapy, myelodysplastic syndrome, hairy cell leukemia, aplastic anemia, and chronic neutropenias. In preliminary studies IL-3 has been shown to have similar qualitative activities. However, these agents have not demonstrated a reproducible salutary impact on platelet or red cell lineages. Adverse effects on platelet counts and/or platelet recovery have been noted. Additionally, hemolymphopoietic growth factor receptors have been identified on malignant cells, suggesting that these factors could stimulate neoplastic growth. Studies with GM-CSF and IL-3 have demonstrated blast proliferation in some cases of AML and myelodysplasia, underscoring the capacity of these agents to stimulate the growth of myeloid leukemia. No clinically evident impact of these factors upon the growth of solid tumors has been identified but this issue has not been adequately studied. The toxicity of these agents has been surprisingly limited and appears to be related to their biologic activities. Hemolymphopoietic growth factors as single agents have broad clinical applications in cytopenias. Several methods for enhancing the clinical activity of these agents are under study, including the use of combinations of growth factors synergistic in vitro.","['Grosh, W W', 'Quesenberry, P J']","['Grosh WW', 'Quesenberry PJ']","['University of Virginia Health Sciences Center, Charlottesville 22908.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,Clinical immunology and immunopathology,0356637,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Neutropenia/*therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Immunol Immunopathol. 1992 Jan;62(1 Pt 2):S25-38. doi: 10.1016/0090-1229(92)90038-p.,['10.1016/0090-1229(92)90038-p [doi]'],"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,143,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fatty acid oxygenases were activated in rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-1) by incubating them for 2-4 hr with 33-300 microM of arachidonic acid (AA) or linoleic acid (LA). As a control, the cells were incubated with one of two analogs of these fatty acids which are not oxygenase substrates: eicosatetraynoic acid or linoelaidic acid. Effects of oxygenase activation on cell viability were monitored by an assay for mitochondrial function. Cytotoxicity occurred in incubations with exogenous AA or LA in direct proportion to the substrate concentration but was not found in the control incubations or in incubations with the principal monohydroxylated AA products, 5-, 15-, and 12-HETE. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (80 microM) and alpha-tocopherol (100 microM) significantly decreased the cell death observed during incubations with AA or LA.

Two irradiated B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (Daudi and EBV-transformed BSM) and fresh human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were used as SC. Stimulation with Daudi and IL-2 resulted in a substantial increase in cytotoxic activity (100- to 1000-fold) against a broad range of tumor targets, and total cellular expansion was higher compared to stimulation with IL-2 alone. The most prominent increase was observed in the CD16+ and CD56+/CD3- natural killer (NK) cell subset; however, a significant increase was also observed in CD56+/CD3+ T cells. Functional analysis of Daudi- and IL-2-generated subsets using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) revealed that most of the lytic activity was mediated by NK cells. Significant potentiation of oncolytic activity and cell growth was also seen in the cultures stimulated with BSM or fresh AML and IL-2. The highest oncolytic activity in the latter cultures was mediated primarily by CD8+, CD3+, and CD56- T cells, although NK cells also participated in cytotoxic activity. The T cell-mediated cytotoxicity was restricted by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), since most cytotoxicity could be blocked by HLA I antibodies. Additionally, we observed that optimum stimulation of cytotoxicity required effector cell-stimulator cell contact. These data indicate that depending on the tumor used for stimulation, different lymphocyte subsets may be generated in IL-2 cultures. These different approaches may be useful in both specific and nonspecific immunotherapy.","['Fuchshuber, P R', 'Lotzova, E', 'Savary, C A']","['Fuchshuber PR', 'Lotzova E', 'Savary CA']","['Department of General Surgery, University of Texas, M.

The patients were: case 1, a 9-year-old girl presenting with a white blood cell count (WBC) 42 x 10(9)/L with 32% blasts and bone marrow with blasts and eosinophil precursors consistent with M4Eo, and case 2, a 25-year-old man with WBC 34.7 x 10(9)/L with 13% blasts and bone marrow with features of M4Eo and basophilia. Both patients achieved remission but died following bone marrow transplantation in first remission (case 1) or in relapse (case 2).

Investigation of the breakpoint on 22 in case 1 with Southern blotting and the polymerase chain reaction demonstrated the presence of a p190 mRNA and a breakpoint typical of acute leukemia.

All consecutive patients suffering from haematological malignancy admitted to the IC unit of the University Hospital Nijmegen over a 4 year period (1986-1989) were studied; 39 patients (21 female, 18 male) with a median age of 41 year (range 18-71). Various clinical variables were assessed at admission and related to the outcome of IC treatment in terms of death or survival. Previously, 33 patients had undergone chemotherapy. Eight (21%) survived. One of a subgroup of 13 bone marrow transplantation patients survived. Hypoxaemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation was the most frequent reason for admission (20 patients of whom four recovered). The second most frequent reason was combination of respiratory failure and septic shock (eight patients, none recovered). Three out of five patients admitted with septic shock survived. The need for mechanical ventilation had the highest predictive power for a poor prognosis (p = 0.002). Mortality increased with increasing APACHE II score (p = 0.03). When more than four major organ systems were affected (seven patients), mortality was 100%. Granulocytopenia (leucocyte count less than 1 x 10(9)/l) at admission turned out to be of no prognostic significance, but absence of leucocyte recovery was a prognostically bad sign (p = 0.05).

In humans, staphylococcal exfoliating toxin (ExT) and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) are known to stimulate VB 2-bearing T cells and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) does not activate VB 2-bearing T cells. We examined the proliferative response of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) cells to ExT, TSST-1, and SEB. Leukemic VB 2.1-bearing CTCL cells were reactive to ExT and TSST-1, but not SEB. In addition, two leukemia CTCL-VB 2- cell samples (one of which was VB 8) showed no substantial response to ExT. Thus, it was shown that Sezary cells proliferate in response to bacterial superantigens in a manner that is restricted by their VB usage. The addition of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in combination with ExT enhanced the stimulative response of VB 2.1-bearing CTCL cells that were pre-cultured with ExT for 7 d, suggesting that IL-1 can be a co-factor for the stimulation. The present study indicates that the superantigen reaction occurs with CTCL cells and implies a possible involvement of bacterial toxins in the pathogenesis of CTCL.","['Tokura, Y', 'Heald, P W', 'Yan, S L', 'Edelson, R L']","['Tokura Y', 'Heald PW', 'Yan SL', 'Edelson RL']","['Department of Dermatology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,IM,"['Antigens, Bacterial/*immunology', '*Bacterial Toxins', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'Cell Division', 'Enterotoxins/*immunology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*immunology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Staphylococcus aureus/*immunology', '*Superantigens']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 1992 Jan;98(1):33-7. doi: 10.1111/1523-1747.ep12494184.,"['S0022-202X(15)59390-1 [pii]', '10.1111/1523-1747.ep12494184 [doi]']","['0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Enterotoxins)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Superantigens)', '0 (enterotoxin F, Staphylococcal)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '39424-53-8 (enterotoxin B, staphylococcal)']",,,['5 RO1 CA43058-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The enhancing effect was observed in both serum-free medium (SFM) and medium containing low concentrations of serum. Guinea-pig anti-insulin serum, but not guinea-pig normal serum, inhibited the proliferation of LB cells incubated either in medium containing serum alone or in medium containing serum and supplemented with insulin. This finding suggests that LB cells use serum insulin as a growth factor. Insulin-like growth factors I (IGF-I) and II (IGF-II) failed to stimulate an appreciable proliferation in LB cells, whereas in the same experiment insulin markedly enhanced the proliferation of this lymphoid leukemia. Furthermore, the concentration of unlabelled insulin required to displace 50% of 125I-insulin bound to LB cells was 3 orders of magnitude lower than the concentration of IGF-I required to achieve the same displacement. Our findings indicate that interaction of insulin with its own receptor, and not with IGF-I receptor, triggers the proliferation of LB cells. Radio-receptor assays revealed that LB cells express approximately 3,200 molecules of high affinity (Kd = 10(-9) M) insulin receptor per cell. None of 7 other tumor cell lines tested responded to insulin. The proliferation of insulin-stimulated LB cells was also inhibited with tyrphostin, a tyrosine kinase blocker analogous to tyrosine, which perhaps blocks the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor beta-chain.","['Pillemer, G', 'Lugasi-Evgi, H', 'Scharovsky, G', 'Naor, D']","['Pillemer G', 'Lugasi-Evgi H', 'Scharovsky G', 'Naor D']","['Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Female', 'Insulin/*physiology', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/pharmacology', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Receptor, Insulin/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/02 00:00,1992/01/02 00:01,['1992/01/02 00:00'],"['1992/01/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/02 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1992 Jan 2;50(1):80-5. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910500117.,['10.1002/ijc.2910500117 [doi]'],"['0 (Insulin)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Insulin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The more malignant cells exhibited higher PKC and PTK activity. This activity was independent of serum concentration between 0.01-10%. In contrast, the weakly malignant cells need a high serum concentration (10%) for optimal PKC or PTK activity. Immunoblot analysis revealed a higher level of PKC protein in the BS-24-1 cells than in the RO2T cells. Serum induction of PKC activity did not change the amount of PKC protein in the cytosol or the membrane fractions, indicating post-translational mechanism regulation of PKC.

Glucocorticoid treatment of the 380 cell line which expresses high levels of BCL-2 resulted in inhibition of cellular proliferation without induction of apoptosis. On the other hand, glucocorticoid treatment of the 697 cell line which expresses lower levels of the BCL-2 resulted in both inhibition of cellular proliferation and apoptosis with characteristic internucleosomal DNA cleavage. The glucocorticoid-induced inhibition of cellular proliferation in both cell lines was also associated with repression of the c-myc mRNA expression. Taken together, our data suggest that BCL-2 blocks the glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of the 380 pre-B-lymphocytes by extending their survival when the level of c-myc expression is repressed. Also by repressing the expression of c-myc, glucocorticoid causes apoptosis of the 697 pre-B-lymphocytes in the absence of high level of BCL-2 expression.","['Alnemri, E S', 'Fernandes, T F', 'Haldar, S', 'Croce, C M', 'Litwack, G']","['Alnemri ES', 'Fernandes TF', 'Haldar S', 'Croce CM', 'Litwack G']","['Department of Pharmacology, Jefferson Cancer Institute, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Cell Death', 'Cell Division', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, myc', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/physiology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/15 00:00,1992/01/15 00:01,['1992/01/15 00:00'],"['1992/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Jan 15;52(2):491-5.,,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,,['DK 135131/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['BCL-2'],,,,,,,

The effects of staurosporine on the cell cycle progression and nuclear morphology of normal human lymphocytes stimulated to proliferate by phytohemagglutinin were studied and compared with the effects of this drug on human lymphocytic leukemic MOLT-4 cells. Exposure of normal lymphocytes to either 5-10 or 50-100 ng/ml of staurosporine resulted in the preferential accumulation of cells in G1 or G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle, respectively. In contrast, regardless of the concentration (5-100 ng/ml), staurosporine arrested MOLT-4 cells initially in G2; these cells then initiated additional rounds of DNA replication, without division. Staurosporine (5-100 ng/ml) induced severe changes in the nuclear morphology of MOLT-4 cells, manifested as nuclear elongation, deep invaginations of the nuclear membrane, extensive fragmentation, and micronucleation. At concentrations of 5-10 ng/ml, staurosporine had no apparent effect on the nuclear morphology of normal lymphocytes and at 50-100 ng/ml it produced minor changes in the nuclear shapes of these cells. The data indicate that the kinase(s) involved in the regulation of cell exit from G1 and G2, respectively, in normal and leukemic lymphocytes may have different sensitivities to staurosporine, which suggests that the mechanisms controlling exit from G1 in these cells may be different. In MOLT-4 cells the staurosporine-sensitive kinase(s) appear to also be involved in phosphorylation of nuclear constituents essential for organization of gross chromatin structure. The different response of normal versus leukemic lymphocytes to staurosporine, if confirmed on clinical material, opens new strategies of tumor treatment.","['Bruno, S', 'Ardelt, B', 'Skierski, J S', 'Traganos, F', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Bruno S', 'Ardelt B', 'Skierski JS', 'Traganos F', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Chromatin/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Phytohemagglutinins', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Staurosporine', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1992/01/15 00:00,1992/01/15 00:01,['1992/01/15 00:00'],"['1992/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Jan 15;52(2):470-3.,,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",,,"['R01 CA28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

After the complementary DNA and gene for the human p120 protein were isolated and sequenced (review: H. Busch, Cancer Res., 50: 4830-4838, 1990), constructs were prepared to study the expression of the sense p120 and its antisense, p021 message. NIH/3T3 cells were transfected by electroporation with pSVX plasmids containing either the p120 complementary DNA (pSVX120) or the antisense, p021 DNA (pSVX021), and clones containing these constructs were selected. The expression of p120 or p021 in these constructs was regulated by Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeats. In pSVX120-transfected NIH/3T3 cells, the expressed human p120 protein was localized to the nucleoli as shown by anti-p120 monoclonal antibody immunofluorescence. Expression of the p120 message and protein was confirmed by Northern (mRNA) and Western (protein) blots. Transfection of the p120 complementary DNA in sense orientation caused malignant transformation of NIH/3T3 cells in vitro and produced rapidly growing tumors in nude mice. Transfection of the antisense p120 constructs markedly delayed the growth of these tumors in vitro and in vivo (L. Perlaky et al., Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res., 32: 1682, 1991). When transformed 3T3/pSVX120 cells were transfected with an inducible antisense p120 construct (pMSG021), dexamethasone induction decreased the growth rate by 62%, and the cell line returned to its normal phenotype. Northern blot analysis showed a decreased level of p120 mRNA, and the immunofluorescence was also markedly reduced.","['Perlaky, L', 'Valdez, B C', 'Busch, R K', 'Larson, R G', 'Jhiang, S M', 'Zhang, W W', 'Brattain, M', 'Busch, H']","['Perlaky L', 'Valdez BC', 'Busch RK', 'Larson RG', 'Jhiang SM', 'Zhang WW', 'Brattain M', 'Busch H']","['Department of Pharmacology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Division', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'DNA, Antisense', 'Gene Expression', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Protein Methyltransferases', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transfection']",1992/01/15 00:00,1992/01/15 00:01,['1992/01/15 00:00'],"['1992/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Jan 15;52(2):428-36.,,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Nop2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Protein Methyltransferases)']",,,['CA10893 P1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

A morphologic and immunophenotypic study.,413-20,"To determine whether there are any consistent morphologic differences between B-cell and T-cell aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of the spleen, the authors analyzed 16 spleens involved by mixed cell (1 case) or large cell (15 cases) lymphomas. Immunologic data were derived from cell suspensions or frozen tissue in each case. Five cases had a T-cell phenotype, and 11 were B-cell. Morphologic features favoring a T-cell phenotype included epithelioid histiocytic reactions, confinement of the lymphomas to the splenic T-zones (periarteriolar lymphoid sheath and marginal zone), and clear cell or polymorphous cytologic features. Features favoring a B-cell phenotype included multiple discrete nodules in the white pulp, large coalescent tumor nodules in association with small lymphocytic lymphoma, and large non-cleaved or immunoblastic plasmacytoid cytologic characteristics. Four cases were unusual because most neoplastic large cells were distributed diffusely or formed only small aggregates in the red pulp without definite tumor masses or nodules involving the white pulp. Because of this distribution and the frequently encountered erythrophagocytosis by benign-appearing histiocytes, these cases resembled malignant histiocytosis. A T-cell phenotype was predicted for all four cases; however, only one case, a lymphoma with polymorphous cytologic characteristics, was of T-cell lineage. The other three cases were of B-cell lineage. The authors' results indicate that in most instances the B-cell or T-cell nature of aggressive splenic lymphomas is predictable from the distributional and cytologic features. As in lymph nodes, there are cases for which the morphologic characteristics of B-cell and T-cell lymphomas are indistinguishable.","['Stroup, R M', 'Burke, J S', 'Sheibani, K', 'Ben-Ezra, J', 'Brownell, M', 'Winberg, C D']","['Stroup RM', 'Burke JS', 'Sheibani K', 'Ben-Ezra J', 'Brownell M', 'Winberg CD']","['James Irvine Center for the Study of Leukemia and Lymphoma, Division of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/*immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Splenic Neoplasms/classification/*immunology/*pathology']",1992/01/15 00:00,1992/01/15 00:01,['1992/01/15 00:00'],"['1992/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1992 Jan 15;69(2):413-20. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19920115)69:2<413::aid-cncr2820690223>3.0.co;2-j.,['10.1002/1097-0142(19920115)69:2<413::aid-cncr2820690223>3.0.co;2-j [doi]'],['0 (Biomarkers)'],,,"['5 RO1 CA26422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 T32 CA09308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5RO1 CA 37194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Results of a phase I/II clinical trial.,29-37,"We have used recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) in a phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate its ability to reverse refractory anemia in hematologic disorders. rHuEPO was administered subcutaneously 5 days per week at escalating doses (50 to 150 U/kg per day). The aim of treatment was a hemoglobin (Hb) level greater than or equal to 10 g/dL without blood transfusion. Of 25 patients treated, 17 were evaluable, most of them with a regular need for transfusion. Eight of these had lymphoproliferative disorders (three cases of malignant lymphoma and five of monoclonal gammopathy) and were exposed to cytotoxic therapy. The other nine patients had hematopoietic stem cell disorders (four cases of myelodysplastic syndrome, three of idiopathic myelofibrosis, and two of chronic myelogenous leukemia). All patients with lymphoproliferative disorder had serum EPO levels inappropriately low for the degree of anemia, while patients with stem cell disorder showed variable values. Erythroid marrow activity was inadequate in all cases. Seven of eight patients with lymphoproliferative disorder responded to treatment maintaining Hb above 10 g/dL without transfusion. The median dose of rHuEPO required for correction of anemia was 75 U/kg. In four cases response was maintained with 50 U/kg, three times per week. There was no complete response among patients with hematopoietic stem cell disorder, although transfusion requirement was eliminated or reduced in four cases. Four patients developed functional iron deficiency during rHuEPO treatment and required iron supplementation to obtain response. Aggravation of splenomegaly was observed in two cases of myeloproliferative disorder. We conclude that: (1) subcutaneous administration of rHuEPO can be effective and safe in patients with lymphoproliferative disorder exposed to chemotherapy and showing inappropriate EPO response to anemia; (2) this is less likely in hematopoietic stem cell disorders, although favorable responses may be observed in occasional patients; and (3) functional iron deficiency as a cause of nonresponse to rHuEPO is frequent also in nonrenal anemia.","['Cazzola, M', 'Ponchio, L', 'Beguin, Y', 'Rosti, V', 'Bergamaschi, G', 'Liberato, N L', 'Fregoni, V', 'Nalli, G', 'Barosi, G', 'Ascari, E']","['Cazzola M', 'Ponchio L', 'Beguin Y', 'Rosti V', 'Bergamaschi G', 'Liberato NL', 'Fregoni V', 'Nalli G', 'Barosi G', 'Ascari E']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Therapy, University of Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory/*drug therapy/etiology/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/pathology', 'Erythropoietin/administration & dosage/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Ferritins/blood', 'Hematologic Diseases/*complications', 'Humans', 'Iron/blood', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/complications', 'Receptors, Transferrin/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/therapeutic use']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jan 1;79(1):29-37.,['S0006-4971(20)75366-8 [pii]'],"['0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",,,,,,,,['Blood. 1992 Aug 1;80(3):841-3.

This paper reports clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular data derived from 64 CML patients following allogeneic BMT. Nested primer PCR was performed on patient blood and bone marrow samples to detect the presence of residual bcr/abl (+) cells in CML patients considered to be in clinical remission at the time of study. Bcr/abl transcripts were detected in 37 of 64 patients for at least one timepoint post-BMT. Thirteen of these 37 bcr/abl (+) patients have subsequently relapsed, as defined by clinical and/or persistent cytogenetic findings, in contrast to 0 relapses among the 27 bcr/abl (-) patients (P = .0025). The median time from first (+) bcr/abl PCR signal to relapse was 150 days (range 90 to 832). Fifty-four patients were studied at two or more timepoints post-BMT: five of eight patients persistently bcr/abl (+) have relapsed; 5 of 23 patients with both bcr/abl (+) and (-) assays during follow-up have relapsed; and none of 23 patients persistently (-) have relapsed (cumulative actuarial relapse rates 77%, 20%, and 0%, respectively, P = .0017). These data indicate that among CML patients in apparent clinical remission after BMT, nested primer bcr/abl PCR can define subgroups with low, intermediate, and high risk of relapse. The pattern of bcr/abl PCR detection after transplant may aid in the development of trials designed to reduce the risk of relapse, or allow for early intervention in patients who fail to clear the malignant clone.","['Roth, M S', 'Antin, J H', 'Ash, R', 'Terry, V H', 'Gotlieb, M', 'Silver, S M', 'Ginsburg, D']","['Roth MS', 'Antin JH', 'Ash R', 'Terry VH', 'Gotlieb M', 'Silver SM', 'Ginsburg D']","['Department of Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/surgery', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jan 1;79(1):276-82.,['S0006-4971(20)75398-X [pii]'],"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,['CA39542/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['bcr/abl'],,,,,,,

An investigation of the structure of the VHDJH joinings using complementarity determining region (CDR)3 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 12 leukemias at both diagnosis and relapse indicates that this instability may increase as a function of time. In only one of seven cases in which relapse occurred within 3 years from diagnosis was a new VHDJH joining identified and this coexisted with the original diagnostic joining. Most strikingly, new VHDJH joinings were identified in four of five cases in which relapse occurred more than 5 years from diagnosis. In this latter population, the instability of the joinings was generated from VH----VH gene replacement events in two cases, since the new joinings retained the original DJH sequences and partial N region homology at the VHD junction, and probably in a third case from a VH gene rearrangement to a common DJH precursor. Furthermore, in five of 23 (21.7%) additional cases studied at diagnosis, subclones were identified that had similar modifications of the VH-N region. These data indicate that VH gene replacement events and VH gene rearrangements to a common DJH joining contribute to the instability of the VHDJH joining in ALL. This phenomenon should be taken into consideration in those methodologies that exploit IgH rearrangements for detection of minimal residual disease.","['Wasserman, R', 'Yamada, M', 'Ito, Y', 'Finger, L R', 'Reichard, B A', 'Shane, S', 'Lange, B', 'Rovera, G']","['Wasserman R', 'Yamada M', 'Ito Y', 'Finger LR', 'Reichard BA', 'Shane S', 'Lange B', 'Rovera G']","[""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, PA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Joining Region/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jan 1;79(1):223-8.,['S0006-4971(20)75390-5 [pii]'],"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Joining Region)']",,,"['CA10819/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['Blood. 1992 Sep 15;80(6):1630-1.

High molecular weight monomer and dimer intermediates were detected by Southern analysis, indicating active viral replication. Approximately 1,000 genome copies were present per infected cell, and at the optimal multiplicity of infection 20- to 50-fold more virus was produced than inoculated. Virus propagation only occurred in UT-7 cells that were adapted to growth in erythropoietin; virus signal was not detected in UT-7 cells adapted for growth in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or interleukin-3, even with exposure to erythropoietin for several days. Infectious virus was detected in cultures as long as 3 months after inoculation. Despite persistence, there was no evidence of viral integration on Southern analysis. This cell line may prove useful for the production of infectious virus and in the analysis of B19 parvovirus persistence, cytotoxicity, and permissivity.","['Shimomura, S', 'Komatsu, N', 'Frickhofen, N', 'Anderson, S', 'Kajigaya, S', 'Young, N S']","['Shimomura S', 'Komatsu N', 'Frickhofen N', 'Anderson S', 'Kajigaya S', 'Young NS']","['Cell Biology Section, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Capsid/analysis', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Parvovirus B19, Human/genetics/*growth & development/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Virus Cultivation']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jan 1;79(1):18-24.,['S0006-4971(20)75364-4 [pii]'],"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HBM-M cells synthesized approximately 150-Kd Pronase-resistant proteoglycans that were recognized by an antihuman secretory granule proteoglycan peptide core antibody. These cells also contained in relatively high abundance the same sized mRNA transcript that encodes the peptide core of proteoglycans that are normally localized to secretory granules of hematopoietic cells. However, unlike most other hematopoietic cells, HBM-M cells continuously released their newly synthesized 35S-labeled proteoglycans rather than retaining them in an intracellular storage compartment. Chondroitinase ABC, nitrous acid, and heparinase degraded approximately 76%, 17%, and 7%, respectively, of the HBM-M cell-derived 35S-labeled proteoglycans. As assessed by high performance liquid chromatography, 91% of the unsaturated 35S-labeled disaccharides generated by treatment with chondroitinase ABC were delta Di-4S. The remaining chondroitin sulfate 35S-labeled disaccharides appeared to be primarily a complex mixture of disulfated disaccharides. The 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans that were not degraded by chondroitinase ABC migrated in two-dimensional cellulose acetate electrophoresis as if they were heparan sulfate or under-sulfated heparin. Thus, although the HBM-M cell-derived proteoglycans had some of the features of proteoglycans produced by normal human mast cells, the heparin-like and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans bound to the HBM-M cell proteoglycans were considerably less sulfated. Because the only human cell types that have so far been shown to synthesize proteoglycans that have heparin-like glycosaminoglycans bound to a protease-resistant peptide core are mast cells and basophilic leukocytes from patients with myelogenous leukemia, it is possible that the HBM-M cell is a mast cell progenitor cell.","['Krilis, S A', 'Austen, K F', 'Macpherson, J L', 'Nicodemus, C F', 'Gurish, M F', 'Stevens, R L']","['Krilis SA', 'Austen KF', 'Macpherson JL', 'Nicodemus CF', 'Gurish MF', 'Stevens RL']","['School of Medicine, University of New South Wales; Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chondroitin Lyases/metabolism', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*metabolism', 'Disaccharides/metabolism', 'Glycosaminoglycans/metabolism', 'Heparin/metabolism', 'Heparin Lyase', 'Humans', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Nitrous Acid', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Polysaccharide-Lyases/metabolism', 'Pronase/metabolism', 'Proteoglycans/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Sulfates/metabolism', 'Urticaria Pigmentosa/*physiopathology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jan 1;79(1):144-51.,['S0006-4971(20)75380-2 [pii]'],"['0 (Disaccharides)', '0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sulfates)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Pronase)', 'EC 4.2.2.- (Chondroitin Lyases)', 'EC 4.2.2.- (Polysaccharide-Lyases)', 'EC 4.2.2.7 (Heparin Lyase)', 'T2I5UM75DN (Nitrous Acid)']",,,"['AI-22531/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-23401/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-23483/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

In three lymphomas of different histologic subtype, low concentrations of anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) MoAb completely inhibited spontaneous 3H-thymidine uptake of T-cell-- and monocyte-depleted tumor cells, whereas two other tumors were not affected. Maximal inhibition of DNA synthesis was achieved at MoAb concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 250 micrograms/mL and required crosslinking by bivalent antibody but not Fc-mediated effects. While two anti-IgM MoAbs were similarly efficient as anti-Id MoAb in inhibition of DNA synthesis, two anti-IgD MoAbs had no effect. Thus, surface IgD molecules seemed to be neither able to deliver inhibitory signals themselves nor to antagonize IgM-mediated signals when simultaneously crosslinked by anti-Id MoAb. Leukocyte differentiation antigen expression, IgM density, and IgM/IgD ratio on the surface of lymphoma cells did not distinguish between sensitive and resistant tumors. In vitro tumor cell survival was differently affected by prolonged incubation with anti-Id antibody. In a centrocytic lymphoma and an immunocytoma, but not in a chronic lymphocytic leukemia, suppression of 3H-thymidine uptake persisted after removal of MoAb and tumor cell viability decreased during prolonged incubation with anti-Id MoAb. These results suggest that direct inhibitory signaling via surface IgM may contribute to anti-Id MoAb-mediated tumor regression in certain human B-cell lymphomas.","['van Endert, P M', 'Heilig, B', 'Hammerling, G J', 'Moldenhauer, G']","['van Endert PM', 'Heilig B', 'Hammerling GJ', 'Moldenhauer G']","['Institute for Immunology and Genetics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Cell Survival', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin D/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phytohemagglutinins', 'Receptors, Fc/immunology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jan 1;79(1):129-37.,['S0006-4971(20)75378-4 [pii]'],"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin D)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we analyzed the results of one or more cycles of high-dose cytarabine-based consolidation chemotherapy as compared with allogeneic BMT in first remission. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The results in 28 adult patients, aged 16 to 45 years, who underwent a closely HLA-matched BMT for AML in first remission were compared with those in 54 consecutive, age-matched, adult patients treated with one or more cycles of high-dose, cytarabine-based consolidation chemotherapy. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 4 years, the actuarial risk of leukemic relapse was considerably lower in the transplant group than in the group treated with consolidation chemotherapy (32% +/- 26% v 60% +/- 14%; P = .05). Treatment-related mortality, however, was much higher in the group treated with BMT (32% v 6%, P = .002). The actuarial disease-free survival at 5 years was not significantly different for the two groups (45% +/- 24% v 38% +/- 14%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that BMT in first remission AML did not offer a disease-free survival advantage over intensive postremission consolidation chemotherapy.

Two schedules were studied; twice-weekly administration of a 1- or 2-mg dose and ""concentration times time"" (C x T) administration of 0.5 mg every 6 hours for three doses, administered once weekly. RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxicity consisting of headache, nausea, or vomiting occurred in only three patients and only at the 2-mg, twice weekly dose. The schedules of 1 mg twice-weekly and 0.5 mg every 6 hours for three doses were well tolerated. Thirty-seven courses were assessable for response. The overall response rate was 62%.

We examined factors that contribute to these adverse sequelae. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serial height and weight measurements were analyzed for 91 long-term survivors who were treated for ALL between 1967 and 1975 at a single institution. These patients were all younger than 12 years at diagnosis, were in continuous complete remission, had reached final height, and had height and weight measurements within 1 year of age 18 years. They had received craniospinal (n = 33) or cranial irradiation (n = 58) to total doses of 24 Gy as CNS prophylaxis. Standard deviation scores (SDS) were used to reflect the deviation of height and weight measurements from population means, and the body mass index (BMI; weight divided by height squared) was used in assessing obesity at age 18 years. RESULTS: Short stature (less than fifth percentile) was seen in 41 patients (45%), and obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 24 kg/m2) in 35 (38%). Regression formulae were developed that explain 65% and 62% of the variability in patient height and BMI, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors were identified for abnormally short stature, which was defined to be a decrease of 1.5 SDS in height from diagnosis to age 18 years. These factors include younger age and above-average height for age at diagnosis (height SDS greater than 0), craniospinal irradiation, and greater decrease in height SDS during antileukemic therapy. Risk factors for obesity at age 18 years include weight SDS greater than 0 and greater than height SDS at 1 year after the end of chemotherapy.","['Schell, M J', 'Ochs, J J', 'Schriock, E A', 'Carter, M']","['Schell MJ', 'Ochs JJ', 'Schriock EA', 'Carter M']","[""Division of Biostatistics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Body Height', 'Body Mass Index', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Obesity/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*physiopathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1992 Jan;10(1):128-33. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1992.10.1.128.,['10.1200/JCO.1992.10.1.128 [doi]'],,,,['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

By using molecular sieve chromatography, heparin agarose chromatography, and reverse phase HPLC, this protein was purified to homogeneity. The first 33 amino acids of the N-terminal amino acid sequence showed complete identity to the sequence predicted from a rat serine protease gene recently cloned and designated RNKP-1.

Samples were assayed for glucose, lactate, and insulin concentrations, and results were compared statistically with those from 16 normal control dogs of similar weight and age undergoing an identical dextrose challenge before and 3 weeks after receiving one dose of IV doxorubicin (30 mg/m2). Glucose, lactate, and insulin concentrations did not change significantly in response to glucose challenge in control dogs after doxorubicin chemotherapy. Lactate and insulin concentrations in untreated dogs with lymphoma were significantly higher than controls. This hyperlactatemia and hyperinsulinemia did not improve when dogs with lymphoma were put into remission with doxorubicin chemotherapy. The results indicate that carbohydrate metabolism is altered in dogs with lymphoma, and that these abnormalities do not improve when a complete remission is obtained with doxorubicin chemotherapy.","['Ogilvie, G K', 'Vail, D M', 'Wheeler, S L', 'Fettman, M J', 'Salman, M D', 'Johnston, S D', 'Hegstad, R L']","['Ogilvie GK', 'Vail DM', 'Wheeler SL', 'Fettman MJ', 'Salman MD', 'Johnston SD', 'Hegstad RL']","['Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Glucose/metabolism', '*Carbohydrate Metabolism', 'Dog Diseases/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Dogs', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Insulin/blood', 'Lactates/blood', 'Lactic Acid', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/*veterinary', 'Remission Induction']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1992 Jan 1;69(1):233-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19920101)69:1<233::aid-cncr2820690138>3.0.co;2-k.,['10.1002/1097-0142(19920101)69:1<233::aid-cncr2820690138>3.0.co;2-k [doi]'],"['0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Lactates)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,['2 P01 CA 29582/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the transport pathway that carries these receptors to the Golgi complex. To learn more about this transport, we studied the effects of treatments that block specific types of vesicular traffic. K562 cells were cultured in test media and the transport of surface TfR to the Golgi complex was assessed by measuring the entry of asialo-TfR into the sialyltransferase compartment of the Golgi complex. Depletion of cellular potassium, which blocks formation of coated vesicles at the cell surface, stimulated asialo-TfR resialylation by 60% over controls, suggesting that coated vesicle formation is not the rate-limiting step in cell surface-to-Golgi transport. Similarly, culture in sodium-free medium, which blocks transport from endosomes to lysosomes, increased asialo-TfR resialylation by 40%, arguing that lysosomes do not lie on the transport pathway. In contrast, incubation of cells in hypertonic medium, which blocks many vesicular transport steps, inhibited TfR resialylation by 40%, confirming the importance of vesicular traffic in transport of asialo-TfR from the cell surface to the Golgi complex. These results are consistent with two possible pathways for cell surface-to-Golgi transport. Receptor could be transported via an endosomal intermediate, with the rate-limiting step occurring at a post-endosomal site. Alternatively, receptor could be transported directly to the Golgi via a pathway that does not involve endosomes.","['Robertson, B J', 'Park, R D', 'Snider, M D']","['Robertson BJ', 'Park RD', 'Snider MD']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106-4935.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,IM,"['Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Cell Survival', '*Endocytosis', 'Golgi Apparatus/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypertonic Solutions', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Potassium/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/drug effects/*physiology', 'Sialic Acids/metabolism', 'Sialyltransferases/metabolism', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1992 Jan;292(1):190-8. doi: 10.1016/0003-9861(92)90067-7.,"['0003-9861(92)90067-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0003-9861(92)90067-7 [doi]']","['0 (Hypertonic Solutions)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",,,['GM38183/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to resting normal T-cells that do not express high-affinity IL-2 receptors (IL-2R), abnormal T-cells of patients with leukemia-lymphoma, certain autoimmune disorders, and individuals rejecting allografts express this receptor. Exploiting this difference in receptor expression, antibodies to the IL-2 receptor have been used effectively to treat patients with leukemia and lymphoma. One approach is to use monoclonal antibodies produced in mice; the disadvantage is that they are highly immunogenic. In an effort to reduce the immunogenicity of the mouse monoclonal antibodies, monoclonal-antibody-mediated therapy has been revolutionized by generating humanized antibodies produced by genetic engineering in which the molecule is human except for the antigen-combining regions, which are retained from the mouse. Further, to increase its cytotoxic effectiveness, the monoclonal antibody has been armed with toxins or radionuclides. Alternatively, IL-2 itself has been linked to a toxin to kill IL-2 receptor-bearing cells. Thus, IL-2 receptor-directed therapy provides a new method for treating certain neoplastic diseases and autoimmune disorders and for preventing allograft rejection.","['Waldmann, T A', 'Pastan, I H', 'Gansow, O A', 'Junghans, R P']","['Waldmann TA', 'Pastan IH', 'Gansow OA', 'Junghans RP']","['National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,IM,"['*ADP Ribose Transferases', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Autoimmune Diseases/immunology', '*Bacterial Toxins', 'Exotoxins', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/therapy', 'Radioimmunodetection', 'Radioimmunotherapy', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/chemistry/*immunology/physiology', '*Virulence Factors']",1992/01/15 00:00,1992/01/15 00:01,['1992/01/15 00:00'],"['1992/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1992 Jan 15;116(2):148-60. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-116-2-148.,['10.7326/0003-4819-116-2-148 [doi]'],"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (toxA protein, Pseudomonas aeruginosa)']",,79,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is unclear how many such patients actually undergo this procedure. METHODS: We reviewed the case records of 350 consecutive adult patients with AML treated with chemotherapy at a single institution from 1979 (when the policy of offering allogeneic transplantation to all such patients in first remission was introduced) through 1990. The criteria for exclusion before transplantation included age greater than 40 and, beginning in 1984, a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia. RESULTS: One hundred forty-two patients (41 percent of the study population) were 40 years of age or under. HLA testing was performed for 120 of these patients (85 percent). Sixty-seven patients (47 percent) had an HLA-identical sibling as a potential donor. One hundred three patients (73 percent) entered remission during treatment according to one of five chemotherapy protocols. Of the 52 patients who both entered remission and had an HLA match, 30 underwent transplantation while they were in first remission. These 30 patients constituted 21 percent of all study patients 40 years old or under, 29 percent of all patients 40 or under who entered remission, 45 percent of all patients with an HLA match, 58 percent of all patients who had both a remission and a match, and 9 percent of all patients treated according to a protocol. Among patients with a match who did not undergo transplantation, those with primary refractory disease were the largest subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is performed in less than 60 percent of adult patients with AML who are potentially eligible for the procedure.","['Berman, E', 'Little, C', 'Gee, T', ""O'Reilly, R"", 'Clarkson, B']","['Berman E', 'Little C', 'Gee T', ""O'Reilly R"", 'Clarkson B']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/statistics & numerical data', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1992/01/16 00:00,1992/01/16 00:01,['1992/01/16 00:00'],"['1992/01/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/16 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1992 Jan 16;326(3):156-60. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199201163260303.,['10.1056/NEJM199201163260303 [doi]'],['0 (HLA Antigens)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One major goal of studying the status of p53 (and other tumor suppressor genes) in human cancer is to facilitate the suppression of the tumorigenic phenotype through the restoration of the expression of the wild-type allele. While the efficient insertion of a suppressor into all cells of solid/metastatic human tumors may at present be impossible, insertion into leukemia cells may be feasible due to the accessibility of the leukemia cells in the body. To examine the feasibility of suppressing the tumorigenicity of human T-leukemia cells, the human T-ALL cell line Be-13, which lacks endogenous p53 protein, was infected with a recombinant retrovirus encoding the wild-type allele of human p53 (hwtp53). Expression of p53 reduced the growth rate of infected Be-13 cells in vitro, suppressed colony formation in methylcellulose cultures, and abrogated their tumorigenic phenotype in nude mice in vivo. These results suggest that suppression of the leukemic phenotype of relapse T-ALL-derived Be-13 cells is feasible. Acute leukemia cell suppression via high-efficiency infection with retroviruses encoding wtp53 may be feasible and beneficial in T-ALL cases as part of a bone marrow transplantation regimen in an effort to reduce the frequency of posttransplantation relapse.","['Cheng, J', 'Yee, J K', 'Yeargin, J', 'Friedmann, T', 'Haas, M']","['Cheng J', 'Yee JK', 'Yeargin J', 'Friedmann T', 'Haas M']","['UCSD Cancer Center, Department of Pathology, La Jolla 92093-0063.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Phenotype', 'Suppression, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Jan 1;52(1):222-6.,,,,,,,,,['p53'],,,,,,,

Transcription and processing of c-myc and rRNA gene transcripts increased proportionally after mitogen stimulation, whereas these processes were independent of cell cycling status in the case of the S14 gene. Normal lymphocytes showed an unexpectedly large amount of primary transcript of the calcyclin gene, whereas the corresponding mRNA was undetectable. The abundance of c-myc, calcyclin, and S14 mRNA in terminally differentiated HL-60 cells decreased sharply, compared to their proliferating counterparts. This decrease reflected post-transcriptional modulation, since the abundance of precursor remained essentially unchanged. After HL-60 differentiation, the 32S rRNA levels remained relatively high, whereas the 45S primary transcript almost disappeared. Leukemic blast cells displayed highly variable precursor/mRNA ratios of c-myc, calcyclin, and S14 genes but consistently high ratios of 32S to 45S RNA, suggesting that the cleavage rate of the 32S rRNA was sharply reduced in these cells, resulting in an accumulation of this molecule. These results suggest the importance of efficient processing of primary transcript to generate adequate functional mRNA, thus regulating gene expression. Furthermore, in terminally differentiated cells and leukemic blast cells a stabilization of the primary transcript without efficient processing can be observed. The role of the stabilization of the primary transcript in terminal differentiation is further supported by the results of run-off transcription, indicating a sharp decrease of c-myc and calcyclin transcription rate in retinoic acid/dimethyl sulfoxide-treated HL-60 cells.","['Ferrari, S', 'Tagliafico, E', 'Manfredini, R', 'Grande, A', 'Rossi, E', 'Zucchini, P', 'Torelli, G', 'Torelli, U']","['Ferrari S', 'Tagliafico E', 'Manfredini R', 'Grande A', 'Rossi E', 'Zucchini P', 'Torelli G', 'Torelli U']","['II Medical Clinic, University of Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'DNA Probes', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis/genetics', 'Ribosomal Proteins/*genetics', 'S100 Calcium Binding Protein A6', '*S100 Proteins']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Jan 1;52(1):11-6.,,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (S100 Calcium Binding Protein A6)', '0 (S100 Proteins)', '0 (ribosomal protein S14)', '105504-00-5 (S100A6 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, serum samples from 40 patients with various solid tumors as well as from 53 healthy individuals were used as controls. It was found that the mean serum levels of sIL-2R were significantly increased (P less than 0.001) in NHL (mean +/- standard error of the mean 2,327 +/- 320 units/ml) and CLL patients (2517 +/- 451 units/ml) as compared to normal controls (207 +/- 17 units/ml). No such difference was observed when the serum sIL-2R levels of patients with multiple myeloma or solid tumors were analyzed. Serum sIL-2R levels were closely related to the clinical stage, the presence of B-symptoms, and the disease activity of patients with NHL and CLL. In fact, response to chemotherapy was followed by marked decrease or normalization of sIL-2R levels, while in a number of patients sIL-2R values were even able to predict disease relapse. Finally, no association with histologic grade in NHL patients, could be demonstrated.

Long-term neuropsychological sequelae are documented in children who received 2400 cGy prophylactic cranial irradiation. The dose was reduced to 1800 cGy. Available reports on developmental consequences, with short follow-up, have yielded inconsistent results. This study assesses radiation dose effects on cognitive function in children with leukemia who received central nervous system prophylaxis with 2400 cGy versus 1800 cGy whole brain radiotherapy. All leukemic children also received intrathecal methotrexate. A control group of children (treated for Wilms' tumor) received no central nervous system therapy. Nineteen children were treated with 2400 cGy, 16 children with 1800 cGy. The 12 control children received no irradiation. All patients were off therapy for at least 70 months. The 1800 cGy and 2400 cGy patient groups were off therapy for equivalent periods of time (range 70-123 mo) at follow-up testing. Mean age at diagnosis was 49 months, at testing: 142 months. The male to female ratio was 1/1. Standardized psychological tests were administered. Full-Scale, Verbal, and Performance IQ were measured with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised. Wide Range Achievement Testing evaluated reading, spelling, and arithmetic abilities. Children treated with 1800 cGy performed significantly better than those who received 2400 cGy, and at the same level as controls. There were statistically significant differences between the 1800 cGy and 2400 cGy subjects in all measures. 2400 cGy patients had deficiencies in IQ and academic performance. 1800 cGy patients scored approximately 12 points higher than 2400 cGy children. Eleven children, two in the control group, two in the 1800 cGy, and seven in the 2400 cGy group had IQ scores of less than 90. Eight of the nine irradiated children with deficits had radiotherapy before age 5. These results indicate a mild, but diffuse information processing deficit in children who received 2400 cGy, but not in children who received 1800 cGy. These findings with a minimum of 6 years of follow-up provide new information on late effects of CNS prophylaxis in ALL. Reducing the cranial RT dose from 2400 cGy to 1800 cGy reduced neurotoxicity to acceptable levels.","['Halberg, F E', 'Kramer, J H', 'Moore, I M', 'Wara, W M', 'Matthay, K K', 'Ablin, A R']","['Halberg FE', 'Kramer JH', 'Moore IM', 'Wara WM', 'Matthay KK', 'Ablin AR']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California, San Francisco 94143.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,IM,"['Brain/*radiation effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Cognition/*radiation effects', 'Cognition Disorders/etiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*prevention & control/radiotherapy', '*Radiotherapy Dosage']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1992;22(1):13-6. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(92)90976-o.,"['0360-3016(92)90976-O [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(92)90976-o [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells can be detected readily after in vitro activation of peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBML) with interleukin-2 (IL-2). In the present study, we demonstrated that IL-2-activated PBML preferentially lyse bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1)-infected cells and that the cell responsible for the lysis copurified with the cell responsible for lysis of K562. The IL-2-activated effector cells were capable of significant reducing virus production. The reduction in virus yield seemed to be by an interferon (IFN)-independent mechanism, as the amount of IFN induced in effector cells by BHV-1 was not altered by the addition of IL-2. Furthermore, enrichment of cytotoxic cells by passage through nylon wool columns removed the capability of PBML to produce IFN in response to the virus. These results suggest that activation of LAK mechanisms in cattle plays a role in controlling virus spread.","['Campos, M', 'Ohmann, H B', 'Rapin, N', 'Babiuk, L A']","['Campos M', 'Ohmann HB', 'Rapin N', 'Babiuk LA']","['Veterinary Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO), Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Viral Immunol,Viral immunology,8801552,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', '*Herpesvirus 1, Bovine/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferons/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Kidney', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virus Replication']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Viral Immunol. 1991 Winter;4(4):259-68. doi: 10.1089/vim.1991.4.259.,['10.1089/vim.1991.4.259 [doi]'],"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings suggest that some factors intrinsic to the neoplasm might favour, in a different degree, the re-expression of HbF, which, in turn, would not necessarily mean a reversion to the foctal stages since the correlation of the gamma chains was similar to the adult pattern in 50% of the cases studied.","['Ibarra, B', 'Montes, J', 'Becerra, C', 'Prea, F J', 'Barros-Nunez, P', 'Aguilar-Luna, J C', 'Arroyo, J']","['Ibarra B', 'Montes J', 'Becerra C', 'Prea FJ', 'Barros-Nunez P', 'Aguilar-Luna JC', 'Arroyo J']","['Division de Genetica, CMO, IMSS, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.']",['spa'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/*analysis', 'Globins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Lymphoma/blood', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*blood']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1991 Oct;36(5):383-6.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)']",Hemoglobina fetal en ninos con diferentes neoplasias.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of circulating progenitors from the peripheral blood as autografts might have some important advantages, since leukaphereses are better tolerable than a BM harvest, could be done immediately following chemotherapy, are possible in patients with previous irradiation to the pelvis and might be less contaminated with malignant progenitor cells. We have shown that monitoring transplants with the relatively simple in vitro assay for myeloid progenitor cells is predictive for hematopoietic recovery in animal models as well as in the clinical setting. Moreover, stem cells harvested during repeated leukapheresis were able to repopulate permanently the irradiated BM. Using recombinant human granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor, large quantities of progenitor cells can be mobilized into the peripheral blood and collected for autotransplantation, in particular if used directly following chemotherapy. Cell separation studies showed that a bone marrow/blood barrier retains some subpopulations of progenitor cells which might lead to the preferential circulation of normal stem cells following chemotherapy. Methods are described to distinguish normal and leukemic progenitor cells which will help in the future to assay autografts both for their repopulating ability and their contamination with tumor cells.","['Gerhartz, H']",['Gerhartz H'],"['Med.

The free substance is cleared relatively quickly from the organism both after intravenous and intraperitoneal administration (t1/2 0.17 and 2.41 h, respectively), and is excreted predominantly via the urinary tract. In contrast, following entrapment in small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) or multilamellar vesicles (MLV), the 57Co radioactivity remains 7- to 30-fold longer in the blood stream and is detectable in considerable amounts in liver, spleen, lung and tumor of the RS model even after 48 h. Concomitantly, the renal excretion is diminished to about 50% of the free drug and the feces excretion is slightly increased, possibly due to the higher concentrations in the liver. Whereas the renal levels of radioactivity were similar with all application forms of [57Co]Bleomycin, there were marked differences in all the other tissues studied. After administration of SUV there was a higher activity in liver, brain and tumor, whereas MLV were more concentrated in spleen and lung.

One of the factors involved in this activity, ADR, appears to be a greater than 90 kDa heat-labile protease. Cytoplasmic extracts prepared from nonproliferating lymphocytes express little to no ADR activity. However, ADR activity can be generated in these extracts by brief exposure to a membrane-enriched fraction of spontaneously proliferating, leukemic human T lymphoblastoid (MOLT-4) cells. This suggests that ADR activity is present in the resting cytoplasm in an inactive or precursor form. This in vitro generation of ADR activity can be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the isoquinolinesulfonamide derivative, H-7 (1-(5-isoquinoline-sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride), an inhibitor of both cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinases and protein kinase C (PKC). However, more specific inhibitors of cAMP-dependent protein kinases, including N-[( 2-methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride (H8) and N-(2-gua-nidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (HA-1004), had little to no effect on the in vitro generation of ADR activity. Furthermore, membranes from MOLT-4 cells depleted of PKC by long-term exposure (24 h) to phorbol esters and calcium ionophores were unable to induce ADR activity in resting peripheral blood lymphocytes extracts. The results of these studies suggest 1) ADR activity is present in resting cell cytoplasm in an inactive or precursor form; and 2) ADR activity can be induced in this resting cytoplasm through a mechanism involving a membrane-associated protein kinase, possibly PKC. The ability of alkaline phosphatase to deplete the activity of preformed ADR suggests the possibility that ADR itself is phosphoprotein.","['Autieri, M V', 'Fresa, K L', 'Coffman, F D', 'Katz, M E', 'Cohen, S']","['Autieri MV', 'Fresa KL', 'Coffman FD', 'Katz ME', 'Cohen S']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hahnemann University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19102.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Regul,Cell regulation,9005331,IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Aprotinin/pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Membranes/metabolism', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Precursors/metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', '*Sulfonamides']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Regul. 1990 Dec;1(13):1015-25. doi: 10.1091/mbc.1.13.1015.,['10.1091/mbc.1.13.1015 [doi]'],"['0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', '84478-11-5 (N-(2-(methylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide)', '9087-70-1 (Aprotinin)', '91742-10-8 (N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide)', '99534-03-9 (IP 20)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (activator of DNA replication)']",,,['CA-39723/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC361699,,,,,,,,,

However, FK-506 was active on a broader range of concentrations than CsA, particularly because of direct cytostatic effects of CsA which appeared at concentrations only slightly higher than those required to show a significant resistance-modulating activity.","['Pourtier-Manzanedo, A', 'Boesch, D', 'Loor, F']","['Pourtier-Manzanedo A', 'Boesch D', 'Loor F']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie, Universite Louis Pasteur Strasbourg, Illkirch, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,IM,"['Amiodarone/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Tacrolimus/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1991 Jun;2(3):279-83. doi: 10.1097/00001813-199106000-00010.,['10.1097/00001813-199106000-00010 [doi]'],"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'N3RQ532IUT (Amiodarone)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the cells are grown in serum-containing medium, no u-PA activity can be found in the medium but active u-PA is found bound to the cell surface where it can generate bound plasmin. This distribution of u-PA activity was shown to be, first, the net result of slow inactivation of free active u-PA by serum inhibitor(s) and simultaneous rapid uptake of u-PA onto the cell surface. Binding to cells was at least six times faster than inactivation by 10% serum. The principal serum inhibitor of u-PA was identified as alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M), and prior inactivation of u-PA by purified human alpha 2M was also shown to prevent uptake of u-PA activity onto cells. Second, although endogenous u-PA could form covalent complexes with purified alpha 2M in the culture medium of RC2A cells, covalent alpha 2M complexes were not formed by u-PA on the cell surface; the u-PA taken up in this compartment was protected against alpha 2M inhibition. u-PA anchored to plastic surfaces via monoclonal antibodies to the amino-terminal region of u-PA was also protected against alpha 2M, suggesting that the protection of cell surface u-PA results from a steric effect. These results provide evidence as to how the active u-PA produced by leukemia cells can contribute to proteolytic activity on their cell surface in the presence of serum inhibitors.","['Stephens, R W', 'Tapiovaara, H', 'Reisberg, T', 'Bizik, J', 'Vaheri, A']","['Stephens RW', 'Tapiovaara H', 'Reisberg T', 'Bizik J', 'Vaheri A']","['Department of Virology, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Regul,Cell regulation,9005331,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Plasminogen Activators/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*metabolism', 'alpha-Macroglobulins/*metabolism']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Regul. 1991 Dec;2(12):1057-65. doi: 10.1091/mbc.2.12.1057.,['10.1091/mbc.2.12.1057 [doi]'],"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (alpha-Macroglobulins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)', 'U5NH2JV64T (saruplase)']",,,,,PMC361905,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS: The risk of secondary acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) was assessed in 552 patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD), who were diagnosed at the Hematology Institute of Bologna from 1970 through 1984 and followed-up through July, 1990. Median follow-up time was 12 years. RESULTS: ANLL developed in 14 of 328 patients treated with the combined modality of extended-field radiotherapy (RT) plus chemotherapy (CT). All ANLL was observed in patients who had received the mechlorethamine-vincristine-procarbazione-prednisone (MOPP) regimen. No ANLL was documented among 115 patients treated with RT alone, nor among the 109 given CT alone. Leukemia, which developed 34-184 months after diagnosis of HD, was always preceded by a preleukemic phase and was fatal (after 1-12 months) to 13 patients. The karyotype of the leukemia cells was studied in 11 of the 14 patients and was always abnormal. CONCLUSIONS: A Cox's Linear Logistic Model that was performed did not demonstrate that the treatment categories, age, sex, and splenectomy were prognostic factors. Because all ANLL was observed in patients who were treated with extended-field RT plus MOPP and who had undergone splenectomies at diagnosis of HD, further research with larger numbers of patients and longer follow-up should be pursued. Thus with such additional data, clinicians could come to appreciate fully the statistical significance of our interesting observations.","['Zinzani, P L', 'Fiacchini, M', 'Mazza, P', 'Gherlinzoni, F', 'Bocchia, M', 'Tura, S']","['Zinzani PL', 'Fiacchini M', 'Mazza P', 'Gherlinzoni F', 'Bocchia M', 'Tura S']","['Istituto di Ematologia, L. e A.

Feline leukemia virus infection of 3201 cells, an FeLV-negative lymphoma cell line, was inhibited by greater than 70% at a concentration of only 1 microM PFA and by greater than 90% at concentrations of 64 to 256 microM PFA, as evidenced by RT activity. However, FeLV antigen expression by 3201 cells remained relatively constant over noncytotoxic concentrations of PFA. Because the persistence of viral antigen expression with concomitant suppression of RT activity appears to be unique and because 3201 cells express small amounts of an endogenous retrovirus (RD-114) and contain endogenous FeLV proviral sequences, a possible role of endogenous retroviruses acting as helper viruses was suggested. Feline leukemia virus infection of 81C cells, a sarcoma-positive, leukemia-negative fibroblast cell line, was inhibited by greater than 50% at a concentration of 64 microM PFA and by greater than 98% at concentrations of 256 to 512 microM PFA, as indicated by suppression of focus formation. The feline lymphoid cell line FL-74 is a large producer of FeLV. When FL-74 cells were cultured in the presence of 256 microM PFA, virus production (virus budding and viral antigen) was not affected, but progeny virus lost RT activity and infectivity. Direct addition of PFA (256 microM) to FeLV also reduced RT activity and infectivity. These data indicate that PFA can directly and rapidly inactivate retrovirus independent of cellular processing, presumably by inhibiting RT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Swenson, C L', 'Polas, P J', 'Cheney, C M', 'Kociba, G J', 'Mathes, L E']","['Swenson CL', 'Polas PJ', 'Cheney CM', 'Kociba GJ', 'Mathes LE']","['Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,0375011,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/drug effects', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cats', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Foscarnet', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*drug effects/enzymology/immunology', 'Lymphoma', 'Phosphonoacetic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/toxicity', '*Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Vet Res. 1991 Dec;52(12):2010-5.,,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '364P9RVW4X (Foscarnet)', 'N919E46723 (Phosphonoacetic Acid)']",,,"['DK 41939/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-AI-62525/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The -117 mutation was found to cause over-expression and confer inducibility of a retrovirally transferred gamma-globin gene in cytosine arabinoside (araC)-treated KMOE cells in an earlier study.

However, many questions remain. What is the mechanism that couples growth-factor binding to the triggering of cellular proliferation? How do multi-CSF and GM-CSF cross-compete at the level of the cell-surface receptor, and yet show no primary amino acid sequence homology? What are the mechanisms that regulate the tissue expression profile of multi-CSF compared to the genetically similar growth factor GM-CSF? And, what are the optimal dosages, schedules of administration, and combinations of CSFs optimal for each of several conditions of marrow failure?

Defined purified glycopeptides, as components of neoglycoproteins, offer the possibility of increasing their structural complexity and, thereby, their receptor selectivity. To test the feasibility of this approach, the glycopeptide man6-glcNAc2-asparagine derived from ovalbumin was purified after pronase digestion. It was coupled to bovine serum albumin as carrier protein with the homobifunctional linking agent bis-(sulphosuccinimidyl)suberate to yield the diglycosylated concanavalin A-reactive product. Following biotinylation, it was used to detect mannose-specific binding sites in fixed cells of seven human leukemia or lymphoma lines and in fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of human breast cancer. In comparison to chemically mannosylated bovine serum albumin with ten sites of glycosylation or to ovalbumin, this derivative produced a similar pattern of reaction with a quantitatively lower extent of staining in most cases. Remarkably, the presence of potential endogenous ligands for the detected receptor sites was ascertained using the plant lectin concanavalin A. Thus, the conjugation of a purified, deliberately selected glycopeptide to a suitable carrier produces a histochemical tool for detecting glycopeptide-specific binding sites.","['Gabius, H J', 'Brinck, U', 'Lusebrink, T', 'Ciesiolka, T', 'Gabius, S']","['Gabius HJ', 'Brinck U', 'Lusebrink T', 'Ciesiolka T', 'Gabius S']","['Max-Planck-Institut fur experimentelle Medizin, Abteilung Chemie, Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Histochem J,The Histochemical journal,0163161,IM,"['Asparagine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry', 'Binding Sites', 'Biotin/chemistry', 'Breast Neoplasms/chemistry', 'Cell Line', 'Concanavalin A/chemistry', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Mannose/*metabolism', 'Oligosaccharides/*chemistry', 'Pronase/metabolism', '*Serum Albumin', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/chemistry', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Succinimides/chemistry', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Histochem J. 1991 Jul;23(7):303-11. doi: 10.1007/BF01044961.,['10.1007/BF01044961 [doi]'],"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '0 (Succinimides)', '0 (mannose-bovine serum albumin conjugate)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '39114-02-8 ((mannose)6-(N-acetylglucosamine)2-asparagine)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'E647932J7Z (bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Pronase)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Competitive binding experiments were carried out using the human myelomonocytic cell line RC-2A. mAb B2B1 and 2BD4 did not cross block. mAb 5A2.G5 partly inhibited binding of 2BD4 but not B2B1. Thus the epitopes identified by 5A2.G5 and 2BD4 appear to overlap but to be quite separate from that recognized by B2B1. All 3 antibodies bound to a 130 kDa species on Western blots after nonreducing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of platelet lysates. Culture of RC-2A cells in the presence of tunicamycin (after removal of surface antigens by pronase) blocked re-expression of the epitopes recognised by all 3 mAb suggesting that they involve N-linked glycosylation. Furthermore, treatment of platelet lysates with Endoglycosidase F prior to electrophoresis and Western blotting abolished the binding of the mAb but not a rabbit polyclonal antiserum to CD31. Nevertheless, neuraminidase treatment of RC-2A cells failed to affect mAb binding. The antibodies displayed typical properties of CD31 antibodies in that all 3 precipitated at 130 kDa cell surface protein and bound strongly to platelets, monocytes, neutrophils and vascular endothelium. All 3 antibodies were positive on hemopoietic progenitor cells which give rise to colonies in the CFU-C assay. However, differences in binding to peripheral blood lymphocytes and to certain human leukemic cell lines were noted. In particular, mAb 5A2.G5 bound weakly to lymphocytes and to the lymphoid cell line HSB-2 compared with the other 2 antibodies.","['Ashman, L K', 'Aylett, G W', 'Cambareri, A C', 'Cole, S R']","['Ashman LK', 'Aylett GW', 'Cambareri AC', 'Cole SR']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Adelaide, South Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'L Cells', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 1991 Nov;38(5):199-207. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0039.1991.tb01898.x.,['10.1111/j.1399-0039.1991.tb01898.x [doi]'],"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic potential in the chemotherapy of cancer.",690-719,"Idarubicin is a 4-demethoxy-anthracycline analogue of daunorubicin which, when administered intravenously in combination with cytarabine, has therapeutic efficacy superior to that of standard induction and salvage treatment regimens in acute myelogenous leukaemia. Idarubicin alone or in combination regimens has also been effective in limited studies in patients with other acute leukaemias, advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Idarubicin is more lipophilic than its parent drug daunorubicin. It intercalates DNA, induces DNA strand breaks and delays cell cycle progression. Leucopenia is often dose-limiting in patients with solid tumours treated with idarubicin, and most other adverse effects are similar in incidence and severity to those experienced with other anthracycline cytotoxic agents, except for alopecia which appears to occur with a reduced incidence and severity. Cardiotoxic effects have been reported with idarubicin as with other anthracyclines, but animal data and preliminary clinical findings suggest the possibility of reduced cardiotoxicity with idarubicin--a potentially important advantage if confirmed on further study. A maximum cumulative dose of idarubicin beyond which the incidence of cardiotoxicity rapidly increases has not been determined. Thus, intravenous idarubicin is a useful alternative to other anthracyclines (particularly in combination with cytarabine) in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukaemia, and there is some evidence that it is less cardiotoxic than other anthracycline drugs. Further studies are required to establish the use of intravenous idarubicin as a replacement for other intravenous anthracyclines, especially its effect on response duration and survival, and to confirm the evidence of reduced cardiotoxic effects. The role of idarubicin as consolidation and maintenance therapy for various malignancies requires further investigation, as does the potential use of oral idarubicin which is currently under development.","['Hollingshead, L M', 'Faulds, D']","['Hollingshead LM', 'Faulds D']","['Adis International Limited, Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drugs. 1991 Oct;42(4):690-719. doi: 10.2165/00003495-199142040-00010.,['10.2165/00003495-199142040-00010 [doi]'],['ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)'],,178,,,,,,,,,,,,

A basis for drug selection?,569-605,"A free radical is any species capable of independent existence that contains one or more unpaired electrons. Free radical reactions have been implicated in the pathology of more than 50 human diseases. Radicals and other reactive oxygen species are formed constantly in the human body, both by deliberate synthesis (e.g. by activated phagocytes) and by chemical side-reactions. They are removed by enzymic and nonenzymic antioxidant defence systems. Oxidative stress, occurring when antioxidant defences are inadequate, can damage lipids, proteins, carbohydrates and DNA. A few clinical conditions are caused by oxidative stress, but more often the stress results from the disease. Sometimes it then makes a significant contribution to the disease pathology, and sometimes it does not. Several antioxidants are available for therapeutic use. They include molecules naturally present in the body [superoxide dismutase (SOD), alpha-tocopherol, glutathione and its precursors, ascorbic acid, adenosine, lactoferrin and carotenoids] as well as synthetic antioxidants [such as thiols, ebselen (PZ51), xanthine oxidase inhibitors, inhibitors of phagocyte function, iron ion chelators and probucol]. The therapeutic efficacy of SOD, alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid in the treatment of human disease is generally unimpressive to date although dietary deficiencies of the last two molecules should certainly be avoided. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors may be of limited relevance as antioxidants for human use. Exciting preliminary results with probucol (antiatherosclerosis), ebselen (anti-inflammatory), and iron ion chelators (in thalassaemia, leukaemia, malaria, stroke, traumatic brain injury and haemorrhagic shock) need to be confirmed by controlled clinical trials. Clinical testing of N-acetylcysteine in HIV-1-positive subjects may also be merited. A few drugs already in clinical use may have some antioxidant properties, but this ability is not widespread and drug-derived radicals may occasionally cause significant damage.","['Halliwell, B']",['Halliwell B'],"['Pulmonary Medicine, UC Davis Medical Center, Sacramento.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Free Radicals', 'Humans']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drugs. 1991 Oct;42(4):569-605. doi: 10.2165/00003495-199142040-00003.,['10.2165/00003495-199142040-00003 [doi]'],"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Free Radicals)']",,233,,,PMC7102057,,,,,,,,,

The genes coding for platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGFA) have been localized to 5q31-32 and 5q31.3-33.2, respectively. These genes fall in the region of chromosome 5 which is deleted in the 5q- refractory anemia syndrome (5q-RA) and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). We have characterized this region in a 5q- patient with therapy-related ANLL (t-ANLL) by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting analysis utilizing DNA probes for PDGFR, c-fms, and FGFA. A single 300 kbp M1uI restriction fragment was detected in the patient using a PDGFR probe as compared to a 200 kbp fragment in normal controls. BssHII digestions also showed restriction fragment length difference. Similar data for both M1uI and BssHII digestions were also obtained when c-fms was used as a probe. Southern blotting analysis of EcoRI-digested DNA showed that each of the PDGFR, c-fms, and FGFA alleles were deleted. These results suggested that one chromosome 5 has a large deletion involving PDGFR, c-fms and FGFA, which is consistent with the cytogenetic analysis of the patient. In contrast, the other chromosome 5, which appeared normal cytogenetically, may have a smaller deletion (or alteration) in proximity to but not involving any of these 3 genes.","['Thornton, D E', 'Theil, K', 'Payson, R', 'Balcerzak, S P', 'Chiu, I M']","['Thornton DE', 'Theil K', 'Payson R', 'Balcerzak SP', 'Chiu IM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Ohio State University, Davis Medical Research Center, Columbus 43210.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Med Genet,American journal of medical genetics,7708900,IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Refractory/genetics', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor', 'Restriction Mapping']",1991/12/15 00:00,1991/12/15 00:01,['1991/12/15 00:00'],"['1991/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med Genet. 1991 Dec 15;41(4):557-65. doi: 10.1002/ajmg.1320410437.,['10.1002/ajmg.1320410437 [doi]'],"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '104781-85-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",,,"['K04 CA01369/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA45611/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09388/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,"['FGFA', 'PDGFR', 'c-fms']",,,,,,,

Ten daily administrations of rhG-CSF following CY prolonged the survival time of leukemic mice more than either agent alone. Hematological examination indicated that this effect was attributable to suppression with rhG-CSF of the leukemic repopulation after CY injection. In addition, rhG-CSF accelerated recovery from CY-induced neutropenia. Based on these hematological changes, a treatment regimen was established consisting of a single injection of CY on day 1 and daily injections of rhG-CSF on days 2-6; this combination treatment was given to the leukemic mice for up to four cycles, with a pause of one day between each cycle. The leukemic mice completed each cycle of treatment with few failures, and it resulted in a long survival time for the leukemic mice. The mean survival time of the mice receiving four cycles of treatment was 47 days, 30 days longer than that of the untreated mice. Hematological examination performed at the end of each cycle showed that the leukemic cell population was controlled at a level equal to or below the pre-treatment level, and peripheral blood neutrophils were maintained at a level equal to or above the normal level. These results indicate the possible effectiveness of combining rhG-CSF with chemotherapeutic drugs in controlling leukemic cell growth, and the effectiveness of rhG-CSF in enhancing neutrophil recovery after chemotherapy. However, it was found that the leukemic cells became resistant to treatment with rhG-CSF after four cycles of combination treatment, suggesting that great care should be taken in the clinical application of rhG-CSF, even when the growth of acute myelogenous leukemia cells is not apparently stimulated by it.","['Tamura, M', 'Nomura, H', 'Ono, M', 'Bessho, M', 'Hirashima, K']","['Tamura M', 'Nomura H', 'Ono M', 'Bessho M', 'Hirashima K']","['Fuji-Gotemba Research Laboratories, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.

In situ hybridization to normal bone marrow and peripheral blood leukocytes demonstrated that the gene was expressed in the promyelocytes at a approximately two fold greater level than in the segmented neutrophils and the expression decreased as the granulocytes matured. The ratio of expression in the other leukocytes to expression in the segmented neutrophils were as follows: eosinophils/basophils approximately 7; monocytes approximately 2; lymphocytes less than 1. Expression of the HpPG gene during myeloblast differentiation was assessed by Northern blot analysis of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) RNA samples. The expression of this gene, when compared to the levels in HL-60 cells, was approximately ten fold lower in the poorly differentiated blast cells obtained from three AML patients classified M""0"". Conversely, the expression in the more differentiated blast cells obtained from 10 of 11 AML patients classified as M1 and M2 were at levels similar to the levels in HL-60 cells. The expression level found in eight lymphoid leukemias was approximately ten fold or more lower than in HL-60 cells. Gene copy number determination confirmed that the HpPG gene is present in one copy per haploid genome. Thus the HpPG gene's expression pattern denotes a single copy gene being differentially expressed during hematopoiesis with initial regulation occurring very early in this developmental process and an additional up-regulatory event occurring during granule genesis.","['Stellrecht, C M', 'Mars, W M', 'Miwa, H', 'Beran, M', 'Saunders, G F']","['Stellrecht CM', 'Mars WM', 'Miwa H', 'Beran M', 'Saunders GF']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,IM,"['Aggrecans', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Leukocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Multigene Family/genetics', 'Neutrophils/cytology/metabolism', '*Proteoglycans', 'RNA/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 1991 Nov;48(2):127-35. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-0436.1991.tb00251.x.,"['S0301-4681(11)60289-2 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1432-0436.1991.tb00251.x [doi]']","['0 (Aggrecans)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",,,,,,,['HpPG'],,,,,,,

Kidney tissue from a number of selected rodent studies held in the National Toxicology Program (NTP) or Food and Drug Administration (FDA) archives were evaluated for hyaline droplet accumulation in proximal tubules. The survey concentrated on rats and mice of both sexes bearing hematopoietic tumors, as our preliminary observations had suggested this direction of study. The tissues of 101 Sprague-Dawley, 25 Osborne-Mendel, and 70 Fischer 344 rats and 96 B6C3F1 mice were examined. These animals provided an assortment of tumors including histiocytic sarcoma, lymphocytic lymphoma, mononuclear cell leukemia, and sarcoma. Hyaline droplet accumulation, primarily involving the P2 segment of proximal tubules, was diagnosed in 96% of rats with histiocytic sarcoma (74/77 cases in Sprague-Dawley, 17/18 in Osborne-Mendels, 7/7 in Fischers) and in 55% of B6C3F1 mice with histiocytic sarcoma (18/33 cases). There appeared to be a qualitative correlation between hyaline droplet accumulation and degree of tumor burden. Thus, in cases negative for hyaline droplets, the tumor was often confined to a single location, while increasing involvement of proximal segments beyond P2 occurred with more extensive multi-organ dissemination of the tumor. By immunohistochemistry on 11 cases of rat and 8 cases of mouse histiocytic sarcoma, the protein in hyaline droplets was identified as lysozyme, a known major secretory product of monocytes and macrophages. The hyaline droplets were negative for alpha 1-antitrypsin, alpha 2u-globulin, rat or mouse immunoglobulin, and albumin. More sparsely scattered droplets and granules present in proximal tubules of Fischer rats with mononuclear cell leukemia were negative for lysozyme but positive for either iron or lipofuscin pigment. The study establishes a clear association between renal tubule hyaline droplet and lysozyme accumulation in rats and mice with histiocytic sarcoma. Hyaline droplets secondary to neoplasia should be distinguished from chemically-induced hyaline droplet nephropathy in the male rat involving alpha 2u-globulin.","['Hard, G C', 'Snowden, R T']","['Hard GC', 'Snowden RT']","['MRC Toxicology Unit, Carshalton, Surrey, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Toxicol Pathol,Toxicologic pathology,7905907,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Hyalin/*metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Kidney Neoplasms/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Kidney Tubules, Proximal/*metabolism', 'Lipofuscin/metabolism', 'Male', 'Muramidase/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Staining and Labeling/methods']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicol Pathol. 1991;19(2):88-97. doi: 10.1177/019262339101900202.,['10.1177/019262339101900202 [doi]'],"['0 (Lipofuscin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",,,,,,,,['Toxicol Pathol. 1991;19(4 Pt 2):670-1.

More recently, in vivo IL-2 therapy was shown to induce complete or partial remission in some cases of relapsed chemotherapy-resistant acute myeloid leukemia. We have investigated the phenotypic modifications of bone marrow cells obtained from five patients with acute myeloid leukemia in relapse receiving high-dose i.v. rIL-2. We found that, in three of five patients, IL-2 could induce, in vivo, an increase in the expression of CD54/ICAM-1 and to a lesser extent of CD58/LFA-3 on bone marrow leukemic blasts. This demonstrates that rIL-2 modifies directly or indirectly the expression of the cell surface molecules of the tumor cells themselves. Upregulation of such adhesion molecules could account for the enhancement of cell interactions between the tumor and effector cells such as T, natural killer, and phagocytic cells as well as being indicators of differentiation signaling.","['Olive, D', 'Lopez, M', 'Blaise, D', 'Viens, P', 'Stoppa, A M', 'Brandely, M', 'Mawas, C', 'Mannoni, P', 'Maraninchi, D']","['Olive D', 'Lopez M', 'Blaise D', 'Viens P', 'Stoppa AM', 'Brandely M', 'Mawas C', 'Mannoni P', 'Maraninchi D']","['INSERM U. 119, Cancerologie et Therapeutique Experimentales, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunother (1991),Journal of immunotherapy : official journal of the Society for Biological Therapy,9102704,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/*metabolism', 'CD58 Antigens', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Interleukin-2/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunother (1991). 1991 Dec;10(6):412-7. doi: 10.1097/00002371-199112000-00004.,['10.1097/00002371-199112000-00004 [doi]'],"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD58 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was no significant differences seen in the total amount of MTX plus polyglutamates measured between ANLL and ALL blasts, indicating that transport defects do not account for intrinsic MTX resistance in ANLL. However, there were significant differences between the amounts of long chain MTX polyglutamates found in ANLL cells as compared to ALL cells. Most, but not all, ANLL blasts were unable to form long chain polyglutamates. In as much as the level of MTX polyglutamates found in blast cells after MTX administration allows for retention of this drug, this property may explain, at least in part, the refractoriness of most patients with ANLL to methotrexate.","['Lin, J T', 'Tong, W P', 'Trippett, T M', 'Niedzwiecki, D', 'Tao, Y', 'Tan, C', 'Steinherz, P', 'Schweitzer, B I', 'Bertino, J R']","['Lin JT', 'Tong WP', 'Trippett TM', 'Niedzwiecki D', 'Tao Y', 'Tan C', 'Steinherz P', 'Schweitzer BI', 'Bertino JR']","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Methotrexate/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Middle Aged', 'Polyglutamic Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1991;15(12):1191-6. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(91)90189-z.,['10.1016/0145-2126(91)90189-z [doi]'],"['25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Non-toxic concentrations of Indo were found to enhance the sensitivity to VP-16 in cultured Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), YAC-1, P815, CCRF-CEM and K562 cells which were all relatively sensitive to VP-16. With the LLC, the Indo effect was dose dependent and near maximal at an Indo concentration of 0.5 micrograms/ml. Indo also increased the response of LLC cells to methotrexate, but not to bleomycin. Ibuprofen was less effective than Indo in enhancing VP-16 sensitivity in LLC cells. The enhanced sensitivity of VP-16 by Indo was not reversed by the prostaglandins PGE2 and PGD2, the analogs carbocyclic thromboxane A2 and carba-prostacyclin or conditioned medium removed after 24 h or 48 h of culture from near confluent LLC cell monolayers. This finding suggests that Indo is not augmenting VP-16 cytotoxicity by inhibiting cyclo-oxygenase activity and prostaglandin production. The lipoxygenase inhibitor, eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), was also ineffective in reversing the Indo augmentation of VP-16 sensitivity. This finding indicates that Indo is not acting by inhibiting cyclo-oxygenase and converting larger amounts of arachidonic acid to lipoxygenase products, such as leukotrienes, that could then interact with VP-16 to increase its sensitivity. In other studies, Indo was found to significantly increase the steady state accumulation of [3H]-VP-16 in all five cell lines studied. With the LLC cells, this increased steady state was achieved within 15 min after the addition of Indo to these cells and this enhanced VP-16 uptake was not reversed by the addition of prostaglandin E2 or prostaglandin D2. Thus, taken together, these studies indicate that Indo most likely enhances the cytotoxicity of VP-16 by increasing the cellular accumulation of VP-16. This newly identified function of Indo may be of potential clinical significance in the treatment of cancers in man.","['Maca, R D']",['Maca RD'],"['Department of Medicine, Overton Brooks Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Shreveport, Louisiana 71101-4295.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,IM,"['Animals', 'Bleomycin/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Indomethacin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Prostaglandins/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1991 Nov;6(5):453-66.,,"['0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Prostaglandins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested that the physiological consequences of strenuous exercise are analogous to those of the acute-phase response. 2. In 70 male and 20 female competitive distance runners, a marked, but transient, neutrophil leucocytosis occurred immediately after these athletes completed a standard (42 km) marathon race. Concomitant significant increases were noted in the plasma cortisol levels, creatine kinase activity, C-reactive protein level, total protein level and albumin level (P less than 0.01). 3. The plasma fibrinogen, C-reactive protein and total protein concentrations were markedly increased both 24 h and 48 h after exercise (P less than 0.01). The serum haptoglobin level was significantly decreased after exercise (P less than 0.01), and increased 48 h later (P less than 0.05). There was no change in the serum iron level, total iron-binding capacity, per cent saturation of transferrin and serum ferritin level. 4. A significant increase in interleukin-1-type activity was demonstrated immediately and 24 h after exercise (P less than 0.01). 5. It is concluded that the metabolic sequelae of sustained exercise are similar, but not analogous, to the acute-phase response, and interleukin-1, probably plays a significant role in linking the haematological and immunological changes observed after sustained strenuous exercise.","['Weight, L M', 'Alexander, D', 'Jacobs, P']","['Weight LM', 'Alexander D', 'Jacobs P']","['University of Cape Town Leukemia Center, South Africa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Sci (Lond),"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",7905731,IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/metabolism', 'Acute-Phase Reaction/*physiopathology', 'Adult', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', 'Creatine Kinase/blood', 'Exercise/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/blood', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism', 'Iron/blood', 'Male', '*Running', 'Time Factors']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Sci (Lond). 1991 Nov;81(5):677-83. doi: 10.1042/cs0810677.,['10.1042/cs0810677 [doi]'],"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 2.7.3.2 (Creatine Kinase)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A useful marker for acute monocytic and megakaryocytic leukemias.,395-403,"We investigated the expression of CD56 (a neural cell adhesion molecule, NCAM) and CD57 in various hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic malignant cells, using Leu-19 and Leu-7 monoclonal antibodies. Although both molecules are commonly defined as a natural killer cell marker, we found that CD56 was highly expressed on blasts from patients with acute monocytic (4/6) and megakaryocytic (3/3) leukemias. In the latter, FACS two-color analysis revealed that leukemic megakaryoblasts simultaneously expressed CD56 and platelet-related antigens. Among leukemic cell lines, one myelocytic, three monocytic, and two megakaryocytic lines were positive for CD56. On the other hand, except for one large granular lymphocytic leukemia and one multiple myeloma cell line, none of the lymphoid leukemia cell lines or lymphoblasts from patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (0/15), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (0/2), and central nervous system (CNS) leukemia (0/2) reacted with Leu-19 antibody for CD56. The expression of CD56 in leukemia cells was not significantly affected by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). By contrast, all hematopoietic materials were negative for CD57, while non-hematopoietic neuroblastoma cell lines expressed this molecule (4/5) as well as CD56 (5/5). Cytogenetically, the NCAM gene is located at chromosome 11q23, and chromosome breaks were often observed at this location in various leukemias. Blasts from all five acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) patients and cell lines with 11q23-proximal chromosomal breaks were positive, while those from one ALL patient with an 11q23 abnormality were negative for CD56, necessitating further studies to clarify the link between the 11q23 abnormality and CD56 expression.","['Ikushima, S', 'Yoshihara, T', 'Matsumura, T', 'Misawa, S', 'Morioka, Y', 'Hibi, S', 'Imashuku, S']","['Ikushima S', 'Yoshihara T', 'Matsumura T', 'Misawa S', 'Morioka Y', 'Hibi S', 'Imashuku S']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Research Hospital, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'CD56 Antigen', 'CD57 Antigens', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Male', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/metabolism']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1991 Oct;54(5):395-403.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (CD57 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported that as NZB mice age they develop a clonal population of hyperdiploid CD5+B cells in the spleen. These cells can readily be transplanted into unirradiated recipients. The growth characteristics of such transplanted hyperdiploid NZB spleen cells were examined in different recipient strains to determine if the immunological status of the host environments affected the growth of the clonal CD5+B cells. Young NZB and NZB.xid recipients (lacking hyperdiploid CD5+B cells) allowed growth and expansion of unpassaged CD5+B cells derived from primary NZB mice. Similarly, (NZBxDBA/2) and (NZBxBALB/c) F1 recipients allowed for expansion of CD5+B cell clones from primary sources. In a separate experiment, T cell-depleted NZB spleen cells containing a hyperdiploid CD5+B cell clone were transferred to SCID mice. The SCID environment supported the growth of the primary clone. None of these recipients normally have elevated CD5+B cells, yet these recipients allowed growth of primary transferred hyperdiploid cells. However, a difference in the ability of these recipient strains in their ability to expand multiply passaged CD5+B cell clones was observed. These results indicate that while hyperdiploid CD5+B cells are difficult to be maintained in culture, they can readily be passaged in vivo. The host environment may provide growth factors or signals for endogenous growth factors. Although the CD5+B clones arise initially in a hyperactive autoimmune environment, a hyperimmune environment is not necessary to support their growth. Transferred CD5+B cells affect the recipient environment and reduce the percentages of normal B cells.","['Raveche, E S', 'Lin, T Z', 'Conroy, J', 'Tjio, J H', 'Steinberg, A D', 'Rudolfsky, U A', 'Phillips, J A']","['Raveche ES', 'Lin TZ', 'Conroy J', 'Tjio JH', 'Steinberg AD', 'Rudolfsky UA', 'Phillips JA']","['Dept. of Pathology, UMDNJ, New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Autoimmunity,Autoimmunity,8900070,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Antigens, Ly/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/transplantation', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Separation', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Inbred NZB', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitosis']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Autoimmunity. 1991;10(3):217-25. doi: 10.3109/08916939109001892.,['10.3109/08916939109001892 [doi]'],"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)']",,,['AI-29740/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we describe a 25-year-old patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who developed ARDS during the phase of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Subcutaneous administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) at doses of 300-600 micrograms/day led to a prompt increase of peripheral granulocyte counts. With resolution of neutropenia, respiratory function gradually improved, and mechanical ventilatory support was stopped after 2 weeks.

Charged polypeptides elicit strong immune responses, and cationized bovine serum albumin and other cationic proteins are significantly more immunogenic than their less charged counterparts. These phenomena may involve enhanced protein uptake by macrophages, resulting in greater processing and presentation of antigenic peptide-MHC complexes to T-cells. We compared macrophage cell-surface binding and uptake of native and cationized bovine serum albumin. Specific binding of [125I]cationized bovine serum albumin to THP-1 macrophages in vitro was 11-16 fold greater than for native albumin. Half-maximal inhibition of [125I]cationized albumin binding was observed at 10-7M ligand. The specificity of [125I]cationized bovine serum albumin binding and uptake was further studied in terms of competitive inhibition of proteolysis by proteins of varying charge content. Cationized bovine serum albumin, but not native albumin, inhibited proteolysis of [125I]cBSA. Calf thymus histones also inhibited cBSA degradation.

Two distinct types of DNA synthesis regulation in heterokaryons ""differentiated cell + proliferating cell"" were revealed: I. Neutrophils and nucleated erythrocytes efficiently prevented the entry of non-malignant proliferating cells nuclei into the S-period but usually failed to substantially inhibit the replication in malignant cells nuclei. Both ""mortal"" and immortalized proliferating cells activated the DNA synthesis in neutrophil and chicken erythrocyte nuclei. II. Macrophages did not influence the DNA synthesis in the nuclei of non-malignant cells in heterokaryons but drastically inhibited that in the nuclei of malignant cells. Only immortalized cells reactivated DNA synthesis in the nuclei of macrophages. These data show that the mechanisms maintaining differentiated cells in non-proliferating state are not uniform. Nucleated erythrocytes were shown to suppress the duplication of centrioles in partner cells. The possibility of the blockage of DNA replication upon the fusion of two proliferating cells (fibroblast + leukemia cell) was demonstrated for the first time in the present work. The influence of various oncogenes upon the regulation of DNA synthesis in heterokaryons was investigated in detail.

The human receptor for SCF/MGF is expressed in a subset of normal bone marrow progenitor cells, in leukemic myeloid cells, and in mast cells. In the present study, the effects of recombinant human growth regulators (IL-1 through -9, granulocyte-macrophage/granulocyte/macrophage-CSF, IFN, and TNF) on c-kit proto-oncogene product expression were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence, by using the anti-SCF/MGFR mAb YB5.B8, and Northern blot analyses, by using a c-kit oligonucleotide probe. Of all cytokines tested, IL-4 was found to down-regulate expression of YB5.B8 Ag in the human mast cell line HMC-1 (maximum inhibition, 51.05 +/- 16.36% mean fluorescence intensity of control; p less than 0.02), as well as in primary leukemic myeloid cells. IL-4 was also found to down-regulate expression of YB5.B8 Ag in normal enriched bone marrow progenitor cells. The effects of IL-4 on expression of YB8.B8 Ag in myeloid/mast cell progenitors was dose and time dependent (maximum effects observed on days 2 and/or 4, by using 50 U/ml of rIL-4) and could be neutralized by using anti-IL-4 mAb. Moreover, IL-4 was found to down-regulate expression of c-kit mRNA in leukemic myeloid cells as well as in HMC-1 cells. Together, these observations identify IL-4 as a regulator of c-kit proto-oncogene product expression in the human system. The effects of IL-4 on human hemopoietic progenitor cells and mast cells may be mediated in part through regulation of SCF/MGFR expression.","['Sillaber, C', 'Strobl, H', 'Bevec, D', 'Ashman, L K', 'Butterfield, J H', 'Lechner, K', 'Maurer, D', 'Bettelheim, P', 'Valent, P']","['Sillaber C', 'Strobl H', 'Bevec D', 'Ashman LK', 'Butterfield JH', 'Lechner K', 'Maurer D', 'Bettelheim P', 'Valent P']","['First Medical Department, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*analysis/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/chemistry/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor']",1991/12/15 00:00,1991/12/15 00:01,['1991/12/15 00:00'],"['1991/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1991 Dec 15;147(12):4224-8.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 30 cases of acute and chronic leukaemia, Ber-MAC3 staining was restricted to 15 myeloid leukaemias of M4 and M5 types. The tumour cells of two cases of true histiocytic malignancies were Ber-MAC3 positive, whereas those of all 280 malignancies of lymphocytic origin were negative. The latter included 52 cases of Hodgkin's disease and 41 cases of Ki-1 positive anaplastic large cell lymphomas which had previously been classified as true histiocytic lymphomas.

This advantage is often ameliorated or reversed in vivo by IFN alpha. Based upon earlier studies suggesting decreased adhesiveness of CML progenitor cells, we asked whether CML progenitor cells are deficient in their expression of the cytoadhesion molecule lymphocyte function antigen-3 (LFA-3, CD58) which is normally expressed on hematopoietic progenitors. Progenitor cells from untreated CML patients showed greatly reduced or absent LFA-3 expression, whereas progenitors from patients treated with IFN alpha in vivo or in vitro expressed surface LFA-3 at more normal levels. LFA-3-deficient CML progenitor cells were unable to stimulate normal regulatory proliferative responses in autologous T cells. We hypothesize that IFN alpha-sensitive LFA-3 deficiency reflects a cell surface cytoadhesion defect which may help explain adhesive abnormalities of CML progenitor cells in vitro and clonal proliferation in vivo.","['Upadhyaya, G', 'Guba, S C', 'Sih, S A', 'Feinberg, A P', 'Talpaz, M', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Deisseroth, A B', 'Emerson, S G']","['Upadhyaya G', 'Guba SC', 'Sih SA', 'Feinberg AP', 'Talpaz M', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Deisseroth AB', 'Emerson SG']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'CD58 Antigens', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1991 Dec;88(6):2131-6. doi: 10.1172/JCI115543.,['10.1172/JCI115543 [doi]'],"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD58 Antigens)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",,,['P01 CA 49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC295821,,,,,,,,,

We directly demonstrate the presence of hematopoietic progenitors in the EBs by employing an in vitro precursor assay. Colony-forming cells (CFC) of all myeloid lineages as well as bi- and multipotent (CFC-MIX) progenitors were readily identified, and a detailed time-course analysis of their appearance was performed. Despite a high frequency of CFC-MIX in vitro, we did not observe any spleen colony-forming cells (CFU-S) in vivo.

By immunophenotyping using four CD56 specific monoclonal antibodies and immunoprecipitation analysis we here confirm that the Leu 19 antigen expressed by myeloma plasma cells is identical to N-CAM and corresponds to the 145 kDa isoform. Because of the possible biological role of adhesion molecules on myeloma cells, we compared the expression of N-CAM with the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and the beta 1 and beta 2 integrins. By immunogold-silver staining of cytospin preparations of mononuclear cell suspensions, bone marrow plasma cells of 17 MM patients were analysed. Plasma cells expressed N-CAM (CD56) in 14 patients. ICAM-1 (CD54) in 16 patients, and beta 2 integrins (CD18) in eight patients. beta 1 integrins (CD29) were expressed in all patients. The expression of beta 2 integrins was always very weak while N-CAM, ICAM-1 and the beta 1 integrins showed a moderate to strong positivity. The plasma cells of five haematological normal individuals lacked significant N-CAM expression but were positive for ICAM-1 and both integrin subgroups. One plasma cell leukaemia patient and two out of four end-stage MM patients showed no expression of N-CAM or beta 2 integrins on their circulating plasma cells. Among 11 previously established myeloma cell lines, surface expression of ICAM-1 and the integrins was detected in most cases, while N-CAM was present in only four lines. Most cell lines showed coexpression of the fibronectin receptors (VLA-4 and VLA-5) and the laminin receptor (VLA-6). The collagen receptor (VLA-2) was not expressed. The N-CAM negative cell lines included four cell lines that were derived from plasma cell leukaemia patients. These results indicate that the expression of adhesion molecules is an intrinsic part of the biology of multiple myeloma.","['Van Riet, I', 'De Waele, M', 'Remels, L', 'Lacor, P', 'Schots, R', 'Van Camp, B']","['Van Riet I', 'De Waele M', 'Remels L', 'Lacor P', 'Schots R', 'Van Camp B']","['Department of Hematology-Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Free University of Brussels (V.U.B.), Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'CD18 Antigens', 'CD56 Antigen', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Precipitin Tests']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 Nov;79(3):421-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08050.x.,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08050.x [doi]'],"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined to what degree granulocytic maturation could be achieved by stimulating AML blast cells in an in vitro serum-free system with a combination of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and all-trans-retinoic acid (RA). Specimens from 41 AML patients were cultured for 7 d and then examined for cytochemistry (myeloperoxidase, Sudan Black, naphthyl-ASD-chloracetate esterase, periodic acid Schiff) an nitroblue tetrazolium reduction. The expression of CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD15, CD18, CD10, CD24 and B13-3 membrane antigens was also evaluated. Morphological and cytochemical studies were also performed after AML colony culture and culture of normal bone marrow cells (NBM). The comparative analysis of the panel of parameters was indicative of granulocytic maturation although to different degrees. The cells from 25/41 cases showed morphologic maturation (May-Grunwald-Giemsa). A positive correlation was evident between morphological maturation and CD11b expression (11/22 patients) as well as that of CD11c and CD15 (6 patients). Napthyl ASD chloroacetate esterase and PAS stainings also correlated with morphology (in 10/22 and 10/24 patients respectively). Nevertheless, the pattern of granulocytic maturation was remarkably variable among the 41 cases examined. The cells from only a few patients acquired the full spectrum of granulocytic markers. The comparison with normal bone marrow blasts indicates that serum-free culture conditions can, per se, limit granulocytic maturation, but it also confirms the intrinsic inability of AML cells to attain complete maturation in response to two potent granulocytic inducers.","['Colombat, P', 'Santini, V', 'Delwel, R', 'Krefft, J', 'Bredmond, J L', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Colombat P', 'Santini V', 'Delwel R', 'Krefft J', 'Bredmond JL', 'Lowenberg B']","['Dr Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 Nov;79(3):382-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08045.x.,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08045.x [doi]'],"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
