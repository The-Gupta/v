That 2-azahypoxanthine is a substrate for hypoxanthine (guanine) phosphoribosyltransferase is shown by the observations that, in cell-free fractions from HEp-2 cells supplemented with 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate, 2-azahypoxanthine inhibited the conversion of hypoxanthine to IMP but not the conversion of adenine to AMP, and hypoxanthine, but not adenine, inhibited the conversion of 2-azahypoxanthine to 2-azaIMP. [8-14C]2-Azahypoxanthine was synthesized from [8-14C]hypoxanthine via [2-14C]-4-amino-5-imidazolecarboxamide. In HEp-2 cells in culture, the principal metabolite of [8-14C]-2-azahypoxanthine was 2-azaATP; there was no detectable 14C in deoxynucleotides or in DNA or RNA fractions. 2-Azaadenosine was much more toxic than 2-azahypoxanthine, and, when used in the presence of an adenosine deaminase inhibitor, 2'-deoxycoformycin, was converted in HEp-2 cells to 2-azaATP in amounts that exceeded those of ATP in control cells. The pool of ATP was reduced by as much as 75% as 2-azaATP accumulated. In a short-term experiment (4 hr), 2-azaadenosine selectively reduced the pools of adenine nucleotides, whereas 2-azahypoxanthine reduced the pools of guanine nucleotides selectively. Both 2-azahypoxanthine and 2-azaadenosine inhibited the incorporation of formate into purine nucleotides and were without effect on the conversion of thymidine and uridine to nucleotides. 2-Azahypoxanthine inhibited the incorporation of thymidine into macro-molecules but not that of uridine or leucine; 2-azaadenosine inhibited the incorporation of all three of these precursors non-selectively. 2-AzaIMP inhibited IMP dehydrogenase competitively with IMP (Ki = 66 microM). The difference in effects of 2-azahypoxanthine and 2-azaadenosine perhaps may be due to the production, from 2-azahypoxanthine but not from 2-azaadenosine + 2'-deoxycoformycin, of 2-azaIMP, which inhibits synthesis of guanine nucleotides and thereby results in inhibition of DNA synthesis. Specific sites of action for 2-azaadenosine are yet undefined.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Retinoic acid-induced expression of tissue transglutaminase is potentiated by analogues of cyclic AMP. The induction of the enzyme can be detected within 6 h of the addition of the retinoid to the cell and results in increases of the enzyme of at least 50-fold. The induction of HL-60 transglutaminase is a specific response of the cells to retinoic acid and is not seen with other agents that induce HL-60 differentiation.

The phenotypic analysis of Japanese adult T cell leukemia (ATL) cells by a series of 13 monoclonal antibodies showed that all ATL cells are anti-T4 reactive but some differ in their expression of T3, T11, and T12 antigens. Thus, considerable phenotypic heterogeneity exists in these populations of leukemia cells. When analyzed in functional assays, ATL cells were suppressive when added to a pokeweed mitogen- (PWM) driven Ig synthesis system. However, the suppression mechanism seemed to be more complex than originally conceived. ATL cells examined in this study seem to function mainly as an inducer of suppressor cells, and as such, activate normal T8 precursors of suppressor cells rather than function as suppressor effector cells. In addition, no evidence was obtained to suggest that suppression of PWM-stimulated IgG synthesis was mediated by natural killer (NK) activity of ATL cells. Rather, ATL cells seem to be markedly deficient in NK activity.

Chromatography of the extract of L-1210 cells revealed four principal radioactive peaks. The fraction containing the third peak was hydrolyzed by snake venom 5'-nucleotidase (Crotalus adamanteus). Cellulose thin layer chromatography revealed that the radioactive peak of the hydrolysate corresponded to 6-thioguanosine. The results showed that 6-MP was converted to 6-thioinosinic acid (6-TIMP) and 6-thioguanylic acid (6-TGMP) in L-1210 cells. In order to elucidate the pathway of 6-MP conversion to 6-TGMP, we examined the interaction of [8-14C]6-TIMP and purified IMP dehydrogenase.

Dowex-1 chromatography of the acid-soluble extract of human CML cells incubated with [8-14C]-6-MP also revealed a radioactive peak corresponding to 6-TGMP.

In this latter case, it has been shown that L1210 cells secrete into the medium some factor which facilitates iron uptake. The growth of L1210 cells in their exponential phase was blocked by desferrioxamine at the G1-S interface of the cell cycle. The action of transferrin on cell growth was also inhibited by propyl gallate - a known antioxidant which prevents lipid peroxidation. The action of iron was more potent than hemin in reversing the influence of propyl gallate on L1210 cell growth.

To determine if these phenotypes represent different mutations within the glucocorticoid receptor locus itself or reflect alterations in other components modifying receptor function, somatic hybrids were constructed between wild-type cells and all three classes of resistant mutants, as well as between various classes of resistant mutants. Hybrids were analyzed for chromosome content, steroid-induced growth inhibition, induction of the enzyme glutamine synthetase, and glucocorticoid receptor content. Hybrids constructed between wild-type cells and any of the three classes of resistant cells were growth-inhibited in the presence of dexamethasone, displayed normal levels of glutamine synthetase induction, and contained a quantity of glucocorticoid receptor approximately equal to the sum of the glucocorticoid receptor concentrations of the parental cell lines. Hybrids constructed between various classes of resistant cells were not growth-inhibited by dexamethasone, displayed no glutamine synthetase induction, and also contained the sum of the glucocorticoid receptor concentration of the individual parents. Thus, each phenotype is recessive, and there is no complementation between phenotypes.

The sequences of these peptides were Met-Asp-Arg-Val-Leu-Ser-Arg-Ala-Asp-Lys (N-MT), Met-Leu-Phe-Ile-Leu-Ile-Lys-Arg-Ser-Arg-His-Phe (C-MT), and Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Tyr-Met-Pro-Met-Glu (MT-Tyr), respectively. Among these peptides, the C-MT peptide inhibited phospholipase A2 (EC 3.1.1.4), phospholipase C (EC 3.1.4.3), and phospholipase D (EC 3.1.4.4). In addition, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (EC 3.1.4.10) was also inhibited by this peptide. To study the mechanism of the inhibition, kinetic analysis was performed using phospholipase A2 from porcine pancreas. The degree of inhibition of phospholipase was dose dependent, and maximal inhibition was observed at pH 8.8. This peptide inhibited phospholipase A2 in a competitive manner for low-affinity sites of Ca2+, and in a noncompetitive manner for phospholipid substrates. When a fatty acid in the 2 position of the glycerol moiety of phosphatidylcholine was replaced by palmitic acid (C16:0), oleic acid (C18:1), linoleic acid (C18:2), eicosatrienoic acid (C20:3), or arachidonic acid (C20:4), the degree of inhibition of phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis by the C-MT peptide decreased. Inhibition of phospholipase A2 by the C-MT peptide was reversed by low concentrations of sodium deoxycholate but not by Triton X-100 or Nonidet P40, nonionic detergents. These detergents and the modification of acyl groups altered the micellar state of phospholipids. These results, taken together, suggest that the binding of the C-MT peptide near the low-affinity Ca2+ binding sites modifies the interaction of phospholipid substrates with the active center of phospholipase A2.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A similar sequence is found in the gene 32 single-stranded DNA binding protein of bacteriophage T4 and is believed to be the zinc binding region of the protein. Solid phase synthesis of p10 was carried out based on the known primary structure of the native protein, with the exception that the acetamidomethyl (Acm) derivative of cysteine was incorporated at all three cysteine positions. The structure of the synthetic p10 was confirmed by direct amino-acid sequencing, as well as by amino acid analysis and FAB mass spectrometry of endoproteinase Lys-C peptides derived from p10. A Chou and Fasman analysis of the primary sequence predicts that p10 contains 9% beta strand and/or sheet and 36% alpha helix. Circular dichroism experiments carried out on the Acm derivatized peptide gave somewhat different results, in that they suggest that p10 contains approximately 70% random coil, less than 30% beta strand and/or sheet and less than 10% alpha helix.

The biochemical goal was to establish how these inert compounds are converted metabolically, by target tissues, to reactive species that can alter the DNA of the susceptible cell. The comparative tumorigenicities were assessed by the use of female CD rats. Control groups consisted of animals that had been given only the solvent, dimethylsulfoxide, which has a low toxicity, to maximize solubility. Equimolar doses (1.7 mumole/ml; 10 mumole/kg body weight) of the compounds were administered to weanling rats by intraperitoneal injection, or by intragastric intubation, three times each week for four weeks, for a total dose of 16 mumoles. Newborn animals were treated by subcutaneous injection of the 1,3-, 1,6-, or 1,8-dinitropyrene or 1-nitropyrene within 24 hours of birth, and at seven weekly intervals, for a total dose of 6.3 mumoles. The possible carcinogenicities of phenolic metabolites of 1-nitropyrene were examined by subcutaneous treatment of newborn animals, and at seven weekly intervals, with 1-nitropyrene, 3-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene, or a mixture of 6-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene and 8-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene (70 mumoles/ml; 100 mumoles/kg body weight; total dose, 63 mumoles). The relative carcinogenicity of 1-nitropyrene in the female Fischer 344 rats was established by the concurrent treatment of appropriate animals. The smaller, inbred Fischer rats received a total dose of 40 mumoles. Subcutaneous and intraperitoneal treatments of weanling female CD rats (70 mumoles/ml; 100 mumoles/kg body weight; 5 weekly injections) with 1-nitropyrene were carried out to explore possible differences because of the different routes of administration in animals of the same age. Dinitropyrenes are much more carcinogenic than 1-nitropyrene (1,6- greater than 1,8- greater than 1,3-dinitropyrene greater than 1-nitropyrene). Phenolic derivatives of 1-nitropyrene are no more carcinogenic than the parent compound. The most likely tumors to be induced in this animal model are malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFHs), mammary gland tumors, and leukemias. Animals treated with 1,6- or 1,8-dinitropyrene by subcutaneous injection yielded MFHs at the site within 15 weeks of the first injection (i.e., at 15 weeks of age), and this did not permit them to survive more than 20 to 25 weeks.

Mo-MuLV(src) encodes a gag-src fusion protein, transforms cells in culture, and induces fibrosarcomas in vivo. To compare transforming properties of the gag-src fusion protein to pp60src encoded by Rous sarcoma virus, we constructed a new recombinant virus, Mo-MuLV(+ src). Mo-MuLV(+ src) encodes pp60src in the context of Mo-MuLV. Cells transformed by Mo-MuLV(+ src) were round and formed colonies in soft agar, whereas Mo-MuLV(src)-infected cells were fusiform and did not grow in suspension. Thus, the extent of transformation induced by Mo-MuLV(+ src) was greater than that induced by Mo-MuLV(src). Subcutaneous inoculation of either virus into neonatal NIH Swiss mice resulted in fibrosarcomas at the site of injection. Further studies indicated that tumors induced by Mo-MuLV(+ src) grew rapidly but rarely metastasized. In contrast, tumors induced by Mo-MuLV(src) grew somewhat more slowly but metastasized with a high frequency (60%). These viruses may provide a useful model system for tumor metastasis. Another src-containing virus was also studied, MRSV (constructed by Anderson and Scolnick). MRSV also encodes pp60src but in the context of amphotropic MuLV. When injected intravenously into six-week-old mice, MRSV induced splenomegaly and spleen foci but no solid tumors, as reported previously. In contrast, Mo-MuLV(src)-induced fibrosarcomas mostly in the spleen under the same inoculation protocol.

BCL1-lymphoma cells from an in vivo passaged BCL1-cell line grew in vitro only in contact with splenic stromal cells. These stromal cells produced a retrovirus, termed BCL1-V, which was lymphotropic but not leukemogenic. BCL1 cells bound BCL1-V, whereas normal spleen cells did not. Isolated BCL1-IgM bound BCL1-V, whereas three other IgM myeloma proteins, MOPC-104E, CBPC-112, and HPC-76, did not. Rat anti-BCL1-IgM monoclonal antibodies recognizing mu chain isotypic determinants and BCL1-specific idiotypic specificities, blocked BCL1-V binding to BCL1 IgM.

In this report the presence of BLV provirus in the DNA of immunoaffinity purified T-lymphocytes from AL animals was assessed using a highly specific radiolabelled (32P) BLV-DNA provirus probe and solid phase DNA hybridization. The BLV provirus was found in the DNA of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of all AL animals tested and three of the four purified T-lymphocyte preparations from these animals. The purified T-lymphocyte preparations used in this study contained less than 4% detectable B-lymphocytes. One animal had no detectable B-lymphocytes in the purified T-lymphocyte preparation and the DNA from these cells also gave positive hybridization results. The lymphocyte blastogenesis assay was then used as an indicator of the functional ability of lymphocytes from these BLV-infected AL cattle to respond to mitogenic stimuli. The responsiveness of lymphocytes from these animals to the mitogens concanavalin A (Con A), phytohemagglutinin (PHA), and pokeweek mitogen (PWM) was comparable to that of lymphocytes from BLV-negative animals when changes in 3H-thymidine uptake (c.p.m.) were used as measurement of mitogenic-induced blastogenesis. This indicated that infection of the T-lymphocytes by BLV does not appear to alter the overall response of the lymphocyte populations to mitogenic stimuli. High levels of spontaneous blastogenesis in the absence of mitogenic stimulation were observed for lymphocyte preparations of AL animals. The reason for this proliferation of lymphocytes is unclear; however, sera from these AL animals were found to contain a blastogenesis-augmenting factor(s) when added to lymphocytes from BLV-negative control animals in the presence of Con A, PHA and PWM.",,,,"['Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Parasitology, School of Veterinary Medicine, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge 70803.']",,,,,,,,

Since we previously reported existence of lipids inside the nucleus and nuclear fractions, it seems of interest to examine the possible presence of the cascade of inositol lipids in isolated nuclei as well as the presence of the protein kinase C, whose activity is tightly related to the phosphoinositide cycle, and requires the presence of phosphatidylserine, which has been previously demonstrated to deeply affect nuclear structure and function. Here we show that highly purified nuclei from both rat liver and Friend cells, free of nuclear membrane, can incorporate radiolabel from ATP-[32P] into phosphatidic acid, phosphatidyl-inositol phosphate and phosphatidylinositol (4', 5')bisphosphate. The degree of radiolabelling of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate is highly dependent on the state of differentiation of the cells. Moreover, a doublet of immunoreactive bands has been identified in rat liver nuclei by means of a polyclonal antibody against protein kinase C.

Mature forms of these viruses are about 100 nm in diameter. The nucleoid is electron lucent and almost completely fills the virion. There is about a 10-nm space between the envelope and nucleoid. The envelope has fuzzy surface projections. HTLV-I and -II resemble other type C retroviruses in morphology. Budding forms of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, LAV, HTLV-III) also have a crescent-shaped nucleoid but not an intermediate layer between the core and envelope. The envelope has rod-shaped surface projections. Mature forms of HIV have an electron-dense nucleoid that is eccentric and bar- or cone-shaped. Particles have the same ultrastructure as retroviruses of the Lentivirus genus. HIV is readily distinguishable from HTLV-I and -II by thin-section electron microscopy. HIV is usually found in extracellular spaces by transmission electron microscopy of thin sections, and scanning electron microscopy of HIV-infected T4 lymphocytes also shows many particles on the surface of these cells. Lymphadenopathy-associated virus type II (LAV-II) has the same internal ultrastructure as HIV, but its surface projections are more prominent, being about three times the length of those of HIV.

However, our data also suggest that these same receptors can be coupled to the phospholipase via an additional pertussis-toxin-insensitive mechanism. This latter finding raises the possibility that undifferentiated HL60 cells express two distinct GTP-binding proteins coupled to phospholipase C; one of these is very likely to be the GHL/GC protein recently isolated from this cell line. Significantly, the data of Oinuma et al. and Falloon et al. indicate that expression of the 40-kDa alpha-subunit/toxin substrate increases upon differentiation of HL60 cells along the granulocyte pathway. It would be interesting to determine whether expression of the putative pertussis-toxin-insensitive G-protein decreases with differentiation of these and other myelomonocytic progenitor cells.

Treatment of human T-cell leukemia line Jurkat by a mitogen or p40x, a transactivator protein encoded by human T-cell leukemia virus type I, activates many transfected lymphokine genes in a transient transfection assay. To study the mechanism of lymphokine gene induction, we examined the effects of mitogen stimulation and p40x on the gene for the mouse granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in Jurkat cells. Deletion and mutation analyses showed that the 5'-flanking region of the gene for the GM-CSF is composed of two types of regulatory elements. One sequence, located at positions -95 to -73, determines response to stimulation by either TPA-A23187 or p40x. This region contains conserved lymphokine element 2, which appears in the gene for interleukin 3 (IL-3) and is followed by a GC-rich stretch. This GC-rich stretch alone specifies inducible response to p40x but not to TPA-A23187. Another sequence, located at positions -113 to -96 upstream of a TATA-like sequence, mediates inducible response to p40x but not to TPA-A23187. This sequence includes conserved lymphokine element 1, which appears in several lymphokine-cytokine genes, such as those for IL-3, G-CSF, and IL-2. We previously showed that the simian virus 40 early region promoter was also induced by a mitogen or p40x in Jurkat cells. Deletion analysis showed that the minimum region require for stimulation by both signals are identical. These results, which indicate that p40(x) stimulates transcription of the gene for the GM-CSF or the simian virus 40 early region promoter through the same DNA element or an overlapping DNA element required for induction by a mitogen, lend further support to the notion that p40(x) can exert its function by activating a component(s) of the T-cell signal transduction pathway which is activated by an antigen or a mitogen.",,,PMC365666,"['Department of Molecular Biology, DNAX Research Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Palo Alto, California 94304-1104.']",,,,,,,,

We describe studies with two sublines of human leukemic CCRF-CEM cells approximately 50-fold resistant (CEM/VM-1) and approximately 140-fold resistant (CEM/VM-1-5) to VM-26, a drug known to interfere with DNA topoisomerase II activity. Each of these lines is cross-resistant to other drugs known to affect topoisomerase II but not cross-resistant to vinblastine, an inhibitor of mitotic spindle formation. We found little difference in the amount of immunoreactive DNA topoisomerase II in 1.0 M NaCl nuclear extracts of the two resistant and parental cell lines. However, topoisomerase II in nuclear extracts of the resistant sublines is altered in both catalytic activity (unknotting) of and DNA cleavage by this enzyme. Also, the rate at which catenation occurs is 20-30-fold slower with the CEM/VM-1-5 preparations. The effect of VM-26 on both strand passing and DNA cleavage is inversely related to the degree of primary resistance of each cell line.

The release of a number of enzymes in response to stimulation by a variety of agents was examined. Soluble aggregated IgG (SAIgG) stimulated the release primarily of elastase from HL-60 derived granulocytes with little or no release of other granule enzymes, in particular myeloperoxidase. This contrasted to what was seen when peripheral blood granulocytes were used. The lack of myeloperoxidase release was not due to the parallel release of enzyme inhibitors or failure of the stimulus to bind to the cells. Neither was it due to variations in the kinetics of enzyme release or the presence of myeloperoxidase and elastase in discrete sub-populations of HL-60 cells. When other stimuli such as fMet-Leu-Phe, A23187, or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) were used a relatively normal degranulation response was seen.

Lysis was not target cell specific, since somatostatin secreting RIN 14B cells, Wistar Furth leukemia cells designated LW12, PC12 cells and NK sensitive YAC-1 cells were also lysed. Lysis of all target cells was significantly reduced by pretreatment of the effector lymphocytes with antiserum to NK cells (anti-asialo GM1) and complement suggesting that NK cells mediated destruction of these cells. These data demonstrate a generalized increase in non-specific NK cell activity in BB/Wor rats.

Three different ADCC protocols were tested but in each case the addition of serum dilutions from AD rats reduced the lysis of insulinoma cells by AD spleen cells in a dose dependent manner. This inhibition was also demonstrated when sera and effector cells from control rats were used. As a positive control, DR spleen cells were incubated with 51Cr labelled target cells that were untreated or pre-treated with anti-rat class 1 antibody (OX18).

GTP[S]-stimulated PPI-pde in membranes is sensitive to the presence of Ca2+ (pCa 8-5).

The calves were monitored serologically during a 3-month postexposure period, using the agar gel immunodiffusion test. All fly-infested and fly-free calves remained BLV-seronegative. For a second vector experiment, donor calves, newly injected with blood from BLV-infected cows with high virus expression, were tethered alternately between uninoculated, weaned BLV-seronegative calves. These groups were housed with or without flies in 2 replicate trials. The inoculated calves from the first replicate seroconverted at 16 and 23 days after inoculation; the inoculated calves from the second replicate seroconverted at 11, 16, 16, and 37 days after inoculation. All uninoculated calves remained BLV-seronegative.

In searching for DNA-binding proteins which might regulate transcription, we found both a ubiquitous (B1) and a B-cell-specific (B2) factor which bind to the octamer sequence ATTTGCAT 52 base pairs 5' of the cap site in the DR alpha gene. We examined the relationship of these factors to DR alpha transcription. HUT-78, a T-cell line which expresses class II mRNA constitutively, contains only the ubiquitous B1 octamer-binding factor also found in non-class II-expressing T-cell leukemias. Human fibroblast, HeLa, and melanoma cell lines similarly contain only the ubiquitous factor, even when these cells are induced to express class II mRNA by treatment with gamma interferon. Both B1 and B2 binding factors are present in the B-cell mutant 6.1.6, which nevertheless fails to transcribe class II mRNA.

MPO deficient PMN were found to occur in a minor number (less than 4% of the total number of PMN) in normal humans and the incidences of an abnormal number (greater than 4%) were found to be about 40% in AML (I, II, III, IV, VIII), 60% in CML (I, VII), 30% in MPD other than CML (VII) and 30% in MDS (V). The highest incidences in AML were found in the FAB subtypes possessing the most myeloid differentiation potential i.e. FAB M2 and FAB M4 (IV). In ALL, CLL, HCL, Hodgkin's disease, anaemia not related to leukaemia and leukaemoid reactions the incidences all were 0% (I, unpublished data). The abnormal MPO deficient PMN subpopulation, if present, disappeared when CR was achieved and reappeared when relapse eventually was developed (II, VIII). In both situations serial determinations showed that the change occurred before the usual routine blood examinations predicted CR and relapse; several days and several months prior, respectively (VIII). The probability of obtaining CR was lower in the AML patients with the abnormal subpopulation and the risk of developing relapse higher than in AML patients without the anomaly (II, VIII). These differences were not statistically significant, however. AML patients, showing an increased number of MPO deficient PMN, revealed a statistically significant increased susceptibility to infections (P less than 0.01) during the preremission phase accounting for 18% to 67% of the total number of infections in this period (III). This increase was positively correlated to the extent of the anomaly (P less than 0.002). The spontaneous occurrence of a subpopulation of MPO deficient PMN in MDS went together with a simultaneous progression in cytogenetically determined clonal chromosomal aberrations and were related to progression in FAB subtype as well (VI). Morphometrically MPO deficient PMN were characterized by a decreased total cell size and an increased nucleus size of the projected images (IX).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,,,"['Department of Pathology, Arhus Amtssygehus, Denmark.']",210,,,,,,,

One proto-oncogene, Erbb-2 (analogous to the neu proto-oncogene), and one growth factor locus, Csfg (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), which had not been mapped in the mouse were also localized on Chromosome 11 using the interspecific backcross mice.

We were interested to determine whether A-MLV can induce IL-3 independence also in non-established cells. To obtain long-term cultures of diploid myelocytes, splenic hematopoietic cells were first infected with MMCV, a murine retrovirus carrying the avian v-myc oncogene. These cultures were superinfected with A-MLV. In three independent experiments, the first growth factor-independent cells appeared between 18 and 43 days after superinfection with A-MLV and represented .02-1% of the population. Furthermore, the cultures that became growth factor-independent were monoclonal for integration of the v-abl gene. These results indicate that the acquisition of growth factor-independence after superinfection of v-myc-expressing cells with A-MLV is a rare event. The low frequency of growth factor-independent cells was not due to a low percentage of infected cells, since 15-25% of the cells were infected with A-MLV after 7 days. The first appearance of growth factor-independent cells coincided with crisis in the cultures, as indicated by a high incidence of cell death and a reduced overall growth rate of the cell populations. These growth factor-independent cells exhibited variable karyotypes, including many that were near-triploid to near-tetraploid. In summary, growth factor-independence induced by super-infection with A-MLV, like that induced by double-infection with v-myc- and v-H-ras-containing viruses, is associated with unstable karyotypes.

IG-h gene rearrangements were detected in 10 cases, in one case in conjunction with an IG-kappa (k) and TCR-b gene rearrangement. A highly significant correlation between the occurrence of DNA rearrangements of the IG-h locus and nuclear staining with the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and surface expression of the CD 19 and CD 34 antigen could be identified: all 10 TdT positive AML samples rearranged IG-h. Similarly, six out of 69 AML samples exhibited surface expression of CD 19, five of these in combination with CD 34 and all of them rearranged the IG-h gene. The one leukemia with TCR-b gene rearrangement only was TdT positive as well, but did not express CD 19 or CD 34. We conclude that IG-h gene is rearranged in a substantial proportion of AML, strongly associated with a specific immunophenotype (TdT+, CD19+, CD34+), whereas TCR-b gene rearrangement appears more rarely.

Therefore, we generated a hybridoma (HY2-15) by a fusion between thyroid monolayer cells from a patient with Graves' disease, and a hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT)-sensitive variant of this human T cell leukemia line, Molt 4-8AGR. The hybrid nature of HY2-15 was confirmed by DNA histograms using propidium iodide and flow cytometry. Karyotyping showed the HY2-15 cells to have five sets of chromosomes and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I determination revealed the presence of an additional HLA class I antigen (A2) not present on the Molt 4 partner cells. The established, cloned, hybridoma cells showed a greater than 30-fold increase in cyclic AMP release after stimulation with bovine TSH (bTSH, 1 mU/ml) with a minimum detectable stimulating dose of less than 10 microU/ml bTSH. However, no other thyroid-specific functions could be detected. Furthermore, HY2-15 cells failed to express HLA class II antigens either constitutively or in response to recombinant human gamma interferon (IF) and a variety of other stimuli, data similar to the Molt 4 partner cells but in contrast to human thyroid cells which show high sensitivity to gamma IF.

The indigenous AC activity of cortex membranes had previously been inactivated with N-ethylmaleimide. In the fusates, the AC activity could be stimulated through beta-adrenoceptors using noradrenaline (NA), or through specific receptors for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), or by fluoride which activates the effector components of the AC-system directly, bypassing receptors. There was a critical stoichiometric relationship between the receptor-stimulated cAMP output and the number of recipient cells of the fusion system, i.e. the total AC capacity as measured by fluoride stimulation. In fusates with rat brain membranes, the beta-adrenoceptor coupling increased as the availability of recipient cells increased; on the other hand, the excess of recipient cells did not change the VIP receptor coupling capacity. In fusates with monkey brain membranes, the situation was the opposite: VIP receptor coupling increased as larger amounts of recipient cells were made available, but the beta-adrenoceptor coupling capacity remained unchanged. The differences in coupling capacities were related to differences in receptor binding with higher beta-adrenoceptor density in rat than in monkey frontal cortex membranes, as opposed to higher VIP receptor density in monkey than in rat frontal cortex membranes. Neuropeptide tyrosine (NPY) attenuated both NA- and VIP-induced activation of AC in the fusates; it was equally potent against both agents. In rat brain membrane fusates, the NA-induced AC activity was attenuated in a dose-dependent and apparently non-competitive manner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,"['Department of Pharmacology, University of Uppsala, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,

In order to identify the current carrier through these ion channels and to determine their ion selectivity, we investigated the currents flowing through the IgE-Fc epsilon receptor gated channels in the presence of a gradient of Ca2+ ions. Thus, the solution in which the micropipet-supported bilayer was immersed contained 1.8 mM CaCl2, while the interior of the micropipet contained 0.1 microM Ca2+ (buffered with EGTA). Both solutions also contained 150 mM of a monovalent cation chloride salt (either K+ or Na+). The currents induced upon specific aggregation of the IgE (by either antigen or anti-IgE antibodies) were examined over a range of potentials imposed on the bilayer. The type of conductance event most frequently observed under the employed experimental conditions was a channel that has a slope conductance of 3 pS and a reversal potential practically identical with the calculated value for the reversal potential of calcium (134 +/- 11 mV in the presence of sodium, 125 +/- 13 mV in the presence of potassium). These results indicate that this channel is highly selective for calcium against the monovalent cations sodium and potassium.

A gel electrophoresis protein-DNA binding assay was used to identify the interaction of nuclear factors with the 21 bp element. Specific protein-DNA interactions were observed in all cell lines examined. No differences were observed in the binding patterns obtained from extracts prepared from those cell lines that did or did not express the tax protein. Dimethyl sulfate (DMS) interference analysis indicates that a nuclear factor contacts the guanine residues in the sequence GGCGTTGAGG.

These cells gave rise to transformed cells with two phenotypes: those which were still anchorage-dependent (AD), and those which readily detached spontaneously from the substratum and grew in suspension. A clone of these AD cells (B clone) was isolated and compared with a clone of the anchorage-independent suspension-cultured (AISC) cells (C clone). While the C clone exhibited a high oncogenicity and ability to metastasize in nude mice, the A and B clones were not tumorigenic. The integrated v-mos was greatly amplified in the C clone, and moderately increased in the B clone as compared with the A clone. The amounts of v-mos mRNA expressed by B and C clones paralleled those of v-mos sequence in their chromosomal DNA, whereas there was no detectable v-mos mRNA in the A clone. Thus, conversion of S + L- mink cells from an AD growth to an AISC phenotype accompanied by manifestation of oncogenicity and metastatic potential in nude mice is associated with amplification of integrated v-mos gene and its enhanced expression. Furthermore, a revertant (D clone) showing AD phenotype was derived from the C clone by selective growth in ouabain. This revertant exhibited a markedly decreased oncogenicity in nude mice, although the copy numbers of integrated v-mos gene and its mRNA did not differ from those of the parent C clone. While more p37mos protein was found in the C than in the D clone, it was not detectable in the A and B clone. The amounts of helper virus-related mRNA and infectious E1BX-MuLV were markedly higher in the B than in the C and D clones. It is concluded that v-mos gene amplification and overexpression is necessary for these cells to exhibit oncogenicity, but other factors associated with ouabain-resistance can modify or suppress its oncogenicity despite the v-mos amplification and mRNA overexpression.",,,,"['Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",,,,,,,,

Cytoplasmic 5'nucleotidase (cyto 5'NT) catalyzes the intracellular degradation of purine nucleotides into their corresponding nucleosides. The plasma membrane bound form (ecto 5'NT) has its active site facing the external medium. Its function is the extracellular dephosphorylation of nucleotides, to which cells are generally impermeable, into nucleosides and the transport of these nucleosides through the cell membrane. Lymphoblastic 5'NT activity varies between different children with common-ALL. 5'NT positive cases have a higher relapse rate and thus a poorer prognosis than 5'NT negative cases. This can be explained by two hypotheses which are not mutually exclusive: 1. Rescue hypothesis. When purine de novo synthesis is blocked by methotrexate (MTX) and/or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), the malignant cell has to rely on the purine salvage pathway. This pathway depends on the ecto-5'NT activity. So, leukemic cells might be resistant to MTX and/or 6-MP because of ecto-5'NT activity. 2. Breakdown hypothesis. Leukemic cells are resistant to 6-MP because of the breakdown of the toxic nucleotide form of 6-MP into the nucleoside form by cyto-5'NT.",,,,"['Department of Pediatrics, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,

The Na/H exchanger is not the system responsible for keeping the pH above the electrochemical equilibrium, since adding inhibitors of this transport system (dimethylamiloride and ethylisopropylamiloride) or removing the extracellular sodium has no effect on intracellular pH. In contrast, the addition of the Cl/HCO3 exchange inhibitors H2 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (DIDS) or pentachlorophenol (PCP) causes a drop in intracellular pH, and the removal of extracellular chloride in the presence of bicarbonate leads to a large intracellular alkalinization, which indicates a role for the anion exchanger in pH homeostasis in these cells. In addition, we find that the intracellular chloride concentration is about one order of magnitude above electrochemical equilibrium. We conclude that an H2DIDS and PCP inhibitable system, probably the Cl/HCO3 exchanger, is at least partially responsible for keeping intracellular pH above electrochemical equilibrium in HL60 cells under resting conditions.

In this process, the plasmid is not changed detectably in amount, topology, or state of methylation. Stably transformed preadipose cells bearing an integrated plasmid express the transferase, but if the cells are allowed to differentiate, the expression of the gene is similarly suppressed. The decline in CAT activity is associated with a decrease in the transcription rate of the gene. Transcription of a gene coding for neomycin phosphotransferase driven by the SV40 promoter is also greatly diminished by differentiation.

A-T is a human recessive genetic disorder which predisposes homozygotes and heterozygotes to cancer. Computer analysis (Robson-Garnier) was used to study the secondary structure of EBV ORF's. Three ORF's (BBRF3, BILF1 and BMRF2) found by the Kyte and Doolittle computer method to have multiple hydrophobic domains in the putative polypeptides were selected, and the polypeptides were selected, and the respective cloned EBV DNA fragments were used as probes to detect mRNA in the normal and L-6 A-T lines that was not present in the L-15 A-T line. The probe for BILF1 detected two mRNA species (3.7 and 2.0 kb) in the normal lymphoblastoid and A-T L-6 lines, while only the 3.7 kb mRNA was expressed in the A-T L-15 lymphoblasts. The probe for BMRF2 detected two mRNA species (3.7 and 2.1 kb) in the EBV-transformed normal lymphoblasts and in one A-T line (L6). The BMRF2 mRNAs were not detected in the other A-T line (L-15). This study indicated that regulation of the three EBV genes in two EBV-transformed A-T lymphoblastoid lines, differs from that in the EBV-transformed normal lymphoblastoid line. In the A-T line L-6, the three EBV genes were expressed as in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells originating from a normal donor (L-21) and in the P3HR1 Burkitt's lymphoma cell line. The A-T line L-15 differed from L-6 and the other cell lines in that it expressed only one (3.7 kb) RNA species from BILF1 ORF, while ORFs BBRF3 and BMRF2 were not expressed. Since A-T L-15 line contains EBV DNA genomes, and EBV VCA is not present in these cells prior to or after TPA treatment, it is suggested that EBV gene expression is regulated by these A-T lymphoblastoid cells in a manner different from that which operates in other EBV transformed cell lines.",,,,"['Department of Molecular Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.']",,,,,,,,

Although the function or bioiological role of endogenous retroviruses still remains to be elucidated, they have been detected in almost all vertebrate species examined. The most relevant properties of endogenous, genetically transmitted retroviruses are summarized in Table 1. Endogenous retroviruses persist in cellular DNA, are transmitted through the germ line, and possess a transposon-like structure (2) which enables them to integrate at any position of the cellular genome. Endogenous retroviruses can be activated by certain chemicals such as mutagens/carcinogens or mitogens, by radiation, and by other mechanisms such as DNA-viruses or physiological processes (e.g. aging) to express antigens or to form infectious virus particles.

On the other hand, an antigenic relationship was shown between DIF and lymphotoxin (LT) by use of neutralizing antibodies. An activity, which cochromatographed with DIF during all purification steps, competed with binding of both rLT and rTNF to HL-60 cells. Approximately 2,000 binding sites for rLT were detected per cell, with a Kd of 330 pmol/l. Our observations are indications of a functional and an antigenic connection between DIF and LT, and indicate that TNF, LT and DIF share cell surface-binding sites. These binding sites are down regulated by activation of protein kinase-C. Results from modulation of the response indicated that the signal for differentiation might be transduced through activation of phospholipase A2. In order to understand myeloid differentiation and the effects of differentiation factors, we have pursued investigations of the biosynthesis and processing of one marker of myeloid differentiation, namely myeloperoxidase (MPO). Our results disclosed that MPO was synthesized as a larger precursor of Mr 90,000 to which a heme group was added, followed by proteolytic cleavage in pregranular structures to generate mature heavy Mr 60,000 and light Mr 12,000 subunits.

However, overall results indicated that patients with integrated HBV DNA sequences showed high copy number of hhcM sequence. Furthermore, EcoR1-restricted hepatoma DNAs showed that HBV and hhcM DNA sequences resided at different fragments in hepatomas.

In three CD3+ patients, a single allelic TCR-delta gene rearrangement was observed with rearrangement of the TCR-alpha gene on the other allele. In five CD3+ patients with bi-allelic rearrangements of the TCR-alpha gene, the TCR-delta gene locus was deleted. Transcription of the TCR-delta gene was also analyzed in six T-ALL. Five patients expressed TCR-delta transcripts.

In B-precursor ALL, 20 patients (69%) showed rearrangements of the TCR-delta gene. The frequency of TCR-delta gene rearrangement was higher than TCR-alpha (59%), gamma (52%), or beta (31%) genes. These findings suggest that TCR-alpha gene rearrangements may take place after rearrangements of the TCR-delta gene with concomitant deletion of rearranged TCR-delta genes in T cell differentiation.

Under similar conditions, cholera toxin enhances the antigen-stimulated rise in cytoplasmic free ionized calcium levels and causes a 2-3-fold increase in the rate of antigen-stimulated influx of 45Ca. In intact RBL cells cholera toxin pretreatment potentiates the antigen-stimulated production of inositol phosphates, but in permeabilized cells, with strongly buffered free calcium levels, no effect of cholera toxin pretreatment on the antigen-stimulated activation of cellular phospholipase activities is observed. In addition, pretreatment of cells with tetradecanoylphorbol acetate inhibits antigen-stimulated production of inositol phosphates by greater than 95%, while the stimulated influx of 45Ca remains unaffected. These data indicate that the antigen-stimulated influx of calcium into RBL cells can be dissociated from the production of inositol phosphates in these cells. The observed effects of cholera toxin on exocytosis and Ca2+ influx in RBL cells are not due to the elevation of cellular cyclic AMP levels since a variety of agents capable of elevating cellular cyclic AMP levels do not mimic these effects.

This P190bcr-abl has been implicated in acute rather than chronic leukemogenesis. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that the transition from chronic to blast phase in CML is accompanied by an alternative splice in the bcr-abl mRNA, which results in a switch of the production of P210bcr-abl into P190bcr-abl. Initial S1 nuclease protection mapping supported this theory. However, this result appears to be based on an artifact in the S1 analysis.

The activity of GlcNAc-T III was determined in Triton X-100 extracts of four human Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected B-cell lines, in four T-cell lines originally established from lymphocytes of patients with acute lymphatic leukemia, and in human tonsillar B and T lymphocytes. The four EBV-transformed B-cell lines showed appreciable GlcNAc-T III activities (ranging from 3.4 to 19.0 nmol.h-1.mg protein-1), while the tonsillar resting B lymphocytes had much less activity (0.68 nmol.h-1.mg protein-1). The four T-cell lines and the tonsillar T lymphocytes had negligible GlcNAc-T III activities (ranging from 0.02 to 0.25 nmol.h-1.mg protein-1). Enzyme product was identified by high resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and methylation analysis. This is the first demonstration of GlcNAc-T III activity in human lymphocytes.

Brief pretreatment of either undifferentiated or differentiated HL60 cells with various activators of protein kinase C Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme (e.g. phorbol myristate acetate) produced a 50-fold decrease in the potency of extracellular ATP to induce mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. The ATP-induced increase in rate of inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) accumulation in these 4-beta-phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate-treated cells was characterized by a 40% decrease in the maximal rate of InsP3 accumulation. Incubation of the cells with NaF also induced mobilization of the same Ca2+ stores released in response to extracellular ATP; this provided indirect evidence that the transmembrane signaling actions of P2-purinergic receptors may be mediated by GTP-binding regulatory proteins. This latter possibility was further supported by the finding that treatment of either undifferentiated or differentiated HL60 cells with pertussis toxin produced a significant, but partial, inhibition of ATP-induced signaling actions. These included: 1) a 60-70% decrease in the maximum rate of InsP3 accumulation, and 2) a 1.5 log unit increase in the half-maximally effective [ATP] required for mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. In cells treated with both pertussis toxin and 4-beta-phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate, there was an 80% decrease in maximal rate of ATP-induced InsP3 accumulation and near-complete inhibition of ATP-induced Ca2+ mobilization. Significantly, the residual, pertussis toxin-insensitive portion of ATP-induced signaling was observed in the same samples of differentiated HL60 cells wherein pertussis toxin treatment produced complete abolition of InsP3 accumulation and Ca2+ mobilization in response to occupation of chemotactic peptide receptors. These results indicate that the activation of inositol phospholipid breakdown by P2-purinergic receptors in HL60 cells may be mediated by both pertussis toxin-sensitive and toxin-insensitive mechanisms; this suggests that these myeloid progenitor cells may express two distinct types of GTP-binding proteins coupled to phospholipase C.",,['GM36387/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,"['Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",,,,,,,,

It seems that the toxicity of busulfan in host mice might be due to unidentified side effects other than bone marrow suppression. These results suggest that BFS and BIT could be improved substitutes for busulfan.",,,PMC5917621,"['Laboratory of Chemotherapy, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya.']",,,,,,,,

In Sjogren's syndrome, it has been recently shown that the benign-appearing lymphocytic infiltrates of the lymphoepithelial lesions in the salivary glands have clonal rearrangements of immunoglobulin genes in their DNA, even in the absence of malignant lymphoma. To investigate whether a similar situation occurs in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, we studied the thyroid glands from four patients with this disease. In all four cases, there was a benign-appearing lymphocytic infiltrate in the thyroid, with eosinophilic changes in the Hurthle cells. In immunologic studies, we determined that the lymphocytes were polyclonal in each case. We extracted DNA from the frozen tissue blocks of these four patients and analyzed it by molecular hybridization for the presence of clonal immunoglobulin (IgH, kappa, and lambda) and T cell receptor beta chain gene rearrangements, and detected none in any case. Therefore, we conclude that the lymphocytes in Hashimoto's thyroiditis are immunologically and immunogenetically polyclonal proliferations of cells, and that the initial lesion of Hashimoto's thyroiditis does not contain a detectable clone of cells that may eventually develop into malignant lymphoma.",,"['5R01 CA-26422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32 CA-09308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['James Irvine Center for the Study of Leukemia and Lymphoma, Division of Anatomic Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010.']",,,,,,,,

Normal thymocytes similarly had a hypersensitive IgH enhancer site. In contrast to lymphoid cells, all myeloid cell lines tested, as well as normal granulocytes, were not DNase I hypersensitive and did not express Cmu. A putative lymphomyeloid progenitor cell line KG1, although having a germline configuration of Ig genes, produced Cmu transcripts and was hypersensitive to DNase I in the IgH enhancer region. After induction of myeloid differentiation the Ig enhancer region of KG1 cells is no longer hypersensitive or transcriptionally active. Two HhaI restriction sites on either side of the IgH enhancer were not methylated in all Cmu-expressing lines but methylated in non-expressing cell lines.

The majority of dispersed VL30 sequences could be assigned to a proviral-like structure 5.2-5.3 kbp long and bounded by long terminal repeats (LTRs). The existence of a hierarchy of evolutionarily conserved elements was rather limited and sequence heterogeneity between different elements was randomly distributed. However, the retrovirus-transmissible class of VL30 element was found to represent a distinct minority subgroup distinguishable by restriction sites and size (4.6-4.9 kbp long). Analysis of sequence conservation showed that VL30 elements display a more rapid turnover than endogenous murine leukaemia virus-related proviral sequences, and that VL30 LTRs show the most limited evolutionary distribution. Although discrete subsets of VL30 unique sequence were conserved in different rodents, the location of conserved regions was found to be variable, arguing against the presence of a functionally conserved protein coding region. These observations support the hypothesis that high frequency recombination, probably occurring during reverse transcription and the accompanying processes of duplicative transposition and amplification, have been a major determinant in the mode of evolution of the VL30 gene family.",,,,"['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K.']",,,,,,,,

SETTING: Medical, pediatric, and intensive care units of a tertiary-care cancer treatment center. PATIENTS: Consecutive cases of 10 patients in the study group and of 11 patients in a historical control group with evidence of cytomegalovirus pneumonia after bone marrow transplantation for treatment of leukemia or congenital immune deficiency.

CONCLUSIONS: Ganciclovir, when combined with high-dose intravenous immune globulin, appears to have significantly altered the outcome of patients with cytomegalovirus pneumonia after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.",,"['CA 23766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08-CA00984/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08-CA00984-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",,,,,,,,

Infection without neoplastic transformation also was obtained in pigs, rhesus monkeys, chimpanzees, and rabbits, and was observed in capybaras and water buffaloes. Structurally and functionally, BLV is a relative of the human T lymphotropic viruses (HTLV-I and HTLV-II). HTLV-I induces in humans a T cell leukemia, and its type II counterpart has been found in dermatopathic lymphadenopathy, hairy T cell leukemia and prolymphocytic leukemia cases. At variance with HTLV-I, BLV has not been associated with neurological diseases of the degenerative type. BLV, HTLV-I, and HTLV-II show clearcut sequence homologies. The pathology of the BLV-induced disease, most notably, the absence of chronic viremia, a long latency period, and a lack of preferred proviral integration sites in tumors, is similar to that of adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma induced by HTLV-I. The most striking feature of the three naturally transmitted leukemia viruses is the X region located between the env gene and the LTR sequence. The X region contains several overlapping long open reading frames. One of them designated XBL-I encodes a trans-activator function capable of increasing the level of gene expression directed by BLV-LTR and most probably involved in ""genetic instability"" of BLV-infected cells of the B cell lineage. The genetic instability puts the cell into a context of fragility and ready to move along a number of stages towards full malignancy. Little is known about these events and their causes; we have presented some theoretical possibilities. BLV infection has a worldwide distribution. In temperate climates the virus spreads mostly via iatrogenic transfer of infected lymphocytes. In warm climates and in areas heavily populated by hematophageous insects, there are indications of insect-born propagation of the virus.",,,,"['Faculty of Agronomy, Gembloux, Belgium.']",97,,,,,,,

The genomic structure of retroviruses, so reminiscent of bacterial transposons and other similar genetic elements, and reverse transcriptase, which leads to the reverse flow of genetic information from RNA to DNA, are responsible for many of the properties of these viruses which make them both fascinating and important as causes of cancer and other diseases. The requirement for integration shared by most retroviruses leads directly to most of the phenomena resulting from their interaction with target cells. Certainly latency, at the level of the organism, is one such property relevant to how we think of vaccines and therapeutic reagents. The ability of retroviruses to acquire oncogenes from cellular DNA has greatly facilitated our understanding of the genetics of neoplasia. Additionally, the use of retroviral vectors to introduce new genes into genetically defective animals is a consequence of the genetic organization of retroviruses. Classification of viruses at the species level is difficult for several reasons. In particular, viruses do not sexually reproduce in any conventional sense, and it is difficult to identify a population of virions which make up a genetically distinct pool. Thus, the definition of individual species is often controversial and is not necessarily aided by the criteria used to define larger phylogenetic groups. In the latter case, retroviruses have distinctive morphological and biochemical features which allow their classification at the family, subfamily, genus, and subgenus levels. Additional classification occurs by accounting for factors such as host range, cross neutralization, ability to compete in interspecies radioimmunoassays, and genetic homology detected by hybridization under conditions of relaxed stringency. Direct comparison of nucleotide sequences offers the hope that mathematical criteria will be developed that can define the level of differences characteristic of individual species, genuses, and subfamilies.",,,,"['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",132,,,,,,,

Persistently infected cats commonly die of secondary opportunistic infections that result from FeLV-induced immunosuppression. The acquired immunosuppression is the most frequent and most devastating consequence of FeLV infection in the cat. Immunosuppression is targeted primarily to the cell-mediated immune system and has been attributed to the viral p15e envelope protein. The decreased IgG response and proliferative response to T cell mitogens is thought to be due to a defect in the helper cell function. As a result of T helper cell immunosuppression, infected cats may also have defective cytotoxic lymphocyte and activated macrophage functions which are regulated by their lymphokines. Research has shown that the virus causes a general suppression in the production of T cell-derived lymphokines, including gamma interferon and interleukin 2. A decrease in the function of polymorphonuclear leukocytes has also been reported and may contribute to deaths due to opportunistic infections in FeLV-positive cats. There are numerous parallels between the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in man and the FeLV-induced immunodeficiency syndrome in cats. Frequent deaths due to opportunistic infections, lymphopenia, depressed cell-mediated immune responses to T cell-dependent antigens despite hypergammaglobulinemia and the presence of a long period of time between infection and the onset of clinical signs are just a few of the syndromes that are similar between the 2 retroviral diseases. A new strain of FeLV, FeLV-FAIDS has been associated with a naturally occurring immunosuppressive syndrome that is strikingly similar to AIDS in man. In addition, a T-lymphotropic retrovirus has recently been identified from cats with an immunodeficiency-like syndrome; this feline lentivirus disease is morphologically similar, but antigenically distinct from the human immunodeficiency virus, the cause of AIDS. Treatment for FeLV immunosuppression is primarily supportive. The development of a soluble tumor cell antigen vaccine has been shown to be efficacious in preventing FeLV infections.",,,,"['College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Illinois, Urbana.']",53,,,,,,,

Structurally and functionally, BLV is a relative of human T lymphotropic viruses 1 and 2 (HTLV-I and HTLV-II) In humans, HTLV-I induces a T-cell leukaemia and its type 2 counterpart has been found in dermatopathic lymphadenopathy, hairy T-cell leukaemia and prolymphocytic leukaemia cases. At variance with HTLV-I, BLV has not been associated with neurological diseases of the degenerative type. Bovine leukaemia virus, HTLV-I and HTLV-II show clearcut sequence homologies. The pathology of the BLV-induced disease, most notably the absence of chronic viraemia, a long latency period and lack of preferred proviral integration sites in tumours, is similar to that of adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma induced by HTLV-I. The most striking feature of these three naturally transmitted leukaemia viruses is the X region located between the env gene and the long terminal repeat (LTR) sequence. The X region contains several overlapping long open reading frames. One of them, designated XBL-I, encodes a trans-activator function capable of increasing the level of gene expression directed by BLV-LTR and most probably is involved in ""genetic instability"" of BLV-infected cells of the B cell lineage. The ""genetic instability"" renders the infected cell susceptible to move, along a number of stages, towards full malignancy. Little is known about these events and their causes; we present some theoretical possibilities. Bovine leukaemia virus infection has a worldwide distribution. In temperate climates, the virus spreads mostly via iatrogenic transfer of infected lymphocytes. In warm climates and in areas heavily populated by haematophagous insects, there are indications of insect-borne propagation of the virus.",,,,"['Faculty of Agronomy, Gembloux, Belgium.']",105,,,,,,,

Subsequently, she became infected with a new EBV strain that differed from her pretransplant strain but was indistinguishable from the virus isolated from her husband. The second patient received marrow from his EBV-seropositive brother. This patient showed only a transient decrease in IgG antibodies to EBV capsid antigen. His pretransplant strain differed from the virus of his donor. On days 252 and 915 after transplantation, lymphoblastoid cell lines were grown from the peripheral blood of the patient and were found to carry exclusively the virus of the donor.

Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) and high affinity specific antagonists bound to the receptor with a rank-order potency equivalent to that for the LTD4 receptors in guinea pig lung. In the [3]myoinositol labeled RBL-1 cells, LTD4 and LTE4 induced a rapid hydrolysis of [3H]phosphoinositides. The biosynthesis of the [3H]inositol-trisphosphate was rapid and was detectable at 15-sec poststimulation. The biosynthesis of [3H]inositol-monophosphate was stereo-selective and specific and was inhibited specifically by receptor antagonists. In fura-2 loaded RBL-1 cells, LTD4 and LTE4 induced a transient intracellular Ca++ mobilization. Agonist-induced Ca++ mobilization was specific and stereo-selective and was inhibited by specific receptor antagonists. The most (greater than 85%) LTD4-induced immediate response of Ca++ mobilization was from intracellular sources, whereas a small amount (less than 15%) was derived from the extracellular milieu. Both components were stimulated by receptor agonists and inhibited by the receptor antagonists, suggesting that they were regulated by the LTD4 membrane receptors. In addition, the results also suggested that a guanine nucleotide binding protein, insensitive to islet activating protein from Bordetella pertussis (not Gi or Go), was involved in the signal transduction mechanisms for LTD4 receptors in RBL-1 cells. These results suggested that the plasma membrane enriched LTD4 receptor was coupled via an islet activating protein insensitive G protein to a phosphoinositide specific phospholipase C. Agonist binding to the receptor could activate phospholipase C and resulted in phosphoinositide hydrolysis.

By comparison, transcripts of IFN-alpha/beta genes were not detected in spleen cells at any time after infection.

Absolute leukocyte count and absolute lymphocyte count were significantly positively correlated with B cell percentage in cows that were seropositive to bovine leukemia virus envelope glycoprotein, but these parameters were not correlated in seronegative cows. The B cell percentage was not affected by age. Cows that had persistent lymphocytosis and hematologically normal seropositive cows had greater mean B cell percentages (78 and 45%, respectively) than did seronegative herdmates (37%). To evaluate B cell percentage as a means of detecting subclinical progression of bovine leukemia virus infection, an index was developed based upon the distribution of B cell percentages in seronegative cows. When this index was compared with a standard hematological key (the European Community's Leukosis Key), which is based on absolute lymphocyte count and age, 29% of seropositive, hematologically normal cows had B cell percentages two standard deviations above the mean of their seronegative herdmates. The B cell percentage was thus shown to be more effective than absolute lymphocyte count for detecting subclinical progression of bovine leukemia virus infection in individual cows.",,,,"['Department of Animal Sciences, University of Illinois, Urbana 61801.']",,,,,,,,

HL-60 cells express very few chemotactic peptide receptors in their undifferentiated state and fail to undergo actin polymerization when stimulated with the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP). However, when the cells were induced to differentiate with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) or retinoic acid, they acquired the ability to undergo actin polymerization on stimulation with FMLP or phorbol myristate acetate. Kinetic experiments revealed that in the first 48 h of retinoic acid treatment there was no increase in the chemotactic peptide receptors on HL-60 cells, but the cells were capable of undergoing actin polymerization on stimulation with FMLP. Similarly, treatment with dbcAMP showed no increase in chemotactic peptide receptors until 24 h but stimulus-induced actin polymerization was demonstrable as early as 4 h after the treatment. In addition, with dbcAMP-treated cells the magnitude of stimulus-induced actin polymerization showed large variation depending on the duration of exposure to the drug. Dual-label studies using propidium iodide to measure DNA content and NBD-phallacidin to measure the F-actin content revealed that these variations were not related to the stages of cell cycle. Cells in all stages of the cell cycle responded to stimulus-induced actin polymerization, but the magnitude of the response appeared to be more in cells in G2/M phase. The observations reported here indicate that the small number of chemotactic peptide receptors present on HL-60 cells are adequate to mount an actin polymerization response, provided the required intracellular mechanisms exist. Differentiation-inducing agents, therefore, must cause changes within the cell, such as induction of actin-binding proteins, to cause actin polymerization following FMLP stimulation. The HL-60 system serves as a useful model for studying the molecular mechanisms regulating stimulus-induced actin polymerization in human neutrophils.",,['R29 DK 38472/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,"['Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.']",,,,,,,,

The cellular receptor for PMA is protein kinase C. However, cellular events distal to protein kinase C phosphorylation are also critical steps toward differentiation. These events may include specific programs of oncogene transcription that have been associated with phorbol ester-induced leukemic cell differentiation. Recently, it has been found that topoisomerase II could be activated by protein kinase C-mediated serine phosphorylation and that PMA treatment of HL-60 cells enhanced extractable topoisomerase II from these cells. Additionally, topoisomerase II-reactive antineoplastic drugs could block PMA-induced differentiation of HL-60. This enzyme has been implicated in gene regulation, and drug-induced, topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage sites have been identified within cellular oncogenes. Thus, topoisomerase II could play a critical role in the signal transduction cascade leading from PMA-protein kinase interaction to monocytoid differentiation. We have examined this relationship between topoisomerase II and PMA-induced differentiation through measurements of drug-induced, topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage (via alkaline elution) in PMA-treated HL-60 cells. Etoposide-induced DNA cleavage was reduced 10-fold in HL-60 cells treated with 10 nM PMA for 24 h. Neither dimethyl sulfoxide (which produces granulocytoid differentiation) nor non-differentiation-inducing phorbol esters could produce this effect. The decreased cleavage was not due to a PMA-induced inhibition of cell-associated etoposide and was demonstrable in nuclei isolated from PMA-treated cells. The decrease was not simply related to decreased cellular proliferation rate as reflected in the inhibition of DNA synthesis because conditions leading to marked inhibition of DNA synthesis did not necessarily inhibit etoposide-induced DNA cleavage. By contrast, lower concentrations of PMA inhibited etoposide-mediated DNA cleavage disproportionately compared with PMA effects on DNA synthesis. Interestingly, PMA reduced cleavage induced by the topoisomerase II-reactive DNA intercalator 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide by 2-fold, suggesting that specific drug-DNA interactions could partially overcome the PMA-induced effect that resulted in decreased etoposide-induced, topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage. Nuclear proteins in 0.35 M NaCl extracts from untreated or PMA-treated HL-60 cells were virtually identical in topoisomerase II activity and in topoisomerase II-associated drug sensitivity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,"['CA40090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR5511-23/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,"['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute, Houston 77030.']",,,,,,,,

On the nature of the antiviral action and binding of IFN, L1210 Sg cells were compared with L1210 m cell line which is sensitive to IFN-gamma. For a half reduction of the vesicular stomatitis virus-RNA synthesis, L1210 Sg cells required 500-fold more IFN-gamma than L1210 m cells did. However, both cell lines were induced to the antiviral state to the same extent with IFN-alpha or -beta. L1210 Sg and L1210 m cells were sensitive to the anti-proliferative action of IFN-alpha and -beta, but insensitive to IFN-gamma. (2'-5')Oligoadenylate synthetase was induced in these cell lines by IFN-beta, but not by IFN-gamma, which suggests that the induction of this synthetase may not be responsible for the antiviral action of IFN-gamma. No substantial difference between L1210 Sg and L1210 m cells was found in IFN receptors for IFN-gamma and IFN-beta either in number per cell or in their affinity to corresponding IFN type. However, differences were noted in time course profiles of cell-associated IFN-gamma at 37 C: in L1210 m cells, a rise-and-decay profile of IFN-gamma bound to cells was observed at 37 C, but in L1210 Sg cells, rise and slight decay was observed. On the other hand, a similar rise-and-decay curve of IFN-beta bound to these cells was observed. These results indicated that the low sensitivity of L1210 Sg cells to IFN-gamma may be due to this slight decay of receptor-bound IFN-gamma.",,,,"['Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University.']",,,,,,,,

Although the vast majority of infected erythroblast clones then differentiated and died out, rare cell clones that were present in only 20 to 30% of the mice grew extensively by 26 to 33 days to form transplantable leukemias. The clonality of these leukemias was established by Southern blot analysis of their DNAs by using several restriction endonucleases and the simian virus 40 tag as a hybridization probe. All transplantable leukemias lacked helper virus contamination and contained a single tagged SFFV provirus that expressed the mitogenic env gene product gp55. The SFFV proviruses in these leukemias also appeared to be integrated into a few tightly clustered sites in the cellular genome. Although the tagged SFFV caused polycythemia during the polyclonal early stage of erythroblastosis, growth of the helper-free clonal erythroleukemias caused severe anemia. These results suggest that a single SFFV can cause mitosis of erythroblasts, and that cell immortalization also occurs when the provirus integrates into a critical site in the host genome.

The promoter of this mRNA must be more than 10 kilobases upstream of the type I promoter region. In two murine thymoma cell lines, LSTRA and Thy19, lck is expressed at elevated levels as a result of Moloney murine leukemia virus retrovirus promoter insertion. p56lck is encoded in these cells by a hybrid virus-lck mRNA containing the 5' untranslated region of Moloney virus mRNA. The structures and the sites of integration of the proviruses upstream of lck in these cells were examined by molecular cloning and Southern analysis. A truncated and rearranged provirus, flanked by 554 nucleotides (nt) of duplicated cellular sequences, was found 962 nt upstream of the start site for type I lck mRNA in LSTRA cells.

Restriction mapping and partial sequencing of a cDNA clone isolated by subtraction analysis demonstrated that the clone, SC34, represents an envelope (env) gene transcript of a mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). In CH12 cells and in normal B cells, levels of MMTV RNA were increased after stimulation with LPS. The env transcript was the predominant MMTV RNA species and increased more dramatically than did levels of the genomic transcript. In differentiating CH12 cells, env transcripts increased as much as 20-fold above levels found in replicating, antibody nonsecreting CH12 cells. The major increase in expression appeared to be associated with B cell differentiation and not replication. By Southern blot analysis, only bands characteristic of endogenous proviruses were found in CH12, indicating that viral sequences were not amplified in this cell line. Restriction mapping indicated that the SC34 cDNA clone was a product of the Mtv-9 locus. Mtv-9 previously was shown to encode a complete MMTV provirus on chromosome 12, on which Ig heavy chain genes also are located. Increases in MMTV transcripts followed distinct kinetics and were quantitatively different from changes in immunoglobulin gene products.

Treatment of v-mos and c-myc transformed cells with murine rTNF-alpha in non-cytotoxic concentrations caused a strong inhibition of both proliferative capacity in monolayer culture and colony formation in soft agar. In contrast, v-Ha-ras transformed cells showed little sensitivity to TNF-alpha treatment. These changes in cell growth characteristics of v-mos and c-myc transformants was preceded by a selective reduction of oncogene-specific steady RNA levels, whereas no RNA down-regulation was observed for v-Ha-ras transformants. An unchanged transcriptional activity of the LTR-controlled v-mos and c-myc genes, but a decreased half-life of oncogene-specific mRNA suggests that TNF-alpha primarily affects stability of v-mos and c-myc RNA without influencing the activity of retroviral promoters. This is confirmed by an unchanged chloramphenicol acetyl transferase activity in TNF-treated LTR-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase transformants. Removal of TNF-alpha from cultures of reverted cells provoked a rapid retransformation, with full recovery of neoplastic growth characteristics 10 days after abrogation of TNF-alpha treatment.

Uniformly 32P-labeled, single-stranded DNA probes (greater than 4 x 10(8) cpm/micrograms) were generated for interleukin 3 (IL-3) and GM-CSF using pTZ based vectors.

GM-CSF mRNA was detected in the two clones that showed the highest IL-3 mRNA levels. Medium conditioned by these cells was able to stimulate IL-3-dependent 32D cells, and IL-3- and GM-CSF-dependent B6SUtA cells, and also supported the growth of a variety of single and multilineage colonies in assays of mouse marrow cells even in the presence of neutralizing antibodies to GM-CSF. Rearrangements of the IL-3 and GM-CSF genes were not apparent by Southern blot analysis. Additional bioassays revealed the presence of two other growth factors: IL-6 (hybridoma growth factor or Ifn-beta 2) assayed on B13.29 cells, a factor-dependent murine B-cell hybridoma; and a new pre-B-cell stimulatory factor different from any of the above.

This stimulation was half-maximal at a vincristine concentration of 4 microM. An enhancement of methotrexate uptake by vincristine was also observed in the presence of glucose but a reversal could be achieved by prior treatment of the cells with taxol, a drug which prevents microtubule disassembly by vincristine. When the effect of vincristine was determined on the individual influx and efflux components for methotrexate, the increased uptake of methotrexate correlated with the inhibition of the unidirectional efflux route for methotrexate that is sensitive to bromosulfophthalein. Inhibition of this route was half-maximal at 3 microM vincristine and it exceeded 90% at high concentrations of the inhibitor. Transport via the bidirectional exchange carrier for methotrexate was not affected by vincristine, while the unidirectional efflux route sensitive to probenecid was inhibited by vincristine but only at concentrations 10-fold higher than required to inhibit the bromosulfophthalein-sensitive route. Vincristine did not increase methotrexate uptake in CCRF-CEM lymphoblasts, a human cell line which contains much lower levels of bromosulfophthalein-sensitive efflux route for methotrexate. Concentrations of vincristine which inhibited the bromosulfophthalein-sensitive efflux route of L1210 cells by 80-90% had little or no effect on the intracellular pH or on intracellular levels of ATP, GTP, cyclic AMP, K+, or oxidized glutathione.

This Ca2+ transient results from both an intracellular mobilization and an influx of Ca2+ through specific membrane channels. The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which receptor-mediated influx of Ca2+ is regulated in JURKAT cells, which demonstrably lack 'voltage-dependent calcium channels'. It was found that upon increased loading with quin2 or 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetate (BAPTA) there was a pronounced decline of both phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated and OKT3-stimulated influx of 45Ca2+. Using 15 microM quin2/AM or 30 microM BAPTA/AM, agonist-stimulated 45Ca2+ influx was almost totally abolished. At these concentrations of both quin2/AM or BAPTA/AM, phytohaemagglutinin and OKT3 could still induce a rise of cytosolic free Ca2+ above 200 nM. In the presence of La3+ (200 microM), which completely inhibited the agonist-induced 45Ca2+ influx, both phytohaemagglutinin and OKT3 were able to raise the concentrations of cytosolic free Ca2+ to well above 200 nM by merely mobilizing Ca2+ from intracellular stores alone. The data suggest that an agonist-induced increase in the concentration of cytosolic free Ca2+, due to mobilization from intracellular stores, could either directly or indirectly, initiate receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane in JURKAT cells.",,,,"['Department of Immunology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,

The purification was achieved by using DEAE chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and affinity chromatography on dTTP-Sepharose. Only one form of deoxycytidine kinase activity was found during all the chromatographic procedures. The subunit molecular mass, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate--polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was 30 kilodaltons. The pure enzyme phosphorylates deoxycytidine, deoxyadenosine, and deoxyguanosine, demonstrating for the first time that the same enzyme molecule has the capacity to use these three nucleosides as substrates. The apparent molecular weight of the active enzyme, determined by gel filtration and glycerol gradient centrifugation, was 60,000. Thus, the active form of human deoxycytidine kinase is a dimer. The kinetic behavior of pure human deoxycytidine kinase was studied in detail with regard to four different phosphate acceptors and two different phosphate donors. The apparent Km values were 1, 20, 150, and 120 microM for deoxycytidine, arabinosylcytosine, deoxyguanosine, and deoxyadenosine, respectively. The Vmax values were 5-fold higher for the purine nucleosides as compared to the pyrimidine substrates. We observe competitive inhibition of the phosphorylation of one substrate by the presence of either of the three other substrates, but the apparent Ki values differed greatly from the corresponding Km values, suggesting the existence of allosteric effects. The double-reciprocal plots for ATP-MgCl2 as phosphate donor were convex, indicating negative cooperative effects. In contrast, plots with varying dTTP-MgCl2 concentration as phosphate donor were linear with an apparent Km of 2 microM.

In our experiments, EBV DNA sequences encoding the virus latent gene products Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA)1, EBNA 2, and EBNA-LP and the latent membrane protein (LMP) were individually expressed in a virus-negative human B-lymphoma cell line, Louckes.

The 53-kilodalton gag precursor polyprotein was processed into the mature p19, p24, and p15 gag proteins when the gag and protease-coding sequence was expressed under the control of a vaccinia virus promoter, suggesting that the protease may be synthesized through the mechanism of ribosomal frame shifting. The processing defect of a protease mutant could be complemented by cointroduction of a wild-type construct into the cell, demonstrating that the pro gene encodes the biologically active protease molecules which are capable of processing the gag precursor polyprotein in vivo in trans. A study involving the use of a variety of mutants constructed in vitro revealed that the protease consists of a nonessential carboxy-terminal region and a part essential for its activity, including the putative catalytic residue, aspartic acid. Furthermore, a cluster of adenine residues positioned at the overlapping region between the gag and pro genes was shown to be involved in the ribosomal frameshifting event for the synthesis of protease. To mimic the formation of the 76-kilodalton gag-pro precursor polyprotein formed by ribosomal slipping, the coding frames of the gag and pro gene were adjusted. The processing of the gag-pro precursor polyprotein depended on an intact protease gene, implying that a cis-acting function of human T-cell leukemia virus type I protease may be necessary to trigger the initial cleavage event that leads to the release of protease from the precursor protein.",,,PMC253515,"['Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Japan.']",,,,,,,,

The 3' LTR of the CFE-6 clone was also sequenced. The endogenous FeLV LTRs, which were very similar to each other in sequence and in organization of the functional domains, differed considerably from the exogenous FeLV LTR in the U3 region. The major differences in U3 included variations in sets of small (14 to 19 base pair) direct repeats, altered location of the simian virus 40 core enhancer-like sequence, and occurrence of three segments of largely nonhomologous sequences. There was extensive homology between endogenous and exogenous FeLV LTRs in sequences beginning from the TATA box through the R region down to the 3' end of the U5 region. The DNA sequence downstream of the 5' LTR encompassing the primer-binding site, leader, and almost to the end of the p15gag coding region, a point up to which the sequencing was carried out, also revealed a high degree of conservation. However, the detection of frameshift and nonsense mutations in this region of a nearly full-length endogenous provirus sequence (CFE-6) predicted its defectiveness and correlated with the lack of infectivity of this DNA. The functional studies of the endogenous LTRs, based on linkage to the bacterial cat gene and transient expression in feline cell lines, indicated that although the basic characteristics for promotion and enhancement of transcription were retained in each LTR, there was a significant variation in the activity of the cat constructs. Reconstruction and deletion analyses with the CFE-6 5' LTR revealed the presence of strong transcription regulatory sequences in the 702-base-pair region immediately upstream of the 5' boundary of the endogenous LTR. These and related data suggest that in addition to the transcription-modulating elements occurring within the LTR, the cis-acting nucleotide sequences in the upstream cellular DNA may determine the overall efficiency of transcription of the defective endogenous FeLV provirus loci of the felid genome.",,['CA40590/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC253504,"['Department of Pathology, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90033.']",,,"['GENBANK/M21479', 'GENBANK/M21480', 'GENBANK/M21481']",,,,,

We previously showed that insertion of the B enhancer element from the PyF101 variant into the M-MuLV LTR between the M-MuLV enhancers and promoter abolished leukemogenicity. PyF101 differs from wild-type polyoma in that it can productively infect undifferentiated F9 embryonal carcinoma cells; this is due to alterations in the B enhancer element. Two additional chimeric M-MuLVs were generated that contained the B enhancers from wild-type polyoma and also from a second host range variant (PyF441), which differs from wild-type polyoma by only a single base change. In contrast to Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV, both Mo+Pywt and Mo+-PyF441 M-MuLV induced T-lymphoid leukemia in neonatal NIH Swiss mice with the same time course as wild-type M-MuLV. Thus the lack of leukemogenicity of Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV was related to the exact nature of the PyF101 B enhancers. While both Mo+Pywt and Mo+PyF441 M-MuLVs induced leukemia, they showed differences when the resulting tumors were examined. First, approximately one-third of the tumors induced by Mo+Pywt M-MuLV contained proviruses which lacked polyoma sequences, while all of the tumors induced by Mo+PyF441 M-MuLV contained proviruses with the chimeric LTR. Second, a majority of tumors induced by Mo+Pywt M-MuLV (and also wild-type, M-MuLV) showed proviral integrations near one or more of the cellular c-myc, pim-1, or pvt-1 loci.

The rearrangement in the DP20-1 cell line is due to the insertion of Friend spleen focus-forming provirus (SFFV) in the 3' end of the p53 gene in intron sequences between exons 9 and 10. Transfection of molecular clones of this SFFV provirus into NIH3T3 cells results in the generation of infectious virus as determined by its ability, in the presence of helper virus, to induce rapid splenomegaly and polycythemia when injected into adult DBA/2J mice. Insertion of SFFV in DP20-1 cells resulted in the expression of an aberrant 2.9 kb RNA species. Analysis of a molecular clone of the rearranged p53 gene in a second cell line, CB3, revealed that the p53 gene in this clone has sustained a large deletion within the p53 gene resulting in the loss of coding sequences between exons 4 and 8. The 5' end of the deletion originates within exon 4 and extends 3' to within the eighth intron.

The MoLV-infected mice showed a progressive loss of endogenous and augmented NK activity, correlated with the development of the leukemic state. Mixing of spleen cells from tumor-bearing mice with NK-augmented splenocytes resulted in suppression of NK activity. In addition, mixing of T cell lines isolated from MoLV-induced tumors with augmented splenocytes also resulted in the down-regulation of NK cell activity. The present study demonstrates that tumor cells from leukemic organs and leukemic T cell lines can actively suppress NK cell function.

We therefore tested splenic NK cell levels in C57BL/Ka (susceptible) and B10.A(5R) (resistant) mice before viral inoculation, immediately after viral inoculation, and throughout the preleukemic period and showed that they were not different.

Using cDNA and intron specific probes for MPO we studied the regulation of MPO expression during myeloid differentiation of the promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia cell line. Mature MPO mRNA species of 3.3, 2.8 and 1.6 kb and heterogeneous nuclear (hn) RNA of greater than 8 and approximately 4 kb were observed in wildtype HL-60 cells. Induction of differentiation of the cells towards either granulocytes or macrophages resulted in a profound decrease (greater than 95%) in the concentration of MPO mRNA levels, showing that gene expression of MPO mRNA is closely linked to the stage of development of myeloid cells. Studies using normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells confirmed these findings and showed that myeloblasts and promyelocytes contain MPO mRNA. Rate of transcription of MPO was measured by a nuclear run-on assay in wild-type and day 3- and day -4 differentiated HL-60 cells and was nearly the same in all three. In contrast, rate of transcription of c-myc in the same nuclei became almost undetectable with induction of differentiation. Overall transcription decreased by 60% and 80% on day 3 and 4 of differentiation, respectively, compared to wild-type cells. Stability of mature MPO mRNA was also measured and found to be the same in wild-type and differentiated HL-60. Half-life of MPO hnRNA was less than or equal to 30 min in wild-type HL-60; nevertheless, this hnRNA was easily detectable 3 days after induction of differentiation of these cells. Taken together, the results show that decreased expression of MPO mRNA with differentiation occurs in part post-transcriptionally, possibly due to a failure in RNA processing. In addition, as overall transcription decreases during differentiation, MPO transcription is concomitantly reduced.

Transformation can alter their growth factor requirements, the ability of the cells to differentiate, or both. To identify genes that are capable of transforming hematopoietic cells, IL-3-dependent cell lines, isolated from retrovirus induced myeloid leukemias, were examined for viral insertions in proto-oncogenes and in common sites of viral integration. Five of 37 cell lines contained proviruses in a common viral integration site termed the ecotropic virus integration 1 site (Evi-1). The integrations were correlated with the activation of transcription from the locus. Sequencing of cDNA clones and genomic clones demonstrated that the integrations had occurred near or in 5' noncoding exons of a novel gene. The sequence of the cDNA clones predicts that the gene product is a 120 kd protein that contains two domains with seven and three repeats of a DNA binding consensus sequence (zinc finger) initially described in the Xenopus transcription factor III A (TFIIIA).

Rates of PDGF secretion did not correlate with specific changes in the pattern of expression of PDGF mRNA. In the human tumor system PDGF A- and B-chain transcripts were present at similar levels before and after transplantation in the nude mouse. In the 3T3 cell system, B-chain transcripts were detected only after transformation, and there was no change in the low basal expression of A-chain.

Two patients were found to have testicular scars and were dropped from the study. Nongerm cell malignant transformation of a teratoma occurred in five of the remaining 17 patients (29%), resulting in three adenocarcinomas and two sarcomas. Another patient developed leukemia. Metastatic disease most commonly involved the lungs, mediastinal lymph nodes, liver, bone, retroperitoneum, and heart. Respiratory failure was the cause of death in 12 patients. Of the possible mechanisms of germ cell transformation into malignant nongerm cell tumors discussed, this study suggests that chemotherapy alone is unlikely to induce stem cell differentiation.

Extensive physicochemical and biological investigations have been performed in this series including the determination of hydrophobic properties, interaction parameters with DNA and polynucleotides, interaction with DNA topoisomerase II in vitro, diffusion through cell membranes, accessibility to genomic DNA in cells and in chromatin preparations and finally, cytotoxic and anti-tumor activities. Establishment of relationships between physicochemical data and biological properties have been attempted. The results show that all the OPCd compounds display favorable parameters in terms of association constant values to DNA, accessibility to DNA in chromatin structure and permeation through cellular membranes. However, in contrast with intercalating drugs such as m-AMSA, adriamycin and 9-hydroxyellipticinium, OPCd compounds are not able to generate cleavable complexes in DNA through the interaction with topoisomerase II.

By using known cell numbers from eight leukemic bone marrow samples and four leukemic cell lines, the modified extraction procedure consistently had better yields of DNA, compared with a standard procedure. These findings were confirmed by further comparisons of DNA yields from 14 hypocellular clinical specimens that had been divided into two equal parts for side-by-side DNA extraction with both methods. The quality of the DNA from the modified extraction method was similar to standard methods on subsequent Southern blot analysis and hybridization with immunoglobulin and/or T-cell receptor gene probes.

Despite this difference in its env gene, HoMuLV appears to use the same ecotropic cell-surface receptor since it infects only hamster and mouse somatic cell hybrids which contain the Rec-1 ecotropic virus receptor on chromosome 5. Furthermore, HoMuLV does not infect mice carrying the Fv-4r allele which is thought to prevent ecotropic virus infection through an interference mechanism.

These clones were selected from the parental line by virtue of their rescue by interferon treatment from the cytopathic effects of EMCV infection. In one such clone, RK8, the replication of VSV and EMCV and the production of resident murine leukemia virus were inhibited by interferon. On the other hand, in clone RK6, which was isolated without any selection, the replication of VSV, but not of EMCV, was impaired by interferons. The levels of 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase mRNA and enzyme activity were similarly elevated upon interferon treatment in the two clones. However, the level of RNase L, as determined by binding and cross-linking of a radiolabeled 2'-5'-oligoadenylate derivative, was much lower in RK6 cells than in RK8 cells. In accord with this observation, the introduction of 2'-5'-oligoadenylates into cells inhibited protein synthesis much less strongly in RK6 cells than in RK8 cells.

Previously, we have described a mink cell focus-inducing (MCF) murine leukemia virus, MCF 1233, which induces not only lymphoblastic T-cell lymphomas but also follicle center cell or lymphoblastic B-cell lymphomas. We now report that the outcome of neonatal infection with MCF 1233 in H-2-congenic C57BL/10 and C57BL/6 mice is decisively influenced by the H-2 I-A locus. A total of 64% of H-2 I-Ak, d mice [B10.BR, B10.D2, B10.A(2R), B10.A(4R), and B10.MBR] developed T-cell lymphomas after MCF 1233 infection (mean latency, 37 weeks). In contrast, H-2 I-Ab [B10, B10.A(5R), B6], H-2 I-Ab/k [(B10.A x B10)F1 and (B10 x B10.A)F1], and H-2 I-Abm12 (bm12) mice were resistant against T-cell lymphomagenesis, but 65% of these H-2 I-Ab, b/k, bm12 animals developed B-cell lymphomas (mean latency, 71 weeks). Animals of T-cell lymphoma-susceptible strains that escaped from T-cell lymphomagenesis developed B-cell lymphomas with similar frequency as animals of T-cell lymphoma-resistant strains, but with a shorter latency. H-2 class II-determined regulation of antiviral immunity was reflected in the presence of high titers of antiviral envelope antibodies in T-cell lymphoma-resistant B-cell lymphoma-susceptible H-2 I-Ab, b/k, bm12 mice, whereas in T-cell lymphoma-susceptible H-2 I-Ak,d mice no antiviral antibodies were found. At week 4 after neonatal MCF 1233 infection, a high percentage of thymocytes were virally infected in both T-cell lymphoma-susceptible and -resistant mice. However, T-cell lymphoma-resistant animals cleared the thymic infection between weeks 4 and 10 of age, coinciding with a sharp rise in serum levels of antiviral antibodies.

Here we question whether this virus:cell interaction is unique to malignant BL cells or whether it might be reproduced by in vitro infection of those particular germinal centre cells displaying the BL-like phenotype. Firstly, we show by biochemical means that a subset of normal tonsillar B cells does indeed express the globotriaosylceramide glycolipid BLA and the common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia antigen CALLA, 2 important markers of the BL phenotype. Secondly, using 2-colour immunofluorescence labelling with anti-BLA and anti-CALLA monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), 4 subsets of low buoyant density tonsillar B cells (BLA+ CALLA+, BLA+ CALLA-, BLA- CALLA+, BLA- CALLA-) have been separated by means of a FACS and tested for their susceptibility to EBV-induced growth transformation in a limiting dilution assay. The BLA+ CALLA+ (i.e., BL-like) subset contained the highest proportion of cells already actively in cycle in vivo and gave the lowest yield of transformants, perhaps reflecting the greater efficiency with which EBV transforms resting target cells.

The effect of ATP[gamma S] was half-maximal at a concentration of 2 microM, was observed in the absence of added GDP and occurred with a lag period two times longer than the one with GTP[gamma S]. HL-60 membranes exhibited nucleoside-diphosphate kinase activity, catalyzing the thiophosphorylation of GDP to GTP[gamma S] by ATP[gamma S]. GTP[gamma S] formation was half-maximal at a concentration of 3-4 microM ATP[gamma S] and was suppressed by removal of GDP by creatine kinase/creatine phosphate (CK/CP). The stimulatory effect of ATP[gamma S] on O2- formation was abolished by the nucleoside-diphosphate kinase inhibitor UDP. Mg2+ chelation with EDTA and removal of endogenous GDP by CK/CP abolished NADPH oxidase activation by ATP[gamma S] and considerably diminished stimulation by GTP[gamma S]. GTP[gamma S] also served as a thiophosphoryl group donor to GDP, with an even higher efficiency than ATP[gamma S]. Transthiophosphorylation of GDP to GTP[gamma S] was only partially inhibited by CK/CP.

An excess of LGLs was found only in the blood and bone marrow. After splenectomy the patient received an alpha 2-interferon (alpha 2-IFN) treatment. The HCs surface phenotype was mu+delta+kappa+, CD20+, and CD25+. The LGLs consisted in CD3+, CD8+, HNK1+, WT31+ T lymphocytes. These were absent in the spleen. alpha 2-IFN treatment resulted in the disappearance of the HCs in the blood and bone marrow, whereas the LGLs remained unchanged. Before alpha 2-IFN treatment, peripheral blood cells, predominantly LGLs, exerted low cytotoxicity that increased up to a normal level after treatment. Using Southern blotting the authors studied the rearrangements of the T-cell receptor beta--chain (C beta) and gamma-chain (J gamma) genes and immunoglobulin heavy (JH)- and light (C kappa, C lambda)- chain genes. An unique JH and C kappa gene rearrangement was found in the blood and spleen, whereas C beta and J gamma gene rearrangements were present in the blood, not in the spleen. Under alpha 2-IFN treatment, the JH gene rearrangement fainted dramatically, in contrast to that of the C beta gene. The study of messenger RNA (mRNA) of the T cell receptor alpha and beta chains evidenced the 1.3-kilobase (kb) and 1.6-kb bands in the blood and their absence in the spleen. The patient was human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-II negative by Southern analysis of blood and spleen cells. It is concluded that the LGL expansion was clonal and not reactive to the HCL.

DUP 785 inhibits the mitochondrial enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, blocking the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate. We examined the influence of exposure time to DUP 785 on its growth-inhibitory effects in L1210 murine leukemia and WiDR human adenocarcinoma cells and the effects of pyrimidine (deoxy) nucleosides on reversal of growth-inhibition. The results were correlated with changes in intracellular pyrimidine nucleotide pools and cell cycle distribution. In L1210 cells, a continuous exposure to 25 microM DUP 785 up to 96 hr caused complete growth inhibition. A 2 hr exposure of cells to the drug did not affect growth. In WiDR cells, exposure to the drug for 1-24 hr, followed by cultivation in drug-free medium resulted in recovery of growth. However, cells exposed to the drug for 48 hr or longer were not able to resume growth when recultured in drug-free medium. Reversal studies were performed to know whether selective depletion of one of the pyrimidine (deoxy) nucleotides might be related to the growth-inhibitory effects of DUP 785. Neither thymidine, deoxycytidine alone, deoxycytidine plus tetrahydrouridine; nor cytidine plus tetrahydrouridine added after 24 hr were able to reverse cell growth inhibition induced by 25 microM DUP 785. However, uridine and cytidine alone reversed growth inhibition. UTP and CTP pools in L1210 cells decreased to about 30-40% of control levels after 4 hr of drug exposure, while dTTP and dCTP pools decreased to about 30% of control levels. There were no significant changes in purine nucleotide pools. In WiDR cells, UTP and CTP pools decreased rapidly after drug exposure and were substantially depleted after 24 hr. Reculture of cells in drug-free medium resulted in a significant recovery of UTP and CTP levels only for cells exposed to DUP 785 for 1-24 hr. For cells exposed to the drug for 48 and 72 hr recovery of nucleotide pools was minimal. In L1210 cells, a 12-hr exposure to the drug caused an accumulation of cells in the early S-phase. In WiDR cells, there was a clear accumulation of cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle after 24 hr drug exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,,,"['Department of Oncology, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,

Management of the resulting increased susceptibility to infections may require supplementation of antibiotic therapy with additional forms of treatment, including passive immunization with antibodies. This review discusses the use of immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous administration (IVIG) in patients with secondary immunodeficiencies associated with neoplasia. A suitable model for evaluating the prophylactic effect of IVIG is chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Many observations suggest that IVIG reduces the frequency of acute respiratory infections. Another malignant condition with decreased serum levels of polyclonal immunoglobulins and high frequency of infections is multiple myeloma. A crossover study recently demonstrated that IVIG significantly (P less than 0.01) reduced the frequency of respiratory tract infections in these patients. Furthermore the prophylactic effect of IVIG was evaluated in patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung. In a randomized prospective trial it was noticed that IVIG applied during intensive chemotherapy and irradiation courses significantly (P = 0.04) reduced the frequency of infections. Evidence for a therapeutic effect of IVIG was obtained in adult tumor patients and in children with leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who developed severe varicella-zoster virus infections. The treatment effectively controlled fever, skin lesions and neuralgia and prevented progression of the infection. Therapeutic usefulness of IVIG in bacterial infections is still based on anecdotal evidence. Experimental data suggest that in addition to effects mediated by specific antibodies, nonspecific interactions of IgG molecules with Fc-receptors on macrophages may be clinically important.",,,,"['Institute for Clinical and Experimental Cancer Research, University of Berne, Switzerland.']",18,,,,,,,

By assessing colony formation in semi-solid medium, we have compared the potential of bone marrow cells from E mu-myc mice and their normal littermates for transformation by Harvey murine sarcoma virus and Abelson murine leukemia virus. E mu-myc bone marrow yielded more lymphoid colonies than normal marrow after infection with Harvey virus. The increased transformation frequency may reflect increased clonogenicity due to complementation between myc and ras and/or the increased number of pre-B cells in E mu-myc marrow. Surprisingly, however, the number of lymphoid colonies induced by Abelson virus was not enhanced. Our interpretation of these results is that the primary Abelson target is more primitive than the pre-B cells expressing the E mu-myc transgene and is therefore not present at increased frequency in the E mu-myc marrow. The cells from most virus-infected E mu-myc colonies failed to grow indefinitely when placed in liquid culture in the absence of a feeder layer.

These studies suggest that EA is related to a non-reversible block of primitive erythroid progenitors or to direct inhibition of BFU-e and CFU-e growth.",,,,"['Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210.']",,,,,,,,

Propionic acid induced a rapid and dose-dependent mobilization of calcium that relied on both internal and external sources of calcium. The effects of propionic acid on the mobilization of calcium were inhibited by pertussis toxin, but not cholera toxin, implicating a guanine nucleotide binding protein. Furthermore, preincubation of the neutrophils with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate resulted in a decreased mobilization of calcium. This inhibitory activity of phorbol myristate acetate was antagonized by the protein kinase C inhibitor H-7. Preincubation of the cells with the synthetic chemotactic factor fMet-Leu-Phe caused a reduction in the magnitude of the calcium transient elicited by propionic acid. However, the calcium response to propionic acid was not affected by antagonists of fMet-Leu-Phe and platelet-activating factor binding or by an inhibitor of leukotriene synthesis. Propionic acid did not elicit a mobilization of calcium in monocytes, platelets, lymphocytes, or undifferentiated HL-60 cells.

The viral gene expression of HIV-2 as well as SIV can be stimulated by T cell activators, such as mitogens and phorbol esters. HIV-2 and SIV display a much broader transactivation response specificity than does HIV-1. The LTR-directed gene expression of HIV-2/SIV is not only transactivated by their own tat gene and by HIV-1 tat gene but also by factors in human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) and simian virus 40 (SV40) infected cells, involving HTLV-I tat gene and SV40 T antigens, respectively. HIV-1 LTR-directed gene expression is much less transactivated by HIV-2/SIV tat genes and by factors in HTLV-I- and SV40-infected cells. Immune activation and heterologous transactivation of the LTR-directed gene expression may be relevant to the latency of virus infection and progression toward the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).",,,,"['Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",,,,,,,,

A particularly useful system to study the mechanism of tumorigenesis is a small group of avian retroviruses that carry two oncogenes. These viruses causes acute leukemias and can transform hematopoietic cells in vitro. The mechanisms by which viral oncogenes affect the growth control and differentiation of their target cells is now understood in fair detail for two of these virus strains. In the avian erythroblastosis virus AEV, the v-erbB oncogene deregulates the growth control of erythroid precursors, while verbA blocks their terminal differentiation into erythrocytes. Based on the findings that v-erbB oncogene corresponds to a mutated growth factor receptor gene and that v-erbA corresponds to a mutated hormone receptor gene, models have been developed that explain the function of these two oncogenes on a molecular basis. The myelomonocytic leukemia virus MH2 acts by a completely different mechanism. In this case, the v-myc oncogene stimulates the proliferation of macrophage-like cells, while the v-mil gene stimulates them to produce their own growth factor, thus leading to autocrine growth. It will be interesting to determine whether the type of mechanisms of oncogene cooperativity elucidated for acute leukemia viruses are also operative during leukemogenesis in humans.",,,,"['Europaischen Laboratorium fur Molekularbiologie, Heidelberg.']",22,Onkogene und Leukamieentstehung.

Recently a key component of the oxidase, phagocyte cytochrome b, has been characterized as a heterodimer of a 91-kDa glycoprotein and a 22-kDa polypeptide. The present studies examined the effects of human recombinant interferon gamma on the expression of the genes for these components of the cytochrome b. In vitro treatment with interferon gamma substantially increases the level of phagocyte cytochrome b heavy chain gene transcripts in normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes, normal monocyte-derived macrophages, and the monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. Light chain gene transcripts are less affected. In monocyte-derived macrophages and THP-1 cells, the enhanced expression of the heavy chain gene appears in large part attributable to increased rates of transcription. Treatment of monocyte-derived macrophages with human recombinant interferon alpha (a down-regulator of the respiratory burst) decreased the heavy chain transcript levels; interferon beta produced no detectable change.

JURKAT cells were made permeable to Al3+, F-, GTP, and a nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S), by treatment with pseudomonal cytotoxin. In the presence of AlCl3 NaF stimulated the release of inositol phosphates in the cytotoxin-treated JURKAT cells. NaF plus AlCl3 induced increases in inositol tris-, bis-, and mono-phosphates and decreases in PtdIns(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol within 5 min after addition to the cytotoxin-treated cells at 37 C. GTP gamma S stimulated, to some extent, polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis in the cytotoxin-treated JURKAT. The cytotoxin-treated JURKAT cells retained the ability to respond to anti-Leu-4 with polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis. It has been shown that Al3+ in the presence of F- modulates the activity of various guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins. Therefore, the results obtained in this study indicate that a guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein regulates the polyphosphoinositide breakdown in JURKAT cells by influencing phosphodiesterase activity.",,,,"['Department of Biochemistry, Sapporo Medical College.']",,,,,,,,

Immunoassays for human transferrin demonstrated that these cells contained immunoreactive human transferrin. Immunofluorescence studies showed that the protein is expressed on the surface of cells, presumably bound to transferrin receptor. Media conditioned by NCI-H510 cells support proliferation of human leukemic cells that would not survive in media lacking transferrin. [35S]Methionine incorporation documented transferrin synthesis by NCI-H510 cells as well as three other small cell lines. Transferrin synthesis by NCI-H510 cells increased more than 10-fold when cells entered active phases of the cell cycle, and this increase was seen before large increases in transferrin-receptor expression. Further experiments examining the effects of agents that affect iron metabolism show that the addition of transferrin-iron or hemin to the media is associated with a more rapid initial rate of proliferation and lower rates of transferrin synthesis than control cells. Gallium salts, which inhibit iron uptake, inhibited proliferation of these cells. If the cells recovered from this effect, transferrin synthesis remained greatly increased compared to control. We conclude that transferrin synthesis by these malignant cells is ultimately related to an iron requirement for cellular proliferation. It appears that this synthesized transferrin acts as part of an important autocrine mechanism permitting proliferation of these cells, and perhaps permitting tumor cell growth in vivo in areas not well vascularized.",,['R01 AM-27039/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],PMC303513,"['Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver 80262.']",,,,,,,,

These effects are initiated by the binding of TNF to high affinity cell surface receptors. The post-receptor events and signaling mechanisms induced by TNF, however, have remained unknown. The present studies demonstrate the presence of a single class of high affinity receptors on membranes prepared from HL-60 promyelocytic leukemic cells. The interaction of TNF with these membrane receptors was associated with a 3.8-fold increase in specific binding of the GTP analogue, GTP gamma S. Scatchard analysis of GTP gamma S binding data demonstrated that TNF stimulates GTP binding by increasing the affinity of available sites. The TNF-induced stimulation of GTP binding was also associated with an increase in GTPase activity. Moreover, the increase in GTPase activity induced by TNF was sensitive to pertussis toxin. The results also demonstrate that TNF similarly increased GTP binding and pertussis toxin-sensitive GTPase activity in membranes from mouse L929 fibroblasts, thus indicating that these effects are not limited to hematopoietic cells. Analysis of HL-60 membranes after treatment with pertussis toxin in the presence of [32P]NAD revealed three substrates with relative molecular masses of approximately Mr 41,000, 40,000, and 30,000. In contrast, L929 cell membranes had only two detectable pertussis toxin substrates of approximately Mr 41,000 and 40,000. Although the Mr 41,000 pertussis toxin substrate represents the guanine nucleotide-binding inhibitory protein Gi, the identities of the Mr 40,000 and Mr 30,000 substrates remain unclear. In any event, inhibition of the TNF-induced increase in GTPase activity and ADP-ribosylation of Gi by pertussis toxin suggested that TNF might act by increasing GTPase activity of the Gi protein. However, the results further indicate that TNF has no detectable effect on basal or prostaglandin E2-stimulated cAMP levels in HL-60 cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein other than Gi, and possibly the Mr 40,000 substrate, is involved in the action of TNF. Finally, the demonstration that pertussis toxin inhibited TNF-induced cytotoxicity in L929 cells supports the presence of a GTP-binding protein which couples TNF-induced signaling to a biologic effect.",,,,"['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",,,,,,,,

Certified mortality fell about 60% for leukaemias, 21% for lymphomas, 66% for Wilms' tumours, 40% for bone sarcomas and 30% for other and unspecified sites. Thus, the overall decline in childhood cancer mortality in Switzerland was around 45%, slightly more marked in females (-48%) than in males (-42%), and more pronounced in younger children (over 50% before age 5). This corresponds to an absolute number of about 50 deaths from childhood cancer per year avoided in the early 1980s as compared with expected numbers computed on the basis of rates registered in the 1950s (30 deaths per year for leukaemias alone). The estimated total number of deaths avoided during the whole period 1960-1980 was 820 (430 leukaemias alone).

In particular, HTLV-I infected T cells synthesize interleukin-2 receptor alpha (IL-2R alpha) chain, which is probably induced through the mediation of the tat-I gene product of the virus. Activated T cells contain a trascription factor called NF-kappa B, which stimulates the expression of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) by binding to an 11-base-pair enhancer sequence called kappa B. We have now found evidence that a similar transcription factor is involved in the induction of IL-2R alpha expression by tat-I. We have identified a sequence upstream of IL-2R alpha which is the same as the kappa B site at 9 of 11 base pairs, competes for binding to the kappa B sequence, and serves as a tat-I responsive element when multiple copies are inserted upstream of a heterologous promoter. The tat-I product also induces kappa B and the IL-2R alpha kappa B binding activity in transfected Jurkat T lymphoid leukaemia cells.

Two such tumors, which developed in the peritoneal cavity with average latencies of 68 to 71 d and incidences of greater than 50%, are 1) the McML, mature monocyte-macrophage tumors induced by retroviral constructs containing exons 2 and 3 of c-myc cDNA, and 2) the MML, promonocytic tumors induced by Moloney murine leukemia virus infection and its integration into the c-myb locus. Development of both neoplasms is clearly dependent on the intense i.p. inflammatory response, inasmuch as mice given the viruses and not pristane fail to develop these tumors. Although both types of tumors appear in the peritoneal cavity, the MML tumors that arise by i.v. injection of Moloney murine leukemia virus may actually originate via infection, and perhaps transformation, of precursor hemopoietic cells outside the peritoneal cavity, followed by migration of the cells to the peritoneal cavity. This is suggested by the fact that i.v.v but not i.p. injection of virus is an efficient method of producing these particular myeloid tumors. Although both McML and MML tumors require the inflammatory environment for their development, treatment of mice with a nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug, indomethacin, has no effect on McML monocyte/macrophage tumors but completely prevents the development of the MML promonocyte tumors.",,,,"['Laboratory of Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",,,,,,,,

MTX influx was markedly depressed due to a decrease in Vmax without a change in Km. From this cell line a clonal variant with greater resistance to MTX was identified due solely to a further decrease in influx Vmax. Trans-stimulation of MTX influx by 5-formyltetrahydrofolate was induced in parental but not resistant cells. Analysis of specific MTX surface binding demonstrated a small increase in the number of carriers in the first- and second-step resistant lines. Affinity labeling of cells with an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester derivative of [3H]MTX demonstrated carriers with comparable molecular weights in the parent and second-step transport defective lines. In two partial revertants with increased MTX sensitivity isolated from the second-step resistant lines, MTX influx was increased but surface membrane-binding sites were unchanged suggesting that recovery of transport was due to normalization of carrier function rather than an increase in the number of carriers. These studies suggest that impaired MTX transport in these lines is not due to an alteration in the association of the transport carrier with its substrate at the cell surface. Rather, resistance may be due to an alteration in the mobility of the carrier possibly associated with a protein change in the carrier itself or the cell membrane that surrounds it.",,"['CA-09564/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NHLBI-07110/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298.']",,,,,,,,

This variant (L1210/R83), which was selected in the presence of the antifolate metoprine, exhibited a 40-fold increase in [3H]aminopterin influx compared to parental cells and a modest (4-5-fold) increase in [3H]aminopterin efflux. The increase in influx was associated with a comparable increase in influx Vmax for the one-carbon, reduced folate transport system and the same increase in the amount of specific binding of [3H]aminopterin on the cell surface. Values for influx Km for [3H]aminopterin and specificity for various folate structures were unchanged. The alteration in influx Vmax and more rapid efflux accounted for the different level of intracellular exchangeable level of drug at steady state in this variant compared with parental L1210 cells. Otherwise, membrane potential was unchanged. The N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of [3H]aminopterin was used to covalently label the specific binding protein for folate compounds in the plasma membrane of variant and parental L1210 cells. Incorporation of label into this protein was stable under a variety of conditions and accounted for 97 and 52% of total cellular labeling, respectively, for membrane derived from R83 and parental L1210 cells at a reagent concentration of 20 nM. Specific affinity labeling on the surface of parental and variant cells was decreased in the presence of aminopterin, methotrexate, or 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, but not in the presence of folic acid. Also, [3H]aminopterin influx in these cells was inhibited by the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of aminopterin or methotrexate, but not the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of folic acid. These findings, in addition to the increased affinity labeling of this variant, which corresponds to the increase in influx of [3H] aminopterin also seen, appears to identify the affinity labeled protein as a component of the ""classical"" one-carbon, reduced folate transport system in these cells. The affinity labeled protein from each cell type was solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate or extracted in detergent in the presence of proteinase inhibitors and was found to elute from Sephacryl S-300 and migrate during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a single peak of Mr = 45,000-48,000.

For the investigation, [3H]RA and [3H]Am80 with high specific radioactivities (more than 50 Ci/mmol) were used. [3H]Am80 was prepared by hydrogenolysis of the corresponding chlorinated derivative of Am80 with tritium gas. The retinoids RA, Am80 and Ch55 were efficiently taken up by HL-60 cells, and induced differentiation of the cells into mature granulocytes. The specific bindings (uptake) of RA, Am80 and Ch55 (the bindings inhibited competitively by the other two retinoids) by HL-60 cells were due to a newly detected binding protein. The protein that bound specifically to RA appeared identical to that which bound specifically to Am80 by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and was named retinoid-specific binding protein (RSBP). One HL-60 cell was found to contain about 1500 molecules of RSBP distributed between the nuclear fraction and cytosolic fraction in proportions of about 4:1. The bindings of the three retinoids (RA, Am80 and Ch55) to RSBP (i.e., formation of retinoid-RSBP complexes) greatly enhanced the affinity of RSBP for the nuclei. The apparent molecular weight of RSBP was estimated to be 95,000 daltons by size exclusion HPLC. The association constants (Ka) of RSBP were calculated to be 2.4 X 10(10) M-1 for RA and 4.4 X 10(10) M-1 for Am80 from Scatchard plots. The bindings of RA, Am80 and Ch55 to RSBP were mutually competitive, indicating that the binding sites for RA, Am80 and Ch55 were identical.

The incidence of the production of six peptide hormones was evaluated in patients with acute leukaemia. Most often the calcitonin gene-related peptides were found to be elevated in sera at the time of diagnosis. The values evaluated for the hormones were: h-CT 46.7%, CGRP 51%, s-CT 20.7%, PTH 15.7%, beta-HCG 15%, and ACTH 11.6%. A significant coincidence of two or more hormones was not observed. In 83.4% of the patients increased concentrations of at least one of the six hormones were found. Clinical and biochemical parameters showed no influence on the serum levels of these peptides. Analysis of elevated hormone serum levels in subtypes of leukaemia revealed that the calcitonin-related hormones were significantly correlated to more immature forms of leukaemia such as AUL and M1. Synthesis of calcitonin gene-related peptides was also seen in established leukaemic cell lines and in buffy coat cells of untreated patients with acute leukaemia. This investigation provides further evidence that peptide hormone production in leukaemic blasts is a common finding. These results further suggest hormone production to be a universal concommitant of neoplasia. A possible influence of these peptide hormones on the biological behaviour of the malignant cells is discussed.",,,,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Phillips-University of Marburg, FRG.']",,,,,,,,

Namely, RA appears to respond to steroid hormone, androgen, and/or vitamin D3, regardless of single or combined use. In particular, it is obvious in androgen, and as our previous reports, high content of acidic ferritin in RBC with RA have changed to more basic ones by treatment with androgen. On the contrary, these drugs were not effective on RAEB, RAEB-T, and CMML. A long-term observation is needed to determine whether the prolonged or decreased occurrence of leukemia could be obtained in the effective cases with RA. Most of the cases who did not develop overt leukemia during this study died of bleeding or infections due to thrombocytopenia or leukocytopenia, thus indicating that supportive therapies are important in patients with MDS.

Furthermore, this drug induced atypical lymphocyte-like cells, which were considered to be differentiated from leukemic cells in case 1, and improvement of pancytopenia in case 3. While hypercalcemia developed during 1 alpha (OH)D3 therapy in case 1, it disappeared within three days after discontinuation.

This trait provides a convenient and inexpensive approach to gender identification of White Leghorn (WL) chicks at hatch, i.e., in a sex-linked mating using k+/k+ males mated with K/- females, the K/k+ male chicks are SF, and the k+/- females are RF. However, in many WL strains, female progeny of SF dams produce fewer eggs and have higher mortality than progeny of RF dams. This loss in productivity has been attributed to higher infection and shedding rates for leukosis viruses (ALV) in SF than in RF dam lines. Because infectious endogenous viruses (EV) can induce immunological tolerance to ALV, we examined the expression and distribution of ev genes in SF and RF siblings from heterozygous K/k+ sires and k+/- dams. Infectious ALV and EV were detected by cocultivation of frozen heparinized blood cells on selected chick embryo fibroblasts and culture supernatants were tested for viral antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests. Specific ev genes were identified as restriction fragment length polymorphisms after hybridization with a recombinant plasmid containing the complete genome of a Rous-associated virus. It was concluded that ev21 and K genes are tightly linked because, in different WL crosses, all SF chicks inherited ev21 but RF siblings uniformly lacked ev21. Alternatively, the K gene in WL may be a mutation resulting from the insertion of ev21 in the k+ gene. The SF chicks which harbor ev21 expressed infectious EV21; evidence that EV21 may influence susceptibility to ALV is presented.",,,,"['US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, East Lansing, Michigan 48823.']",,,,,,,,

The fast band is present only in K562 erythroleukemic cells induced to differentiation and hemoglobin accumulation and in fetal and adult erythroblasts, but absent in uninduced K562 cells. Binding occurs on a short DNA region including the proximal CACCC box, and is not significantly competed by excess gamma-globin fragments containing the CACCC box; the CACCC box appears to be essential for this binding, as shown by the failure of a fragment containing a natural beta-thalassemic mutation (-87, C----G) to bind significantly to nuclear factors.

Mutation of a DNA sequence of the 5'-TGTGG-3' type decreased transcription in vivo specifically in T-lymphocyte cell lines. Extracts of nuclei from different T-lymphocyte cell lines or cells from lymphoid organs resulted in much higher amounts of complexes in vitro with this DNA sequence than did extracts from other cell lines or organs tested. Differences were also found in the sets of complexes obtained with extracts from the different types of cells. The DNA sequence specificities of the different SL3-3 enhancer factor 1 (SEF1) protein complexes were found to be distinct from those of several other previously identified DNA motifs of the TGTGG type because of differences in several nucleotides critical for binding and because these other DNA motifs could not compete with the identified DNA sequence for binding of SEF1. Limited treatment with several different proteases cleaved the SEF1 proteins such that their DNA-binding domain(s) remained and created complexes with decreased and nondistinguishable electrophoretic mobility shifts and with new properties. These results indicate that the SEF1 proteins have a structure with a flexible and relatively vulnerable hinge region linking a DNA-binding domain(s) to a more variable domain(s) with other functions. We suggest that the binding of SEF1 is an essential factor for the T-cell tropism of SL3-3 and the ability of this virus to cause T-cell lymphomas.,,,PMC363322,"['Unit for Applied Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Umea, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,

Consistent with the earlier reports, treatment of RBL-1 cells with PMA resulted in a time- and dose-dependent translocation of PKC from cytosolic to the particulate fractions, sustained for at least 10 min. When RBL-1 cells were treated with LTD4, a small, transient decrease in PKC activity in cytosolic fraction was observed within 7.5 s after LTD4 treatment. This was accompanied by a significant increase of PKC in the particulate fraction. However, at 15 and 30 s, both particulate and cytosolic PKC activities were increased with LTD4 treatment. The activation induced by LTD4 was dose- and time-dependent with maximal effects occurring within 30 s, declining at the later time points. Pretreatment of the cells with 2(R)-hydroxy-3(S)-carboxyethylthio-3-[2-(8-phenyloctyl,pheny l]propanoic acid (SK&F 104353), a high affinity specific LTD4 receptor antagonist, and also with staurosporine, a potent inhibitor of PKC, completely inhibited the LTD4-induced activation of PKC both in the particulate and cytosolic fractions. These results suggest that activation of PKC by LTD4 is different from that elicited by PMA. The ability of SK&F 104353 to block LTD4-induced activation of PKC further suggests that stimulation of PKC might be an important intermediate step in the signal transduction mechanism of the LTD4 receptor in RBL-1 cells.",,,,"['Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Smith Kline & French Laboratories, King of Prussia, PA 19406-0939.']",,,,,,,,

As previously reported, quiescent lymphocytes and lymphocytes stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) showed clearcut changes in the proportions of synthesis of core histone variants and H1 variants. Leukemic lymphocytes freshly obtained from blood showed a pattern of core histone synthesis and H1 synthesis intermediate between that of quiescent and PHA-stimulated lymphocytes; this is probably due to the presence of a mixture of resting and growing cells. When leukemic cells were stimulated to grow by mitogens, the pattern of core histone and H1 variant synthesis was similar to that in mitogen-stimulated normal lymphocytes. Histone variants whose synthesis is associated with the S-phase were not synthesized in leukemic cells treated with the DNA synthesis inhibitors hydroxyurea and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C). The pattern of acetylation of histone H4 was also apparently similar in leukemic cells and normal lymphocytes. The radioactivity associated with the ubiquitinated forms of H2A increased in nongrowing lymphocytes and in leukemic cells treated with DNA synthesis inhibitors whereas they decreased after mitogenic stimulation. Variability was wide in the synthesis of ubiquitinated H2A in different cases of leukemia.

However, recent studies have shown that decreased retention alone cannot account for anthracycline resistance, and possibly other factors, such as drug metabolism, free radical scavengers, and altered DNA damage/repair, may be involved. We have measured DOX-induced DNA damage and its repair in P388 cells sensitive (P388/S) and resistant (P388/R) to DOX. Our studies show 2- to 5-fold less DNA damage, measured as protein-associated single-strand DNA breaks, in P388/R cells when compared to similarly treated P388/S cells. The repair of DNA in whole cells, expressed as percent DNA rejoined, was complete in 4 hr in P388/R, whereas no repair was seen in P388/S cells until 20 hr. No difference in repair of DNA lesions was observed when nuclei were used in repair experiments. The absence of repair in sensitive whole cells may be due to high retention or slow drug efflux. Increase of cellular DOX retention by exposure of cells to trifluoperazine (TFP) or verapamil (VPL) did not result in the increase of DNA damage in P388/R cells. DOX analogs, N-trifluoroacetyladriamycin-14-valerate (AD 32), 4'-O-tetrahydropyranyladriamycin (THP-adriamycin), and N-benzyladriamycin-14-valerate (AD 198), induced 2- to 4-fold more DNA damage than DOX in resistant cells. There was no difference in the poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis of P388/S and P388/R cells exposed to DOX or AD 32. Since ADP-ribose polymer synthesis is associated with free radical-induced DNA damage and is indicative of DNA repair by an excision-repair mechanism, data from these studies suggest that DNA breaks in anthracycline-exposed cells may not be due to free radical production but rather to other mechanisms, such as inhibition of DNA topoisomerase II activity. The present studies, in addition to emphasizing the role of DNA damage in resistance, also underscore the relative importance of DNA topoisomerase II function in anthracycline cytotoxicity.",,"['37209/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA 29360/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 37082/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['Division of Experimental Therapeutics, Papanicolaou Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, FL.']",,,,,,,,

Nuclear extracts made from human lymphoid neoplasms were screened for their ability to enhance transcription of the unrearranged Kappa light chain immunoglobulin gene (V Kappa) in a whole cell in vitro transcription assay. Extracts from plasmacytomas, large noncleaved cell lymphomas, and Burkitt's lymphomas specifically enhance V Kappa gene transcription up to 22-fold, whereas no enhancement was achieved using extracts from lymphoid neoplasms corresponding to the earlier stages of normal B cell maturation.

The enhancer sequences present within the M-MuLV long terminal repeat (LTR) region of the proviral genome have been shown to influence the disease specificity of the virus strongly. We examined the contribution of the M-MuLV enhancers to the transcriptional activity and pathogenesis of M-MuLV by constructing LTRs containing heterologous enhancer elements. The simian virus 40 enhancer region (72- and 21-base-pair repeats) was inserted into the U3 region (at -150 base pairs) of the M-MuLV LTR (Mo + SV) and also into a deleted form of the LTR which lacks the M-MuLV enhancer sequences (delta Mo + SV). These chimeric LTRs were used to generate infectious M-MuLVs by transfection of corresponding proviral plasmids into mouse fibroblasts. The relative infectivities of Mo + SV and delta Mo + SV recombinant viruses as determined by rat XC cell plaque assay and reverse transcriptase assay were 60 to 70% of wild-type M-MuLV levels. To study the pathogenicity of these two recombinant viruses, we inoculated newborn NIH Swiss mice with either Mo + SV or delta Mo + SV M-MuLV. Both viruses induced disease more slowly than M-MuLV, which induces disease 2 to 4 months postinoculation. Mo + SV M-MuLV-inoculated animals became moribund at 3 to 13 months postinoculation, whereas delta Mo + SV M-MuLV-inoculated animals became moribund at 6 to 24 months postinoculation. The tumors induced by the two viruses were characterized histologically and molecularly. Mo + SV M-MuLV-induced tumors were primarily T-cell-derived lymphoblastic lymphomas containing extensive rearrangements of the T-cell receptor beta gene. In contrast, delta Mo + SV M-MuLV induced pre-B- and B-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas, B-cell-derived follicular-center cell lymphomas, and acute myeloid leukemia. The delta Mo + SV tumor DNAs from B-lineage tumors were typically rearranged at the immunoglobulin gene loci and contained germ line configurations of the T-cell receptor beta gene. Southern blot hybridization confirmed that the tumor DNAs contained the predicted Mo + SV M-MuLV or delta Mo + SV M-MuLV provirus.",,"['CA32454/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 GMO 9553/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC253401,"['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine 92717.']",,,,,,,,

The response was amplified markedly by increasing the concentration of external Ca2+ from 0 to 1 mM, but the concentration required to support half-maximal response varied from less than 0.1 mM for the most potent cross-linking reagent, DNP24BSA (24 molecules of DNP attached to 1 molecule of BSA) to 0.5 mM for the least potent reagent, aggregated OVA. The dependency of phosphoinositide hydrolysis on external Ca2+ was reduced to zero once hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids was underway but secretion of histamine remained totally dependent on the presence of 0.5 to 1 mM external Ca2+. The stimulatory response persisted as long as receptors remained aggregated but it was modulated by a biochemical process, possibly the activation of protein kinase C, that targeted specifically aggregated receptors, or an associated protein. For example, when cells had become desensitized to high concentrations of one Ag, a normal response could be evoked with a second Ag. Also cells that had become desensitized could be reactivated by permeabilizing the cells.

Recent studies have demonstrated both the linkage between H genes and retroviral sequences and the ability of integrated Moloney-murine leukemia virus to encode what is operationally defined as a non-H-2 H antigen. The experiments described in this communication reveal that skin grafts from an SV40 T-antigen transgenic C57BL/6 mouse strain are rejected by coisogenic C57BL/6 recipients with a median survival time of 49 days, which is comparable to those of many previously defined non-H-2 H antigens. The specificity of this response for SV40 T-antigen was demonstrated by the identification of SV40 T-antigen-specific cytolytic T lymphocytes and antibodies in multiply-grafted recipients. Although these cytolytic T lymphocytes could detect SV40 T-antigen on syngeneic SV40-transformed fibroblasts, they neither could be stimulated by splenic lymphocytes from T-antigen transgenics nor could they lyse lymphoblast targets from T-antigen transgenics. These observations suggest a limited tissue distribution of SV40 T-antigen in these transgenics. These results confirm the role of viral genes in the determination of non-H-2 histocompatibility antigens by the strict criteria that such antigens stimulate (1) tissue graft rejection and (2) generation of cytolytic T lymphocytes. Furthermore, they suggest that the SV40 enhancer and promoter region can target expression of SV-40 T-antigen to skin cells of transgenic animals.",,"['AI-16052/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21124/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,"['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, PA 19104.']",,,,,,,,

The apparent resting pHi, as assessed by the fluorescent pH probe quenel, were 6.61 and 6.75 for the U-937 and K-562 cells, respectively. When extracellular Na+ was substituted by equimolar choline+, pHi decreased by about 0.2 units. The protein kinase C activating beta-form of the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA; 10(-10) and 10(-7) M) induced a dose-dependent alkalinization in both cell types of 0.03-0.12 units, whereas the alpha-form was inactive. The response was detectable after about 2 min and reached steady-state 10-15 min later. In the K-562 cells the alkalinization was mediated by Na+/H+ exchange as it was accompanied by stimulation of H+ extrusion and abolished by Na+ removal. The TPA response in the U-937 cells, however, was unaffected by Na+ removal, not accompanied by H+-efflux, and thus unrelated to Na+/H+ exchange. Since electron microscopy indicated development of multivesicular bodies with an acidic interior, the alkalinization can probably be accounted for by an intracellular mechanism. Ionomycin (10(-5) M) induced a rapid increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration of both cell types and this response was accompanied by acidification followed by a Na+-dependent recovery. In the U-937, but not in the K-562, cells this recovery was followed by a net alkalinization. It is concluded that both cell types possess a Na+/H+ exchange of importance for pHi but that this mechanism is regulated differently in the U-937 and K-562 cells.",,,,"['Department of Pathology, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,

No supplementary metabolic activation systems were used. In the mouse lymphoma assay, the dihydroxybenzenes catechol and hydroquinone had similar and appreciable mutagenic potentials, whereas resorcinol was less active. Derivatives of catechol, such as dopamine and epinephrine, were mutagenic, whereas the related monohydroxylated compounds tyramine and synephrine were inactive. The primary amine, arterenol, and the corresponding secondary amine, epinephrine, induced similar mutagenic responses. Carboxylation of the side chain of dopamine, giving L-dopa, reduced the maximum mutagenic response. The introduction of charged groups directly on to the aromatic ring also reduced mutagenic activity, while an intervening methylene reversed this effect. Thus, 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic acid was more active than 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid. The compound active at the lowest doses was 4-tert-butyl catechol. The activities of these compounds are highly dependent upon substituent groups. Experiments with superoxide dismutase gave circumstantial evidence for some of the mutagenic activity being due to superoxide anion. Active oxygen species might be responsible for some of the observed effects, but this cannot be concluded from the superoxide dismutase experiments. Mutagenic responses in Salmonella were very low but were significant for L-dopa in three strains and for epinephrine and arterenol in one strain. Limited DNA association studies of 14C-dopamine suggest interactions in L5178Y and Salmonella cells and in mouse liver. The mutagenicity of dopamine in L5178Y is reduced by high serum concentrations during the exposure period, while the apparent association with DNA is unaffected.",,,,"['Department of Mutagenic and Cellular Toxicology, Inveresk Research International Limited, Musselburgh, Scotland.']",,,,,,,,

The synergistic interaction was confirmed when sublytic concentrations of H2O2 were combined with defensin preparations that had been purified to homogeneity.

Sequential addition experiments suggested that synergistic lysis required a simultaneous exposure to both cytotoxins.

In contrast, DNA cleavage was observed in T-cells from CLL patients. Exposure to amsacrine or etoposide caused at least 50-fold less DNA cleavage in CLL and normal lymphocytes as compared to L1210 cells. These findings cannot be accounted for by differences in drug uptake. An attempt was made to explain the relative resistance of human lymphocytes to drug-induced DNA cleavage. DNA topoisomerase II, an intracellular target of tested drugs, was assayed in CLL and normal human blood lymphocytes by immunoblotting. The enzyme was detected neither in unfractionated lymphocytes nor in the enriched B- and T-cells from 28 untreated patients with CLL (Stage 0-IV) and from seven normal donors.

When phosphorylated, the ddNs (ddNTPs) function as chain-terminating substrate analogues with reverse transcriptase, thereby inhibiting HIV replication. These nucleoside analogues can also inhibit, by chain-terminating additions, the primitive lymphoid DNA polymerase, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). To determine the effect of possible intracellular chain-terminating additions of ddNMPs by TdT, we exposed a series of TdT-positive and TdT-negative cell lines to 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine (ddA), a representative ddN. At ddA concentrations 25-fold higher than required for inhibition of HIV replication, progressive dose-related cytotoxicity was observed in the TdT-positive cell lines. This was accentuated by the adenosine deaminase inhibitor Coformycin (CF), presumably by enhancing the intracellular generation of ddATP from ddA. A central role of TdT in mediating the ddA/CF cytotoxicity was suggested by studies in a pre-B-cell line rendered TdT positive by infection with a TdT cDNA-containing retroviral vector. After a 48-hour continuous exposure period to 250 mumol/L ddA and 30 mumol/L CF, 30% cell death was observed in the TdT-negative parental line, whereas 90% cell death was observed in the TdT-positive daughter line. Exposure of fresh TdT-positive leukemic cells to ddA/CF for 72 hours ex vivo resulted in cytotoxicity (six cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia [ALL]) while not affecting TdT-negative acute leukemic cells (six cases).

It has been inferred that the enhancers may specifically target viral expression into the cells that then become neoplastic. However, the neoplasms in those studies formed after latencies and contained ultimate viruses (called MCFs) that differed from the injected viruses in their enhancer sequences and envelope (env) genes. Transcriptional activities of LTRs from these proximal and ultimate viruses have not been thoroughly analyzed in different hematopoietic lineages. We present evidence that the enhancer of Friend spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV), an ultimate erythroleukemogenic retrovirus, contains an unstable 42-nucleotide direct repeat. Other ultimate erythroleukemogenic MuLVs (Friend MCFs) contain an enhancer nearly identical to that of SFFV both in its sequence and in its specific instability. The instability occurs in sequences that contain inverted repeats and we propose that it occurs by a simple reverse transcriptase hop mechanism. We constructed plasmids that contain the two forms of the SFFV LTR linked to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, and we compared these in transient transfection assays with LTR-CAT plasmids constructed from Friend and Moloney MuLVs. The assays employed erythroleukemia cells, thymic lymphoma cells, and fibroblasts. The tropisms of expression correlated only weakly with tissue specificities of pathogenesis and each LTR was active in all cells. The SFFV 42-nucleotide duplication reduced expression in erythroid cells and increased expression in fibroblasts. We conclude that retroviral enhancers do not stringently direct gene expression into specific cell lineages, but on the contrary they are leaky and contain replicative instabilities that also may facilitate viral entrenchment throughout the host.

Treatment of RBL-1 cells with PMA resulted in translocation and activation of PKC from the cytosol to the membrane fraction.

However, no studies have been carried out with the SFFV env gene in the complete absence of other SFFV sequences. To accomplish this goal, we isolated the sequences that encode the envelope glycoprotein, gp52, of SFFVA and expressed them in a Moloney murine leukemia virus-based double-expression vector containing the neomycin resistance gene. The method used to produce retrovirus stocks in tissue culture cells affected the expression of the gp52 gene in the vector and the subsequent pathogenicity of the vector in mice. Highly pathogenic virus stocks were obtained by cotransfection of vector and helper virus DNAs into fibroblasts, followed by virus replication and spread through the cell population. Mice infected with this stock developed a rapid erythroid disease that was indistinguishable from that induced by the entire SFFV genome, and the virus stock transformed erythroid cells in vitro. Spleen cells from the diseased mice expressed the SFFV env gene product but not the SFFV gag gene product. As expected, mice given the virus containing the SFFV env gene in the reverse orientation did not express the SFFV env gene product or develop erythroleukemia. This study, therefore, demonstrated (i) that double-expression retroviral vectors can be used under specific conditions to produce viruses expressing high levels of a particular gene and (ii) that incorporation of the SFFV env gene into such a vector in the absence of other SFFV sequences results in a retrovirus which is as pathogenic as the original SFFV.",,,PMC253318,"['Laboratory of Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",,,,,,,,

Because the proteoglycans that are present in the secretory granules of different types of rat and mouse mast cells possess small peptide cores that are rich in serine and glycine, we propose that this HL-60 cell-3 derived cDNA encodes the peptide core of the proteoglycan that is expressed in the secretory granules of this human promyelocytic cell.",,"['AI-23401/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-23483/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-24158/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,"['Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.']",,,['GENBANK/J03223'],,,,,

Using full-length viral DNA, we studied the regulatory effects of rex on HTLV-1 gene expression. p27rex is required for expression of both gag and env proteins, increasing the level of their mRNAs. The effect was dependent on the dose of p27rex expression plasmid. In parallel, increased doses of p27rex suppressed the expression of fully spliced pX mRNA, which encodes the regulatory proteins. These two effects of p27rex operated at the post-transcriptional level and were independent of transcriptional regulation.

In these characters scid mice seem to lack lymphoid stem cells. However, some mice have detectable serum immunoglobulin and others develop thymomas; both observations indicate that the block in lymphoid development is not absolute. To determine whether scid mice have any B-cell precursors, we looked for pre-B cells by their ability to be transformed by Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV). Surprisingly, scid mice contain as many B-cell precursors transformable with A-MuLV as normal control mice. Cell-surface markers specific for pre-B and B cells were detected on the A-MuLV-transformed bone marrow cells of both scid and normal mice, indicating that the A-MuLV-transformed cells belong to the B lineage.

Only tissues of colonic origin were found to express these CEA-specific transcripts. Colon carcinomas consistently express a 2.6-kilobase mRNA species as well which codes for nonspecific cross-reacting antigen. Nonneoplastic colon mucosas, on the other hand, express lower or nondetectable levels of this transcript. Most breast carcinomas produce only the nonspecific cross-reacting antigen mRNA, whereas leukocytes of chronic myelogeneous leukemia express both nonspecific cross-reacting antigen mRNA and a 2.3-kilobase mRNA corresponding to a yet undefined gene of the CEA family. Thus the multiple CEA-like products reported to be produced by these tissues correspond to only four different mRNA species coding for three different peptides.

The majority of MNU-induced lymphomas contain newly acquired murine leukemia proviral sequences. In contrast to spontaneous AKR/J lymphomas which contain multiple integrations of mink cell focus-forming recombinant proviruses, MNU-induced lymphomas contain ecotropic-related proviruses. This conclusion was based on the demonstration that EcoRI- and PvuII-digested DNA from MNU-induced lymphomas contains new 3' proviral-cellular junction fragments that hybridize with the ecotropic-specific pAKV-4 and pAKV-5 hybridization probes. Also, EcoRI/PstI double digests of DNA from MNU-induced lymphomas revealed that the acquired proviruses do not contain an internal 3' EcoRI site characteristic of mink cell focus-forming recombinant viruses. The proviral integration patterns suggest that MNU-induced lymphomas are clonal or oligoclonal in nature. This conclusion is supported by comparison of proviral integration patterns in lymphomas obtained from thymus and spleen of individual mice, and by analyses of T-cell receptor beta-chain gene rearrangements. The frequent occurrence of ecotropic-related proviral sequences in MNU-induced lymphomas suggests that these newly acquired proviruses may play a role in tumor development.",,['CA 37912/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['University of Texas System Cancer Center, Science Park-Research Division, Smithville 78957.']",,,,,,,,

At the same time, the biological activity of these compounds in serum calcium elevation is either unchanged or diminished. Thus, lengthening the side chain may well provide a preferentially active form of vitamin D on the promyelocytes. Shortening the side chain has resulted a 10-fold loss of activity in HL-60 for each carbon removed. Furthermore, elimination of the 26- and 27-carbons decreases biological activity by 100-fold.

B6 dendritic cells (DC) are superior in the presentation of Sendai virus Ag to CTL in comparison with B6 normal spleen cells. Con A blasts have even less capacity to present viral Ag than NSC, and LPS blasts show an intermediate capacity to present viral Ag. H-2Kb mutant bm1 mice do not generate a CTL response to Sendai virus, but respond to Moloney leukemia virus, as demonstrated by undetectable CTL precursors to Sendai virus and a normal CTL precursor frequency to Moloney virus. Compared to B6 mice, other H-2Kb mutant mice show decreased Sendai virus-specific CTL precursor frequencies in a hierarchy reflecting the response in bulk culture. The Sendai virus-specific CTL response defect of bm1 mice was not restored by highly potent Sendai virus-infected DC as APC for in vivo priming and/or in vitro restimulation. In mirror image to H-2Kb mutant bm1 mice, H-2Db mutant bm14 mice do not generate a CTL response to Moloney virus, but respond normally to Sendai virus. This specific CTL response defect was restored by syngeneic Moloney virus-infected DC for in vitro restimulation. This response was Kb restricted indicating that the Dbm14 molecule remained largely defective and that a dormant Kb repertoire was aroused after optimal Ag presentation by DC. In conclusion, DC very effectively present viral Ag to CTL. However, their capacity to restore MHC class I determined specific CTL response defects probably requires at least some ability of a particular MHC class I/virus combination to associate and thus form an immunogenic complex.",,,,"['Division of Immunology, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam.']",,,,,,,,

We found that HL-60 cells produce little if any C2 but can be induced to synthesize C2 by IFN-gamma.

The molecular abnormality in the former group is similar to that found in chronic myelogenous leukemia. To characterize the abnormality in the breakpoint cluster region-unrearranged form, we have mapped a 9;22 translocation from the Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line SUP-B13 by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and have cloned the DNA at the translocation junctions. We demonstrate a BCR-ABL fusion gene on the Philadelphia chromosome. The breakpoint on chromosome 9 is within ABL between exons Ia and II, and the breakpoint on chromosome 22 is approximately equal to 50 kilobases upstream of a breakpoint cluster region in an intron of the BCR gene. This upstream BCR breakpoint leads to inclusion of fewer BCR sequences in the fusion gene, compared with the BCR-ABL fusion gene of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Consequently, the associated mRNA and protein are smaller. The exons from ABL are the same. Analysis of leukemic cells from four other patients with breakpoint cluster region-unrearranged Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia revealed a rearrangement on chromosome 22 close to the breakpoint in SUP-B13 in only one patient. These data indicate that breakpoints do not cluster tightly in this region but are scattered, possibly in a large intron. Given the large size of BCR and the heterogeneity in breakpoint location, detection of BCR rearrangement by standard Southern blot analysis is difficult. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis should allow detection at the DNA level in every patient and thus will permit clinical correlation of the breakpoint location with prognosis.",,"['CA-34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-07190/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC280086,"['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL 60637.']",,,,,,,,

FeLV C isolates also possess an extended host range in vitro, including an ability, unique among FeLVs, to replicate in guinea pig cells. To identify the viral determinants responsible for the pathogenicity and host range of FSC we constructed a series of proviral DNAs by exchanging gene fragments between FSC and FeLV-61E (or F6A), the latter of which is minimally pathogenic and whose host range in vitro is restricted to feline cells. Transfer of an 886-base-pair (bp) fragment of FSC, encompassing the codons for 73 amino acids at the 3' end of pol (the integrase/endonuclease gene) and the codons for 241 amino acids of the N-terminal portion of env [the extracellular glycoprotein (gp70) gene], into the F6A genome was sufficient to confer onto chimeric viruses the ability to induce fatal aplastic anemia in SPF cats. In contrast, no chimera lacking this sequence induced disease. When assayed in vitro, all chimeric viruses containing the 886-bp fragment of FSC acquired the ability to replicate in heterologous cells, including dog and guinea pig cells. Thus, the pathogenic and the host range determinants of the feline aplastic anemia retrovirus colocalize to a 3' pol-5' env region of the FSC genome and likely reside within a region encoding 241 amino acid residues of the N terminus of the extracellular glycoprotein.",,['CA32563/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC280078,"['Department of Cancer Biology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02115.']",,,,,,,,

The BoLA W8.1 allele was negatively associated with the presence of antibodies to the major BLV envelope glycoprotein, BLV-gp51 (corrected P less than 0.001, relative risk = 0.31). These results suggest that a BoLA-linked gene(s) may influence the early spread of BLV infection. Since B cells are the primary target of BLV infection, we then determined the relationship between BoLA-A locus phenotypes and B-cell numbers in peripheral blood of seropositive and seronegative cows. There were no significant differences between BoLA-A alleles for any hematological parameter in seronegative cows. Seropositive cows with the W12.1 allele had significantly greater absolute numbers of lymphocytes per microliter and B cells per microliter than did seropositive cows with other BoLA-A phenotypes (P less than 0.01, respectively). The average effect associated with the W12.1 allele in BLV-infected cows was an increase of 2010 B cells per microliter of whole blood relative to BLV-infected cows with other BoLA-A phenotypes. These results demonstrate that susceptibility to the polyclonal expansion of BLV-infected B lymphocytes is associated with the W12.1 allele in Holstein-Friesian cattle. Compared with results of a previous study in a herd of Shorthorn cattle, it appears that resistance and susceptibility to subclinical progression of BLV infection are associated with different BoLA-A locus alleles in different cattle breeds.",,,,"['Department of Animal Sciences, University of Illinois, Urbana 61801.']",,,,,,,,

In a comparison with control responder C57BL/6 mice, a clear pattern emerged. Akv-negative mice of the AKXL-29 strain were fully responsive, but five other AKXL strains which had inherited the Akv-1 provirus failed to mount significant antiviral CTL responses (less than or equal to 10% of control). In contrast, an Akv-1-negative but Akv-4-positive strain (AKXL-5) was partially responsive (approximately 24% of the C57BL/6 control).

The effector cell (EC) population consisted of peripheral blood lymphocytes enriched for NK cells. Upon a 5-min exposure of EC to the NK-sensitive tumor TC K562 and U937, nearly four- and threefold increases in the incorporation of 32P into phosphatidylinositol (PI) occurred, respectively. In contrast, no increase in 32P incorporation into PI was seen when two NK-resistant TC were used. In addition, little or no change in the incorporation of 32P into phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, or phosphatidylserine took place with any of the above TC. Depletion of Leu 11b-positive cells abolished the increase in 32P incorporation into PI when K562 were used in the phospholipid assay. Furthermore, labeling kinetics of this phospholipid turnover showed that it occurred less than 5 min following exposure to NK-sensitive TC and that phosphatidic acid, a breakdown product of phosphoinositides, was produced during this 5-min period. These results indicated that metabolism of a phosphoinositide took place and that it occurred in association with early activation events in NK cells. Quercetin and dibutyryladenosine-cyclic monophosphate (dbcAMP) plus theophylline exerted profound inhibitory effects on both NK activity and PI metabolism, suggesting a linkage between the two events. The inhibitors had no effect on target cell-binding capacity, indicating that the inhibition occurred postbinding. PI metabolism took place in the absence of extracellular calcium even though NK activity was completely abolished under the same conditions. Thus, we have shown PI metabolism, but not other phospholipids, to occur in human NK cells upon exposure to NK-sensitive TC, in association with early activation events. This event was independent of extracellular calcium and could be inhibited by quercetin or dbcAMP plus theophylline.",,,,"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46223.']",,,,,,,,

This indicates that some of the asparagine-linked (N-linked) oligosaccharide of FPCR is of the complex type. Studies with endoglycosidase F and endoglycosidase H show that unaltered FPCR contains both complex and high mannose content N-linked oligosaccharide chains, and that FPCR synthesized in the presence of swainsonine contains only high mannose N-linked oligosaccharide chains. Cycloheximide prevents the swainsonine effect on FPCR molecular weight. This shows that swainsonine only affects the carbohydrate structure of FPCR which is newly synthesized in the presence of swainsonine. Since swainsonine decreases the molecular weight of FPCR from human peripheral blood monocytes in culture, these cells must be synthesizing new FPCR. The abnormally low molecular weight FPCR synthesized in the presence of swainsonine is converted to the normal, higher molecular weight form of FPCR when swainsonine is removed from the culture. This occurs even when new protein synthesis is inhibited by cycloheximide. This requires that previously synthesized, swainsonine-affected FPCR at the cell surface must come in contact with Golgi enzymes which complete the processing of the abnormal, high mannose oligosaccharide.

Therefore, like cultured rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL cells), the peritoneal macrophage contains LTC4 synthetase and appears to contain little, if any, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. When LTA4 was added to subcellular fractions of mouse macrophage lysate, the highest specific activity of LTC4 synthetase (nmol LTC4/mg protein per 10 min) was associated with the particulate or membrane fractions (i.e., 10(4) and 10(5) X g pellets). The 10(5) X g supernatant contains approx. 1% of the specific activity and 6% of the total LTC4 synthetase activity compared with that of the 10(5) X g pellet. Conversely, the 10(5) X g supernatant had four-times more specific activity and 19-times more total GSH S-transferase activity than did the 10(5) X g pellet when evaluated using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB) as the substrate. LTA4 was converted to LTC4 by the membrane enzyme LTC4 synthetase in a dose-dependent manner at low LTA4 concentrations (3-50 microM) and reached a plateau of approx. 30 microM LTA4 using the macrophage 10(5) X g pellet as an enzyme source. The apparent Km value of LTC4 synthetase for LTA4 was estimated to be 5 microM based on Lineweaver-Burk plots. Enzyme in the 10(5) X g supernatant produced negligible quantities of LTC4 (1% or less of the particulate fractions) over a wide range of LTA4 concentrations. However, an enzyme in the 10(5) X g supernatant fraction presumed to be GSH S-transferase effectively catalyzes the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) with the aromatic compound DNCB. The apparent Km value of GSH S-transferase for DNCB was estimated to be 1.0-1.5 mM. On the other hand, enzyme from the membrane fraction (i.e., 10(5) X g pellet) catalyzed this reaction at a negligible rate over a wide range of DNCB concentrations. The apparent Km value of LTC4 synthetase for GSH was estimated to be 0.36 mM and the corresponding Km value estimated for the glutathione S-transferase was 0.25-0.76 mM. These values indicate similar kinetics for GSH utilization by both enzymes. These Km values are also significantly lower than the intracellular GSH levels of 2 to 5 mM. Therefore, it is suggested that the substrate limiting LTC4 synthetase activity is LTA4 and not GSH.

The dissociation constant was confirmed independently by quantifying the kinetics of initial specific PAF binding. PAF binding was stereospecific, required an sn-2 acetyl substituent, and was inhibited by structurally diverse PAF antagonists including kadsurenone, BN 52021, triazolam, and CV3988. The fact that the receptors are functionally active was shown by the observation that 1 to 100 pM PAF increased free intracellular calcium in P388D1 cells in a dose-related manner.

The relationship between these two pathways is not known. In this study, we have examined a series of either Abelson virus or Moloney virus-derived T cell lines for their expression of these T cell receptor and cell surface marker genes. Results indicate that the Abelson T cell lines do not express the cell surface markers CD4 and CD8, but express relatively high levels of gamma chain transcripts. After culture of these cell lines with the phorbol ester phorbol myristate acetate and interleukin 2, a down-regulation of these gamma chain transcripts can be observed. More interestingly, we found that the Moloney virus-derived T cell lines, which express the cell surface markers CD4 and/CD8, contain high levels of alpha and beta chain T cell receptor transcripts but little or no gamma transcripts even though they have rearranged these latter genes. The gamma transcripts, however, can be induced to high levels after culture with phorbol myristate acetate and interleukin 2. In the process, the cell surface markers CD4 and CD8 and their transcripts were dramatically down-regulated resulting in cells with high levels of gamma chain transcripts and a CD4-CD8- phenotype. The regulation of expression of these genes is reversible. Taken together, these results indicate that the T cell receptor gamma chain genes and those of the cell surface markers CD4 CD8 can be regulated in vitro by external factors and it opens up the possibility of studying the regulatory sequences associated with these genes.",,,,"['Ontario Cancer Institute, University of Toronto, Canada.']",,,,,,,,

An alternative splicing event in which a portion of the intron bounded by the vE6 and vE7 exons with v-myb homology is included as an additional 363-nucleotide coding exon has recently been identified in a mouse tumor that carries a provirus-activated myb gene. This alternative splicing was hypothesized to be a tumor-specific aberrant form of 3'-myb RNA processing as a consequence of the disruption of upstream 5'-sequences by proviral insertion. However, RNA blot analyses and RNase mapping studies presented here show that a significant portion (approximately 10%) of all myb transcripts examined, whether in normal or in clonal tumor cells, contains the additional exon. Hence the alternative splicing is a hitherto unrecognized common normal event that potentially increases the diversity of the myb proteins expressed in normal tissues including thymus and spleen, as well as in tumor cells with either normal or 5'-rearranged myb alleles. The lack of change in the ratio of the two spliced products expressed from either the normal or the 5'-rearranged myb further indicates that the insertion of the unique 121 amino acids in the larger myb transcripts is not a consequence of tumor-specific activation of the mouse myb oncogene.",,,PMC553885,"['Laboratory of Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",,,,,,,,

During erythroid differentiation by dimethyl sulfoxide, B8 cells displayed a rapid and marked increase in the amount of specific 125I-EPO binding before the appearance of hemoglobin-containing cells. Scatchard analysis of the saturation binding data revealed that B8 cells had a single class and low number (350 to 650) of EPO receptors per cell with an apparent Kd of 1.2 to 1.4 nM. In addition, the number of EPO receptors on B8 cells was increased twice by induction with DMSO for 1 day, but the binding affinity of EPO toward its receptors did not change significantly. Affinity cross-linking experiments with disuccinimidyl suberate demonstrated two radiolabeled components with apparent molecular weights of 145,000 and 130,000 under both reducing and nonreducing conditions.

Brief heating of camptothecin-treated cells to 65 degrees C resulted in a rapid reduction of the number of protein-linked DNA breaks.

Following infection with this retrovirus some cats eliminate the virus and produce neutralizing antibody whereas others remain latently infected. A final group become persistently infected, and eventually succumb to neoplastic or non-neoplastic diseases induced by the virus. The proportion of cats falling into these different post-infection states depends on the age of exposure and the dose of virus received. In breeding colonies where the virus is endemic, up to 40% may be persistently infected, whereas in surveys of urban or suburban cats, only 1% are found to be infected for life. An important epidemiological feature of FeLV infection is that the majority of cats die from anaemia or immunosuppression rather than from leukaemia. Recent studies of the molecular biology of FeLV have shown that T cell tumour induction involves either transduction or insertional mutagenesis of the myc gene. Recombination between FeLV and FeLV related sequences present in all cat cells also appears to be important in generating different subgroups of the virus.",,,,,32,,,,,,,

The alterations occurred after commitment and before the appearance of the multiple cell types characteristic of these pluripotential cells. After commitment, gene activity controlled by the HIV-1 LTR markedly increased, whereas that controlled by the HTLV-I LTR decreased. Steady-state mRNA levels and nuclear run-on transcription indicated that the increased HIV-1-directed activity during differentiation occurred posttranscriptionally, whereas the decreased HTLV-I activity was at the transcriptional level. Phorbol esters did not cause commitment but strongly enhanced expression by both viral LTRs at the transcriptional level. A specific inhibitor of protein kinase C, 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine, indicated that the enhanced activity involved the activation of protein kinase(s) C; altered cyclic nucleotide metabolism was apparently not involved. Differentiating cells gradually lost the ability to respond to phorbol ester stimulation. Experiments with a deletion mutant of the HIV-1 LTR suggested that this was due to imposition of negative regulation during differentiation that was not reversed by phorbol ester induction. Cycloheximide, with or without phorbol ester, slightly stimulated HIV-1-directed activity at the transcriptional level and massively increased the amounts of steady-state mRNA by posttranscriptional superinduction. It appeared, however, that new nuclear protein synthesis was required for maximal transcriptional stimulation by phorbol esters.

HTLV-I infection is associated with adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma, and HTLV-II is associated with an indolent form of hairy-cell leukemia. To identify potential transcriptional regulatory elements of these two related human retroviruses, we performed DNase I footprinting of both the HTLV-I and HTLV-II long terminal repeats (LTRs) by using extracts prepared from uninfected T cells, HTLV-I and HTLV-II transformed T cells, and HeLa cells. Five regions of the HTLV-I LTR and three regions of the HTLV-II LTR showed protection by DNase I footprinting. All three of the 21-base-pair repeats previously shown to be important in HTLV transcriptional regulation were protected in the HTLV-I LTR, whereas only one of these repeats was protected in the HTLV-II LTR. Several regions exhibited altered protection in extracts prepared from lymphoid cells as compared with HeLa cells, but there were minimal differences in the protection patterns between HTLV-infected and uninfected lymphoid extracts. A number of HTLV-I and HTLV-II LTR fragments which contained regions showing protection in DNase I footprinting were able to function as inducible enhancer elements in transient CAT gene expression assays in the presence of the HTLV-II tat protein.

However, the pattern of substitution of nonecotropic sequences within the envelope genes of the CWD class II recombinant viruses differs from that seen in class I recombinant MuLVs of AKR, C58, and HRS mice. To determine how CWD host genes might influence the envelope gene structure of the recombinant viruses, we characterized the responses of these mice to two different types of exogenous MuLVs. Neonatal mice injected the HRS class I recombinant PTV-1 became infected and developed T-cell lymphomas more rapidly than controls did. The inoculation of CWD mice with the leukemogenic AKR ecotropic virus SL3-3 led to the formation of recombinant MuLVs with a novel genetic structure and class II-like envelope genes, although SL3-3 generates class I recombinants in other strains. These results suggest that the absence of class I recombinant MuLVs in CWD mice is not related to the restriction of the replication or oncogenicity of class I viruses or to the absence of an appropriate ecotropic virus that can generate class I recombinants.

In vivo reticuloendothelial cell function, as assessed by 51Cr-labeled sheep erythrocyte clearance, was unaffected by D2O. Although a dose-dependent decrease in fluid intake occurred during deuteration, hematocytopenia was not a consequence of dehydration. In view of the known kinetics of D2O in biological systems, the rapid response of myeloid elements to deuteration must be due primarily to the solvent (nonmetabolic) isotope effect. Prolonged deuteration has proven toxic when included in regimens for treatment of neoplasia, including leukemia, in animal models.

Prior exposure of RBL-1 cells to LTD4 resulted in a 40% reduction in the amount of maximal [Ca++]i mobilization. This desensitization was concentration- and time-dependent, with an EC50 of 1 to 3 nM and with 50% of the desensitization occurring after 7.5 min of pretreatment. SKF 104353 (100 nM), a high affinity, LTD4-receptor antagonist, blocked completely LTD4-induced desensitization of RBL-1 cells. The LTD4-induced desensitization was stereospecific, as the (5R,6S)-enantiomer of LTD4 was at least 100 times less potent than LTD4. Pretreatment of RBL-1 cells with LTD4 did not alter the ability of thrombin or ATP to induce [Ca++]i mobilization, suggesting that the desensitization was of the ""homologous"" type. The density of [3H]LTD4 receptors in RBL-1 cell membranes was decreased 23% by prior treatment of RBL-1 cells with LTD4.

Camptothecin altered the cleavage pattern of the wild type but not of the mutant enzyme. The stability of cleavable complexes was studied at a preferred topoisomerase I-binding sequence recognized by both enzymes. Camptothecin greatly enhanced the kinetic stability of the cleavable complex formed by the wild type enzyme, whereas that of the mutant enzyme was only marginally affected. In the absence of camptothecin, the cleavable complex formed by the mutant enzyme was stabilized relative to that of the wild type by several criteria. Thus, the mutant enzyme cleaved the topoisomerase I recognition sequence with 2-fold higher efficiency than the wild type enzyme. The mutant cleavable complex had a higher kinetic stability and was less sensitive to salt dissociation than the wild type complex.

A result of these investigations is the extension of the H-2 TLb molecular map. Two additional TL genes have been isolated from C57BL/6 mice, T14 and T15. The genomic organization of T9 through T15 is presented. The nucleotide sequence has been determined for exons 4, 5, and 6 of T13. As a result of a C to T conversion, a termination codon is introduced into exon 4, indicating that T13 either encodes a secreted protein or is a pseudogene. T13 was found to be more homologous to the H-2 genes outside the TL region. T14 has been physically disrupted by the integration of TLev1, and the H-2 sequences appear to have diverged greatly. The relationship of the TL regions of the b and c haplotypes has been investigated using numerous low copy probes. The genome of BALB/c (TLc) is shown to lack a counterpart of the T13-T15b region.

Optimal oxygen-dependent microbicidal activity depends on MPO as the critical enzyme for the generation of hypochlorous acid and other toxic oxygen products. MPO is synthesized during the promyelocytic stage of myeloid differentiation, the stage at which azurophilic granules are formed. Like other lysosomal enzymes, MPO is synthesized as a larger precursor which is subsequently processed and transported intracellularly to the lysosomes. The primary translation product is a single 80-kDa protein which undergoes cotranslational N-linked glycosylation to produce a 92-kDa glycoprotein. Glucosidases in the endoplasmic reticulum or early cis Golgi convert the proMPO to a 90-kDa form which is sorted into a prelysosomal compartment that undergoes final proteolytic maturation to native MPO, a pair of heavy-light protomers with subunits of 60 kDa and a 12 kDa. These events contrast with similar processes seen with other lysosomal enzymes in two ways. First, alkalinization of lysosomes with NH4+ does not alter processing or transport, in contrast to the pH dependence of these processes for other lysosomal enzymes. However, some studies indicate retardation of processing in the presence of the proton ionophore monensin. Second, intracellular transport of MPO is not apparently mediated by the mannose-6-phosphate receptor system. The gene for MPO is on the long arm of chromosome 17 (17q22, 23) near the breakpoint of the 15, 17 translocation of acute promyelocytic leukemia. The gene spans approximately 14 kb and contains 11 irons and 12 exons. The cloned full-length cDNA is approximately 2.2 kb and both normal bone marrow and cultured promyelocytic leukemia cells express two species of mRNA. Inherited MPO deficiency, a relatively common disorder, is associated with the absence of mature MPO but the presence of proMPO, consistent with a post-translational defect. Studies at the molecular level aimed at identifying the underlying genetic defect are thus far consistent with that hypothesis. In addition, the basis for the observed association between acquired MPO deficiency and some myeloid leukemias can now be studied at the molecular level using these probes.",,['I01 BX000513/BX/BLRD VA/United States'],,"['Department of Medicine, VA Medical Center, Iowa City, IA.']",108,,,,,,,

Cell lines transformed with mIL2 cDNA stably carried 30-100 copies of the plasmid per cell and constitutively secreted biologically active mIL2 in quantities similar to those produced by murine EL4 thymoma cells or rat spleen cells stimulated with mitogens. Deletion of the 3' untranslated region containing AT-rich sequences from the mIL2 cDNA resulted in a 100-fold increase in the constitutive production and secretion of mIL2 by the transformants. Addition of a heavy metal further increased the production 2 to 6-fold. Cells transformed with 3'-deleted mIL3 cDNA constitutively secreted 300-1000 times higher activities of mIL3 than the myelomonocytic leukemia line WEHI3. mIL4 produced by the similar transformants induced [3H]thymidine uptake of a T cell line, a mast cell line and B leukemia cells, and enhanced the production of IgG1 by B cells. IL4 titers were 150 times higher than those produced by the concanavalin A-stimulated T cell line 2.19. mIL5 was secreted by similar transformants at 10-fold higher titers than those produced by concanavalin A-stimulated 2.19 T cells, as judged by the proliferation and maturation of B cell leukemia BCL1.

PZE was highly cytotoxic for these cells (90% inhibitory concentration = 3.1 microM). The effects of PZE on cellular DNA were studied first by alkaline sucrose sedimentation, in comparison with those of 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA). Like m-AMSA, PZE induced DNA strand breaks which were detected without a proteolytic treatment of the cell lysate. This result rules out the existence of covalent protein bridges sealing DNA termini at the break sites. PZE was less active than m-AMSA. DNA fragmentation was maximum at 5 microM and was lower at higher concentrations. The DNA effects of PZE were also studied by alkaline elution, and compared with those of Adriamycin and m-AMSA. Like Adriamycin, PZE induced single-strand breaks (SSBs) in a bell-shaped manner with respect to drug concentration. The maximum SSB frequency [1784 +/- 370 (SEM) rad equivalents)] was obtained at 16 microM. The kinetics of SSB reversion after drug removal was slower than in the case of m-AMSA. Similar bell-shaped curves were obtained for PZE-induced double-strand breaks and DNA-protein cross-links. PZE induced more double-strand breaks per SSB than did m-AMSA. However, as in the case of m-AMSA, PZE induced equal SSB and DNA-protein cross-link frequencies. These results suggest that PZE induces DNA breaks by inhibiting topoisomerase II as do other antitumor intercalators.",,,,"['Sanofi Recherche, Toulouse, France.']",,,,,,,,

The presence of skin involvement, circulating malignant cells, abnormal liver function tests, or the presence of two or more of these four features were statistically significantly different between virus-positive and virus-negative cases. Although the survival of positive cases (6 months) was shorter than that of negative cases (9 months), this was not statistically significant. The only significant determinant of survival was hypercalcemia, with those who developed hypercalcemia at some point in their disease course, independent of their HTLV-I status, surviving a mean of 5 months as compared to a mean of 17.5 months in those who never became hypercalcemic. The six HTLV-I-positive lymphomas that underwent cell typing were all primarily OKT4 positive, whereas two HTLV-I antibody-negative cases that were typed were B-cell lymphomas.",,,,"['Environmental Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",,,,,,,,

CTX yields of 23.5 +/- 21.5 U/ml, 15 +/- 18 U/ml, and 12.1 +/- 12.1 U/ml were obtained in response to PHA, PMA, and Sendai virus, respectively, as compared with corresponding yields of 207.3 +/- 93.1, 154 +/- 37.4, and 205.2 +/- 62.4 in healthy controls. The extent of reduced production of CTXs appeared to be correlated with the severity of the disease. Systemic interferon (IFN) administered to four patients caused CTX production to improve in response to PHA (147.5 +/- 55.1 U/ml compared with pretreatment values of 14.1 +/- 6 U/ml, P less than 0.05). However, CTX production in response to Sendai virus remained low. The extent to which CTX production by hairy cell leukemia mononuclear cells was reduced was proportionate to the observed decrease in monocyte counts. However, the degree to which CTX production improved after IFN treatment was significantly greater than the observed increase in monocyte counts.

A greater proportion of CFU-GM colonies were recovered relative to uninfected controls as the stringency of selection was diminished. Enzyme activity was detected in drug-resistant colonies, confirming that the resistant colonies obtained after infection with N2 represented cells producing neomycin phosphotransferase. Activity in the CFU-GM colonies approached 50% of that of drug-resistant vector-producing cells on a per cell basis. To test the hypothesis that more rapidly cycling bone marrow cells would be more susceptible to vector infection, we treated progenitor cells obtained from cyclic hematopoietic (CH) dogs with the N2 vector. Despite the increased numbers of hematopoietic progenitor cells obtained from CH dogs, the proportion of G418-resistant CFU-GM did not increase over that obtained with N2-infected normal marrow.

Since this type of peroxidase is highly specific for the myelomonocytic lineage the data indicate myelomonocytoid differentiation of all five cases studied.

AzddThd and ddCyd are considerably more cytostatic to human (i.e. Raji, Molt/4F, ATH8) cell lines than murine (i.e. L1210) cells. The intracellular levels of AzddThd 5'-triphosphate and ddCyd 5'-triphosphate formed do not seem related to the cytostatic effects achieved by these compounds. In human lymphoid (ATH8, Molt/4F) and caprine ovary (Tahr) cells AzddThd accumulates as its 5'-monophosphate (AzddTMP), whereas in murine leukemia (L1210) cells it is readily metabolized to the 5'-triphosphate (AzddTTP). The rapid conversion of AzddThd to AzddTTP in murine cells may explain why AzddThd has a pronounced activity against Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MSV)-induced transformation of murine C3H cells in vitro and MSV-induced tumor development in newborn NMRI mice in vivo. In contrast, ddCyd has not much activity in these murine assay systems, and this may seem related to the poor conversion of ddCyd to its 5'-triphosphate in murine cells. In human cells, however, ddCyd is more extensively phosphorylated to its 5'-triphosphate than in murine cells. When [3H]AzddThd and [3H]ddCyd were compared for their metabolism in ATH8 and Molt/4F cells, little [3H]AzddTTP was formed even after a 48-hr incubation period, whereas under the same conditions substantial levels of [3H]ddCTP built up gradually. Thus, much higher ddCTP than AzddTTP levels were achieved in human lymphoid cells, an observation that may be particularly relevant from a therapeutic viewpoint.",,,,"['Rega Institute for Medical Research, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium.']",,,,,,,,

We have used DNase I-protection assays (footprinting) to construct a map of protein-DNA interactions over a 250-nucleotide region of the LTR upstream of the start site for viral RNA synthesis. We find that a host factor (host expression factor 1, or HEF-1) binds to the imperfect 21-nucleotide repeats that have previously been implicated in HTLV-I gene expression. HEF-1 binding activity is present in preparations from both lymphoid and nonlymphoid cell lines. However, the boundaries of the protected regions and the presence of a flanking DNase-hypersensitive site vary with cell type. Several regions of binding are detected in addition to the HEF-1 sites, including a complex group of sites 40-90 nucleotides upstream of the RNA start site. A comparison of HTLV-I-transformed T lymphocytes that do and do not express the viral trans-activating protein p40xI shows that none of the observed features of the DNase I footprint pattern correlate directly with the presence of this protein in the extract. These results suggest (i) that the primary recognition of promoter elements in the HTLV-I LTR involves specific interactions with host-cell proteins and (ii) that p40xI influences the activity of one or more of these proteins, rather than interacting directly with the DNA.",,"['CA01113/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM35866/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'RR07013/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC279790,"['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Colorado, Boulder 80309.']",,,,,,,,

Mutant cells were much more resistant than wild-type cells to the toxic effects of ouabain. The gross structures and copy numbers of two ouabain-resistant genes were unaltered in the mutants, as was the expression of the Na,K-ATPase gene. Uptake of 86Rb+ was more resistant to ouabain in the mutants than in wild-type cells. There was no evidence for an inducible uptake mechanism. The Na,K-ATPase activity in extracts of the mutants was, in all cases examined, more resistant than wild-type cells to the inhibitory action of 10(-3) M ouabain. At 10(-5) M ouabain, the Na,K-ATPase activity in three out of eleven mutants was actually more sensitive to ouabain than in wild-type cells.

These cells permit the recovery of mutants due to single-gene or chromosomal mutation. m-AMSA was highly mutagenic at the tk locus, producing approximately 3000 mutants/10(6) survivors at 10% survival; positive dose range 1-10 ng/ml; o-AMSA produced approximately 1500 mutants/10(6) survivors at 10% survival; positive dose range 0.1-2.5 micrograms/ml. Most of the TK mutants were small colonies, which suggests that m-AMSA and o-AMSA induce primarily chromosomal mutations as opposed to single-gene mutations. The potent clastogenicity of these agents was confirmed by cytogenetic analysis for chromosomal aberrations, which showed that m-AMSA (9 ng/ml, 10% survival) and o-AMSA (1 microgram/ml, 10% survival) produced 383 and 179 aberrations, respectively, per 100 metaphases (background = 3-4/100). The large-colony TK mutant frequencies produced by m-AMSA (67 - 112/10(6) survivors; background = 7/10(6); survival = 63 - 16%) were comparable to the published HPRT mutant frequencies produced by m-AMSA in V79 cells. Novobiocin (50 micrograms/ml), an inhibitor of mammalian DNA topoisomerase II and other enzymes, inhibited the mutagenic effects of m-AMSA, suggesting that DNA topoisomerase II (or another enzyme) may play a role in the mutagenic/clastogenic activity of m-AMSA.",,,,"['Genetic Toxicology Division, US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.']",,,,,,,,

It was isolated from a C57BL mouse which had been primed with the Radiation leukemia virus-induced thymoma, C6VL/1, and has been shown to be phenotypically and karyotypically distinct from C6VL/1. IL-2 dependency has been stable over many in vitro passages, and this property also serves to distinguish this cell line from C6VL/1. 5C2 constitutively expresses a T cell receptor (TCR) and can respond by increased proliferation to external stimulation with anti-TCR antibody. This antibody acts to stimulate 5C2 growth in the absence of added IL-2. Maximum stimulation was achieved in the presence of a 50-ng/ml concentration of purified antibody. 5C2 has also been shown to produce detectable levels of IL-2 which can be increased by 8- to 16-fold after exposure of cells to anti-TCR antibody. The C6VL/1 T cell lymphoma has served as a control cell line in three experiments since it cannot be stimulated either to increased proliferation or to lymphokine release by this same antibody. However, a 10-ng/ml concentration of anti-TCR antibody was found to inhibit proliferation of both T cell lymphomas when they were cultured under optimal conditions, i.e., in the presence of an IL-2 source for 5C2. The proliferation of both T cell lymphomas appears to be regulated, although in different ways, by the binding of antibody in the vicinity of the TCR complex. While 5C2 is dependent on IL-2 production (and TCR triggering) to proliferate, C6VL/1 replicates independently of any growth factors. Signal transduction through the TCR/T3 complex, together with the subsequent production of growth factors, may be important for driving the proliferation of T cells such as 5C2 at an early stage in oncogenic progression following infection with an RNA tumor virus.",,,,"['Department of Experimental Pathology, John Curtin School of Medical Research, Canberra, Australia.']",,,,,,,,

None of the above mentioned parameters has a significant effect on the length of the latency period. In two series of sheep inoculated with decreasing number of lymphocytes from BLV-positive donor cows, hematological disorders and tumors appeared at first in recipient animals inoculated with the higher doses of infectious blood. Thus, the inoculated dose has an effect upon the length of the latency period; the higher the dose inoculated, the shorter the latency period. This finding suggests an explanation to the natural occurrence of multiple case herds as opposed to no-tumor case herds.

Ap3T, Ap4T, Ap2cpT and Ap3cpT were poor inhibitors of both enzymes. Ap5T, Ap6T and their phosphonate analogues were potent inhibitors of dTMP kinase, possibly acting as bisubstrate analogues (IC50 values: Ap5T, 7.9 microM; Ap4cpT, 5.8 microM; Ap6T, 5.4 microM; Ap4cpT, 4.0 microM). For CDP reductase, where these compounds may bridge activity/effector sites on the M1 subunit of the enzyme, Ap5T and Ap6T were inhibitors with IC50 values of 14.4 microM and 20.3 microM respectively. The phosphonate series of compounds was far less active. The thymidine moiety of the compounds was essential for inhibition since Ap5A was inactive against both enzymes. dTTP, although a poor inhibitor of thymidylate kinase was a potent negative effector of CDP reductase (IC50, 19.3 microM). Significantly, Ap5T was not hydrolysed to release dTTP under the conditions of the assay. These studies show that the activities of both enzymes may be modulated by nucleotide analogues.",,,,"['Drug Development Section, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, U.K.']",,,,,,,,

Here we show that highly purified nuclei from Friend cells, washed free of nuclear membrane by Triton, can incorporate radiolabel from [gamma-32P]ATP into phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The degree of radiolabelling of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate is highly dependent on the state of differentiation of the cells, being barely detectable in growing cells and much greater after dimethyl sulphoxide-induced differentiation; this difference is mostly due to different amounts of phosphatidylinositol phosphate in the isolated nuclei. We suggest that polyphosphoinositides are made inside the nucleus and that they have a role in chromatin function; either the phospholipids themselves play a role, or there is a possibility of intranuclear signalling by inositide-derived molecules.",,,PMC1148615,"['Istituto di Anatomia Umana Normale, University of Bologna, Italy.']",,,,,,,,

The blast cells of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) may be considered as a lineage; a minority are stem cells capable of both self-renewal and determination followed by terminal divisions ending in proliferatively inert cells retaining blast morphology. Two cell culture methods are available for the study of blasts. The first is a clonogenic assay. Blast stem cells form colonies in methylcellulose, containing proliferatively inert blast cells, together with a small number of new progenitors. Growth factor(s) are usually required. These may be supplied by media conditioned by the continuous bladder carcinoma cell line HTB9 (HTB9-CM). The recombinant growth factors GM-CSF and G-CSF are also active, and in many instances are synergistic. Blast progenitors will also grow in suspension, provided the cell density is high and growth factors are provided. In these cultures, blast progenitors increase in number, reflecting their self-renewal capacity. Evidence is also available that specific genes may be involved in the self-renewal process. Thus, three forms of growth regulation, similar to those encoded by proto-oncogenes, can be shown to be operative in AML blast cell cultures.",,,,"['Division of Biological Research, Ontario Cancer Institute, Canada.']",37,,,,,,,

Leukemic B-CLL DNA from five patients showed demethylation of these two sites in the productively rearranged allele and methylation of both sites in the nonexpressed allele whether rearranged or in germ-line configuration. Non-T-lymphocytes from normal individuals also showed part of the C kappa genes to have demethylation of both HpaII sites. On the other hand, C kappa genes from normal granulocytes, T-lymphocytes, and four of five fibroblast samples were methylated in one or both HpaII sites. We propose that in B-lymphocytes, demethylation of C kappa alleles is a specific event taking place in the expressed genes and being associated with an increased transcriptional activity of the gene. In addition to this specific demethylation, there is also an unspecific one that may appear in cells with silent C kappa genes and that do not modify the expression of the gene.",,,,"['IMBICE, La Plata, Argentina.']",,,,,,,,

The highest amount of nuclear MPO (3.5 micrograms per 10(6) nuclei) was found in granulocytes; less than half of this amount was detected in nuclei from HL-60 cells. Still lower levels were found in nuclei from monocytes and a series of human monomyelocytic leukemia cells. MPO from HL-60 cells was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography and fractionated into three components (forms I, II, and III) by CM-cellulose chromatography. Chromatography of these MPO forms on DNA-Sepharose columns confirmed that all three forms of MPO were tightly bound to DNA with apparent relative affinities in the order of form III greater than form II greater than form I. The affinity of MPO form III for DNA was sufficient to enable the formation and elution of DNA-MPO complexes during size-exclusion chromatography at high ionic strength and neutral pH. This form of MPO was also able to shield DNA from strand scission induced by active oxygen species generated by xanthine oxidase acting aerobically on xanthine.

Immunocompromised persons and their household contacts were excluded from the oral poliovirus vaccine target group and given instead a dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine.

Fourteen children, ages 3 to 17 years, with leukemia were given a booster dose of a novel high antigen content, trivalent inactivated poliovirus vaccine. All but two responded by an at least 4-fold increase in serum-neutralizing antibodies to at least one poliovirus serotype. These results indicate that children with acute lymphocytic leukemia in remission respond well to a booster dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine. Antibody concentrations to the uncommon local epidemic strain of type 3 poliovirus remained, however, relatively low in most patients (median, 1:6) suggesting relatively impaired heterologous response to vaccination. Possible spread of live vaccine viruses to the inactivated poliovirus-vaccinated children and their close contacts was evaluated by examining weekly fecal specimens from 20 children and their 19 regular adult contacts for cytopathic viruses.

We used an immunoprecipitation kinase assay to measure both autophosphorylation and artificial substrate phosphorylation by the mutant kinases. To assay transformation ability of the mutant proviruses, we transfected NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with the mutants and with helper virus (Moloney MuLV) by the DEAE-dextran method. Our analysis of these A-MuLV insertional mutants allows the division of the protein-coding region of the provirus into four domains: domain A (proviral bp 1068 to 1685), in which insertions have no effect on the bacterially expressed kinase, but diminish both kinase activity and transformation efficiency in fibroblasts; domain B (bp 1750 to 2078), in which insertions have no effect on the provirus; domain C (bp 2181 to 2878), the critical kinase domain, in which 12-bp or even 6-bp insertions completely inactivate the A-MuLV kinase and result in transformation-defective proviruses; and domain D (bp 2956 to 4610), the large C-terminal domain in which mutations are silent.",,['AM01336/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],PMC253657,"['Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032.']",,,,,,,,

Endogenous ecotropic type C virus induced by iododeoxyuridine from the nontransformed C3H/10T1/2 cell line is XC negative and replication deficient. In contrast, viruses produced late after iododeoxyuridine induction in chemically transformed C3H/10T1/2 cells (MCA5) are XC positive and infectious. XC-negative viruses can be converted to XC-positive viruses by being grown in certain transformed cell lines. We have cloned the endogenous ecotropic provirus of C3H/He from MCA5 cells, which is XC negative and replication deficient, as well as two XC-positive C3H proviruses derived by in vitro conversion. Fragment exchange between the XC-negative molecular clone p110 and the XC-positive AKR virus clone p623 revealed that the defect in p110 lies 3' of the SalI site located in the pol region. Nucleotide sequencing established that the C3H p110 provirus was integrated within the R region of an endogenous VL30 long terminal repeat (LTR) in reverse orientation and that the virus differed from the infectious AKR p623 provirus by a point mutation, substituting Lys for Arg at the potential precursor cleavage site for gp70 and p15E. In vitro-converted XC-positive C3H proviral clones 3211 and 4211 are identical to XC-negative C3H p110, except that they have Arg at this site and the normal cleavage site is thus regenerated in these clones. The XC-negative C3H p110 was blocked in processing of Pr85env, whereas clones 3211 and 4211 had normal cleavage of the env precursor into gp70. Both the XC-negative C3H provirus and the in vitro-converted XC-positive C3H proviruses had a single copy of a 99-base-pair enhancer element in the LTR, whereas two copies of this sequence are present in the AKR proviral LTR. Substitution of Arg for Lys at the envelope precursor processing site of C3H p110 by site-directed mutagenesis is sufficient by itself to convert the virus to the XC-positive replication-competent phenotype. Thus, we have established that a single point mutation at the processing site of the envelope precursor protein Pr85 is responsible for the difference in the infectivity and XC phenotype of endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia virus from C3H/He and AKR mice and that the basis for in vitro conversion is a mutation at this site.",,,PMC253652,"['Laboratory of Viral Carcinogenesis, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland 21701.']",,,"['GENBANK/M19005', 'GENBANK/M19006', 'GENBANK/M21028', 'GENBANK/M21031']",,,,,

In contrast to earlier studies which showed a great disparity in the rate and incidence of lymphomas in HRS/J hr/hr and HRS/J hr/+ mice, we found a high incidence of T-cell lymphomas and the same mean age of onset of disease in both strains. SJL/J mice died primarily of pre-B-cell lymphomas, whereas CWD/LeAgl and SEA/GnJ mice died primarily of B-cell lymphomas. Somatically acquired mink cell focus-forming proviruses were detected only in T-cell lymphomas, whereas ecotropic proviruses were found in lymphomas from all hematopoietic cell lineages. No rearrangements were detected in the Fis-1, Mlvi-2, and Myb loci, whereas rearrangements were detected in the Mlvi-1, Myc, Pim-1, Pvt-1, and Evi-1 loci. Most rearrangements were found in T-cell lymphomas, and many were virally induced. These results are similar to those we obtained previously for lymphomas of 21 highly lymphomatous AKXD recombinant inbred mouse strains.",,"['CA-37283/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-23909/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC253640,"['National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research Facility, Bionetics Research, Inc., Maryland 21701.']",,,,,,,,

F6A corresponds to the non-disease-specific common-form component of the immunodeficiency disease-inducing strain of FeLV, FeLV-FAIDS, and was isolated from tissue DNA of a cat following experimental transmission of naturally occurring feline acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

The F6A provirus is organized into 5'-LTR-gag-pol-env-LTR-3' regions; the gag and pol open reading frames are separated by an amber codon, and env is in a different reading frame.

Titration by HClO4 in CH3NO2 was used to determine pKas of the following diphosphines: R2P(CH2)nPR'2, where for R = R' = Ph, n = 1, 2, and 3 (dppm, dppe, and dppp respectively); for R = R' = Et, n = 2 (depe); for R = Ph, R' = Et, n = 2 (eppe); and for cis and trans Ph2PCH = CHPPh2 (dppey). The difference between the first and second protonation constants decreases as the length of the carbon chain between the two phosphorus centers increases. Unsaturation in the carbon chain lowers pKas. -PEt2 centers are apparently more basic than -PPh2 centers. Apart from electrostatic effects, the protonation of a given phosphine center appears to be independent of the substituents at the second phosphine center. The autoxidation reactions of dppm, dppe, dppp, depe, and cis-dppey were studied in a variety of solvents by 31P NMR spectroscopy. The ethyl-substituted diphosphines were much more rapidly oxidized than the phenyl-substituted, and the pathways of autoxidation differed. Generally, the phenyl-substituted diphosphines gave only mono- and dioxides, while the ethyl-substituted diphosphines additionally gave phosphinites and other oxidation products. The relevance of the autoxidation reactivity and the pKas to the contrasting antitumor activity of these diphosphines is discussed.",,,,"['Department of Chemistry, Birkbeck College, University of London, United Kingdom.']",,,,,,,,

We have examined the binding of human GM-CSF to a variety of responsive human cells and cell lines. The most mature myelomonocytic cells, specifically human neutrophils, macrophages, and eosinophils, express the highest numbers of a single class of high affinity receptors (Kd approximately 37 pM, 293-1000 sites/cell). HL-60 and KG-1 cells exhibit an increase in specific binding at high concentrations of GM-CSF; computer analysis of the data is nonetheless consistent with a single class of high affinity binding sites with a Kd approximately 43 pM and 20-450 sites/cell. Dimethyl sulfoxide induces a 3-10-fold increase in high affinity receptors expressed in HL-60 cells, coincident with terminal neutrophilic differentiation. Finally, binding of 125I-GM-CSF to fresh peripheral blood cells from six patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia was analyzed. In three of six cases, binding was similar to the nonsaturable binding observed with HL-60 and KG-1 cells.

We have compared the effects of m-AMSA and several acridine analogues (9-aminoacridine; A, NSC 343499; B, SN 16507; C, NSC 140701; D, SN 13553) on DNA integrity and cell survival in L1210 leukemia in vitro. Cells (or isolated nuclei) were treated with drugs (0.1-50 microM) for 0.5-1.0 h and subsequently analyzed using the alkaline elution technique. All drugs, except Compound D, produced DNA-protein cross-links (DPC) in L1210 cells. At 1 microM, potency was in the order, C greater than m-AMSA greater than B greater than A much greater than 9-aminoacridine. In isolated nuclei, DPC and single-strand breaks were produced in essentially a 1:1 ratio, which is consistent with topoisomerase II-mediated protein-linked DNA breaks. Potency differences were less pronounced in nuclei than in cells. In isolated nuclei, Compound D produced extensive DPC not associated with single-strand breaks, which suggests a more complex activity for this compound. Colony formation assays demonstrated the cytotoxicity of most of these acridine analogues (C greater than B greater than A approximately equal to m-AMSA much greater than D = 9-aminoacridine). Correlation of DPC with cell kill gave similar curves for each compound. These results are evidence for a causal relationship between drug-induced topoisomerase II-mediated DNA breaks and cytotoxicity.",,,,"['Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",,,,,,,,

To further characterize the role of HTLV-II, the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells were fractionated into four enriched subpopulations at autopsy. Oligoclonally integrated HTLV-II was detected in DNA from a T cell-enriched fraction and a CD8+ T cell-enriched fraction, but not in a CD4+ T cell-enriched fraction, a non-T cell fraction, or in B cells obtained from the malignant pleural effusion.

In a similar manner, chromosomal translocations associated with specific disease types can be detected with DNA probes in Southern blot analysis without the use of conventional cytogenetics.

Unlike avian cells transformed by other acutely transforming viruses, lymphoid cells transformed by REV-T are immortalized. Furthermore, in vitro derived, REV-T transformed cells which do not produce virus are tumorigenic and induce lethal reticuloendotheliosis when injected into histocompatible birds. Thus REV-T transforms its target cell both in vitro and in vivo. In addition this transformation is independent of any helper virus functions. Like other acute leukemia viruses, REV-T is replication-defective and must co-replicate with a reticuloendotheliosis associated virus (REV-A). During evolution, a substantial portion of its genome has been deleted and replaced with a host-derived genetic sequence, designated v-rel. Presumably, the v-rel oncogene was transduced from a normal turkey DNA locus, c-rel. There are 9 regions of homology between c-rel and v-rel, however, several differences exist between these genes, suggesting that transformation by REV-T results from the production of an altered v-rel protein. The v-rel sequence is distinct from other known oncogenes and encodes a 57-kDa phosphoprotein. In REV-T transformed cells, this pp57v-rel protein is localized in the cytoplasm. The product of the v-rel oncogene is present at a low level, representing only about 0.003% of total methionine-labelled protein. In addition, pp57v-rel is relatively stable, having an estimated half-life of 4-10 h. The v-rel protein when purified close to homogeneity is complexed with a 40-kDa cellular phosphoprotein in transformed lymphoid cells and possesses serine kinase activity.

In the current study we show that benextramine, a hydrophilic irreversible antagonist, can be used to investigate alpha 2-adrenergic receptor compartmentation in these cells. In membranes prepared from HEL cells, benextramine competed for all alpha 2-adrenergic receptors ( [3H]yohimbine sites). In intact cells, at 4 degrees, benextramine exhibited a biphasic competition curve for alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, with EC50 values of approximately 10 microM and greater than 1 mM for the high and low affinity components, respectively. We propose that the alpha 2-adrenergic receptors preferentially blocked by benextramine are those on the surface of the cell, whereas those with low affinity are sequestered receptors because: 1) only epinephrine-accessible sites [i.e., cell surface sites; McKernan et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 32:258-265 (1987)] are removed by prior treatment of cells with benextramine, 2) a preparation enriched with surface membranes is also enriched in receptors with a high affinity for benextramine; and 3) after blockade of cell surface receptors (54 +/- 6% of total sites, n = 7) by benextramine, the ability of the alpha 2-adrenergic agonists epinephrine and UK-14,304 to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation is lost. The latter result implies that only cell surface and not sequestered receptors are functionally coupled to adenylate cyclase. The return of receptors from the sequestered compartment to the cell surface and the recovery of alpha 2-adrenergic receptor function were measured after HEL cells were treated with benextramine (50 microM for 1 hr at 4 degrees). The recovery of receptor binding (t1/2 = 25 min) was somewhat slower than the recovery of function (t1/2 approximately 8 min). This is consistent with the existence of ""spare receptors"" and also suggests that the sequestered compartment of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors can rapidly exchange with those on the surface. When all alpha 2-adrenergic receptors were blocked by incubation of HEL cells with benextramine for 1 hr at 37 degrees, repopulation of surface and sequestered receptors was much slower (t1/2 = 9 hr for recovery of total receptors). Surface receptors recovered even more slowly than did total cellular receptors consistent with the idea that alpha 2-adrenergic receptors must traverse through intracellular locations before insertion into the cell surface.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,,,"['Department of Pharmacology, University of California, La Jolla 92093.']",,,,,,,,

Deoxycytidine (dCyd) and cytidine (Cyd) effectively blocked the intracellular phosphorylation of ddCyd: dCyd by competition with ddCyd for 2'-deoxycytidine kinase, and Cyd probably by competition with the higher nucleoside mono- and diphosphate kinases. These conclusions are supported by the observations that (i) the cytostatic effects of ddCyd against human Molt/4F cells are significantly reversed by dCyd; (ii) the antiviral effects of ddCyd against hman immunodeficiency virus-infected human ATH8 cells are reversed by dCyd and Cyd; (iii) phosphorylated metabolites of ddCyd could not be detected in a 2'-deoxycytidine kinase-deficient murine leukemia (L1210)/araC cell line; and (iv) ddCyd lacked any cytostatic effect against this araC-resistant L1210 cell line. In contrast to dCyd and Cyd, thymidine (dThd) stimulated formation of phosphorylated ddCyd metabolites. The degree of this stimulation proved dependent on preincubation time and dThd concentration. There was a correlation between the increased ddCTP levels upon preincubation of the cells with dThd, and decreased dCyd-5'-triphosphate pools, presumably caused by inhibition of cytidine-5' -diphosphate reductase by dThd-5'-triphosphate. In an attempt to discover compounds other than dThd that are able to stimulate ddCTP formation, a number of inhibitors of pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism were also studied. Under our experimental conditions, 3-deazauridine and hydroxyurea proved equally as effective as dThd in stimulating ddCyd phosphorylation. Finally, we could demonstrate that dThd significantly enhanced the protective effect of ddCyd against human immunodeficiency virus-infected ATH8 cells.",,,,"['Clinical Oncology Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",,,,,,,,

We have examined the role of replication-competent helper virus in the early and late stages of FV disease by replacing FMuLV, the native helper, with Akv, the endogenous ecotropic MuLV of AKR mice. SFFVP/FRE, an established fibroblast line nonproductively infected with the polycythemic strain of SFFV, was superinfected with FMuLV or with Akv. Although supernatants from these cells showed similar titers in the XC plaque assay, supernatants from Akv-infected SFFVP/FRE cells showed 100- to 5,000-fold less activity than did those from FMuLV-infected cells with respect to spleen focus induction in vivo. Since virions isolated from these two supernatants contained similar ratios of SFFV to helper virus genomic RNA, it did not appear that the difference was due to a relative inability of Akv to package SFFV. Although FMuLV- and Akv-rescued SFFV are equally infectious in a mouse fibroblast cell line (NIH 3T3), FMuLV-rescued SFFV was far more efficient in inducing erythroid bursts in cultured primary bone marrow cells. Adding Akv to preparations of FMuLV-rescued SFFV did not significantly interfere with burst induction. Helper-free SFFV induced 50- to 500-fold more spleen foci when coinjected with FMuLV than it did with Akv. Helper virus also affected mortality rates that reflect the late stage of the disease. When FMuLV- or Akv-rescued SFFV was injected into NIH Swiss mice at dosage levels adjusted to give equal numbers of spleen foci, all mice receiving FMuLV-rescued SFFV developed splenomegaly and died, whereas no mice receiving Akv-rescued SFFV died or developed detectable splenomegaly. When FMuLV was coinjected with Akv-rescued SFFV, the mortality rate rose from 0 to 100%. Injection of helper-free SFFV alone did not induce mortality, but coinjection of helper-free SFFV with FMuLV resulted in 100% mortality. Thus, the helper virus used to rescue SFFV plays at least a quantitatively important role in the early stage of FV disease and a crucial role in the late stage of the disease in vivo.",,['19931/PHS HHS/United States'],PMC250562,"['Department of Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461.']",,,,,,,,

However, the chemical carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene can induce ecotropic virus expression in approximately 95% of treated DBA/2 mice. Previous experiments involving DNA transfection and marker rescue analysis of molecularly cloned Emv-3 DNA suggested that Emv-3 carries a small defect(s) in the gag gene, not detectable by restriction enzyme mapping, that inhibits virus expression in vivo and in vitro. Using a combination of approaches, including DNA sequencing, peptide mapping, and metabolic labeling of cells with [3H]myristate, we have demonstrated that the defect in Emv-3 most likely results from a single nucleotide substitution within the gene for p15gag that inhibits myristylation of the Pr65gag N terminus. Myristylation of Pr65gag is thought to be required for this protein to associate with the plasma membrane and is essential for virus particle formation.

O2 consumption by these cells in response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; 100 ng/ml) or opsonized zymosan (3 mg/ml) was less than that by neutrophils, as was superoxide formation. O2 metabolism was not inhibited by KCN or antimycin A. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity decreased during differentiation but remained greater than that of human neutrophils. Cytochalasin B enhanced recovery of superoxide secreted in response to zymosan, implying its release from the phagosome. 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cells had morphology consistent with monocytes. O2 consumption and superoxide release were less than with Me2SO-treated cells. Unlike the case with human monocytes, O2 consumption was not inhibited by KCN or antimycin A. MPO activity was minimally reduced by differentiation. Cytochalasin B inhibited recovery of superoxide. Luminol-dependent luminescence was greater among 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cells than among Me2SO-treated cells. Free radicals were also measured with a spin trapping technique using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO). Spin trapping allows direct, simultaneous detection of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. Regardless of the mechanism of differentiation, only superoxide was formed by HL-60 cells.

We report that macrophage cytotoxicity of these cell lines is dependent upon the direct contact between tumor cells and macrophages. In contrast, macrophage-mediated cytostasis occurred via soluble macrophage products and no differential susceptibility of F5b or F5m to macrophage-mediated cytostasis was observed. Macrophage binding of F5b was also significantly better than that of F5m. These data suggest that only the events that depend upon the close contact of macrophages and tumor cells will be affected by the expression of AKR or AKR-like virus.

For example, the cells in a Kirsten sarcoma virus-modified line were found to biosynthesize and secrete von Willebrand factor in both a constitutive and regulated manner, and they contained ultrastructurally identifiable Weibel-Palade bodies, an endothelial cell-specific organelle. In contrast to the parent cultures, sarcoma virus-modified cells were able to proliferate indefinitely in culture. Examination of both Kirsten sarcoma and Moloney leukemia virus-modified lines indicated that the immortalized cells retained a diploid female karyotype after over 18 months in culture. In addition, the sarcoma virus-modified cells were able to grow independently of added endothelial cell growth factor. This growth factor autonomy does not appear to be due to autocrine production of a biologically cross-reactive growth factor. These immortal, virus-modified endothelial cells express large amounts of sarcoma virus-specific mRNA but no detectable helper virus or transforming virus activity. This technique for immortalization of primary human cells without alteration of the differentiated characteristics of the cell type is readily applied to a variety of human cell types.

In the present study, we used the human erythroleukemic cell line K562 to examine expression and regulation of the receptor for Epo using 125I-labeled, bioactive recombinant human Epo. K562 cells expressed low numbers of a single class of high-affinity Epo receptors corresponding to 4 to 6 receptors per K562 cell (KD = 270 to 290 pmol/L). Treatment of K562 cell cultures with medium conditioned by the EPA-secreting cell line U937 (U937CM) increased receptor expression 2.6 to 3.5-fold to 13 to 17 receptors/cell (KD = 260 to 300 pmol/L). That all of the Epo receptor-potentiating activity in U937CM was accounted for by EPA was shown by a similar increase in Epo receptor expression on K562 cells with recombinant EPA. The effect of U937CM on Epo receptors was reversed by culturing cells in inducer-free medium for 3 days. Medium conditioned by the 5637 cell line had no effect on Epo receptors on K562 cells. In methylcellulose culture, U937CM and Epo acted synergistically to increase erythroid differentiation of K562. Similarly, U937CM stimulated human cord blood CFU-E growth under conditions in which Epo was limiting or in excess.

Ara-C did not affect the cellular uptake of m-AMSA or etoposide, the amount of 0.35 M NaCl-extractable nuclear topoisomerase II activity from either cell line, or the ability of this enzyme activity to covalently bind to DNA in the presence of the drugs, m-AMSA- and etoposide-induced DNA cleavage is thought to result from drug-induced stabilization of a topoisomerase II-DNA complex. The ability of ara-C to modulate this effect and associated cytotoxicity appears to be mediated by the effects of ara-C on cellular targets other than topoisomerase II but which are important to topoisomerase II-mediated events, such as protein-associated DNA cleavage. A good candidate for such a target may be cellular chromatin.",,"['CA39809/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA40090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute, Houston 77030.']",,,,,,,,

HL-60 cells grown in SFM were induced to differentiate into monocytes/macrophages by calcitriol as indicated by induction of differentiation-associated biological and biochemical parameters: chemiluminescent (CL) responsiveness, lysozyme activity, nonspecific esterase, expression of cell surface antigens, and reduced proliferation. The exposure of HL-60 cells in SFM to calcitriol (from 10(-10) to 10(-8)M) resulted in dose-dependent induction of these parameters, which was similar to those obtained with cells grown in 10% fetal calf serum containing medium (10% SCM). However, calcitriol was 5-fold more potent for HL-60 cells cultured in SFM than those cultured in 10% SCM as indicated by shifts in dose-response curves for induction of CL responsiveness and lysozyme activity. The effect of calcitriol on the proliferation and acquisition of several monocyte-associated cell surface antigens was also more sensitive for HL-60 cells cultured in SFM than for cells grown in 10% SCM. We characterized and quantitated calcitriol receptors in HL-60 cells cultured in SFM in comparison to those in 10% SCM after exposing intact cells to radiolabeled calcitriol. Cells cultured in either SFM or 10% SCM exhibited calcitriol receptors that migrated at 3.4S as a single peak on sucrose gradients and elicited inherent DNA binding ability. There was essentially no difference in the apparent dissociation constants (Kd) nor in the number of calcitriol binding sites per HL-60 cell, that is approximately 6.0 X 10(-11) M and approximately 3000 binding sites/cell respectively. It is concluded that culturing HL-60 cells in SFM results in full expression of calcitriol-induced phenotypic changes excluding the possibility that such changes result from the indirect effect of calcitriol mediated by identified and/or unidentified components present in serum.",,['AM27234/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],,"['School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53706.']",,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Randomized trial with intermittent interferon administration to day 80 after transplantation. SETTING: Marrow transplantation units of a cancer research center. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia in remission at the time of transplantation. Thirty-nine patients received interferon, and 40 were control patients. INTERVENTIONS: Partially purified human leukocyte interferon given every 3 days beginning after marrow engraftment and continuing to day 80 after transplantation. After initial safety testing, the starting and minimum dose was 6 X 10(4) units/kg of body weight, with dose escalations determined by the circulating neutrophil count. Transplant conditioning and post-transplantation prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease with methotrexate followed standard procedures. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: No difference was observed in the probability or severity of cytomegalovirus infection or in the probability or severity of graft-versus-host disease. Relapse of leukemia occurred in 9 interferon recipients and 21 control patients, with a minimum follow-up of 4 years among surviving patients. The probability of relapse among all interferon recipients was 0.36 (95% confidence interval [Cl], 0.56 to 0.17) and among all control patients was 0.74 (95% Cl, 0.91 to 0.58) (p = 0.04 by log-rank test). Among patients who received transplants in first or second remission, the probability of relapse among interferon recipients was 0.19 (95% Cl, 0.37 to 0.02) compared with 0.71 (95% Cl, 0.97 to 0.51) among control patients (p = 0.008 by log-rank test). Survival rates did not differ between interferon recipients and control patients. Transient decreases in leukocyte count and anorexia and nausea occurred among interferon recipients. Six interferon recipients, all of whom had received chemoradiotherapy of the central nervous system before transplantation, developed leukoencephalopathy after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that interferon given after transplantation reduces the risk for subsequent relapse of leukemia. The effect of longer administration and of administration in patients with other underlying diseases will require additional trials. No effect was observed on cytomegalovirus infection, either because interferon was not initiated until a median of 18 days after transplantation or because of a lesser effect among marrow allograft recipients.",,"['CA 15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 26966/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,"['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.']",,,,,,,,

We have observed a marked increase in the incidence of thymic lymphoma in male B6C3F1 relative to NIH Swiss mice chronically exposed to BD in the absence of demonstrable differences in bone marrow (target organ) toxicity. Increased expression of murine leukemia virus (MuLV) antigens was also observed on lymphomas from BD-exposed B6C3F1 mice. Because NIH Swiss mice do not usually express endogenous retroviruses and their ecotropic proviral sequences are not intact, these findings provide presumptive evidence of a role for endogenous retrovirus sequences in BD-induced lymphoma in the B6C3F1 mouse. The present study was conducted to examine the expression and behavior of endogenous retroviruses in these strains during the preleukemic phase of BD exposure. Chronic exposure to BD (1250 ppm) 6 hr/day, 5 days/wk for 3 to 21 weeks increased markedly the quantity of ecotropic retrovirus recoverable from bone marrow, thymus, and spleen of B6C3F1 mice. However, expression of other endogenous retroviruses (xenotropic, MCF-ERV) was not enhanced. No viruses of any type were found in similarly treated NIH Swiss mice. The mechanism of this increase in ecotropic retrovirus in B6C3F1 mice is believed to be de novo activation in greater numbers of cells because changes in the Fv-1 tropism of the replicating viruses or changes in Fv-1 host restriction were not found. Endogenous retroviruses are thus implicated in BD-induced leukemogenesis in B6C3F1 mice. Further studies will examine the role of retrovirus in BD-induced leukemogenesis and the mechanisms of activation of ecotropic proviral sequences in murine cells.",,,,"['Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.']",,,,,,,,

Studies of deleted forms of the LTR supported a central role in these responses for the HIV-1 enhancer, which alone was sufficient for mitogen inducibility, but also suggested that other 5' positive and negative regulatory elements contribute to the overall magnitude of the response. Synergistic activation of the HIV-1 LTR (up to several thousandfold) was observed with combinations of these mitogens and the HIV-1--derived tat-III protein. Cyclosporin A, an immunosuppressive agent, inhibited PHA-mediated activation of the HIV-1 LTR but was without effect in the presence of other mitogens.

This increase correlated with an increase in the number of circulating B lymphocytes as demonstrated by the presence of surface immunoglobulins (SIg) and a high cell proliferative response to lipopolysaccharide and was considered to be a persistent B cell lymphocytosis. Lymphosarcoma developed in five BLV-infected sheep between 19 and 38 months postinoculation and was preceded in four out of five of these cases by an elevation in peripheral blood lymphocytes which began 4 to 26 months before death due to lymphosarcoma. The majority of tumor cells in all lymphosarcoma cases were of the centroblastic type, and in two cases in which the presence of SIg was assayed, the majority of tumor cells were SIg-positive.

In the present study we compared TTNPB with 13-cis-retinoic acid (RA) in its potential to inhibit cell growth and to induce morphological differentiation and functional activity in two cell lines established in vitro from either acute promyelocytic (HL-60) or acute myelomonocytic (LK) patients. Both agents, 10(-6) M, were found to effectively inhibit cell growth and cause a significant decrease in number of immature granulocytes in both cell lines. However, while in HL-60 cells this decrease was associated with a concomitant increase in fully mature granulocytes (neutrophil-like cells) the maturation of LK cells was blocked at the metamyelocyte stage. Study of the functional activity of the induced cells revealed that the rate of superoxide (O-2) production, as assayed by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable ferricytochrome c reduction, was faster in RA treated HL-60 cells than in TTNPB treated cells (0.41 vs. 0.25 nmol. O2-/10(6) cells/60 min). Superoxide production by LK cells treated by either TTNPB or RA was negligible. The percentage of O2(-)-producing cells was determined cytochemically by their ability to reduce the dye nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT). The results showed that production of O2-by LK cells exposed to TTNPB or RA was negligible by this method as well. A higher percentage of HL-60 cells reduced NBT following incubation with RA than with TTNPB (93 +/- 4% vs 26 +/- 2%), but neither of the two retinoids affected the ability of LK cells to reduce NBT. TTNPB thus proved less effective than RA in inducing morphological and functional differentiation in HL-60 cells, whereas in LK cells both agents inhibited cell growth but induced only partial cell differentiation.",,,,"['Department of Histology and Cell Biology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.']",,,,,,,,

Since Moloney virus is thought to induce mostly T-cell lymphomas, we have carried out studies to investigate this alteration of disease specificity and to determine whether v-abl played an obligatory role in the development of these tumors. We found that, whereas lymphomas developed late (greater than 3 months) in both pristane-primed and unprinted control mice, the myelomonocytic tumors arose at a high frequency, within 3 months, but only in pristane-treated mice. Clonal Moloney virus insertion was again found in each of the seven myelomonocytic tumors examined. Northern blot analyses and S1 mapping studies revealed the presence of virally promoted chimeric mRNAs that lack the three 5'-most myb coding exons.

A panel of eight monoclonal antiidiotypic antibodies raised against a monoclonal antibody which reacts with a mouse mammary tumor virus cross-reactive qp52 envelope protein (TAA) of the L1210/GZL lymphoma was used to measure the expression of idiotopes in sera from different treatment groups. Significant correlations between the expression of certain idiotopes and the growth of the tumor or the establishment of anti-tumor immunity are seen. 1) Idiotypes detected by anti-idiotype D11 are high in anti-idiotype immunized progressor or tumor-susceptible mice and low or absent in regressor mice, i.e., the mice immunized with the protective 2F10 anti-idiotype; 2) the 3A4-detected idiotypes are less frequent or absent in irradiated tumor-immunized regressor mice than in untreated mice challenged with live tumor or progressor mice; 3) no difference in the anti-TAA titers is seen in mice in which the tumor growth is inhibited and in mice in which the tumor grows; 4) no difference in 11C1 idiotype + anti-TAA titer was observed between regressor and progressor mice; and 5) mice with normal or accelerated tumor growth have higher titers of idiotypes detected by a polyclonal anti-idiotype. These findings provide evidence for a regulatory idiotype network induced by the growing L1210/GZL tumor or by anti-idiotypic immunization. The titer of anti-TAA antibody does not correlate with the biology of tumor growth, but certain idiotopes correlate with either progressive or regressive tumor behavior. Therefore, the target of the idiotype regulation is likely to be anti-tumor T effector cells. Effective idiotype therapy of tumors must deal with the complexity of idiotype regulation induced by the tumor itself and is unlikely to be successful if anti-idiotypes are used only as internal mimicry of a TAA.",,,,"['Department of Molecular Immunology, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",,,,,,,,

Interleukin 2 (IL-2) activated killer (AK) cells have been shown to lyse freshly explanted tumor cells in vitro and have been used as a form of adoptive immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer. In this report, the ability of AK cells to lyse HTLV-1-infected targets was examined. Normal lymphocytes, when cultured in recombinant IL-2 for periods of 3 to 7 days, killed infected T and B cell lines. The precursor for these AK cells resided in the CD-16 antigen-positive subset (i.e., natural killer (NK) cells). Resting T cells, NK cells, or unfractionated lymphocytes did not lyse the infected targets. However, when isolated NK cells were incubated for 24 hr in IL-2, suboptimal cytolysis was induced whereas activation of NK cells with a four pulse of IL-2 was insufficient to generate effector cells. The results of performing cold target inhibition studies with Epstein-Barr virus-infected B cell lines and HTLV-1-infected T and B cell lines suggest that there are discrete subsets (i.e., clonotypic) in the AK population that preferentially lyse a given virally infected cell line. Thus to consider AK cells as true polyspecific killer cells may be inaccurate. Alternately AK cells may express a number of different receptors with variable affinities for the Epstein-Barr virus- and HTLV-1-infected cell lines. In addition, it was shown that HTLV-1-infected B cells are relatively resistant to AK cell-mediated lysis. These results clearly indicate that AK cells but not resting NK cells kill HTLV-1-infected cells.",,,,"['Department of Medicine, University of Illinois College of Medicine at Chicago 60612.']",,,,,,,,

Wild type HL-60 cells were resistant at these concentrations but responded with differentiation into monocyte-like cells at higher concentrations. An antigenic relationship between DIF and LT was indicated because a neutralizing monoclonal anti-LT antibody bound to and neutralized both differentiation and growth inhibitory effects of DIF. An activity, which cochromatographed with DIF during all purification steps, competed with binding of both rLT and recombinant tumor necrosis factor (rTNF) to HL-60 cells. By use of radioiodinated ligand, 2100 binding sites for rLT were detected on HL-60 cells with a Kd of 330 pmol/l. At 37 degrees C bound ligand was transferred to lysosomes, followed by degradation. rTNF and rLT were shown to compete for binding sites on HL-60 cells. Receptors for both rLT and rTNF were downregulated by activators of protein kinase C such as phorbol diester or diacylglycerol; the number of cell surface receptors decreased while the Kd remained unchanged.

The substrate of this enzyme, the superoxide anion, was found to be formed during the in vitro oxidation reaction of avarol to its semiquinone radical in the presence of oxygen. Under the same incubation conditions plasmid DNA (pBR322) was converted from the fully supercoiled circular form mainly to the nicked circular form, indicating that the compound causes primarily single-strand breaks. Using Friend erythroleukemia cells (FLC) it was found that avarol induces a dose-dependent DNA damage; the maximum number of DNA strand breaks was observed at 5 h after addition of the compound to the cells. Removal of avarol resulted in a rapid DNA rejoining with biphasic repair kinetics [first half-time, 8 min (90% of the breaks) and a second half-time, 40 min (10% of the breaks)]. When the degree of avarol-induced DNA damage in FLC was compared with the drug-caused inhibition of cell growth a close correlation was established. Avarol displayed no effect on dimethyl sulfoxide-induced erythrodifferentiation of FLC as determined by the benzidine reaction and by dot blot hybridization experiments. From incubation studies of FLC with [3H]avarol no hint was obtained for the formation of an adduct between DNA and the compound. The subcellular distribution of [3H]avarol was studied in liver cells after i.v. application of the compound. The predominant amount of the compound was present in the cytosolic fraction; little avarol was associated with plasma membranes, nuclei, and mitochondria. Using (a) oxidative phosphorylation and (b) oxygen uptake as parameters for mitochondria function, no effect of the compound on the activity of this organelle was determined.

The pathogenesis of FeLV-FAIDS-induced feline immunodeficiency disease is characterized by: a prodromal period of largely asymptomatic viremia; progressive weight loss, lymphoid hyperplasia associated with viral replication in lymphoid follicles, lymphoid depletion associated with extinction of viral replication in lymphoid follicles, intractable diarrhea associated with necrosis of intestinal crypt epithelium, lymphopenia, suppressed lymphocyte blastogenesis, impaired cutaneous allograft rejection, hypogammaglobulinemia, and opportunistic infections such as bacterial respiratory disease and necrotizing stomatitis. The clinical onset of immunodeficiency syndrome correlates with the replication of a specific FeLV-FAIDS viral variant, detected principally as unintegrated viral DNA, in bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, and intestine. Two of seven cats with chronic immunodeficiency disease that survived greater than 1 year after inoculation developed lymphoma affecting the marrow, intestine, spleen, and mesenteric nodes.

Diseases for which ABMT is indicated are selected on the basis of sensitivity to escalation of drug and radiation dose. These diseases include non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia, small cell carcinoma of the lung, melanoma, neuroblastoma, metastatic breast cancer and Ewing's sarcoma. Phase I and phase II studies have demonstrated that dose escalation to several times the conventional dosage may be feasible with the use of ABMT. Clinical trials of intensive therapy plus ABMT have produced encouraging results in terms of response rate and long-term survival for selected patients with poor-prognosis malignant diseases which are resistant or refractory to conventional forms of cancer therapy. When these preliminary results are analysed, it is apparent that the outcome of this treatment modality is affected by several factors such as disease status or tumor burden at the time of ABMT, the anti-tumor effect of the pretransplant intensive therapy and the extent of bone marrow invasion by tumor cells.

HL-60 cells have a specific receptor for 1,25-(OH)2D3 with an apparent Kd of 0.25 nM, identical with that of chick intestinal receptor. While the binding affinities of 26,27-F6-1,25-(OH)2D3 and 26,27-F6-1,24-(OH)2D3 for chick intestinal receptor were lower than that of 1,25-(OH)2D3 by factors of 3 and 1.5, respectively, they were as competent as 1,25-(OH)2D3 in binding to HL-60 cell receptor. The ability of 26,27-F6-1-OH-D3 to compete for receptor protein from HL-60 cells and chick intestine was about 1/70 that of 1,25-(OH)2D3.

In certain mouse strains, FV shows striking similarities to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in man in that infected mice have severe T-cell immunosuppression but also develop virus-neutralizing antibodies incapable of eliminating infected cells. Previously we noted the influence of mouse major histocompatibility complex (H-2) genes on both FV-induced immunosuppression and on ability to protect mice against FV by immunizing with a vaccinia-Friend murine leukaemia helper virus (F-MuLV) envelope (env) recombinant virus. Here we show that different subregions of H-2 are involved in susceptibility to virus-induced immunosuppression (H-2D subregion) and protective immunization with a recombinant vaccinia virus (H-2K or I-A subregions). Thus, susceptibility to virus-induced immunosuppression does not preclude protection by vaccinia-Friend immunization. The mechanism of protection seems to involve priming of immune T cells, and not initial induction of neutralizing antibodies or cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) (ref.2). Subsequent virus challenge generates a secondary response, resulting in appearance of IgG antibodies and CTL. In human HIV infection there could also be host genetic influences on elements of disease pathogenesis, such as immunosuppression, and on the success of T-cell priming by potential protective vaccines.",,,,"['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Hamilton, Montana 59840.']",,,,,,,,

Stimulation of JURKAT by anti-Leu-4 induced a rapid and immediate decrease in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2] and an increase in the 32P-labeling of phosphatidic acid, which occurred after a short lag period. An analysis of inositol phosphates formed in the anti-Leu-4-stimulated JURKAT indicated the formation of inositol trisphosphate. These results strongly suggested that the T3 complex or T3/antigen receptor (Ti) complex functions as a receptor which transduces antigen signal, presented by either antigen-presenting cells or target cells, into the hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2. Fetal bovine serum at a dose of 1-20 microliters/ml induced a marked and transient [Ca2+]i increase in JURKAT immediately after addition. However, the level of formation of inositol phosphates was very small in cells stimulated by fetal bovine serum.

We now show that this is associated with the formation of small numbers of protein-linked DNA breaks (a characteristic of topoisomerase reactions).

Neutrophil studies performed included myeloperoxidase release and superoxide anion generation, measured spectrophotometrically, in response to stimulation by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, opsonized zymosan, and the chemotactic peptide formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), respectively.

No significant change was noted following 2 or 8 weeks of interferon therapy. Because of the severe thrombocytopenia prevalent in myelodysplastic syndrome, fewer platelet studies were feasible. One patient, however, exhibited normal platelet numbers but markedly decreased aggregation in response to arachidonic acid, epinephrine, and collagen. After 4 weeks of treatment, this patient's platelet aggregation was noted to be normal. Platelets from two patients were purified by gel filtration, and the ATP/ADP ratios were determined by HPLC. Pretreatment ATP/ADP ratio of one patient was 4.85 (normal = 1.85 +/- 0.28) which declined to 3.27 on treatment and then returned to 4.80 following a 14-day period off treatment. Another patient, also with elevated ATP/ADP, exhibited a smaller decline during a treatment cycle. From these studies it was concluded that fMLP-stimulated superoxide generation may be a sensitive marker for neutrophil dysfunction in the myelodysplastic syndrome.

C57BL/6 mice were much more resistant to MHSV and Ha-MuSV-induced spleen focus formation than DDD mice regardless of their Fv-2 state.

The Ha-MuSV caused a strikingly different benign histiocytic tumor in DDD mice and, unlike MHSV, did not induce a rapid, progressive splenomegaly in C57BL/6 mice. Infection of DDD mice with MHSV induced a rapid and synchronized depletion of early and late erythroid precursor cell pools. In MHSV-infected C57BL/6 mice comparable changes were observed with dissimilar kinetics.

For ACIT, mice bearing 5-day-old tumors received cyclophosphamide followed by transfer of resting helper T lymphocyte clones with or without exogenous interleukin 2 (rIL-2). A single injection of clone B10 was effective in ACIT when followed by a short course of exogenous rIL-2. Alternatively, repeated injections of resting clone were also effective without exogenous rIL-2, suggesting that the major role for rIL-2 was prolongation of clone survival in vivo rather than activation of other effector cells. Clone F12, specific for a component of fetal calf serum, was not effective in ACIT either with or without rIL-2, even when administered under conditions known to result in clone activation.

By comparison, infection of mice with A-MuLV results primarily in the development of pre-B cell lymphomas. To determine whether A-MuLV could induce erythroid disease in vivo, NFS/N mice were pretreated with phenylhydrazine (PHZ) to stimulate erythropoiesis and increase the frequency of potential target cells for A-MuLV. No erythroleukemias developed in mice treated with PHZ. Instead, the latency for pre-B cell lymphomas was reduced by half. This acceleration of disease could be attributed to a marked increase in pre-B cells as targets for transformation by A-MuLV in the bone marrows but not the spleens of treated mice. Increases in the frequencies of T cells in bone marrow and spleen also followed treatment with PHZ. These results show that although PHZ-induced anemia stimulates the production of T and B cells as well as erythroid progenitors, PHZ-treated mice do not develop erythroleukemia or T cell lymphomas. It was also found that the genetically determined resistance of adult C57BL/6 mice to lymphoma induction by A-MuLV could not be overcome by pretreatment with PHZ even though the frequency of pre-B cells in bone marrow was greatly increased by this treatment.",,,,"['Laboratory of Immunopathology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",,,,,,,,

First, we studied growth inhibition by DUP-785 in L1210 leukemia cells and M5 melanoma cells. The concentrations causing 50% growth inhibition after 48 hr of culture were 5.8 and 0.6 microM, respectively. DUP-785 had to be present continuously throughout culture. Growth inhibition by 25 microM DUP-785 could be prevented by addition of 1 mM uridine or orotic acid to cultures of these cell lines; in M5 cells cytidine was also able to prevent growth inhibition. Dihydro-orotic acid (DHO) and carbamyl-aspartate were not able to prevent growth inhibition by DUP-785. Second, we studied accumulation of orotic acid and of orotidine induced by incubation with 1 microM pyrazofurin, an inhibitor of the orotate phosphoribosyl-transferase-orotidine-monophosphate decarboxylase complex. Addition of DUP-785 to the culture medium prevented the orotic acid accumulation. Furthermore, DUP-785 prevented accumulation of H14CO3- into orotic acid of pyrazofurin-treated L1210 cells. Third, we measured the effect of DUP-785 on DHO-dehydrogenase (DHO-DH), since the results indicated that this enzyme was affected by DUP-785. DHO-DH was assayed in isolated rat liver mitochondria. The Km for L-DHO was about 12 microM. DUP-785 appeared to be a potent inhibitor of DHO-DH with an apparent Ki of about 0.1 microM and an apparent Ki' of about 0.8 microM. The mode of inhibition appeared to be linear mixed type. After exposure of L1210 cells to 25 microM DUP-785 for 2 hr DHO-DH was almost completely inhibited. After suspension in fresh medium without drug, DHO-DH activity was recovered to about 60% after 24 hr.

Concentrations of ascorbate greater than 0.5 mM increased the frequency of DNA strand breaks caused by MNU in both L1210 murine leukemia cells and guinea-pig pancreatic cells in tissue culture; ascorbate alone led to DNA strand breaks in the latter cells. Investigations of the mechanism of DNA damage were carried out with purified DNA. Ascorbate produced single- and double-strand breaks in plasmid DNA. Cleavage was catalyzed by copper(II), inhibited by catalase and blocked by the presence of thiols.

These compounds cause the enzyme to cleave DNA, forming a DNA-protein complex that may be a key step leading to cell death. It is apparently unique as a chemotherapy target, since drug potency diminishes with decreasing enzyme activity. It was thus of interest to examine the topoisomerase content and drug-induced DNA cleavage in freshly obtained human leukemia cells and to compare the obtained data with the results of similar studies performed in well-characterized human leukemia cell lines. The human T-lymphoblast line, CCRF-CEM, was more than 100-fold more sensitive to the DNA-cleavage effect of etoposide than the cells of the 13 leukemic patients examined. One of the leukemia lines (HL-60) and a lymphoblastoid line (RPMI-7666) were somewhat less sensitive than cells of the CCRF-CEM cells, but were still 10-fold more sensitive than the patients studied. The relative insensitivity of the freshly obtained cells could not be accounted for by differences with respect to drug uptake but were associated with markedly reduced topoisomerase-II content as assayed by immunoblotting using a mouse polyclonal serum against topoisomerase II. Heterogeneity was observed in the sensitivities of patients' cells with respect to both drug-induced DNA cleavage and enzyme content. The observed differences between cultured cell lines and patients' cells may have been related to their proliferative status. Etoposide potency in normal resting lymphocytes resembles that observed in circulating leukemia cells. However, following mitogenesis with phytohemagglutinin and interleukin-2, proliferating lymphocytes become as sensitive to etoposide as cultured cell lines with regard to DNA cleavage. This effect was accompanied by an increase in topoisomerase-II content. Our data thus support the hypothesis that topoisomerase-II content may be an important determinant of cell sensitivity to certain classes of chemotherapy agents. Efforts to stimulate topoisomerase-II content may improve the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs.",,['CA 40884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['Department of Pharmacology, University of Florida, Gainesville 32610.']",,,,,,,,

In addition, the potential presence of soluble inhibitors of macrophage tumoricidal activity in serum-free culture supernatants and in serum from strain 2 guinea pigs terminally ill with the leukemia was tested by determining the effects of leukemic guinea pig serum (LGPS) or L2C-conditioned medium (CM) on the tumoricidal activity of normal pulmonary macrophages.

The lymphokine-stimulated cytotoxic activity of normal macrophages was inhibited in the presence of LGPS or CM. Oxidative burst activity of normal macrophages, as measured by zymosan-stimulated production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, was also inhibited under these conditions.

Studies on 17 normal individuals and 17 patients with lymphomas and leukemias (other than CML) indicated that for the restriction enzymes chosen, only expected germ line DNA bands were obtained. In contrast, novel DNA bands interpreted as being the product of translocation within the bcr region could be demonstrated in 31 of 31 cases of Ph-positive CML. One commercially available 1.2 kb bcr probe detected most cases of CML. Because of the frequent presence of deletion of part of the bcr region, however, a probe from the 5' end of bcr is essential to detect some cases. An analysis of the bcr breakpoints occurring in CML patients suggested a difference in the location of the breakpoints for the blast crisis patients versus chronic phase patients although the difference between these two groups was not statistically significant.

The FL-18 cells lacked cytoplasmic immunoglobulin and were positive for common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA), whereas the FL-18-EB cells had cytoplasmic immunoglobulin and were negative for CALLA.

Within 25 years of 3-year survival about 4% developed a SPT, about 6-fold expected, the relative risk not varying much with increasing follow-up. Following genetic retinoblastoma we observed 30-fold the expected number of SPTs, and over 400-fold the expected number of osteosarcomas. The risk of SPT in the absence of radiotherapy and chemotherapy (inherent risk) following genetic retinoblastoma was 13-fold expected and over 200-fold the expected number of osteosarcomas were observed. There was evidence that both radiotherapy and cyclophosphamide were associated with an increased risk of SPT. After all first primary tumours (FPTs) excluding retinoblastoma we observed almost 5-fold the expected number of SPTs. The inherent risk was 4-fold expected, the relative risks associated with radiotherapy but no chemotherapy, and both radiotherapy and chemotherapy were 6- and 9-fold expected respectively. There were about 20-fold the number of malignant bone tumours expected, most were osteosarcoma; also 7-fold the number of central nervous system tumours expected. There were 8 basal cell carcinomas and it seems likely that radiotherapy was involved in the development of some of these. Radiotherapy appears to have been involved in the development of many of the SPTs observed following all FPTs excluding retinoblastoma, particularly after CNS tumours, Wilms' tumour and Hodgkin's disease. Currently there is insufficient follow-up to examine the risk following chemotherapy. After acute leukaemia there was 20-fold the expected number of central nervous system tumours, though this is based on only 3 cases; whether therapy is directly involved in their development is uncertain. The risks we report are rarely greater than those reported in previous large-scale studies; in most instances they are substantially less. It is very unlikely that many SPTs were missed with our follow-up system so alternative explanations require further investigation; in particular it is possible the lower risks in our data compared to series treated in the United States may be explained, in part, by less combination therapy and lower doses of radiotherapy.",,,PMC2002190,"['Childhood Cancer Research Group, Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, UK.']",,,,,,,,

The major component of toxicity up to 24 h of di- and tri-phenols is due to toxic oxygen species acting outside the cells and not to cellular uptake of these phenols as such. In fact the addition of oxygen-radical-scavenger enzymes significantly (P less than 0.01) decreased the adverse effect of these drugs on all cell lines. The lower toxicity of monophenols and resorcinol as compared with that of di- and tri-phenols is due, in our opinion, to the fact that they are less oxidized under the conditions existing in the culture medium, and therefore do not produce sufficient levels of oxygen radicals.

These studies revealed that in control and monensin (1 microM) treated cells, more than 85% of the total immunoprecipitable radiolabeled myeloperoxidase was present predominantly in precursor form (Mr 91,000) and resided in lower density compartments after an initial 3-h labeling period. Using biochemical and ultrastructural techniques, the lower density regions of the gradient were found to contain elements of the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex. Following a 16-h chase period, about 70% of the radiolabeled myeloperoxidase in untreated cells was found predominantly in denser regions of the gradient and was present mainly in the form of the mature large subunit (Mr 63,000). These dense regions were shown to contain azurophilic granules by means of the distribution of beta-glucuronidase and myeloperoxidase activities and by electron microscopy. Processing of myeloperoxidase and its deposition into dense granules were blocked by monensin treatment. Following a 16-h chase period in the presence of monensin, approximately 80% of the radiolabeled myeloperoxidase continued to reside in lower density compartments and was predominantly in precursor (Mr 91,000) and intermediate (Mr 81,000 and 74,000) forms. Only about 10% of the radiolabeled myeloperoxidase was associated with dense azurophilic granules. Monensin treatment produced large, Golgi-derived vacuoles which were isolated using Percoll density centrifugation and identified by electron microscopy. These vacuoles were found to be essentially devoid of peroxidase activity and pulse-labeled, newly synthesized radiolabeled myeloperoxidase species. The effects of monensin on transport and processing were reversible after a 3-h exposure and 16-h chase period in the absence of monensin. Taken together, these data indicate that maturation of myeloperoxidase is closely linked to its deposition into dense azurophilic granules via a monensin-sensitive process(es). The lower density compartments within which immature myeloperoxidase species accumulate in the presence of monensin appear to be functionally related to or associated with Golgi or endoplasmic reticulum structures distinct from the large monensin-induced vacuoles.",,['CA22294/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['Department of Biochemistry, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.']",,,,,,,,

Pneumonitis was much more likely to develop in patients with acute leukemia than in those with other malignancies (32% v 19%). Similarly, deaths due to pneumonitis were restricted to patients with acute leukemia. Lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count less than 500/microL) was significantly associated with varicella-zoster virus pneumonitis and a higher fatality rate among patients with this complication. Both acyclovir and adenine arabinoside, administered to 18 and 28 patients, respectively, stopped the progression of skin lesions; however, pneumonitis developed in none of the acyclovir recipients after two days of treatment, compared with 29% of the adenine arabinoside recipients (P = .03). Passive immunization in 45 children who subsequently had varicella was associated with an 11% incidence of varicella-zoster virus pneumonitis. Despite passive immunization of approximately 150 children, the attack rate of varicella at our institution remains unchanged.

Pneumonia was mild in most of the patients: Three had only radiographic evidence of pneumonia and required no supplemental oxygen, and seven required an FiO2 less than or equal to 0.4 for intervals for up to 11 days. One patient had severe pneumonia and required major ventilatory support. Three patients (27%) had significant restrictive defects on follow-up, with total lung capacity 62-69% predicted; and a fourth was abnormal at 1 month follow-up but normal at 16 months. No obstructive defects were noted, although RV/TLC ratios were elevated in three patients and volume of isoflow increased in three. Single breath diffusing capacity was reduced in two patients, but gas exchange was normal in all. No residual radiographic changes were present except in the patient who had severe pneumonia and increased lung markings at 2 months follow-up.

Several of these CTL clones were selected for further study. Lysis of Gross cell surface antigen-positive tumor cells by these clones was restricted by the H-2Kb molecule. The cell surface phenotype of these clones was Thy-1.2+, Lyt-2.2+, L3T4-, a phenotype consistent with that of polyclonal anti-AKR/Gross CTL, suggesting that they were of conventional CTL origin. According to their fine specificity pattern, the CTL clones were divided into two major groups (A and B) which were further subdivided into five and three subgroups, respectively. The specificity of group A clones was essentially the same as that of the standard polyclonal CTL population except for a variable level of natural killer-like activity by some of the CTL clones. That is, group A clones did not efficiently lyse the insusceptible variant tumors nor any of Friend-Moloney-Rauscher-positive tumors tested, but they showed strong lytic activity to susceptible tumors and iododeoxyuridine-treated insusceptible variants. Thus, their CTL activity appeared to be strictly directed to Gross cell surface antigen-positive tumors that are susceptible to polyclonal anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL. In contrast, group B clones could lyse both susceptible and insusceptible variant tumors and also a Friend virus-induced tumor (FBL3). Therefore, as defined by these CTL clones, at least two distinct antigenic systems (A and B), each with several antigenic determinants, appeared to be present. Because recent findings suggested that most of the polyclonal anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL activity appeared to be directed to N-ecotropic proviral determinants, we further investigated the nature of these two antigenic systems by use of additional target cells including lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated spleen cell blasts from AKXL recombinant inbred strains and retrovirus-infected fibroblasts. Group A clones could lyse all LPS blasts derived from AKXL recombinant inbred strains containing the AKV-1 proviral genome, but lysed only very insufficiently or did not lyse AKV-1-negative blasts containing the AKV-3 and/or AKV-4 provirus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,"['CA-23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-43475/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['Department of Microbiology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH 03756.']",,,,,,,,

In 7 of the 100 B cell specimens, a single nongermline band was detected after digestion with the restriction enzyme BamHI, but the rearrangement could be confirmed with a second restriction enzyme in only two. The B cell fragments were small in size and of limited size diversity when compared with the T cell cases, and germline bands of equal intensity were present. A rearrangement of the T gamma gene was never seen in a B cell sample. In contrast, T cell specimens usually rearranged both alleles of T beta (15 of 18), the rearrangement could be confirmed with a second restriction enzyme (17 of 18), both alleles of the first constant region gene segment of T beta always underwent either rearrangement or deletion, and the T gamma gene was also rearranged or deleted (17 of 18).

These studies also suggested that BFU-E from cats with PRCA were unusually sensitive to C' alone, without the addition of antibody. In further studies, we demonstrated that C' activation was via the classical pathway and that C' sensitivity was unique to BFU-E and not a property of CFU-E, CFU-GM, or progenitors that were capable of giving rise to BFU-E in suspension culture. As BFU-E from cats viremic with FeLV-A/Glasgow-1 or the Rickard strain of feline leukemia virus were not sensitive to C', this finding may relate to the pathogenesis of feline PRCA.

Normal numbers of early erythroid progenitors (BFU-E) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM) remain, suggesting that the maturation of BFU-E to CFU-E is impaired in vivo. We have examined the cell cycle kinetics of BFU-E and their response to hematopoietic growth factor(s) to better characterize erythropoiesis as anemia develops. Within 3 weeks of FeLV-C infection, yet 6-42 weeks before anemia, the traction of BFU-E in DNA synthesis as determined by tritiated thymidine suicide increased to 43 +/- 4% (normal 23 +/- 2%) while there was no change in the cell cycle kinetics of CFU-GM. In additional studies, we evaluated the response of marrow to the hematopoietic growth factor(s) present in medium conditioned by FeLV-infected feline embryonic fibroblasts (FEA/FeLV CM). With cells from normal cats or cats viremic with FeLV-C but not anemic, a 4-fold increase in erythroid bursts was seen in cultures with 5% FEA/FeLV CM when compared to cultures without CM. However, just prior to the onset of anemia, when the numbers of detectable CFU-E decreased, BFU-E no longer responded to FEA/FeLV CM in vitro. BFU-E from anemic cats also required 10% cat or human serum for optimal in vitro growth. These altered kinetics and in vitro growth characteristics may relate to the in vivo block of BFU-E differentiation and PRCA. Finally, when marrow from cats with PRCA was placed in suspension culture for 2 to 4 days in the presence of cat serum and CM, the numbers of BFU-E increased 2- to 4-fold although no CFU-E were generated. By 4 to 7 days, CFU-E were detected, suggesting that conditions contributing to the block of erythroid maturation did not persist.

The remaining efflux at pH 6.2 was greater than 90% sensitive to bromosulfophthalein. This route was also inhibited by probenecid, prostaglandin A1, diamide, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, various metabolic inhibitors, and by transfer of the cells to a buffer containing high concentrations of KCl.

An enhancement in efflux occurred upon the addition of glucose or by transfer of the cells to a non-saline buffer. When parameters relating to cellular energetics were measured, a reduction in ATP level was associated with the inhibition of efflux by probenecid, carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, valinomycin, and antimycin A, whereas the increase in efflux by glucose was accompanied by an increase in intracellular ATP.

We have examined the effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a product of activated macrophages, on human erythroid progenitors (CFU-E, BFU-E) and the hematopoietic cell lines K562, HL60, and HEL cells. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) significantly inhibited CFU-E and BFU-E growth at concentrations as low as 10(-11)-10(-12) M (0.2 U/ml), although erythroid colony and burst formation were not totally ablated. Preincubation of marrow samples with TNF for 15 min was sufficient to suppress erythroid colony and burst formation. Addition of TNF after the start of culture inhibited CFU-E- and BFU-E-derived colony formation if TNF was added within the first 48 h of culture. Additionally, TNF inhibited the growth of highly purified erythroid progenitors harvested from day 5 BFU-E. The colonies which formed in cultures treated with TNF were significantly smaller than those formed in control cultures. TNF (10(-8)-10(-10) M) also suppressed the growth of the hematopoietic cell lines K562, HL60, and HEL cells, with 40%-60% of the cells being sensitive to TNF. Preincubation of HL60 cells with TNF for 15 min significantly inhibited their growth. K562, HL60, and HEL cells expressed high-affinity receptors for TNF in low numbers (6000-10,000 receptors per cell). Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of TNF binding to HEL cells demonstrated that the majority of these cells expressed TNF receptors. These data suggest that: (1) TNF is a rapid irreversible and extremely potent inhibitor of CFU-E, BFU-E, and hematopoietic cell lines K562, HL60, and HEL cells; (2) TNF appears to be acting on a subpopulation of erythroid cells, predominantly CFU-E, BFU-E, and possibly proerythroblasts; (3) TNF appears not to require accessory cells such as lymphocytes or macrophages to inhibit erythroid progenitors; and (4) the presence of TNF receptors on hematopoietic cells is not sufficient to confer sensitivity to TNF since the majority (80%-95%) of HEL cells express TNF receptors while only 40%-60% are inhibited by TNF.",,"['AM-35188/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA40035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-31264/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['Audie Murphy VA Hospital, Research Service, San Antonio, TX 78284.']",,,,,,,,

This results in the formation of a bcr-c-abl fusion gene, which is transcribed into an 8.5 kb chimeric mRNA encoding a 210 kd bcr-c-abl fusion protein.

This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a mononuclear phagocyte-derived factor, tumor necrosis factor/cachectin (TNF), on the proliferation and differentiation of the human cell lines HL-60 (promyelocytic) and U937 (monoblastic), and to characterize TNF receptors on these cells. TNF had no effect on HL-60 cell growth or thymidine incorporation, but it markedly inhibited that of U937 cells. HL-60 cells treated with TNF formed osteoclast-like polykaryons and developed nonspecific esterase positivity. In a dose-dependent fashion, TNF enhanced HL-60 cell nonspecific esterase activity, H2O2 production, NBT reduction, and acid phosphatase content. Together, TNF and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) additively and synergistically caused increases in these activities as well as the expression of HLA-DR and the monocyte antigens LeuM3 (CDw14) and OKM1 (CD11). TNF also synergistically enhanced the differentiating effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. The potentiating actions of D3 of IFN-gamma on the TNF effect were maximal when the two agents were present together throughout the incubation, and pretreatment with TNF augmented the subsequent response to D3, but not IFN-gamma. HL-60 and U937 cells bound 125I-labeled TNF specifically, rapidly, and reversibly with binding constants of 227 and 333 pmol/L and receptors per cell of 4,435 and 6,806 for HL-60 and U937, respectively. Scatchard plots were linear, which suggested single classes of receptors. HL-60 TNF receptors were not changed by a three-day treatment with IFN-gamma or D3. U937 and HL-60 cells internalized and degraded 125I-labeled TNF to comparable degrees. TNF has differing effects on HL-60 and U937 cells that are apparently mediated through comparable high-affinity TNF receptors.

The cytosolic phosphodiesterase activity of RPMI 8392 cells is separated into two forms by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. The first form is eluted at approx. 0.2 M-sodium acetate, catalyses the hydrolysis of both cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP, and is stimulated 3-fold by Ca2+-calmodulin. This form exhibits non-linear kinetics for cyclic AMP in the absence of calmodulin, with extrapolated Km values of 0.8 and 4 microM, and non-linear kinetics in the presence of calmodulin, with extrapolated Km values of 0.5 and 1 microM. The Vmax. values are increased approx. 3-fold by calmodulin. The second form is eluted at approx. 0.6 M-sodium acetate, is specific for cyclic AMP, and insensitive to stimulation by Ca2+-calmodulin. The Ca2+-calmodulin-sensitive phosphodiesterase from the DEAE-Sephacel column can be adsorbed to a calmodulin-Sepharose affinity column and eluted with EGTA.

Ethidium bromide was more potent than any of the 9-aminoacridines. This assay is a fast and simple method to compare DNA unwinding effects of intercalators. It led to the definition of a drug intrinsic unwinding constant (k). An additional finding was that all 9-aminoacridines and ethidium bromide inhibited L1210 topoisomerase I. Enzyme inhibition was detectable at low enzyme concentrations (less than or equal to 1 unit) and when the kinetics of topoisomerase I-mediated DNA relaxation was studied.

In contrast, quiescent CHO cells contained virtually no detectable topoisomerase II, while the content of L1210 cells was unchanged. Enzyme content of quiescent CCRF cells was diminished but detectable. DNA cleavage activity induced by etoposide correlated well with enzyme content in proliferating and quiescent cells. Quiescent CHO and CCRF cultures were highly resistant to the cytotoxic effects of etoposide as expected. However, despite unchanged enzyme content and DNA cleavage activity, there was also significant resistance observed in plateau L1210 cells. We have also investigated topoisomerase content and drug activity as a function of cell cycle progression. Following serum stimulation of confluent BalbC/3T3 cells, maximal etoposide-induced DNA cleavage activity is observed in G2/M and is associated with an increase in topoisomerase II content. Maximum cytotoxicity, however, occurs during mid to late S phase. Our data suggest that topoisomerase II content may be an important determinant of chemotherapeutic sensitivity during alterations in the proliferative status of the cell. However, it is clear that other factors must be involved in cell sensitivity, and elucidation of these may contribute to our understanding of the mechanism of action of these drugs.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In an effort to determine whether this selectivity may occur in leukemic cells in vivo, we have investigated the metabolism of araG in MOLT-4 T-lymphoblasts. MGL-8 B-lymphoblasts, HL-60 promyelocytes, and HUT-102 mature T-cells and compared it to that in freshly isolated leukemic cells from patients. MOLT-4 T-lymphoblasts were 50- to 380-fold more sensitive to growth inhibition with araG and accumulated 80-fold higher levels of araGTP than any of the other cell lines studied. Incubation of peripheral blood from patients with leukemia with araG for 4 h demonstrated that T-acute lymphocytic leukemia cells accumulated significantly higher median levels of araGTP than did acute myelogenous leukemia or chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (187 versus 72 and 31 pmol of araGTP per 10(7) cells, respectively), araGTP accumulation was not dependent on the rate of degradation of araG during the incubation. In contrast, araG did not exhibit similar selective growth inhibition, nor did the accumulation of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine 5'-triphosphate in the freshly isolated leukemic cells differ significantly among T-acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non-T-, non-B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia cells. These results demonstrate that the selective metabolism of araG observed in cultured cell lines was representative of the metabolism in freshly isolated leukemic cells. Furthermore, degradation of araG did not limit the accumulation of araGTP in the leukemic cells.

On the basis of these results, cases of ATLL with no monoclonal proviral HTLV-I DNA should be clinicopathologically differentiated from those with integrated proviral DNA.",,,,"['First Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Japan.']",,,,,,,,

During the 2 to 10 subsequent years, 16 patients developed symptoms of the myelodysplastic syndrome, i.e., chronic aregenerative anemia, granulocytopenia, dysmyelopoiesis, and appearance of circulating blast cells; three of them died from acute myeloblastic leukemia. So a pure thrombocytopenia due to a platelet production defect, without any demonstrated functional platelet defect or morphologic dysmegakaryocytosis, may be a preleukemic syndrome. In the other 20 patients, with the same pure chronic thrombocytopenia, no malignant evolution has been seen with long follow-up delays, which is often also the case in pure refractory anemias. In the absence of objective criteria of a possible premalignant disorder, the classification of these cases is difficult, which it is also the case for the so-called refractory anemias. We suggest to individualize, in the classification of the myelodysplastic syndromes, a group of pure refractory thrombocytopenias.

A simple and rapid biochemical technique based on spectrophotometric measurements was used to assay SADA. Of the 32 patients, 17 remained in remission and had less than a 15% variation in SADA levels. They had no clinical symptoms of recurrence at any time. In the remaining 15 patients, after a period of stability, a progressive decrease in SADA, with variations of more than 15%, was observed without any treatment. At that time, no abnormalities of clinical parameters were detected in these patients. A recurrence of disease as evidenced by routine examinations was found relatively late after the first decrease in SADA in all 15 patients (range 1.5 to 5.5 months). These results suggest that periodic measurements of SADA during the posttherapeutic course can be used as a means to assess early detection of an eventual recurrence.",,,,"['Departement des Sciences Pharmaceutiques, Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Louvain, Belgium.']",,,,,,,,

The receptor for AGE-proteins was demonstrated in murine macrophages (Vlassara et al. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82. 5588). Our recent study with rat macrophages revealed that the receptor also recognized proteins modified with aliphatic aldehydes such as formaldehyde or glycolaldehyde, indicating its close identity to a scavenger receptor for aldehyde-modified proteins (Takata, K. et al. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263. 14819). This notion was tested in the present study with human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1 cells), human monocyte macrophages and murine peritoneal macrophages. Endocytic uptake of AGE-proteins and aldehyde-modified proteins was inhibited in a cross-competitive fashion. The receptor activities of THP-1 cells for AGE-albumin and aldehyde-modified proteins were induced synchronously by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Furthermore, upon reduction by NaBH4 of the Schiff base formed between proteins and glucose or aldehydes, no ligand activity was generated. However, once the ligand activity was generated, NaBH4 was no longer effective for the ligand activity. Thus, a structure in common between AGE-proteins and aldehyde-modified proteins may be crucial for recognition by the human macrophage receptor.",,,,"['Department of Biochemistry, Kumamoto University Medical School, Japan.']",,,,,,,,

The enhancement was not due to increased bioavailability because cellular uptake of [3H]tamoxifen was not increased and the lipoprotein fraction of serum had negligible [3H]tamoxifen-binding capacity. Cholesterol and lipoproteins, but not mevalonate, reversed the cytostatic effect of antiestrogens. Reversal by cholesterol was dose-related (10(-7) M to 10(-5) M), while that by lipoproteins could also be demonstrated in medium undepleted of lipoproteins. The cytostatic efficacy of a series of ten compounds correlated well with their relative binding affinities for solubilized antiestrogen-binding sites from K36 cells when log IC50 values (concentration required to reduce [3H]thymidine incorporation by 50%) were plotted against log RBA50 values (concentration required to reduce [3H]tamoxifen binding by 50%) (correlation coefficient 0.94).

Previous observations that therapy-induced clinical and haematologic improvement in HCL is accompanied by a progressive decrease of sIL-2R suggest a possible correlation between sIL-2R levels and tumour burden. To verify this hypothesis, we monitored the variation of sIL-2R values in 13 non-splenectomized HCL patients admitted for treatment with recombinant interferon alpha-2. The data were correlated with the estimated weight of bone marrow (BM) and spleen infiltration, which in these patients almost entirely account for the tumour mass. The regression analysis test showed a direct correlation between sIL-2R values and both BM neoplastic involvement (r = 0.63) and spleen tumour mass (r = 0.76).

However, several recent studies have demonstrated that cellular DOX retention alone does not always correlate with its cytotoxicity and suggest that mechanisms other than rapid drug efflux may also be important. In the present study, we have compared glutathione (GSH) S-transferase (GST), selenium-dependent GSH peroxidase and selenium-independent GSH peroxidase II activities in DOX-sensitive (P388/S) and resistant (P388/R) mouse leukemic cells. The GST activity towards 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and ethacrynic acid (EA) was markedly higher in P388/R cells compared to P388/S cells. Purification of GST by GSH-affinity chromatography from an equal number of P388/S and P388/R cells revealed an increased amount of GST protein in P388/R cells. Immunological studies indicated that alpha and pi type GST isoenzymes were 1.27- and 2.2-fold higher, respectively, in P388/R cells compared to P388/S cells. Selenium-dependent GSH peroxidase activity was similar in both the cell lines, whereas selenium-independent GSH peroxidase II activity was approximately 1.36-fold higher in P388/R cells compared to P388/S cells. These results suggest that increased GSH peroxidase II activity in P388/R cells may contribute to cellular DOX resistance by enhancing free radical detoxification in this cell line.",,"['CA 27967/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 44737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['Department of Oncology, University of Miami School of Medicine, FL 33101.']",,,,,,,,

Nucleotide derivatives that can act as effective membrane-transport precursors of the poorly membrane-permeable nucleotides have not been identified so far. We studied the bis(pivaloyloxymethyl)ester (I) of FdUMP (5-fluoro-dUMP) and a cyclic phosphodiester (II) of FdUMP derived from 1,3-dihydroxyl-1-C-(pivaloyloxy-methyl)propane which are active in vivo against a 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FUdR)-resistant mouse leukemia and are attacked by carboxylic esterases under physiological conditions to produce FdUMP by elimination of formaldehyde and acrolein respectively. The assay for intracellular FdUMP was the inhibition of DNA synthesis due to inhibition of TMP synthetase in cultured mouse LM(TK-) fibroblasts genetically devoid of thymidine kinase (TK) and thus unable to convert FUdR directly to FdUMP. At 10(-6)M, I, II, or FUdR inhibited DNA synthesis in 2 hr by 99, 80, and 35% respectively; at 10(-5)M. maximal inhibition was attained after less than 15, 30 and 90 min respectively. Inhibition of DNA synthesis in TK+ cells by 10(-5) M I, II, or FUdR was reversed completely by 10(-5)M thymidine (TdR) but unaffected by 10(-5)M UdR, confirming TMP synthetase as the locus of inhibition. At 10(-5)M, bis(pivaloyloxymethyl) esters of phenyl phosphate or a p-substituted benzylphosphonic acid did not inhibit significantly DNA synthesis in TK+ cells. From this finding, and from effects produced by V (see below), we conclude that pivalic acid and CH2O arising from I contribute little to its above inhibitory effects. In TK- cells in which DNA synthesis is prevented by blockade of TMP synthetase with aminopterin, the bis(pivaloyloxymethyl) ester (V) of TMP, at 0.9 x 10(-4) M, induced a 4-fold faster rate of DNA synthesis than did 10(-3)M TMP, whereas 10(-3) M TdR did not affect the rate. After 3 hr the rate with V was 80% that in the absence of aminopterin.

The cyclosporine dosage was tapered and then stopped in May 1986 when the platelet count was 35,000/L. In October 1986 the platelet count was only 16,000/L, and the bone marrow showed evidence of a myelodysplastic syndrome; cytogenetic analysis revealed deletion of the long arm of chromosome 13 (previous cytogenetic findings had been normal). After cyclosporine therapy was resumed, platelet count promptly increased to 36,000/L. A subsequent attempt to taper the cyclosporine dosage resulted in a decreased platelet count. The platelet count responded to cyclosporine again and was maintained at 54,000/L and higher with cyclosporine therapy at only 25 mg/day.

After the myeloid vascular system was freed from normal circulating blood cells, the bone marrow was perfused with a suspension of leukemia cells derived from an ascites tumor. The bone marrow was then fixed by perfusion with double aldehyde with and without the addition of tannic acid. Leukemia cells were seen adhering to the adluminal aspect of the sinus endothelium and in all stages of endothelial penetration. The penetration of the sinus wall was independent of endothelial junctions; i.e., the transmural passage into the myeloid parenchyma was transcellular. At these sites, there were restricted areas of close plasmalemmal appositions of the two cell types where the intraplasmalemmal space was reduced to 2.3 nm. This space was interrupted by electron densities of 5 nm diameter and spaced 9 nm center to center. These close plasmalemmal appositions extended over distances ranging from 150 nm to 200 nm. It is suggested on the basis of the structural similarity that these heptalaminar complexes of close plasmalemmal apposition represent the structural equivalent of gap junctions and may be sites of intercellular communication requisite for transmural passage. When tannic acid was added to the fixative, there were extended areas of apparent fusion of the plasmalemmas of the two cell types, at the sites both of adhesion and of endothelial penetration. This fusion was limited to the outer leaflets of the two plasmalemmas, resulting in a single pentalaminar complex. These pentalaminar complexes extended over decidedly longer distances than the presumed gap junctions seen in the nontannic-acid-fixed material. The tannic acid material did not show the heptalaminar gap junction type of plasmalemmal apposition. It is believed likely that the tannic-acid-induced pentalaminar complexes may incorporate the smaller heptalaminar ones. The factors underlying the plasmalemmal configurational differences between the tannic acid and non-tannic-acid material remain undetermined.",,['CA 05493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['Department of Anatomy, University of Chicago, Illinois 60637.']",,,,,,,,

Lonidamine exposure of MOLT-4 cells at 50 micrograms/mL and pH 6.7 disrupted the mitochondria within 1 h of treatment. The mitochondria were swollen and the cristae were disrupted. When the treated cells were re-incubated in fresh medium at pH 7.4 the mitochondria rapidly returned to their normal morphology.

AIDS favours opportunistic fungi related to defective cellular immunity as Cryptococcus neoformans, responsible of severe meningoencephalitis and septicemia, as Candida albicans responsible of thrush and oesophagitis, but also true pathogenic fungi (Histoplasma capsulatum) becoming opportunistic in such conditions. C. albicans provokes in heroin addicts a new septicemic syndrome with cutaneous, ocular and osteoarticular lesions and in leukaemic patients hepatic micro-abscesses soon after the neutropenic phase induced by chemotherapy. New methods for immunologic diagnosis (research of circulating fungal antigen), for clinical diagnosis (scanning, magnetic resonance).

When cancer is mapped by geographic region, it is necessary to choose what this quantity is to be. Some cancer atlases have chosen a measure of effect, such as incidence, mortality, or relative risk. These are certainly the quantities which interest us most, but when the number of cases in a given region is small, their estimates can be very imprecise, and unreliable. The usual alternative is to map the statistical significance of departure from the overall map average. This has the advantage of de-emphasizing areas with low precision, but it can conversely highlight areas with high populations, even if they differ only minutely from the overall mean. Attempts to combine the two quantities on one map, for example by starring significant areas with relative risks above a certain level, are clumsy, and detract from the simplicity of the map. The empirical Bayes approach provides an alternative. Rather than plotting rates or risks which are individually estimated, the goal is to plot quantities which are estimated in such a way that those which are imprecise are improved by estimates from other appropriate areas. In the simplest case, this is equivalent to plotting for each map region the weighted average of the estimate for the region and the mean of the whole map, with more weight given to the regional estimate if it is based on a large population, and lower weight given if it is based on a small population. More sophisticated models are also described, and the methods are illustrated by the example of lip cancer in Scotland.",,,,"['International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.']",,,,,,,,
