Median remission length was 245 days for both groups and median survival was 465 days for patients given chemoimmunotherapy and 476 days for patients given only immunotherapy. The failure of remission chemotherapy in AML cannot be attributed to induced resistance because the same drugs induced a second remission in 60% of the patients. From laboratory studies with human AML cells it is suggested that in AML the residual leukaemic cells mature after induction chemotherapy and are then refractory to further drug treatment.

Correlation of in vitro lymphocyte blastogenesis to viremia and leukemia.,2351-8,"Various inbred strains of mice respond immunologically to genetically transmitted ecotropic C-type viruses. Part of this response is T cell blastogenesis with type specificity for the viral envelope glycoprotein gp71. Of those nonviremic, nonleukemic strains, and F1 crosses examined, in which virus expression occurs early in life, gp71-specific blastogenic T cells were detected within the first 2 months of age and temporally preceded the development of a humoral immune response. However, in the viremic, highly leukemic strain of AKR mice, gp71-specific T cell blastogenesis in vitro was readily detectable throughout the preleukemic phase, the first 5 months of age. In appropriate F1 crosses and backcrosses, the persistent in vitro blastogenic response segregated with viremia and leukemia. These data suggest that in vivo T cell stimulation by endogenous viral gp71, caused by viremia, may contribute to virus-induced leukemogenesis in mice.","['Lee, J C', 'Ihle, J N']","['Lee JC', 'Ihle JN']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Leukemia/*etiology/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phenotype', 'Retroviridae/*immunology', 'Viremia/*immunology', 'Virus Replication']",1979/11/01 00:00,1979/11/01 00:01,['1979/11/01 00:00'],"['1979/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1979 Nov;123(5):2351-8.,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)']",,,,,,,,,

The degree of protection depended on enzyme and alpha 2M concentrations respectively, and on the preincubation time of the alpha 2M-enzyme mixture prior to substrate addition. The formation of a catalytically active complex between alpha 2M and L-asparaginase was confirmed by gel filtration on a Sephadex-G column and by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The fact that the migration distance of the active complex corresponded to the migration of alpha 2M and the absence in that case of a migration band corresponding to the intact molecule suggest that complexing of the enzyme with alpha 2M prevented its dissociation into subunits and thus its inactivation. Addition of alpha 2M to the already dissociated enzyme molecule did not restore its catalytic activity. Alpha2-macroglobulin was shown to have an inhibiting effect on the proteolytic activity of almost all proteases and no effect on their esterolytic activity. Furthermore, it prevents the inhibition of esterolytic activity by some natural compounds. The effect of alpha 2M on other types of catalytic activity has not been investigated enough to afford a generalization of the possible role of this macroglobulin in the control of enzyme activity in the body. This paper reports the results of an in vitro study of the effect of alpha 2M on the catalytic activity of an important amidase, i.e. L-asparaginase (L-asparagine amidohydrolase 3.5.1.1), which in recent years has been used in the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia in children.","['Soru, E']",['Soru E'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,IM,"['*Asparaginase', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate', 'Time Factors', 'Urea', '*alpha-Macroglobulins']",1979/02/09 00:00,1979/02/09 00:01,['1979/02/09 00:00'],"['1979/02/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/02/09 00:01 [medline]', '1979/02/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00219457 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 1979 Feb 9;23(3):185-92. doi: 10.1007/BF00219457.,"['0 (alpha-Macroglobulins)', '368GB5141J (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,,,,,,

When such cell lines were analyzed 1 to 2 weeks after their isolation, however, all produced infectious virus. Because these cell lines were carried in culture, many ceased to release infectious virus but produced defective virions. One defective producer, SWR4, has been extensively studied. The particles it produces have the same density as that of virions of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV). The particles contain no 35 to 70S RNA, as determined by analysis of [3H]uridine-labeled particles, and exhibit no endogenous reverse transcriptase activity. Although the reverse transcriptase enzyme is of normal size, the major structural protein of the defective virions has a molecular weight of 28,000 (p28), in contrast to the p30 of M-MuLV, and no viral glycoprotein was evident. The defective particles do not appear to arise either from the helper virus or from Abelson virus. An alteration of the protein of the helper virus is an unlikely source of p28 because particles produced by lymphoid cells transformed with another strain of M-MuLV as helper (M-MuLV-TB) contained p28 with an unaltered cleavage pattern, although M-MuLV-TB p30 differs from M-MuLV p30. The A-MuLV genome lacks the capacity to code for the reverse transcriptase virions. Clones of fibroblasts infected with A-MuLV only occasionally produce defective particles. The defective particles therefore probably arose from an endogenous virus that is preferentially expressed in the class of lymphoid cells transformed by A-MuLV. This interpretation implies that the majority of A-MuLV-transformed lymphoid cells completely lose expression of the helper virus genome.","['Shields, A', 'Rosenberg, N', 'Baltimore, D']","['Shields A', 'Rosenberg N', 'Baltimore D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Defective Viruses/analysis/growth & development', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/analysis/enzymology/*growth & development', 'Mice', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/biosynthesis', 'Viral Proteins/analysis', '*Virus Replication']",1979/08/01 00:00,1979/08/01 00:01,['1979/08/01 00:00'],"['1979/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.31.2.557-567.1979 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1979 Aug;31(2):557-67. doi: 10.1128/JVI.31.2.557-567.1979.,"['0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",PMC353478,,,,,,,,

By use of these assays, pseudotype viruses were found to contain only 8 to 48% helper-specific p30's; the remainder is presumably derived from the sarcoma virus.","['Kennel, S J', 'Tennant, R W']","['Kennel SJ', 'Tennant RW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/analysis', 'Epitopes', 'Helper Viruses/*analysis/growth & development', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*analysis/growth & development', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/*analysis/growth & development', 'Viral Proteins/*analysis/immunology']",1979/06/01 00:00,1979/06/01 00:01,['1979/06/01 00:00'],"['1979/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.30.3.729-734.1979 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1979 Jun;30(3):729-34. doi: 10.1128/JVI.30.3.729-734.1979.,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",PMC353381,,,,,,,,

Viral adsorption to cell membrane was determined by assaying this enzyme activity in isolated debris of mechanically disrupted cells after infection with murine leukemia virus in the presence of actinomycin D. At 37 degrees C, viral adsorption proceeded at a high initial rate, but after 5 min of incubation with the virus, it gradually slowed down. At 4 degrees C, viral adsorption was slower but proceeded at a linear rate. Intracellular virus was determined by centrifuging the cytoplasmic fraction of the disrupted cells at 105,000 x g for 45 min and assaying reverse-transcriptase activity in the high-speed pellet thus obtained. Sucrose gradient analysis of the enzyme activity recovered from the cytoplasm of infected cells indicated that this activity represented intact virus particles. No appreciable amount of such particles was recovered from the cytoplasm of cells infected at 4 degrees C. This indicates that the virions recovered from the cytoplasm of cells infected at 37 degrees C are indeed intracellular virus particles which penetrated into the cells and not just membrane-bound particles mechanically released to the cytoplasmic fraction during cell disruption. By this procedure intracellular virus was found to accumulate in the cytoplasm, reaching a maximal level within 20 min. The accumulated intracellular virus particles gradually disappeared from the cytoplasm, evidently due to their uncoating which was completed within 80 min.","['Aboud, M', 'Shoor, R', 'Salzberg, S']","['Aboud M', 'Shoor R', 'Salzberg S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Adsorption', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cytoplasm/enzymology', 'Fibroblasts', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology/*growth & development', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions', '*Virus Replication']",1979/04/01 00:00,1979/04/01 00:01,['1979/04/01 00:00'],"['1979/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.30.1.32-37.1979 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1979 Apr;30(1):32-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.30.1.32-37.1979.,['EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)'],PMC353294,,,,,,,,

Under limiting concentration conditions, BLM and NCS induce alkali-labile sites in DNA without a subsequent cleavage of the chain. After transfer of BLM- or NCS-treated DNA into an alkaline solution, strand scissions occur. Combination of BLM and NCS results in an additive DNA-cleaving effect, which indicates that the splitting reactions initiated by BLM or NCS are not influenced if the two antibiotics are applied in combination. The DNA polymerase beta is inhibited by BLM (at higher concentrations) and by NCS in a competitive way with respect to DNA. The inhibition constant of BLM and NCS in a combination experiment was found to be the result of the sum of the inhibition constants of BLM and NCS. Using L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, it was found that cells incubated with both BLM and NCS show ""unbalanced growth.""

The F(ab')2 fragments, studied in direct immunofluorescence, reacted with both normal and CLL B lymphocytes but not with T lymphocytes. Comparative studies with an HLA-DR antiserum showed that the antigen(s) detected by 7420 antiserum did not redistribute together with HLA-DR antigens in cocapping experiments, nor did the HLA-DR antiserum block the reaction of 7420 F(ab')2 fragments with B lymphocytes. The 7420 F(ab')2 fragments prcipitated detergent-solubilized B-cell membrane material with a molecular weight of around 40,000 and 150,000 daltons.

It was originally isolated from urine of cadmium-poisoned patients. Its amino acid sequence was established and shown to be structurally related to immunoglobulin constant domains. With the aid of antibodies specific against beta 2-microglobulin, the protein was detected on the membranes of all nucleated cells, normal and neoplastic. Measuring the quantity of beta 2-microglobulin showed that high levels are present in patients with renal tubular deficiencies and several other pathological conditions including neoplastic diseases. Extremely high levels were detected in seminal fluid and colostrum. Despite the structural relationship to immunoglobulins, no immunological relationship was demonstrated with these proteins using antibodies specific for beta 2-microglobulin. However, such antibodies are cytotoxic to all cells carrying beta 2-microglobulin on their surfaces. The discovery that beta 2-microglobulin is an integral part of the histocompatibility antigens of human and murine origin stimulated further research and interest in this molecule. Several groups of investigators have shown that beta 2-microglobulin is the low molecular weight chain and is noncovalently bound to a high molecular weight chain which carries the histocompatibility antigens. The structure of the histocompatibility antigens of lymphocytes (HLA) was shown by immunochemical as well as biological methods, and it is now well accepted. The antibodies against beta 2-microglobulin are extremely useful in the isolation of the histocompatibility antigens for sequence studies. Furthermore, the antibody to beta 2-microglobulin revealed that other structures may be bound to beta 2-microglobulin such as phytohemoagglutimin (PHA) receptors, mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) antigens, etc. Murine thymus leukemia (TL) antigen also contains beta 2-microglobulin as an integral part of its structure; other tumor antigens may have a similar structure. Through all these studies, beta 2-microglobulin emerged as the best known membrane protein that can serve as a model for study of the arrangement and the function of the cell membrane.","['Poulik, M D', 'Gold, P', 'Shuster, J']","['Poulik MD', 'Gold P', 'Shuster J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,CRC Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci,CRC critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,1247734,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Beta-Globulins/*analysis', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Electrophoresis, Starch Gel', 'Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Humans', 'Immunoelectrophoresis', 'Kidney Diseases/blood', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/blood', 'Receptors, Drug/metabolism', 'Semen/analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*analysis/isolation & purification']",1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10408367909147135 [doi]'],ppublish,CRC Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci. 1979;10(3):225-45. doi: 10.3109/10408367909147135.,"['0 (Beta-Globulins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",,,103,,,,,,

It contains mainly full-length, single-stranded DNA, and its infectivity and size are insensitive to digestion by the single-strand-specific S1 nuclease. Analysis of fragmentation of the DNA using restriction endonucleases has shown that it is indistinguishable from the linear double-stranded DNA synthesized in infected cells. On the basis of the positions of the cleavage sites for a number of enzymes, the 9 kbp DNA has a 575 base direct terminal repetition. It is longer than the viral RNA at both ends, evidently due to repetitive copying of segments of the RNA. Virions also synthesize an 8.4 kbp double-stranded circular DNA that lacks one copy of the terminal repetition, as well as viral DNA longer than 9 kbp. The enzymatic machinery in the virions of retroviruses therefore appears to be responsible for all the steps involved in making fully double-stranded linear and one form of circular DNA.","['Gilboa, E', 'Goff, S', 'Shields, A', 'Yoshimura, F', 'Mitra, S', 'Baltimore, D']","['Gilboa E', 'Goff S', 'Shields A', 'Yoshimura F', 'Mitra S', 'Baltimore D']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell-Free System', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes/metabolism', 'DNA, Circular/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",1979/04/01 00:00,1979/04/01 00:01,['1979/04/01 00:00'],"['1979/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(79)90101-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(79)90101-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1979 Apr;16(4):863-74. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(79)90101-6.,"['0 (DNA, Circular)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",,,,,,,,,

The two substrates were, respectively, granulocyte- and monocyte-specific. By this method three subgroups of acute nonlymphocytic leukemias could be distinguished. Leukemic cells may be positive for either chloracetate esterase or nonspecific esterases, and the authors believe these two subgroups represent ""true"" granulocytic and ""pure"" monocytic leukemias. In a third group, leukemic cells contained both esterases in the same cell, and it is believed this group may represent ""true"" myelomonocytic leukemias. In the majority of patients in this group, leukemia evolved from a preleukemic phase. When only Romanowsky-stained smears are used, the monocytoid feature and absolute elevated monocyte counts in acute granulocytic leukemia may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of the leukemia as acute myelomonocytic leukemia. This happened in five of the 13 cases in the study. The presence of granulocyte- and monocyte-specific esterases in a single cell supports the concept of a common origin of granulocytes and monocytes.

A 3-hr (51)Cr-release assay with splenic effector cells and leukemia or myeloma target cells was used to measure cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The cytotoxic activity of effector cells against allogeneic targets was abolished by exposure to Lyt-1, Lyt-2, or Lyt-3 antiserum and complement. Specificity was established by tests with C57BL/6 Lyt congenic mice and absorption studies with thymocytes. Similarly, the cytotoxicity of effector cells directed against semisyngeneic myeloma targets was reduced by Lyt-1, -2, or -3 antiserum and complement. Effector cell cytotoxicity against another semisyngeneic target was only marginally affected by Lyt-1 antiserum and complement, but was abolished by Lyt-2 or -3 antiserum and complement. It appears likely that cytotoxic T cells are a heterogeneous population with regard to Lyt-1 expression and that past studies indicating an apparent absence of Lyt-1 on cytotoxic T cells revealed a quantitative, not qualitative, feature of these cells. With regard to the activity of Lyt antisera in the absence of added complement, selective blocking of effector cell cytotoxicity for allogeneic and semisyngeneic targets was found with Lyt-2 and Lyt-3 antisera but not with Lyt-1 antiserum. The specificity of blocking was established by tests with Lyt congenic mice and absorption studies with thymocytes. With the exception of blocking by antisera to the H-2 haplotype expressed by the target cell, no effector cell blocking was observed with alloantisera or heteroantisera to a range of other cell surface molecules present on mouse lymphoid cells. One possibility to account for the selective blocking by Lyt-2 and Lyt-3 antisera is that Lyt-2,3 determinants on the surface of cytotoxic T cells have a close spatial relation to the T cell receptor.","['Nakayama, E', 'Shiku, H', 'Stockert, E', 'Oettgen, H F', 'Old, L J']","['Nakayama E', 'Shiku H', 'Stockert E', 'Oettgen HF', 'Old LJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Epitopes', 'Immune Sera', '*Immunoglobulin Allotypes', 'Mice', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1979/04/01 00:00,1979/04/01 00:01,['1979/04/01 00:00'],"['1979/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.76.4.1977 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1979 Apr;76(4):1977-81. doi: 10.1073/pnas.76.4.1977.,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Allotypes)']",PMC383516,,,,,,,,

After 2 h in 50 muM dNTP, about 2.8 mug of cDNA per mg of protein is produced, almost 30% of which is long cDNA. The system thus compares favorably with the other two well-characterized endogenous reaction systems, Moloney murine leukemia virus and avian sarcoma virus. Elongation rates of 100 to 150 nucleotides per min have been observed; these rates are comparable to those seen with purified avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and significantly higher than those observed in vivo. In the absence of actinomycin D, equine infectious anemia virus does not require high dNTP levels for either optimal incorporation or long cDNA synthesis. The amount of long cDNA synthesized is maximal at 2 h in 50 muM dNTP; neither longer time nor higher dNTP levels (through 1.8 mM) increased this yield. Half-maximum yield in 2 h was achieved at about 15 muM dNTP, which is very similar to the published K(M)'s for isolated avian and murine reverse transcriptases. Total incorporation, on the other hand, continues to rise slowly through 1 mM dNTP; the half-maximum was 30 to 50 muM dNTP. In the presence of 100 mug of actinomycin D per ml, however, higher dNTP levels are required for long cDNA synthesis.

Two lines of evidence indicate that the 70,000- and 45,000-molecular weight polypeptides represent translation products of the gag gene of the bovine leukemia virus genome (Pr70gag and Pr45gag). First, they are specifically precipitated by a monospecific antiserum to the major internal protein, p24, and second, they are synthesized and correctly processed into virion proteins p24, p15, and p10 in Xenopus laevis oocytes microinjected with bovine leukemia virus 38S RNA. The 145,000-molecular weight polypeptide was immunoprecipitated by the anti-p24 serum and not by an antiserum to the major envelope glycoprotein, gp60.

In this report we analyze the cell-surface antigens on a Balb/c Moloney lymphoma, LSTRA, using hyperimmune sarcoma regressor sera (alphaMo) as a primary reagent. We also use heterologous anti-viral p30 and gp70 sera for a direct analysis of virion protein antigens on the LSTRA surface. Using radiolabeled alphaMo-binding assays, we demonstrate that LSTRA tumor antigens detected by these sera are all Moloney viral antigens; approximately 1/3 of these antigenic determinants are expressed on the intact virus, and the other determinants are revealed by detergent lysis of the virus. The major viral antigens expressed on the LSTRA cell surface are viral env gene products, whereas gag gene products are only sparsely represented. We conclude that alphaMo sera detect almost exclusively viral antigens on LSTRA cells, and these antigens are almost exclusively virion env gene products.","['Humphrey, D', 'Tsukamoto-Adey, A', 'Witte, O M', 'Fox, R', 'Jerabek, L', 'Weissman, I L']","['Humphrey D', 'Tsukamoto-Adey A', 'Witte OM', 'Fox R', 'Jerabek L', 'Weissman IL']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', '*Antigens, Surface', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Epitopes', 'Immune Sera/pharmacology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Peptides/immunology', 'Viral Proteins/immunology']",1979/07/01 00:00,1979/07/01 00:01,['1979/07/01 00:00'],"['1979/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1979 Jul;123(1):412-8.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,

Criteria for transformation were the establishment of permanent lines, growth on semisolid agarose, and the production of tumors at the site of inoculation in syngeneic hosts. Two lines of immature hematopoietic cells that grow in suspension originated from the infected cultures. Each has an almost diploid karyotype (38-39 chromosomes) and 3-4 metacentric chromosomes. These transformed cells express gp71 viral envelope glycoprotein and p30 viral core protein antigens. Virus production was measured by reverse transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase) activity of the virions released into the medium.

The ability to estimate the number of such cells may facilitate the planning of therapy and make more meaningful the concept of complete remission.","['Ault, K A']",['Ault KA'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', '*Cytological Techniques', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/immunology', 'Immunologic Capping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*blood/immunology', 'Male', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Staining and Labeling']",1979/06/21 00:00,1979/06/21 00:01,['1979/06/21 00:00'],"['1979/06/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/06/21 00:01 [medline]', '1979/06/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM197906213002501 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1979 Jun 21;300(25):1401-5. doi: 10.1056/NEJM197906213002501.,"['0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,

The difference is seen after cell treatment with buffers at pH 1.5 (1.3-1.9 range) followed by staining with acridine orange at pH 2.6 (2.3-2.9). Under these conditions the red metachromatic fluorescence of the acridine orange-DNA complex is higher in quiescent cells than in the cycling lymphocytes while the orthochromatic green fluorescence is higher in the cycling, interphase cells. The results suggest that DNA in condensed chromatin of quiescent lymphocytes (as in metaphase chromosomes) is more sensitive to acid-denaturation than DNA in dispersed chromatin of the cycling interphase cells. The phenomenon is used for flow cytometric differentiation between G0 and G1 cells and between G2 and M cells. In contrast to normal lymphocytes the method applied to neoplastic cells indicates the presence of cell subpopulations with condensed chromatin but with DNA content characteristic not only of G1 but also of S and G2 cells.

The mediation of post-translational changes in growth control is suggested by the transformation-dependent alteration in the molecular weight of the non-virion surface proteins recognized by anti-MLV serum in the rat cells used in this study.","['Rieber, M', 'Rieber, M', 'Alonso, M']","['Rieber M', 'Rieber M', 'Alonso M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Epitopes', 'Glucosamine', 'Glycoproteins/immunology', '*Immune Sera', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/microbiology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Membrane Proteins/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Rats', 'Viral Proteins/*immunology']",1979/04/15 00:00,1979/04/15 00:01,['1979/04/15 00:00'],"['1979/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1979/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910230417 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1979 Apr 15;23(4):547-54. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910230417.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'N08U5BOQ1K (Glucosamine)']",,,,,,,,,

Whereas antibody-induced capping of gp70 did not change the membrane distribution of MCSA, co-capping was observed between MCSA and p30 and p12 gag protein antigens. This indicated that, whereas MCSA is distinct from gp70, it is linked to p30 and p12 on the membrane of living cells. It was then attempted to isolate MCSA on anti-p30 and anti-p15 immunoadsorbent columns from solubilized YAC cells. Contrary to what was expected, no MCSA was found to the anti-p30 column. On the other hand, a part (10-15%) of the MCSA was bound to the anti-p15 column, indicating that MCSA is linked to the gag p15.","['Karande, A', 'Yefenof, E', 'Fenyo, E M', 'Klein, G']","['Karande A', 'Yefenof E', 'Fenyo EM', 'Klein G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, Surface', '*Antigens, Viral', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Epitopes', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Genes', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunologic Capping', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/microbiology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics/immunology']",1979/04/15 00:00,1979/04/15 00:01,['1979/04/15 00:00'],"['1979/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1979/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910230411 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1979 Apr 15;23(4):508-13. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910230411.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,

The amount of precipitated virus was then measured as reverse transcriptase activity. The method was designated the virion precipitation test (VPT).

The study of envelop antigens of 11 different oncoviruses permitted their differentiation into the following groups: (1) murine type-C viruses: (2) feline type-C viruses; (3) simian type-C viruses; (4) the RD-114/BEV group; (5) Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV); (6) bovine leukemia virus; (7) avian type-C viruses; (8) mouse mammary tumor virus. No common antigenic determinants were detected in the last three groups. Mammalian type-C viruses (RD-114, NIH-MuLV, G-MuLV) had common antigenic determinants in the envelope, as demonstrated with an anti-RD-114 serum. Mammalian type-C viruses also shared antigenic determinants with M-PMV. The relationship of type-C viruses to M-PMV decreased in the following order: RD-114--NIH-MuLV--G-MuLV. It was also shown that the endogenous xenotropic feline RD-114 virus was more closely related to xenotropic NIH-MuLV than to ecotropic G-MuLV.

Anti-H-2k and anti-H-2ja as well as anti-H-2d sera precipitated labeled polypeptides of a molecular weight similar to that of H-2 heavy chains. In addition, all antisera tested precipitated a component of 70000 daltons molecular weight, which is antigenically related to gp 69/71 of Friend murine leukemia virus. Reactions with antisera directed against haplotypes other than H-2d could be blocked by addition of unlabeled, detergent-solubilized extracts of H-2d lymphocytes, or by H-2 antigens against which the antiserum was directed. Sequential immunoprecipitations initially using antisera against the K, D, or L region gene products to remove individual known H-2d antigens have made possible the identification of some molecules responsible for these reactions. The results show that antisera against haplotypes other than H-2d which react with SL2 cells, cross-react with normal H-2d antigens. Quantitative absortion of these antisera with intact or solubilized cells has shown that lymphocytes and tumor cells differ in their expression of some H-2 determinants. The antibodies bind only weakly to intact H-2d lymphocytes, but strongly to the corresponding detergent-solubilized antigens. These results do not, therefore, support the derepression hypothesis put forward earlier.","['Robinson, P J', 'Schirrmacher, V']","['Robinson PJ', 'Schirrmacher V']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Epitopes', 'H-2 Antigens/*immunology', 'Immune Sera/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Spleen/immunology']",1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830090113 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1979 Jan;9(1):61-6. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830090113.,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Immune Sera)']",,,,,,,,,

The results obtained from such an analysis revealed the presence of two major abundance classes of mRNA with a total genetic complexity of approximately 10,000 diverse mRNA species in both of these cell types. Diversity of mRNA species in these unrelated human cells was studied by heterologous hybridization reactions between the cDNA of one cell type and a vast excess of poly(A)-containing mRNA from another.

Formation of non-infectious virus in chronically infected cells.,467-80,"Interferon (150 units/ml) was used to treat SC-1 and AKR-2B cells which were chronically infected with murine leukaemia virus (MuLV). This led to a 100-fold decrease in the amount of infectious virus released into the medium and a 10-fold decrease in the number of virus particles measured by the virion-associated reverse transcriptase assay. However, there was little change in the amount of cell-associated infectious virus, though nearly twice as many cell-associated virions were counted in electron micrographs. With both types of cells, interferon blocked MuLV replication at the post-budding stage, but it did not change the morphology of the particles produced or their content of virion 70S RNA. Infectious virus assembled on the cell membranes of interferon-treated cells was less stable at 37 degrees C than that grown in the absence of interferon. Release of infectious virus from interferon-treated cells was not inhibited by actinomycin D or cycloheximide, though both agents inhibited virus production in controls. These results show that interferon inhibits MuLV replication through effects on virion assembly; these lead both to the formation of non-infectious particles and of fewer virions. Kinetic analysis further shows that interferon affects MuLV assembly rapidly and induction of an antiviral protein may not be required.","['Pitha, P M', 'Wivel, N A', 'Fernie, B F', 'Harper, H P']","['Pitha PM', 'Wivel NA', 'Fernie BF', 'Harper HP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Hot Temperature', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*drug effects/enzymology/growth & development', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",1979/03/01 00:00,1979/03/01 00:01,['1979/03/01 00:00'],"['1979/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-42-3-467 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1979 Mar;42(3):467-80. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-42-3-467.,"['1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,,,,,,,

The MCF type-specific antibodies were present in high titer and not absorbable by cells infected with ecotropic, xenotropic, or wild mouse amphotropic murine leukemia viruses, or combinations of ecotropic and xenotropic viruses. Three MCF subtype-specific reactions were identified. One subspecificity (operationally designated MCFA-1) defined antigenic determinant(s) distributed among MCF viruses in general. Another (MCFA-2) specified determinant(s) induced by all naturally occurring MCF isolates not of Friend or Moloney origin. A third subspecificity (MCFA-3) was induced by some MCF isolates, and not by others; the presence of this antigen did not correlate with the source of any presently known biological property of the viruses. In addition, type-specific antigenic determinants of ecotropic and xenotropic murine leukemia viruses were expressed on MCF virus-infected cells. The serological profile of MCF viruses thus supports the contention that they are env gene recombinants between ecotropic and xenotropic murine leukemia viruses. However, new, distinct MCF-specific determinants are also generated, and these could be useful markers in studying MCF viruses.","['Cloyd, M W', 'Hartley, J W', 'Rowe, W P']","['Cloyd MW', 'Hartley JW', 'Rowe WP']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/*classification', 'Antigens, Viral/*classification', 'Cross Reactions', 'Epitopes', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*immunology', 'Mink/microbiology', 'Species Specificity']",1979/03/01 00:00,1979/03/01 00:01,['1979/03/01 00:00'],"['1979/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.149.3.702 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1979 Mar 1;149(3):702-12. doi: 10.1084/jem.149.3.702.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)']",PMC2184819,,,,,,,,

The rapid development of immunology, the application of immunocytological, cytochemical and electromicroscopic methods led to new classifications of nHL based on immunology. They are founded on the idea that the prevailing cells of nHL correspond to a cell type from the differentiation line of lymphocytes. Thus, a distinction can be made between malignant lymphomas (ml) of stem, B and T-cells; the more frequently occurring lymphomas originating from B-cells are represented by chronic lymphatic leukaemia originating from B1-cells, by ml of follicular genesis (centrocytes, centroblastic-centrocytic ml, centroblasts) and by ml synthesizing and releasing immunoglobulins (immunocytoma, immunoblastoma). The type formerly called ""reticulosarcoma"" (histocytic ml) could be identified to be an immature, Ig synthesizing ml (immunoblastloma) in most cases.

These fast-sedimenting protein-DNA complexes may be released by gently lysing cells in solution containing non-ionic detergents and high NaCl concentrations (1.95 M). The supercoiled structure of DNA in these protein-DNA complexes is suggested by the characteristic sedimentation in the presence of intercalating agents. Apparently, no DNA damage could be detected in Ehrlich cells from 7-day-old tumours within 3 h after various doses of daunomycin (0.5--10 mg/kg of body wt.) were administered i.p. to mice. Sedimentation anomalies could not be observed even 15 or 30 h after administration of rtherapeutic doses of daunomycin or adriamycin. In contrast, at 30 min after administration to mice, therapeutic doses of bleomycin (2--8 mg/kg) caused extensive fragmentation of tumour cell DNA, which could be monitored as slowly sedimenting DNA structures (compared with the the control). Similarly, DNA damage could be induced by procarbazine at therapeutic doses. Exposure to bleomycin or procarbazine abolished the characteristic biphasic response to ethidium bromide. The absence of anthracycline-induced degradation of Ehrlich ascites tumour cell DNA is apparently in contrast with the DNA damage observed in L1210 tumour cells.

The cytotoxic anti-SL2 activity of the anti-foreign H-2 sera was detected in a newly developed microradioassay, not however, in a conventional 51Cr release test. Upon culture in vitro the reactivity of the tumor cells with the anti H-2 sera decreased. The anomalous cytotoxic anti-tumor activity of the anti-foreign H-2 sera appeared to be distinct from anti-murine leukemia virus activity, since it was not removed by absorption with either Friend of AKR leukemia virus. Partial absorption was observed with normal lymphoid cells carrying the respective foreign H-2 antigens, but not with cells of unrelated H-2 haplotypes. In each serum tested, the anti-tumor activity could also be absorbed with syngeneic H-2d lymphoid cells. These results show that the anomalous anti-tumor reactivity of certain anti H-2 typing sera, in particular of sera raised in recipients differing in H-2 from the tumor host strains, is not due to the presence of foreign (derepressed) H-2 molecules on the tumor cells. The differences observed between the tumor cells and normal cells seem to be due to unexpected antibodies in the sera reacting with public H-2 specificities which are better exposed on the tumor cells than on normal cells.","['Schirrmacher, V', 'Marxen, I', 'Robinson, P']","['Schirrmacher V', 'Marxen I', 'Robinson P']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Z Immunitatsforsch Immunobiol,Zeitschrift fur Immunitatsforschung.

This DNA species has been purified by sedimentation of total in vitro synthesized Mo-MSV DNA through neutral sucrose gradients. A physical map of the positions of the cleavage sites for a series of restriction endonucleases has been derived for this 5.8 kbp DNA. Mo-MSV DNA synthesized in vitro was found to induce morphological transformation of NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts upon transfection. The foci had a morphology indistinguishable from that of Mo-MSV-induced foci, and the induced transformed phenotype was stable. The 5.8 kbp double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) purified by agarose gel electrophoresis also induced focal transformation. Furthermore, gel-purified, restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of 5.8 kbp dsDNA containing the region from 2.8--4.9 kbp on the physical map of Mo-MSV DNA were able to induce foci. In contrast, endonuclease-generated DNA fragments lacking this region on the map were unable to transform cells upon transfection. When transformants derived by transfection with 5.8 kbp dsDNA were infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) helper virus, Mo-MSV was rescued from a small portion of these cells, suggesting the establishment of the complete viral genome in these cells.

Schulz Lecture.,1-24,"Permanent cell lines have been established from twelve diffuse histiocytic lymphomas (SU-DHL-1 to -12), three American Burkitt's lymphomas (SU-AmB-1 to -3), two acute lymphoblastic leukemias (SU-ALL-1 and -2), and three diffuse undifferentiated lymphomas (SU-DUL-1, -2, and -3). The cultured cells displayed neoplastic characteristics, as manifested by heterotransplantability in congenitally athymic nude mice and by the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities in early passage generations. Functional and marker studies revealed that the three American Burkitt's lymphomas, as well as several of the diffuse histiocytic and undifferentiated lymphomas, were of B-lymphocytic origin, whereas the two acute lymphoblastic leukemias were both of T-lymphocytic origin. Two of the cell lines, SU-DHL-1 and -2, appeared to be of true histiocytic origin; two others exhibited no markers and were designated as ""null"" cells. All ten of the DHL cell lines studied to date, as well as SU-DUL-1, have been devoid of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes by the EBNA test, whereas two of the three American Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines were positive. Spontaneous production of a C-type RNA virus was first detected in post-mitochondrial cytoplasmic fractions and culture fluids of the SU-DHL-1 cell line. Screening assays for the detection of reverse transcriptase-positive particles in the culture fluids of the other cell lines indicate that eight of the fifteen cell lines tested to date have spontaneously initiated C-type RNA virus production. After partial purification by ion-exchange and affinity chromatography, the reverse transcriptases of the virus isolated from SU-DHL-1 cells is partially inhibited by antibodies to the reverse transcriptases of C-type viruses of subhuman primate and endogenous feline, but not of murine, origin. Conversely, antibody prepared against the purified SU-DHL-1 viral reverse transcriptase, at concentrations which maximally inhibit the homologous enzyme, partially inhibits the reverse transcriptases of subhuman primate C-type viruses, but has little or no inhibitory activity against the reverse transcriptases of feline or murine leukemia viruses. The viruses produced by the SU-DHL-1 and SU-AmB-3 cell lines have been shown to be infectious for normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, normal human bone marrow cells, and certain human lymphoblastoid cell lines. After infection by these viruses, normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and human bone marrow cells have exhibited striking changes in growth behavior and morphology which, though not permanently sustained, have many of the features of abortive transformation.","['Kaplan, H S', 'Goodenow, R S', 'Gartner, S', 'Bieber, M M']","['Kaplan HS', 'Goodenow RS', 'Gartner S', 'Bieber MM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Animals', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/etiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*etiology', 'Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/etiology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/isolation & purification', 'Retroviridae/isolation & purification', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(197901)43:1<1::aid-cncr2820430102>3.0.co;2-m [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1979 Jan;43(1):1-24. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197901)43:1<1::aid-cncr2820430102>3.0.co;2-m.,['EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)'],,,57,,,,,,

Two patients with greater than 90% FcR positive cells failed to mediate ADCC. When initially examined, a third patient, with fewer malignant cells, demonstrated a less marked impairment of cytolysis. When reexamined at a later date, this patient had an increased number of hairy cells and concomitantly demonstrated more impaired ADCC effector cell activity.

The remaining nonadherent fraction, containing 5.5% FcR positive, sIg negative cells, was able to mediate ADCC as effectively as the normal controls.

Cytogenetic studies of the virus-releasing co-culture showed mitotic figures identical to the normal mink cell line (MvlLu) with the exception of a low frequency of cells with extensive chromosomal breakage and uncoiling. The new virus bands at a buoyant density of 1.16 g/ml, contains 60S RNA and a reverse transcriptase which prefers Mn2+ over Mg2+ for the synthesis of DNA. This enzyme utilizes poly(rA).oligo(dT) more efficiently than poly(dA).oligo(dT) and is also able to synthesize DNA copies from the endogenous RNA. Morphologically, it is a typical type C virus. Filtered virus readily infects mink, dog and other mammalian cells indicating the amphotropic nature of its cell growth requirement. Hybridization studies showed that normal mink DNA contains multiple copies of proviral sequences of this newly isolated virus. Serological analyses indicate that the mink endogenous virus contains in its core protein, in addition to the interspecies type-C determinant, an antigenic component related to one of the determinants found in the feline leukaemia virus p30 protein. This determinant is not present in the Rauscher leukaemia virus, RD114 virus or simian sarcoma virus.","['Ahmed, M', 'Yeh, J', 'Stephens, R', 'Holden, H E', 'Schlom, J', 'Drohan, W', 'Howard, D K']","['Ahmed M', 'Yeh J', 'Stephens R', 'Holden HE', 'Schlom J', 'Drohan W', 'Howard DK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', '*Cell Line', '*Mammary Glands, Animal', 'Mink', '*Neoplasms', 'RNA Viruses/*analysis/physiology/ultrastructure', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/analysis']",1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-42-1-179 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1979 Jan;42(1):179-84. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-42-1-179.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,,,,,,,

Mammary tumour virus-induced antigens (MLr) expressed on the surface of the cells are enriched on these vesicles as compared to plasma membranes isolated from the cell homogenate. The lipid fluidity of the vesicles is much smaller than that of the plasma membranes, and the content of the pertinent lipid parameters, cholesterol and sphingomyelin, are accordingly greatly increased. The extracellular vesicles which are also enriched in sialic acid and 5'-nucleotidase are apparently derived from the plasma membrane, probably at least partly by exfoliation of selected parts or domains of the surface of living cells. An analogy between this shedding of vesicles, the formation of endocytotic vesicles and the budding of viruses is noted; all these processes select or assemble rigid lipid domains of the cell membrane. The possible participation of surface microvilli and sub-lethal autolysis in the process of shedding is discussed.","['van Blitterswijk, W J', 'Emmelot, P', 'Hilkmann, H A', 'Hilgers, J', 'Feltkamp, C A']","['van Blitterswijk WJ', 'Emmelot P', 'Hilkmann HA', 'Hilgers J', 'Feltkamp CA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', '*Antigens, Surface', 'Ascitic Fluid/analysis/*immunology', 'Cell Membrane/analysis/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Complement System Proteins', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Epitopes', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Immune Sera', 'Leukemia, Experimental/analysis/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Lipids/analysis', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Nucleotidases/analysis', 'Sialic Acids/analysis']",1979/01/15 00:00,1979/01/15 00:01,['1979/01/15 00:00'],"['1979/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910230112 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1979 Jan 15;23(1):62-70. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910230112.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.- (Nucleotidases)']",,,,,,,,,

Clones which can be induced by MGI to form Fc and C3 rosettes, to synthesize and secrete lysozyme and to differentiate to mature macrophages and granulocytes (MGI+D+) were induced by MGI to produce higher amounts of type C virus. Clones (MGI+D-) that were less inducible by MGI for Fc and C3 rosettes and lysozyme and were not induced to from mature cells were also less inducible higher virus production. In both types of clones, the increased virus production induced by MGI preceded the induction of rosettes and lysozyme. Clones that were not induced by MGI for rosettes or lysozyme (MGI-D-) showed little or no enhancement of virus production. MGI did not affect virus production in erythroleukemic cells, and erythropoietin did not affect virus production in the myeloid leukemic cells. Dexamethasone, lipopolysaccharide, dimethylsulfoxide and low concentrations of actinomycin D can induce some differentiation-associated properties in some of the clones. With these compounds, there was also a direct relationship between the enhancement of virus production and induction of differentiation-associated properties. Virus released from the three types of clones before or after treatment with MGI or dexamethasone was identified as N-tropic. The enhancement of virus production, as measured by reverse transcriptase activity, was accompanied by an increase in the amount of the viral protein p30, and interferon, which idd not inhibit the induction of differentiation in the myeloid leukemic cells, also did not prevent the increase in the amount of p30. After the early enhancement of virus production associated with the induction of differentiation, a shut-off of virus production occurred in the mature cells induced by MGI in MGI+D+ clones, whereas clones that did not differentiate to mature cells continued to produce virus. The results indicate that enhancement of virus production appears to be an early step in the induction of differentiation. Once induction has occurred, the lack of virus production in the mature cells suggest that a subsequent shut-off of virus production may be required for the completion of differentiation to mature cells. This relationship between cell differentiation and virus production suggests that type C virus has a regulatory role in myeloid cell differentiation.","['Liebermann, D', 'Sachs, L']","['Liebermann D', 'Sachs L']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Interferons/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Muramidase/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*growth & development', 'Rosette Formation', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",1978/11/01 00:00,1978/11/01 00:01,['1978/11/01 00:00'],"['1978/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(78)90267-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(78)90267-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1978 Nov;15(3):823-35. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(78)90267-2.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",,,,,,,,,

By analysis of the immunological properties of their gag gene-coded structural proteins, each of the AKR-derived isolates and two dual-tropic C3H-derived isolates were found to closely resemble AKR murine leukemia virus. In contrast, gag gene-coded proteins of two other leukemogenic isolates of C3H origin, including one ecotropic and one dual-tropic virus, were indistinguishable from those of Moloney murine leukemia virus. All of the oncogenic isolates, including those of AKR and C3H origin, were found to possess common envelope glycoprotein determinants of a unique class not shared by the nononcogenic ecotropic viruses from which they were derived. These findings support the possibility that oncogenic variants of endogenous ecotropic mouse type C viruses are derived by genetic recombination.

Formation and uptake of complexes of Ig and tumour antigens by T cells.,611-20,"A large dose of tumour cells (10(7)) from two different tumours produced a significant increase of Ig-bearing spleen cells 6 h after intraperitoneal administration in syngeneic mice, like conventional antigens previously tested. Incubation of normal spleen cells in serum taken 6 h after administration of tumour cells reproduced in vitro the changes observed in the spleen cell population of the serum donors, demonstrating the presence of a cytophilic Ig, which was shown to be taken up by T cells. Serum collected 6 h after tumour cell inoculation contains also a 4S factor which can generate in vitro cytophilic Ig for T cells in the presence of a foreign soluble protein or tumour antigen. Extracts obtained from tumours cells, which were shown to contain tumour antigens, were labelled with 125I and mixed with the 4S factor and normal 7S Ig. Upon fractionation of the mixture, high molecular weight material containing radioactivity and 7S Ig were eluted in the void volume, well ahead of the position of both the tumour cell preparation and the 7S Ig. This material contained Ig cytophilic for splenic T cells and it is likely that it represents cytophilic complexes of Ig and tumour antigens. It is postulated that the cytophilic Ig detected in the serum of animals 6 h after injection of a large number of tumour cells represents cytophilic complexes of Ig and tumour antigens formed through the mediation of a soluble factor.","['Dular, U', 'Chow, D A', 'Paraskevas, F']","['Dular U', 'Chow DA', 'Paraskevas F']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Cell Membrane/*immunology', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Epitopes', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",1978/11/15 00:00,1978/11/15 00:01,['1978/11/15 00:00'],"['1978/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1978/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910220517 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1978 Nov 15;22(5):611-20. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910220517.,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,

We now have evidence to show that phosphonoacetic acid inhibits also the cellular DNA polymerases alpha, beta, and gamma of L1210 cells as well as reverse transcriptases of two type C viruses. Particularly, the DNA polymerase alpha is just as sensitive as the herpes virus induced DNA polymerase. The DNA polymerases beta and gamma required seven times more phosphonoacetic acid for a 50% inhibition of their activities. Phosphonoacetic acid inhibited the activities of the reverse transcriptase and terminal deoxyribonucleotidyltransferase only at higher concentrations. Kinetic analysis with the DNA polymerase alpha showed that the compound is a non-competitive inhibitor with respect to the substrates and uncompetitive inhibitor with the activated DNA template. Studies on time course of phosphonoacetic acid inhibition revealed that the compound is inhibitory even after the initiation of DNA synthesis. Phosphonoacetic acid also inhibited cell growth as well as the type C virus production; at concentrations above 50 microgram/ml, the inhibitory effect was more profound on the type C virus production than on cell growth.","['Allaudeen, H S', 'Bertino, J R']","['Allaudeen HS', 'Bertino JR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210', '*Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Phosphonoacetic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Retroviridae/drug effects', '*Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors', 'Templates, Genetic']",1978/10/24 00:00,1978/10/24 00:01,['1978/10/24 00:00'],"['1978/10/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/10/24 00:01 [medline]', '1978/10/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2787(78)90134-X [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2787(78)90134-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1978 Oct 24;520(3):490-7. doi: 10.1016/0005-2787(78)90134-x.,"['0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'N919E46723 (Phosphonoacetic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,

Detection of Ia antigens on GRSL cells.,153-6,"The expression of immune response-associated (Ia) antigens on the surface of mouse strain GR (H-2dx) ascites leukemia (GRSL) cell lines was studied by cytotoxic tests, immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation assays. Ia expression varied among the three GRSL cells lines (GRSL 2, GRSL 14, and GRSL 15) studied by cytotoxic assay. GRSL 14 cells showed the strongest expression of Ia antigens among these three cell lines. A time-course study of tumor growth in mice revealed that Ia antigens on the tumor cells demonstrated the strongest expression 10 days after injection of GRSL cells into GR mice, and that subsequently it decreased until the death of the animal. Cells treated with neuraminidase exhibited more readily detectable Ia antigens, expecially in the late stages of leukemia, which suggested that Ia antigens had been masked by sialic acid. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that Ia molecules on the leukemia cell had the same molecular weight as those on the normal lymphocytes.

Inhibition by natural and synthetic RNA.,576-81,"The RNase H activity associated with purified avian myeloblastosis virus and Rauscher murine leukemia virus DNA polymerases is inhibited by homopolymeric RNA molecules, although the efficiency of inhibition by each homopolymer appears enzyme specific. Formation of duplex RNA molecules abolished the inhibitory activity. In contrast to these results, DNA polymerase-independent RNase H activities, such as the RNase H-II from Rauscher murine leukemia virus and calf thymus RNase H, were unaffected by the addition of exogenous RNA molecules to reaction mixtures. These results support the concept (M. J. Modak and S. L. Marcus, J. Virol. 22:253--256, 1977) that the catalytic site of DNA polymerase-associated RNase H activity may be that which is also involved in template binding. Naturally occurring RNA molecules of oncornaviral, procaryotic, or eucaryotic origin also proved to be efficient inhibitors of avian myeloblastosis virus DNA polymerase-associated RNase H activity. In contrast to this result, naturally occurring RNA molecules, at concentrations which inhibited the avian myeloblastosis virus enzyme, did not inhibit Rauscher murine leukemia virus DNA polymerase-catalyzed RNase H activity. This finding represents a new biochemical distinction between the two reverse transcriptases, and may be indicative of differences in the relative affinities of these enzymes for natural RNA molecules.","['Marcus, S L', 'Smith, S W', 'Modak, M J']","['Marcus SL', 'Smith SW', 'Modak MJ']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Avian Leukosis Virus/*enzymology', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/*enzymology', 'RNA/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Viral/*pharmacology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Rauscher Virus/*enzymology', 'Ribonucleases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1978/09/01 00:00,1978/09/01 00:01,['1978/09/01 00:00'],"['1978/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.27.3.576-581.1978 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1978 Sep;27(3):576-81. doi: 10.1128/JVI.27.3.576-581.1978.,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",PMC525844,,,,,,,,

We reexamined this phenomenon, and the earlier observation was found to be reproducible. However, when doubly banded preparations of viral cores were solubilized and reverse transcriptase was isolated by ion-exchange chromatography, a coincident peak of a nuclease activity with the specificity of RNase H was observed, which indicated that RNase H was selectively inhibited in the core fractions. By direct activity measurements using the purified reverse transcriptase-RNase H from cores, this endogenous inhibitor has been identified as the viral RNA. Viral 70S RNA strongly inhibited RNase H activity purified either from whole virions or from prefractionated cores. Other RNAs tested that had inhibitory effects were yeast tRNA, polyadenylic acid, and polyguanylic acid. Polyuridylic acid and polyadenylic acid were moderately inhibitory, and polycytidylic acid did not inhibit the RNase H. A rabbit anti-reverse transcriptase immunoglobulin G inhibited both the reverse transcriptase and RNase H activities of the enzyme purified from cores. These data provide a rational explanation for the failure to detect RNase H activity in core preparations of Rauscher murine leukemia virus. Furthermore, these data are consistent with the idea that the RNase H and reverse transcriptase activities purified from cores reside on the same protein molecule. Possible biological implications of the observed inhibition of RNase H by RNA is discussed.","['Sarngadharan, M G', 'Kalyanaraman, V S', 'Gallo, R C']","['Sarngadharan MG', 'Kalyanaraman VS', 'Gallo RC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['RNA/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Viral/*pharmacology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Rauscher Virus/*enzymology', 'Ribonucleases/*antagonists & inhibitors/isolation & purification']",1978/09/01 00:00,1978/09/01 00:01,['1978/09/01 00:00'],"['1978/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.27.3.568-575.1978 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1978 Sep;27(3):568-75. doi: 10.1128/JVI.27.3.568-575.1978.,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",PMC525843,,,,,,,,

The relationship between M-PMV and type C viruses decreases in the series RD-114--NIG-MuLV--G-MuLV. Type C viruses of mammals have common envelope antigenic determinants lacking in M-PMV. No common antigenic determinants with M-PMV have been found in the envelope of virions of bovine leukemia virus, type B virus of mice (MMTV), or type C avian virus (Pr-RSV).","[""Al'tshtein, A D"", 'Zakharova, L G', 'Zhdanov, V M']","[""Al'tshtein AD"", 'Zakharova LG', 'Zhdanov VM']",['rus'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Vopr Virusol,Voprosy virusologii,0417337,IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, Viral', 'Cats/microbiology', 'Cross Reactions', 'Epitopes', 'Haplorhini/microbiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/immunology', 'Mice/microbiology', 'Retroviridae/classification/*immunology', 'Serotyping', 'Species Specificity']",1978/05/01 00:00,1978/05/01 00:01,['1978/05/01 00:00'],"['1978/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Vopr Virusol. 1978 May-Jun;(3):309-14.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)']",,Vyiavlenie obshchikh antigennykh determinant v obolochkakh virionov tipa D (Mezon--Pfaizer) i tipa s mlekopitaiushchikh s pomoshch'iu reaktsii pretsipitatsii virionov.,,,,,,,

Analysis of IF-treated cells showed that there was a three to fourfold increase in the amount of virus RNA in the nucleus at 48 h after IF addition, and still a slight increase at 72 h. There were no increases in the amounts of virus RNA in the cytoplasm during 72 h after the addition of IF. These results agree with the postulate that IF inhibits a late stage in the maturation of virus in chronically infected cells.","['Salzberg, S', 'Bakhanashvili, M', 'Aboud, M']","['Salzberg S', 'Bakhanashvili M', 'Aboud M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*drug effects/growth & development/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects']",1978/07/01 00:00,1978/07/01 00:01,['1978/07/01 00:00'],"['1978/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-40-1-121 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1978 Jul;40(1):121-30. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-40-1-121.,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,,,,,,,

The results suggest that the bleomycin cleavage sites in chromatin are present only in the linker region and that there are probably only one or two cleavage sites per linker. The repeat lengths of nucleosomal DNA released by bleomycin from nuclei of different species are different; this variability is considered to reflect the length of the linker. Incorporation of BrdU into DNA did not alter the bleomycin action on nucleosomes.

A pooled, hyperimmune antiserum precipitated at least 16 polypeptides from both normal and CLL lymphocytes as shown by sodium-dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These polypeptides varied in molecular weight from 11,000 to 180,000. None was prominent or unique to the CLL lymphocytes, although four peptide bands in the CLL cells usually showed more radioactivity than their counterparts in normal cells. Precipitation with antisera of known specificity showed that the cell surface proteins from CLL and normal lymphocytes included HLA antigens and beta2-microglobulin. IgM and IgD were found in preparations of normal cells and in cells of 3 of 5 CLL patients. Of cells from the other 2 patients, one showed only IgD and the other no Ig. An antigen-binding capacity test was employed to quantitate the antibody content of a pooled anti-CLL lymphocyte serum. The antiserum reacted with all Ig classes; however, after absorption with light chains and F(ab')2 fragments, the serum retained activity only for IgM and IgD. The absorbed antiserum bound 45 microgram IgM, 1.5 microgram IgD and 4.5 microgram beta2-microglobulin per milliliter. These data indicate that rabbit anti-CLL lymphocyte sera fail to detect a qualitatively unique tumor-specific polypeptide on the surfaces of CLL cells.

The transformation of ring shaped nucleoli to nucleoli with less or more distinct nucleolonemata in PHA stimulated cells was characterized by a marked increase of granular RNP components in number indicating the activation of their production. This phenomenon seems to be related not only to the activation of the ribosomal RNA synthesis but also to its processing. The appearance of fibrillar RNP components in the central area of the ring shaped nucleoli apparently represents the first sign of the nucleolar RNA synthesis in these cells. The proportion of fibrillar and granular nucleolar RNP comonents in PHA inresponsive lymphocytes was similar to that in lymphocytes from patients with the usual type of lymphocytic leukemia. The intranucleolar chromatin areas appeared to be larger in PHA stimulated lymphocytes but the proportion of these areas to the nucleolar body did not show substantial difference as compared to the resting cells.,"['Raska, I', 'Smetana, K']","['Raska I', 'Smetana K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Folia Haematol Int Mag Klin Morphol Blutforsch,"Folia haematologica (Leipzig, Germany : 1928)",0374615,IM,"['Cell Nucleolus/*analysis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Lectins', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood', 'Lymphocytes/*ultrastructure', 'RNA/*analysis', 'Ribonucleoproteins/blood']",1978/01/01 00:00,1978/01/01 00:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Folia Haematol Int Mag Klin Morphol Blutforsch. 1978;105(2):200-15.,"['0 (Lectins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",,,,,,,,,

Interferon added together with 3H-uridine inhibited the production of labelled virus particles even when it was only allowed to act after all viral RNA synthesis had been stopped by actinomycin D. This indicated that the interferon-induced antiviral state primarily functions at a posttranscriptional step. When interferon was given after a 3H-uridine pulse label and arrest of label incorporation by glucosamine and unlabelled uridine, it prevented a portion of the preexisting radioactive RNA from occurring in extracellular particles. However, part of the labelled viral RNA had reached a stage beyond which interferon could not prevent it from occurring in extracellular virus particles. The notion that interferon primarily affects release of fully assembled and enveloped MLV particles may be eliminated: interferon-treatment did not affect the release of particle-bound reverse transcriptase in cells treated with cycloheximide after the antiviral state had been established. It was confirmed that interferon-treated JLSV 5-cells contained an increased number of virus particles associated with the cell membrane. However, these particles were found to have a reduced infectivity compared to those associated with control cells, thus confirming the view that virions produced by interferon-treated cells are defective; perhaps lacking in certain components.","['Billiau, A', 'Heremans, H', 'Allens, P T', 'Baron, S', 'de Somer, P']","['Billiau A', 'Heremans H', 'Allens PT', 'Baron S', 'de Somer P']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/biosynthesis', 'Rauscher Virus/*drug effects/growth & development/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects']",1978/01/01 00:00,1978/01/01 00:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01315085 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Virol. 1978;57(3):205-20. doi: 10.1007/BF01315085.,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,,,,,,,

These antigens are serologically distinct from the G cell surface antigens that are found on cells infected with endogenous MuLV (AKR and Gross virus). Cell surface antigens of both virus groups are immunogenic in mice, and immunization with appropriate virus-infected cells leads to the production of cytotoxic antisera. The cytotoxic activity of FMR antisera can be absorbed by disrupted preparations of Rauscher MuLV, but not by AKR MuLV. FMR antisera precipitate the viral envelope proteins gp70, pl5(E), and p12(E) from detergent-disrupted preparations of [3H]leucine-labeled MuLV. The reaction of these antisera with p15(E) and p12(E) proteins is directed against group-specific antigens and can be absorbed with AKR MuLV; in contrast, the reaction of these antisera with gp70 is directed against type-specific antigens and is absorbed only by viruses of the FMR group. In immune precipitation assays with detergent-disrupted 125I surface-labeled cells, FMR antisera react only with type-specific antigens of the viral envelpe protein. On the basis of these findings we conclude that the FMR cell surface antigen is a determinant on the MuLV env gene product.","['Nowinski, R C', 'Emery, S', 'Ledbetter, J']","['Nowinski RC', 'Emery S', 'Ledbetter J']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Viral/*analysis', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Culture Techniques', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Epitopes', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice']",1978/06/01 00:00,1978/06/01 00:01,['1978/06/01 00:00'],"['1978/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.26.3.805-812.1978 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1978 Jun;26(3):805-12. doi: 10.1128/JVI.26.3.805-812.1978.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)']",PMC525905,,,,,,,,

Antisera raised against classically defined Friend- Moloney-Rauscher antigenic determinants have been shown to react with virus structural proteins coded for by genetic information contained in the lymphatic leukemia or helper (LLV) virus genome. The recent development of nontrans-formed fibroblast cell lines which contain the replication-defective spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) genome, free of replicating LLV, has allowed investigation of an SFFV-specific antigen. We have applied the techniques of mixed tumor-lymphocyte culture stimulation followed by lymphocyte-mediated cytolysis assays to search for the cell surface expression of an antigen coded expressly by SFFV genetic information. SFFV nonproducer-immune, in vitro activated spleen cells were capable of effecting the lysis of SFFV-containing BALB/c 3T3 and Fischer rat epithelial, cloned cell lines. Normal BALB/c 3T3 and BALB/c 3T3 cells infected with three types of ecotropic LLV were unaffected. Syngeneic FLV and RLV-induced murine leukemia cells were also killed by SFFV nonproducer-immune lymphocytes. In addition, Kirsten sarcoma virus-transformed, replication-defective and replication-rescued BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts were not susceptible to SFFV antigen-directed cytolysis. Antibody-dependent complement-mediated cytolysis assays using monospecific goat antisera confirmed that SFFV nonproducers lacked cell surface expression of virion structural proteins. These observations suggest that the antigen detected in LMC experiments was not coded for by genetic information contained in the helper component of FLV, and that it represents a true SFFV-specific cell surface antigen. Based upon the recent molecular evaluation of the SFFV genome as consisting of both xenotropic and ecotropic virus sequences, it appears reasonable that xenotropic genetic information may be responsible for expression of the SFFV- specific antigen. Since the replication-defective SFFV genome is also responsible for the malignant transformation associated with FLV-induced erythroleukemia, one might postulate that gene sequences capable of programming transformation may also code for the TASA detected in these studies.","['Gillis, S', 'Gillis, A E', 'Smith, K A']","['Gillis S', 'Gillis AE', 'Smith KA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*isolation & purification', 'Antigens, Viral/*isolation & purification', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes', 'Female', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Code', 'Helper Viruses/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology/microbiology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Mice', 'Spleen/microbiology', 'Viral Proteins/isolation & purification']",1978/07/01 00:00,1978/07/01 00:01,['1978/07/01 00:00'],"['1978/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.148.1.18 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1978 Jul 1;148(1):18-31. doi: 10.1084/jem.148.1.18.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",PMC2184929,,,,,,,,

A certain interspecies activity was obtained, stronger in mouse anti-human (M alpha H) than in human anti-mouse (H alpha M) combinations. In the H alpha M system, activity was associated with the same type of PBL-derived non-B-non-T cell fraction as in the intraspecies H alpha H system.

Nonlabeled tumor cells were allowed to compete with isotope-labeled targets in intra- and interspecies cytolytic NK tests. NK-sensitive tumor lines of the same species were superior to xenogeneic competitors in both M alpha M and H alpha H tests. In the M alpha M assay, the competing ability of the same human tumors varied, depending on the genotype of the mouse effector cells.

Azacytidine is transported with about the same efficiency as uridine and cytidine by the facilitated nucleoside transport system of these cells. The phosphorylation of azacytidine in untreated, wild-type cells, however, is much more inhibited by uridine and cytidine than is its transport into the cell. This inhibition seems to be responsible for the specific protection of cells by these nucleosides from azacytidine toxicity. Azacytidine is incorporated by Novikoff and P388 cells into both RNA and DNA, and this incorporation seems to be responsible for its cytotoxicity; an inhibition of de novo pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis is not a major contributory factor. Incorporation of azacytidine into nucleic acids is relatively slow, but it is enhanced 3 to 4 times when cells are preincubated with pyrazofurin. Pyrazofurin inhibits de novo pyrimidine synthesis and thus causes a depletion of cellular pyrimidine nucleotides. Azacytidine is largely cytostatic for Novikoff and P388 cells, but a sequential treatment with pyrazofurin and azacytidine markedly increases the cytotoxicity over that observed with drug alone or when administered together with drug, even at higher concentrations. Increased cytotoxicity correlates with the increased incorporation of azacytidine into nucleic acids.","['Plagemann, P G', 'Behrens, M', 'Abraham, D']","['Plagemann PG', 'Behrens M', 'Abraham D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Amides', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytidine/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Drug Synergism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/metabolism', 'Phosphates/metabolism', 'Pyrazoles', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Ribose', 'Uridine/pharmacology']",1978/08/01 00:00,1978/08/01 00:01,['1978/08/01 00:00'],"['1978/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1978 Aug;38(8):2458-66.,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '4B15044GQZ (pyrazofurin)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '681HV46001 (Ribose)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",,,,,,,,,

Two variants of the course of mixed chronic infection of the cultures with oncornavirus and arbovirus differing in the rate of transition of the arbovirus into the noninfectious form and inhibition or stimulation of oncornavirus functions are discussed.","['Pogodina, V V', 'Fokina, G I', 'Kiseleva, L L', 'Graevskaia, N A', 'Sito, A F']","['Pogodina VV', 'Fokina GI', 'Kiseleva LL', 'Graevskaia NA', 'Sito AF']",['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Vopr Virusol,Voprosy virusologii,0417337,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured/*microbiology', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/analysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/analysis', 'Retroviridae/*pathogenicity', 'Sindbis Virus/*pathogenicity', 'Time Factors', 'Virus Cultivation']",1978/03/01 00:00,1978/03/01 00:01,['1978/03/01 00:00'],"['1978/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Vopr Virusol. 1978 Mar-Apr;(2):196-201.,"['EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,"Persistentsiia virusa Sindbis v kul'turakh, produtsiruiushchikh onkornavirus.",,,,,,,

Although the two viral proteins share murine group-specific antigenic determinants, the Y-1 virus p30 appeared to have both a lower relative number of such determinants and a decreased affinity at the cross-reactive sites for Moloney virus p30 monospecific antibodies. Further, immunological analysis indicated the presence of unique antigenic sites on the Moloney virus p30 not shared by the analogous Y-1 virus molecule. The two polypeptides copurified and had similar isoelectric points (pH 6.2 to 6.3) and sedimentation coefficients (2.47S). However, equilibrium sedimentation yielded a significant mass difference between the two proteins, 28,300 +/- 600 and 31,000 +/- 300 daltons for the Moloney and Y-1 virus molecules, respectively. Amino acid analysis indicated a concomitant increase in total residues for the Y-1 virus p30, although a number of residues appeared to have been conserved between the two viral proteins. Conformational studies and hydrodynamic calculations demonstrated marked secondary and tertiary structural differences; with the Y-1 virus p30 being an asymmetric prolate ellipsoid containing 27 to 28% alpha-helix and Moloney virus p30 being somewhat more spherical and possessing an alpha-helical content of 50 to 55%.

The mechanism of this phenomenon was investigated by comparing the inactivation rates for viral infectivity and for the ability of the same virus to abrogate Fv-1 restriction. Inactivation of the abrogating ability of N-tropic murine leukemia virus following graduated doses of gamma radiation proceeded at half the rate of that for viral infectivity. This result indicates that viral RNA must function in abrogating Fv-1b restriction but that only a portion of the viral genome is required. The inactivation kinetics of N-tropic murine leukemia virus were also determined following incubation of virus at 43 degrees C. Abrogating ability of N-tropic murine leukemia virus was found to be about six times as stable under these conditions as was viral infectivity. Interestingly, virion-associated reverse transcriptase activity was inactivated at the same rate as was viral infectivity, indicating that this enzyme may not need to function during abrogation. Virus heated at 43 degrees C was used to study the kinetics of the abrogation phenomenon itself. Abrogation was shown to be transient, requiring 6 to 9 h after virus infection to become maximally effective and beginning to disappear after about 18 h. The data reported here confirm the idea that abrogation of Fv-1 restriction can be separated experimentally from virus replication, and they raise the possibility that a separate biochemical pathway exists for incoming viral RNA in Fv-1 restrictive cells.","['Bassin, R H', 'Duran-Troise, G', 'Gerwin, B I', 'Rein, A']","['Bassin RH', 'Duran-Troise G', 'Gerwin BI', 'Rein A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Gamma Rays', '*Genes', 'Hot Temperature', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*growth & development/radiation effects', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*growth & development/radiation effects', 'RNA, Viral/physiology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism']",1978/05/01 00:00,1978/05/01 00:01,['1978/05/01 00:00'],"['1978/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.26.2.306-315.1978 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1978 May;26(2):306-15. doi: 10.1128/JVI.26.2.306-315.1978.,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",PMC354069,,,,,,,,

Whereas the purified reverse transcriptase of mammalian viruses sedimented in glycerol gradients as a globular protein with a molecular weight of 70,000, after interaction with tRNA the enzyme cosedimented with a protein of 150,000 molecular weight. The twofold increase in molecular weight could be a result of either two reverse transcriptase molecules complexed with a tRNA or, alternatively, several tRNA molecules bound to a single enzyme polypeptide. The enzyme complexes were dissociated in part upon degradation of the tRNA moiety by pancreatic RNase A. The reverse transcriptase released from virions of Moloney murine leukemia virus, simian sarcoma virus, and avian myeloblastosis virus, by nonionic detergent, migrated faster on glycerol gradients than purified enzyme preparation. This phenomenon was probably due to complex formation between part of the virion enzyme and the tRNA, which is endogenous in virions. Addition of exogenous tRNA was needed, however, to quantitatively complex all the virion reverse transcriptase of Moloney murine leukemia virus and simian sarcoma viruses. The reverse transcriptase of Moloney murine leukemia virus did not show tRNA species specificity in the binding reaction when glycerol gradients were used for assay. Thus, several tRNA species of Escherichia coli, yeast, chicken, and rat origin were able to complex with the enzyme. The species specificity in the interaction between tRNA and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase was also examined. We demonstrated that under our experimental conditions, this enzyme binds different tRNA species of E. coli and yeast as well as tRNA of chicken origin.","['Panet, A', 'Berliner, H']","['Panet A', 'Berliner H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Chickens', 'Escherichia coli', 'Molecular Weight', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'RNA, Bacterial/metabolism', 'RNA, Transfer/*metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Retroviridae/*enzymology', 'Sarcoma Virus, Woolly Monkey/*enzymology', 'Species Specificity', 'Virion/enzymology', 'Yeasts']",1978/05/01 00:00,1978/05/01 00:01,['1978/05/01 00:00'],"['1978/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.26.2.214-220.1978 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1978 May;26(2):214-20. doi: 10.1128/JVI.26.2.214-220.1978.,"['0 (RNA, Bacterial)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",PMC354057,,,,,,,,

We have used fluorescence microscopy and uptake of radioactive dye to study MC 540 staining of peripheral blood leukocytes from 80 leukemic and 34 normal individuals; leukemic leukocytes stain, whereas normal leukcytes do not. The leukocyte staining reaction differs from that previously described for excitable cells since it is independent of the ionic composition of the staining medium, kinetically complex, enhanced by light, enhanced by oxygen and essentially irreversible. Virtually all circulating nucleated cells from leukemic individuals are stained to approximately the same extent, and there is no qualitative or quantitative distinction between the various forms of leukemia. We have also found that MC 540 interacts with granulopoietic colony-forming cells (CFU-C) and with spleen colony-forming cells derived from mouse bone marrow (CFU-S). We cannot as yet identify a specific property of leukocyte plasma membranes that determines MC 540 permeability; since changes in MC 540 uptake appear to be correlated with cellular maturation during normal hemopoiesis, the retention of staining by leukemic cells, some of which appear morphologically normal, may indicate of failure in membrane maturation during leukemic blood cell development.","['Valinsky, J E', 'Easton, T G', 'Reich, E']","['Valinsky JE', 'Easton TG', 'Reich E']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,IM,"['*Benzoxazoles', 'Blood Platelets/analysis', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Erythrocytes/analysis', '*Fluorescent Dyes', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Leukocytes/*analysis', 'Light', 'Oxygen/pharmacology', '*Pyrimidinones', 'Staining and Labeling']",1978/03/01 00:00,1978/03/01 00:01,['1978/03/01 00:00'],"['1978/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(78)90322-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(78)90322-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1978 Mar;13(3):487-99. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(78)90322-7.,"['0 (Benzoxazoles)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,

To examine whether the glycoprotein mRNA of murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs) might consist of portions derived from both the 5' and 3' ends of the viral genome, we performed hybridization with a 5'-specific probe and heteroduplex analysis with long reverse transcribed DNA. A 5' probe was made by purifying a discrete 50 nucleotide-long reverse transcript attached to its tRNA primer. This probe was found to hybridize to RNA of the size of glycoprotein mRNA--21S, poly(A)-containing RNA--indicating that the mRNA could have a 5' leader sequence. The 5'-specific sequences were studied by electron microscopic examination of hybrids between 21S RNA and the two longest discrete cDNA species synthesized in the endogenous reverse transcriptase reaction. One of these species, 8.8 kb long, is only made in the absence of actinomycin D, but it does not contain any self-complementary sequences, and therefore appears to be a complete transcript of the viral genome. The shorter of the two species, 8.2 kb long, is synthesized whether or not actinomycin D is present; it must terminate 500--600 nucleotides internal to the 5' end of the template RNA. The structures observed in heteroduplexes of 21S RNA and these DNAs indicated the presence of a leader sequence approximately 500 nucleotides long at the 5' end of the 21S RNA. Sequences comprising this leader segment in the 21S RNA mapped at the 5' end of the genome RNA; the rest of the 21S RNA consisted of sequences from the 3' portion of the genome. Analysis of heteroduplexes with 8.2 kb DNA suggested that actinomycin D could block the reverse transcription of most of the sequence in the genome RNA that appears as a leader in the 21S RNA.","['Rothenberg, E', 'Donoghue, D J', 'Baltimore, D']","['Rothenberg E', 'Donoghue DJ', 'Baltimore D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', '*Genes, Viral', 'Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Viral/*analysis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis']",1978/03/01 00:00,1978/03/01 00:01,['1978/03/01 00:00'],"['1978/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(78)90318-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(78)90318-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1978 Mar;13(3):435-51. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(78)90318-5.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,,,,,,,

RNase H activity (RNase H I) associated with RNA-directed DNA polymerase eluted at 0.23 M KCI from poly(C)-agarose. RNase H II, which eluted from poly(C)-agarose at 0.12 M KCI and was not associated with DNA polymerase activity, was shown to be identical to an RNase H species (designated RNase H II) previously isolated from M-MSV(MLV) by a different procedure (G. F. Gerard and D. P. Grandgenett, J. Virol. 15:785-797, 1975). M-MSV(MLV) RNase H II was established to be a random exohybridase that requires free-chain termini in its hybrid substrate for activity. Lysates of Rickard feline leukemia virus also contained RNase H activity not associated with DNA polymerase activity that eluted from poly(C)-agarose at 0.12 M KCl. A third species of enzyme from M-MSV(MLV) lysates, called RNase H III, did not bind to poly(C)-agarose in 0.06 M KCl. RNase H III was purified from lysates of M-MSV(MLV) and M-MLV (grown in mouse cells) by sequential chromatography on poly(C)-agarose, DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, and polyuridylic acid-Sepharose. Purified RNase H III (i) was free of any associated DNA polymerase activity, (ii) had an apparent molecular weight of 30,000 determined by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration, (iii) had an absolute requirement for Mn2+ (1 mM optimum) for the degradation of [3H](A)n.(dT)n, (iv) was inhibited by the presence of any salt in reaction mixtures, and (v) was endoribonucleolytic in its mode of action as indicated by the size distribution of limited degradation products of [3H](A)n.(dT)n. RNase H III was inhibited by antisera prepared against Rauscher MLV and simian sarcoma virus reverse transcriptase, and the quantity of RNase H III and RNase H I present in lysates of M-MLV were reduced and increased proportionately if virus was lysed in the presence of the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. These results indicate that RNase H III is a proteolytic cleavage product of DNA polymerase-RNase H. Substantial RNase H activity that did not bind to poly(C)-agarose in 0.06 M KCl was also found in lysates of Harvey MSV(MLV), Rauscher MLV, and Rickard feline leukemia virus, but not in lysates of avian myeloblastosis virus.","['Gerard, G F']",['Gerard GF'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Endonucleases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Ethylmaleimide/pharmacology', 'Gammaretrovirus/*enzymology', 'Phenylmethylsulfonyl Fluoride/pharmacology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*enzymology', 'Ribonucleases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",1978/04/01 00:00,1978/04/01 00:01,['1978/04/01 00:00'],"['1978/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.26.1.16-28.1978 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1978 Apr;26(1):16-28. doi: 10.1128/JVI.26.1.16-28.1978.,"['57KD15003I (Phenylmethylsulfonyl Fluoride)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)', 'O3C74ACM9V (Ethylmaleimide)']",PMC354029,,,,,,,,

The two enzyme forms, neither of which is detectable in uninfected cells (JLSV-9), were initially partially purified by poly(C)-agarose chromatography, and their separation was achieved by phosphocellulose chromatography. The enzyme form eluting first from phosphocellulose (0.3 M KCl), designated PC I, was found to be identical in all parameters tested to that form isolated directly from purified virions. The second enzyme peak, designated PC II, eluted from phosphocellulose at 0.5 M KCl and was not detectable in purified virions. The PC II enzyme has a molecular weight, determined by velocity sedimentation, of approximately 109,000, as compared with 70,000 for the PC I enzyme, and could not be further dissociated by exposure to high salt or nonionic detergent. Mixing purified virion or PC I DNA polymerase with uninfected cells followed by fractionation did not produce the PC II form, suggesting that it is neither an artifact of purification nor the result of fortuitous complexing of reverse transcriptase with normal cellular component(s). Both PC I and PC II enzyme forms appeared antigenically similar to virion DNA polymerase, demonstrated identical divalent cation requirements for various template-primers, and were capable of copying heteropolymeric regions of rabbit globin mRNA. However, kinetic studies of heat inactivation revealed that the PC II enzyme was far more heat labile than the PC I form, which appeared identical to the virion enzyme in this respect. Furthermore, whereas the PC I and virion-derived reverse transcriptase copied poly(C).(dG)12-18 most efficiently at a template-to-primer molar nucleotide ratio of 25:1, the PC II enzyme preferred a ratio of 5:1 for optimal rates of poly(dG) synthesis.

It is shown to be a potent inhibitor of reverse transcriptase activity from both avian myeloblastosis virus and Rauscher murine leukaemia virus. In addition, it affects eukaryotic DNA-dependent DNA polymerase-alpha activity: 50% inhibition is reached in 60-min incubation time by about 8 micron beta-lapachone. Enzyme activity is inhibited irrespective of the purity of the enzyme used or of the amount or type of template/primer or substrate present. The inhibitory effect of the drug is only observed in the presence of dithiothreitol. The primary site of action of beta-lapachone appears to be the enzyme protein, as is also borne out by the specificity of its action. Eukaryotic DNA-dependent DNA polymerase-beta, prokaryotic DNA-dependent DNA polymerase I, several other nucleic acid polymerases and some completely unrelated enzymes are not affected.

By gel-filtration and ion-exchange chromatography, 5 novel urinary glycoproteins have been isolated which are responsible for about 1/2 the mass of the ""low molecular weight proteinuria"" of patients with advanced cancer: BJC1 and BJC2 (patient B.J., chronic myelocytic leukemia); JBB5 (J.B., metastatic pancreatic carcinoma); EDC1 (E.D., acute myelocytic leukemia); HNC1beta (H.N., acute monocytic leukemia). Mol wts respectively are 29,000, 22,000, 55,000, 27,000 and 33,000, and carbohydrate contents respectively 61%, 23%, 23%, 27% and 40%. Attention to date has focussed on EDC1 and HNC1beta, because their urinary excretion directly reflects the course of the neoplastic disease. EDC1 and HNC1beta possess the same protein but different carbohydrate moieties. They are antigenically related to inter-alpha trypsin inhibitor, mol wt 160,000, which is one of the 6 antiproteolytic proteins in normal human plasma. EDC1 and HNC1beta both possess antitryptic activity. Specific radioimmunoassays (RIA) to these 2 glycoproteins were developed. Normal individuals (n = 210) excreted 0.3 +/- .02 (ave. +/- SE) mg EDC1 per g creatinine. In 18 non-neoplastic diseases (n = 75), urinary EDC1 was .5 +/- .06 mg/g creatinine. In disseminated cancer of 7 types (n = 81) (breast, ovary, colon, squamous of head-neck and lung; melanoma; acute myelocytic leukemia), ave. EDC1 excretion ranged from 10 to 190 mg/g creatinine. A significant increase (P less than .05) was found in the localized stage of squamous cancer of head-neck-lung, but only after regional or distant spread in the other types. Similar results were found with HNC1beta, urinary excretion of which averaged 1/10 that of EDC1. Effective chemotherapy in 5 patients with leukemia or solid tumors caused prompt disappearance of urinary EDC1; the glyco-protein reappeared in the urine several weeks before clinical relapse. CONCLUSIONS: (i) EDC1- and HNC1beta-proteinuria is a useful indicator of some types of localized and most types of disseminated cancer; (ii) the degree of this proteinuria reflects the effectiveness of chemotherapy; (iii) the antiproteolytic property of EDC1 and HNC1beta suggests a relation between proteolysis and tumorigenesis.","['Rudman, D', 'Chawla, R K', 'Wadsworth, A D', 'Nixon, D W', 'Schwartz, M']","['Rudman D', 'Chawla RK', 'Wadsworth AD', 'Nixon DW', 'Schwartz M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Trans Assoc Am Physicians,Transactions of the Association of American Physicians,7506109,IM,"['Carcinoma/urine', 'Colonic Neoplasms/urine', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/urine', 'Epitopes', 'Glycoproteins/blood/immunology/*urine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/urine', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/urine', 'Neoplasms/*urine', 'Protease Inhibitors']",1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Trans Assoc Am Physicians. 1977;90:286-99.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)']",,,,,,,,,

Pr200(gag-pol) contains both p30 and RT peptide sequences. Intermediate RT-related precursors of 145,000 (Pr145(pol)), 135,000 (Pr135(pol)), and 125,000 (Pr125(pol)) molecular weights were specifically recognized by precipitation from infected cell extracts by antiserum to RT. These proteins shared methionine-containing tryptic peptide sequences with a virion polypeptide of 80,000 molecular weight (p80(pol)) precipitate by antiserum to RT. Purification of active RT enzyme from virions labeled with [(3)H]methionine showed that p80(pol) was the major component, based on analysis by gel electrophoresis and tryptic peptide mapping experiments. A polypeptide (Pr80(pol)), similar in size to mature viral p80(pol), was also precipitated from infected cells by antiserum to RT. Its peptide map was nearly identical to that of virion p80(pol). Pulse-chase studies showed that Pr80(pol), Pr125(pol), and Pr135(pol) were stable polypeptides, whereas Pr200(gag-pol) and Pr145(pol) were unstable precursors.

End point-diluted stocks of PP-1R have been obtained that are free of focus-forming activity and lack both Kirsten sarcoma and primate type C viral sequences. Nucleic acid hybridization experiments show that the cloned virus (MiLV) is an endogenous, genetically transmitted virus of the mink (Mustela vison). MiLV replicates in canine, feline, and 64J1 mink cells but not in an untransformed mink cell line. Multiple viral gene copies can be detected in the DNA of normal mink cells in culture and in normal mink tissues; related endogenous viral genes are also detected in several related Mustela species. The virus codes for a p30 protein very closely related antigenically to that of feline leukemia virus but contains p15 and p12 proteins that are antigenically distinct. The mink cell line, Mv1Lu, and its Kirsten sarcoma-transformed derivatives, 64J1, express relatively low levels of type C viral RNA related to MiLV and normally do not produce detectable levels of MiLV p30 protein or complete, infectious viral particles. Infection of sarcoma virus-transformed mink cells with baboon type C virus, however, can augment the level of expression of endogenous mink viral RNA and can result in the synthesis and packaging of mink viral RNA and p30 antigen in extracellular virions. Since the Mv1Lu cell line and its tranformed derivatives have become widely used in studies of retroviruses, the possibility of activating endogenous mink viral genes should be considered by investigators working with these cells.","['Sherr, C J', 'Benveniste, R E', 'Todaro, G J']","['Sherr CJ', 'Benveniste RE', 'Todaro GJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Epitopes', 'Gammaretrovirus', 'Mink', 'Molecular Weight', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', '*Retroviridae/analysis/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Viral Proteins/immunology']",1978/03/01 00:00,1978/03/01 00:01,['1978/03/01 00:00'],"['1978/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.25.3.738-749.1978 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1978 Mar;25(3):738-49. doi: 10.1128/JVI.25.3.738-749.1978.,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",PMC525967,,,,,,,,

Since IgE molecules are firmly bound to receptors on mast cells, bridging of cell-bound IgE molecules probably brings receptor molecules into close proximity. A hypothesis was therefore presented that such a local change in membrane structure and/or possible interaction between adjacent receptor molecules may be triggering mechanisms of IgE-mediated histamine release. The hypothesis was tested by use of antibodies against ""exposed portion"" of receptor molecules on rat basophilic leukemia cells. It was found that antireceptor antibodies and its F(ab')2fragments induced noncytotoxic histamine release from normal rat mast cells without participation of IgE, while the monovalent Fab' fragments of the antibody failed to do so. However, sensitization of normal rat skin with the Fab' fragments followed by an intravenous injection of antirabbit IgG induced skin reactions. These findings support the concept that bridging of receptors rather than polymerization of IgE molecules is responsible for the activation of membrane-associated enzymes which in turn leads to histamine release.","['Ishizaka, T', 'Ishizaka, K', 'Conrad, D H', 'Froese, A']","['Ishizaka T', 'Ishizaka K', 'Conrad DH', 'Froese A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Formation', 'Binding Sites', '*Histamine Release', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism/*physiology', 'Rats']",1978/05/01 00:00,1978/05/01 00:01,['1978/05/01 00:00'],"['1978/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0091-6749(78)90054-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0091-6749(78)90054-4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 1978 May;61(5):320-30. doi: 10.1016/0091-6749(78)90054-4.,['37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)'],,,,,,,,,

The interaction of AMSA with DNA and its effects on nucleic acid-polymerizing enzymes were examined in an attempt to define the site of cytotoxicity of AMSA. Binding of AMSA to DNA, as demonstrated by equilibrium dialysis and spectrophotometric methods, appears to be similar to other aminoacridines, in that two types of binding sites (type 1 and type 2) were observed. Fluorescence studies and thermal denaturation studies gave strong evidence that AMSA type 1 binding was by intercalation into DNA. The binding of AMSA to DNA was without marked base-pair specificity. Furthermore, the effect of AMSA on nucleic acid-polymerizing enzyme activities (mouse embryo DNA polymerase alpha, avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, and Escherichia coli RNA polymerase) was studied. Inhibition of enzyme activity by AMSA appeared to be independent of DNA base sequence. The relatively high concentrations of AMSA required for inhibition of these enzymes as compared to the concentrations of AMSA necessary for cytotoxicity in vitro suggest that the interaction with DNA alone might not fully explain its antitumor activity.","['Gormley, P E', 'Sethi, V S', 'Cysyk, R L']","['Gormley PE', 'Sethi VS', 'Cysyk RL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Acridines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation/drug effects', '*Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Phenylenediamines/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Temperature']",1978/05/01 00:00,1978/05/01 00:01,['1978/05/01 00:00'],"['1978/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1978 May;38(5):1300-6.,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Phenylenediamines)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases)']",,,,,,,,,

The slides were studied without clinical information, and the following morphologic features were evaluated: pattern of growth, number of large lymphocytes, mitotic rate, degree of capsular involvement, presence of plasma cells and/or plasmacytoid lymphocytes, and presence of residual germinal centers. Subsequently, clinical information was obtained. The minimum follow-up period on living patients was 5 years. The patients were divided into 3 clinical categories: 1) monoclonal gammopathy (MG)-11 cases, 2) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) without MG-56 cases, and 3) those without MG or CLL at the time of lymph node biopsy-17 cases. The criterion for CLL was an initial absolute lymphocyte count less than 4000/mm3. Four of the patients with MG also had CLL, and 6 of those in the third group later developed CLL, from 1 to 61 months after lymph node biopsy. Generalized lymphadenopathy was the usual presentation in all 3 groups, and bone marrow examination was positive in all but 1 of the 49 cases, representing all 3 groups, in which it was performed. Median survival for the 84 patients was 51 months. The only clinical parameters which showed a significant association with poorer survival were age above 60 and anemia (Hb. conc. less than 11.0). There was no significant relationship between morphologic characteristics and clinical categories other than the association of plasmacytoid cells with MG in 6 cases. A mitotic rate of 30 or more mitoses per 20 high power fields (HPF), found in 5 cases with at least 1 in each clinical category, showed a highly significant association with decreased survival (p = .01). Variations in mitotic rate between 0 and 29 mitoses per 20 HPF and other morphologic parameters did not show a significant relationship with prognosis. It was concluded that malignant lymphoma of the small lymphocytic type is a definite clinicopathologic entity which may or may not exhibit MG or CLL, and it is proposed that the term ""intermediate lymphocytic lymphoma"" be applied only to those cases showing histopathologic characteristics of small lymphocytic lymphoma and a mitotic rate of 30 or more mitoses per 20 HPF.","['Evans, H L', 'Butler, J J', 'Youness, E L']","['Evans HL', 'Butler JJ', 'Youness EL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Protein Disorders/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Nucleus/pathology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitosis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'gamma-Globulins']",1978/04/01 00:00,1978/04/01 00:01,['1978/04/01 00:00'],"['1978/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(197804)41:4<1440::aid-cncr2820410432>3.0.co;2-g [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1978 Apr;41(4):1440-55. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197804)41:4<1440::aid-cncr2820410432>3.0.co;2-g.,['0 (gamma-Globulins)'],,,,,,,,,

In this connection, the authors report their own findings on the role of reverse transcriptase in a preleukemic disease, myelofibrosis. This enzyme, discovered in their laboratory, is antigenically closely related to reverse transcriptase of certain primate RNA tumor viruses, and of human leukemic cells. The article also describes the role of reverse transcriptase inhibitors in viral oncogenesis. Of particular interest, is the partially thiolated polycytidylic acid (MPC) which has been developed by the authors, and is known to have a very high binding affinity to the viral reverse transcriptase.

These reactions by anti-RBL or its F(ab')2 fragments were inhibited if the receptors on mast cells had been saturated with IgE. The Fab' fragments of anti-RBL could bind with receptors on RBL cells and blocked passive sensitization of mast cells with IgE antibodies, but failed to induce skin reactions and histamine release from normal mast cells.

The other was found not only on lymphocytes, but also on the nucleated myeloid and erythroid cells of bone marrow.","['Thompson, A', 'Morris, R J']","['Thompson A', 'Morris RJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens/*analysis', 'Antilymphocyte Serum', 'Epitopes', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Rats', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1977/04/01 00:00,1977/04/01 00:01,['1977/04/01 00:00'],"['1977/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1977 Apr;32(4):419-25.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Epitopes)']",PMC1445490,,,,,,,,

H-2 linked effects on virus replication can be detected subsequent to the initial virus infection, and clear-cut differences in numbers of virus infected thymus cells can be detected as early as 5 wk after RadLV inoculation. Rapid increases in cellular synthesis and cell surface expression of H-2 antigens are detectable immediately after virus inoculation. These changes have been studied by immunofluorescence, absorption, cell surface iodination followed by sodium dodecyl-sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and two dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis of internally labeled lymphocyte proteins. Expression of H-2K molecules is significantly increased in cells of susceptible and resistant animals. However, significant increases in expression of H-2D antigens occurs only on thymus cells from resistant strains (H-2Dd). Transformed cells of resistant and susceptible H-2 haplotypes adapted to tissue culture lack detectable H-2 antigens as determined by serological absorption studies. It is argued that altered expression of H-2 antigens plays a very significant role in the mechanism of host defense to virus infection.","['Meruelo, D', 'Nimelstein, S H', 'Jones, P P', 'Lieberman, M', 'McDevitt, H O']","['Meruelo D', 'Nimelstein SH', 'Jones PP', 'Lieberman M', 'McDevitt HO']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Epitopes', 'Genetic Linkage', '*H-2 Antigens/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Thymoma/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/*immunology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/immunology', 'Virus Replication']",1978/02/01 00:00,1978/02/01 00:01,['1978/02/01 00:00'],"['1978/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.147.2.470 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1978 Feb 1;147(2):470-87. doi: 10.1084/jem.147.2.470.,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)']",PMC2184498,,,,,,,,

The method takes advantage of the high resolution that proteins, solubilized by Triton X-100 and reduced, display after sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. The antigens can be detected as distinct molecular weight species by a highly sensitive inhibition of cytotoxic reaction. When coupled to the lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of intact cells, the procedure permits the determination of externally exposed antigens. In the present study, the method has been applied to the Moloney leukemia virus-induced YAC lymphoma cells of strain A mice, which express a Moloney leukemia virus-determined cell surface antigen (MCSA) in addition to the type C viral proteins gp71, p30, p15, p15(E), p12, and p10. MCSA was identified as an exposed surface protein distinct in size and antigenic determinants from the major envelope and core protein of Moloney leukemia virus and the histocompatibility antigens. Multiple molecular weight species possessing antigenic determinants for MCSA, gp71, and H-2(a) have been detected. These results provide direct confirmation that MCSA is unrelated to the known virion structural proteins or to the H-2(a) antigen. This method should permit the direct identification and molecular weight characterization of any antigen whose determinants are not solely dependent on a complex quaternary structure and for which serological reagents are available.","['Troy, F A', 'Fenyo, E M', 'Klein, G']","['Troy FA', 'Fenyo EM', 'Klein G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Viral/*analysis', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Epitopes', 'H-2 Antigens/analysis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Viral Proteins/immunology']",1977/12/01 00:00,1977/12/01 00:01,['1977/12/01 00:00'],"['1977/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.74.12.5270 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1977 Dec;74(12):5270-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.74.12.5270.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",PMC431679,,,,,,,,

The infectivity of ts7, determined by a focus-forming unit assay, was reduced at least 100-fold when the virus was assayed at the nonpermissive temperature (39 degrees C) as compared with assay at the permissive temperature (34 degrees C). However, several lines of evidence indicated that the diminution of ts7 titer at 39 degrees C is not due to its inability to form virus particles at that temperature. The supernatant from ts7-infected cells grown at 39 degrees C showed significant infectivity when assayed at 34 degrees C; only small reductions in reverse transcriptase activity and fusion ability were observed when compared with supernatant from 34 degrees C ts7-infected cultures. That particles are produced at the nonpermissive temperature was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy of the supernatant from ts7-infected cells at 39 degrees C and by transmission electron microscope observations of mature particles trapped in the intercellular spaces of pelleted thin cell section. A possible explanation for the productivity at 39 degrees C of particles that are infectious at 34 degrees C but not at 39 degrees C is that the virus is heat labile at the nonpermissive temperature. Consistent with this hypothesis is the extreme heat lability of virus harvested at 34 degrees C. Such virus, when incubated at 39 degrees C, has a half-life one-sixth that of identical virus incubated at 34 degrees C, or that of wild-type virus at either temperature.","['Wong, P K', 'Gallick, G E']","['Wong PK', 'Gallick GE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology/genetics/*growth & development/ultrastructure', '*Mutation', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Virus Replication']",1978/01/01 00:00,1978/01/01 00:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.25.1.187-192.1978 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1978 Jan;25(1):187-92. doi: 10.1128/JVI.25.1.187-192.1978.,['EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)'],PMC353915,,,,,,,,

Biological characterization.,146-56,"We have studied the virus produced by a clone, termed 8A, that was isolated from a culture of murine sarcoma virus-transformed mouse cells after superinfection with Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV-M). Clone 8A produced high levels of type C virus particles, but only a low titer of infectious murine sarcoma virus and almost no infectious MuLV. When fresh cultures of mouse cells were infected with undiluted clone 8A culture fluids, they released no detectable pogeny virus for several weeks after infection. Fully infectious MuLV was then produced in these cultures. This virus was indistinguishable from MuLV-M by nucleic acid hybridization tests and in its insensitivity to Fv-1 restriction. It also induced thymic lymphomas in BALB/c mice. To explain these results, we propose that cone 8A is infected with a replication-defective variant of MuLV-M. Particles produced by clone 8A, containing this defective genome, can establish an infection in fresh cells but cannot produce progency virus at detectable levels. Several weeks after infection, the defect in the viral genome is corrected by back-mutation or by recombination with endogenous viral genomes, resulting in the formation of fully infectious progeny MuLV. The progeny MuLV'S that arose in two different experiments were found to be genetically different from each other. This is consistent with the hypothesis that, in each experiment, the progeny virus is formed clone 8A cells and assayed for infectivity by the calcium phosphate transfection technique. No detectable MuLV was produced by cells treated with this DNA. This finding, along with positive results obtained in control experiments, indicates that clone 8A cells do not contain a normal MuLV provirus.","['Rein, A L', 'Gerwin, B I', 'Bassin, R H', 'Schwarm, L', 'Schidlovsky, G']","['Rein AL', 'Gerwin BI', 'Bassin RH', 'Schwarm L', 'Schidlovsky G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Cell Line', '*Genetic Variation', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology/genetics/*growth & development', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Transfection', '*Virus Replication']",1978/01/01 00:00,1978/01/01 00:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.25.1.146-156.1978 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1978 Jan;25(1):146-56. doi: 10.1128/JVI.25.1.146-156.1978.,['EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)'],PMC353911,,,,,,,,

The mink virus shared antigenic determinants with the major structural proteins of known mammalian type C viruses. Double-antibody competition radioimmunoassays were developed by utilizing the purified major structural protein, p30, of the mink endogenous virus. The virus was shown to possess antigenic determinants unique from those of other known mammalian type C viruses. It exhibited a higher degree of immunological cross-reactivity with endogenous rat type C and horizontally transmitted feline leukemia viruses than with other mammalian type C viruses tested.

In opposition to this administration technique is facile drug decomposition in aqueous formulations giving products of unknown toxicity. Analysis of 24-h-old water solutions of 5-AC with high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) indicated a threefold mixture of 5-AC, N-(formylamidino)-N'-beta-D-ribofuranosylurea (RGU-CHO), and 1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-3-guanylurea (RGU). Preparative HPLC allowed the isolation and subsequent identification of each component in the mixture, including RGU-CHO which until now has not been available for chemical and biological study. It was shown that RGU-CHO in water solution readily equilibrates to 5-AC and more slowly deformylates to give RGU irreversibly. The latter hydrolysis produce exhibited no pronounced toxicity when tested either in vitro or in vivo. Although RGU-CHO showed considerable antitumor activity against murine L1210 leukemia, hydrolysis studies indicated that all of the observed activity could be attributed to 5-AC formed by in vivo equilibration from RGU-CHO.

The reaction utilized oligo (dG) poly (rC) as a primer-template with very low efficiency. 3. The crude virus preparation had a detectable endogenous reaction using the four deoxyribonucleotides for DNA polymerization. 4. The cation requirement for the enzyme reaction was much more biased for Mn++ than for Mg++ ions. 5. The molecular weight of the partially-purified enzyme was estimated to be about 80,000. Aggregates of 240,000 daltons were also seen. The activity of this enzyme was not inhibited by antisera against the reverse transcriptases of various type C RNA viruses, namely, feline endogenous leukemia virus, RD 114, Woolly simian sarcoma virus (SSV-1) and avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV). Antiserum against Rauscher leukemia virus (RLV) enzyme was marginally active against foamy virus enzyme, perhaps indicating a slight cross-reaction.

Although it is mainly found in patients with proliferative haematological disorders, particularly acute leukaemias and chronic myelogenous leukaemia, LAA is occasionally present in sera from healthy people. In protein fractionation experiments, LAA behaves as a distinct population of molecules and has the characteristics of an alpha2-beta-globulin, not carrying any lipids. The origin of LAA in haematological disorders is unknown. Its presence does not correlate with high white blood cell count, although antibody to LAA has been raised in animals injected with blast cells from leukaemia patients. LAA is distinct from alpha-fetoprotein, and we have observed a reaction of immunological non-identity between LAA and ferritin. This is of considerable interest since ferritin has been reported to be immunologically closely related to alpha2H-globulin which may occur in the same categories of patients as LAA.

Optimal conditions for lethal glucocorticoid responses in vitro were determined for a series of human lymphoblastoid cell lines by using different glucocorticoid preparations, and steroid solvents and by varying the cell density. Kinetic studies revealed that lethal glucocorticoid effects are dose-dependent and that continuous exposure of cells to steroid is necessary for progression of lethal effects to occur. Even under optimal conditions, human lymphoblastoid cells only exhibit a marked cytolethal response to glucocorticoids at concentrations which greatly exceed both physiological and therapeutically attainable steroid levels. They are also greatly in excess of steroid levels required to saturate the cytoplasmic receptors of intact or disrupted lymphoblastoid cells. It is suggested that either lethal steroid mechanisms in vitro differ fundamentally from those in vivo or the pharmacological activity of glucocorticoids in vivo does not involve a direct cytolethal action.","['Bird, C C', 'Robertson, A M', 'Read, J', 'Currie, A R']","['Bird CC', 'Robertson AM', 'Read J', 'Currie AR']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,IM,"['*Burkitt Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Cell Count/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', '*Leukemia/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Methylprednisolone/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1977/11/01 00:00,1977/11/01 00:01,['1977/11/01 00:00'],"['1977/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/path.1711230304 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 1977 Nov;123(3):145-56. doi: 10.1002/path.1711230304.,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",,,,,,,,,

Unlike the reverse transcriptases of most mammalian C type RNA viruses, and of the ubliquitous foamy-like bovine syncytial virus, the BLV enzyme prefers magnesium rather than manganese for optimal activity. The identification of several other conditions required for optimal activity of the viral reverse transcriptase led to the development of a rapid, sensitive, semiquantitative assay, which is comparable in sensitivity to the syncytia-infectivity assay for the detection of BLV in supernatant fluids of monolayer cell cultures. However, the reverse transcriptase assay is not sufficiently reproducible for obtaining routine detection of BLV in short-term cultures of bovine peripheral blood lymphocytes.

There was a good correlation between the presence of C-particles and the demonstration of FeLV-antigen but none between IAP and FeLV antigens. No correlation was found between RD-114 virus antigens and any type of particle. Morphologically, the IAP found in feline mammary tumors were indistinguishable from the IAP present in mammary tumors of some inbred mice strains. The IAP in feline mammary tumors possibly represent an endogenous virus, different from RD-114 virus. The role of these viruses in the etiology of feline mammary tumors is discussed.","['Calafat, J', 'Weijer, K', 'Daams, H']","['Calafat J', 'Weijer K', 'Daams H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Cat Diseases/*immunology', 'Cats', 'Cell Membrane/ultrastructure', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/ultrastructure', 'Epitopes', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*immunology', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/immunology/ultrastructure/*veterinary', 'Retroviridae/*immunology']",1977/11/15 00:00,1977/11/15 00:01,['1977/11/15 00:00'],"['1977/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1977/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910200516 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1977 Nov 15;20(5):759-67. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910200516.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)']",,,,,,,,,

This factor specifically cleaves P70, the gag precursor polyprotein which is enriched for in preparations of immature virus core subparticles. The factor has been partially purified on Sephadex G-75 columns. It has a molecular weight of 10,000-12,000 daltons but does not coincide in elution position with the major peaks of the viral polypeptides p10 or p12. Under optimal conditions, that is 2% NP-40 (v/v), 10 mM DTT, (pH 7.2) and incubation for 16 hr at 22 degrees C, cleavage of labeled P70 occurs and increasing amounts of the four gag polypeptides p30, p15, p12 and p10 are obtained. The P70 cleavage activity is blocked by TLCK, TAME, CBZ-lysine and other lysyl-containing protease inhibitors. Further, the CBZ-lysine inhibition is reversible, while an inhibition by phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) is irreversible. These inhibition studies suggest that a similarity exists between the P70 proteolytic factor and some serine proteases, such as trypsin. The cleavage pattern of P70-rich immature cores treated with trypsin or chymotrypsin is different from that obtained with the P70 proteolytic factor. Thus murine leukemia virions apparently contain a unique, highly specific protease which is present in small amounts and cleaves P70.","['Yoshinaka, Y', 'Luftig, R B']","['Yoshinaka Y', 'Luftig RB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,IM,"['Epitopes', 'Molecular Weight', '*Peptide Hydrolases/analysis/metabolism', 'Peptides/immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Precursors/immunology/metabolism', 'Rauscher Virus/*enzymology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Viral Proteins/immunology/metabolism']",1977/11/01 00:00,1977/11/01 00:01,['1977/11/01 00:00'],"['1977/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(77)90271-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(77)90271-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1977 Nov;12(3):709-19. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(77)90271-9.,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",,,,,,,,,

To assess the role of genomic RNA in encapsidation of a functional reverse transcriptase and to study the interaction of the enzyme and its template in the cores of intact virions, the reverse transcriptase enzymes of normal and Act D virions were compared. The enzymes were indistinguishable by column chromatography, sedimentation velocity, or template/primer preferences. In addition, these enzymes showed equal sensitivity to inactivation by antibodies directed against Rauscher murine leukemia virus DNA polymerase. The enzymes from Act D and normal virions had similar thermal decay rates and were both protected against heat denaturation by natural and synthetic template/primers. By these criteria, the DNA polymerase molecules synthesized and assembled into virions in the absence of genomic RNA are identical to those packaged under normal conditions. Additional studies designed to measure protection of reverse transcriptase by genomic RNA were carried out by comparing the thermal lability of the enzyme in intact Act D and normal virions. The thermal decay rate of reverse transcriptase in Act D virions was identical to that in control virions.

However lymphoblasts from 4 cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia and neoplastic lymphoid cells from 2 cases of B-cell lymphoma stimulated better than they responded to allogeneic lymphocytes. The data suggest the possibility that lymphoblasts without receptors of E-rosettes and surface membrane immunoglobulin may contain B-cell antigens which crossreact with HLA antisera and vigorously stimulate allogeneic lymphocytes.","['Huntington, S J', 'Davey, F R']","['Huntington SJ', 'Davey FR']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,IM,"['Absorption', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Epitopes', '*HLA Antigens', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Rosette Formation']",1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1977;16:91-102.,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,

This was apparent by fluorescent staining with both human alloantisera and rabbit antisera to the isolated Ia-like proteins. The cells of patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia showed this difference especially clearly. Separation of the myeloblasts and promyelocytes by multistep density gradient fractionation produced a marked enrichment of the positive cells. The remaining cells from higher density fractions were more-mature neutrophils that were essentially negative. In acute myeloid leukemia, in which myeloid cells early in differentiation predominate, the vast majority of cells were strongly positive. Similar results were obtained with normal bone marrow cells. Here also, only the early forms of the myeloid series separated by gradient centrifugation had Ia antigens. Evidence was also obtained for the presence of Ia determinants on cells with the appearance of early erythroid precursors. Support for the presence of the Ia determinants on granulocyte-macrophage committed stem cells was provided by the inhibition of granulocyte colony formation in agar cultures following preincubation of normal bone marrow with antiserum and complement. Cross absorptions with purified preparations of immature cells provided evidence for the close similarity of the antigenic determinants on both myeloblasts and B cells. A 28,000-37,000-dalton bimolecular complex obtained from myeloblast membranes contained the Ia determinants and was similar to that obtained from peripheral blood B cell membranes.","['Winchester, R J', 'Ross, G D', 'Jarowski, C I', 'Wang, C Y', 'Halper, J', 'Broxmeyer, H E']","['Winchester RJ', 'Ross GD', 'Jarowski CI', 'Wang CY', 'Halper J', 'Broxmeyer HE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', '*Epitopes', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Granulocytes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Leukocytes/*immunology']",1977/09/01 00:00,1977/09/01 00:01,['1977/09/01 00:00'],"['1977/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.74.9.4012 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1977 Sep;74(9):4012-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.74.9.4012.,['0 (Epitopes)'],PMC431823,,,,,,,,

Several human lymphoblastoid cell lines were investigated as potential effector cells. The most promising (Raji cells) bound to antibody-coated target cells but caused only modest levels of ADCC at 25:1 effector-to-target cell ratio with substantial lysis in the absence of antiserum. Human peripheral lymphocytes were active as effector cells in ADCC at a 5:1 ratio and produced no lysis in the absence of antibody. These cells were used to demonstrate that high dilutions of rabbit antisera to MuLV antigens p30, p15, p12, and p10 were capable of mediating lysis of MuLV-producing target cells but not of a virus-negative murine cell line. A murine antiserum to Thy 1.2 and three caprine antisera to MuLV antigens that were active in complement-mediated cytotoxicity functioned poorly in inducing ADCC; however, rabbit antisera to similar antigens were 16- to 512-fold more efficient in cell-mediated than in complement lysis. The inefficiency of goat antisera was not due to shedding of cell surface antigens or generation of blocking factors but rather to lack of lytic interaction of antibody-coated targets with the effector cells.","['Peters, C J', 'Theofilopoulos, A N']","['Peters CJ', 'Theofilopoulos AN']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', '*Antibody Specificity', '*Antigens, Viral', 'Cell Line', 'Complement System Proteins/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Epitopes', 'Goats', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/pharmacology', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NZB', 'Rabbits', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology']",1977/09/01 00:00,1977/09/01 00:01,['1977/09/01 00:00'],"['1977/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1977 Sep;119(3):1089-96.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,

Four main findings are reported. First, thymuses of 14-day-old CBA and AKR embryos could be maintained in organ cultures for at least 9 weeks with sustained production of lymphocytes. Lymphopoiesis in CBA and AKR thymuses were not grossly different. Secondly, an indirect immunofluorescence (IF) technique demonstrated spontaneous appearance of MuLV-antigen-containing cells in AKR, but not in CBA thymuses. Such spontaneous MuLV expression first occurred after 16 days of organ culture, thereafter infrequently and at random in individual thymus cultures. Thirdly, incubation of AKR and CBA thymuses in lymphoma extract containing AKR-type MuLV at initiation of organ cultures induced MuLV-antigen-containing cells. These were first detected after 7-14 days in culture, somewhat earlier and initially more frequently in AKR than in CBA thymuses. In the former, induction was accompanied by a clear reduction in the number of lymphocytes per thymus. Fourthly, iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd) treatment of AKR thymuses on cultute day 0, 3 or 7 decreased the number of lymphocytes per thymus and induced appearance of MuLV-antigen containing cells, assayed 8-20 days later. The IdUrd effect was most marked on day 0, and decreased sucessively on days 3 and 7. IdUrd had a much slighter effect on CBA thymuses, causing a lower reduction in cell numbers and inducing few MuLV-antigen cells. These main results clearly demonstrate the potential usefulness of the organ culture system for studied on leukemogenesis. It may be directly applied to answer several questions raised by detailed findings in our study.","['Riesenfeld, I', 'Alm, G V']","['Riesenfeld I', 'Alm GV']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, Viral', 'Epitopes', 'Idoxuridine/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Thymus Gland/embryology/*immunology']",1977/08/15 00:00,1977/08/15 00:01,['1977/08/15 00:00'],"['1977/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1977/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910200221 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1977 Aug 15;20(2):309-17. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910200221.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', 'LGP81V5245 (Idoxuridine)']",,,,,,,,,

NALM-1 resembled the parent cells in the presence of Philadelphia chromosome, non-T/non-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia specific antigens and lack of T or B cell markers, whereas BALB-2, like the parent cells, had two chromosome markers and bore kappa, delta and mu immunoglobulins. NALM-1 lacked Epstein-Barr virus genome, whereas BALM-2 showed the presence of Epstein-Barr virus genome. K-562 cells lacked all the antigen markers examined. All cells had high DNA polymerase alpha activity and low DNA polymerase gamma activity. NALM-1, like the parent cells and unlike K-562 cells, had high terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase activity of about 200 mu/mg DNA, whereas BALM-2, like its parent cells, had terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase activity of 1-2 mu/mg DNA (1 u = 1 nmole Mn++-dGTP/h on dA12-18 initiator). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was characterized by its chromatographic and sedimentation behavior, thermal sensitivity and specific inhibition by streptolydigin and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase antisera.

It was found that L(2)C leukemic lymphoblasts, leukemic spleen, and BUdR-induced virus-producing cells contain virus-specific RNA: 0.05% (800 to 960 copies per cell), 0.02% (360 copies per cell), and 0.3% (5,120 copies per cell), respectively.

Both BUdR-induced cells and L(2)C leukemic lymphoblasts contained 14S, 22S, 35S, and 70S RNA species of total and cytoplasmic virus-specific RNA as determined by sucrose velocity gradient analysis and hybridization of sucrose gradient fractions to cDNA. Virus-specific mRNA was identified in both BUdR-induced cells and L(2)C leukemic lymphoblasts by the criterion that it cosedimented with purified polyribosomes in a sucrose gradient and that it changed to a lower sedimentation value if polyribosomes were disaggregated with EDTA prior to centrifugation. Virus-specific mRNA obtained from either the polyribosome region of purified polyribosomes or the released messenger region of EDTA-disaggregated purified polyribosomes consisted of 14S, 20S, and 35S species in both BUdR-induced cells and L(2)C leukemic lymphoblasts.

In this study virion P60 was shown to contain murine pp12, to be phosphorylated, and to bind to nucleic acids. 32P-labeled m1MSV[FeLV) was fractionated by guanidine agarose chromatography and analyzed by gel electrophoresis.

Moreover, P60 from cytoplasmic extracts was retained on single-stranded DNA-Sepharose columns, demonstrating that cellular P60 binds to DNA.","['Oskarsson, M K', 'Long, C W', 'Robey, W G', 'Scherer, M A', 'Vande Woude, G F']","['Oskarsson MK', 'Long CW', 'Robey WG', 'Scherer MA', 'Vande Woude GF']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/metabolism', 'Epitopes', 'Gammaretrovirus/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis/immunology', 'Phosphorus/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA/*metabolism', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/analysis/immunology/*metabolism', 'Serine/analysis', 'Threonine/analysis', 'Viral Proteins/analysis/immunology/*metabolism']",1977/07/01 00:00,1977/07/01 00:01,['1977/07/01 00:00'],"['1977/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.23.1.196-204.1977 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1977 Jul;23(1):196-204. doi: 10.1128/JVI.23.1.196-204.1977.,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '27YLU75U4W (Phosphorus)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",PMC515815,,,,,,,,

Polypeptides of similar size were also produced by limited proteolysis of purified gp69/71; these degradation fragments were shown to contain carbohydrate by the incorporation of (3)H from sodium boro[(3)H]hydride after neuraminidase and galactose oxidase treatment. Each of these glycoproteins was isolated by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was analyzed by tryptic peptide mapping. The major virion components of 69,000 and 71,000 daltons were nearly identical, as were the primary degradation fragments. Analysis of the immunological properties of the glycoproteins showed that the 71,000-, 69,000-, and 32,000-dalton glycoproteins behaved similarly with respect to type and group-specific antigenic determinants. In contrast, the 45,000-dalton glycoprotein lacked detectable interspecies and some of the group-specific reactivity. Components of about 45,000 and 32,000 daltons isolated directly from virions were also identified as constituents of the major envelope glycoprotein by immune precipitation and tryptic peptide mapping. These results indicate that all of the examined virion glycoproteins of approximately 71,000, 69,000, 45,000, and 32,000 daltons are derived from the same viral gene and that these lower-molecular-weight glycoproteins can readily be produced from the major envelope glycoprotein.","['Krantz, M J', 'Strand, M', 'August, J T']","['Krantz MJ', 'Strand M', 'August JT']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Carbohydrates/analysis', 'Epitopes', 'Gammaretrovirus/analysis/immunology', 'Glycoproteins/*analysis/immunology/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptides/analysis', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Rauscher Virus/*analysis/immunology/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/*analysis/immunology/metabolism']",1977/06/01 00:00,1977/06/01 00:01,['1977/06/01 00:00'],"['1977/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.22.3.804-815.1977 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1977 Jun;22(3):804-15. doi: 10.1128/JVI.22.3.804-815.1977.,"['0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",PMC515779,,,,,,,,

Secondary allogeneic mixed tumor lymphocyte culture of normal murine spleen cells.,468-82,"In vivo or in vitro immunity to murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-induced leukemia cells which do not effectively produce virus, has been difficult to demonstrate. Because immunizations with allogeneic murine leukemia cells have been used to confer syngeneic tumor immunity to virus- producing cells, we attempted to generate lymphocytes, cytotoxic to syngeneic nonproducer leukemia cells, by stimulating normal murine spleen cells with allogeneic nonproducer leukemia cells in mixed tumor lymphocyte culture (MTLC) reactions in vitro. Secondary allogeneic MTLC of normal C57BL/6 or DBA/2 spleen cells effectively produced syngeneic tumor-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes. Target cells lysed in lymphocyte- mediated cytolysis (LMC) assays, included both Friend and Rauscher virus- induced syngeneic murine leukemia cells and chemically-induced hematopoietic tumor cells. Syngeneic tumor cells were lysed regardless of whether they produced infectious MuLV or expressed viral antigens gp-71, p-30, or p-12 at the cell surface. Syngeneic normal cells (thymus, lymph node, or Concanavalin A-stimulated spleen cells) used as targets in LMC assays were uneffected by lymphocytes harvested from secondary allogeneic MTLC. Several other in vitro culture treatments including secondary syngeneic MTLC and repetitive mixed lymphocyte culture stimulations were incapable of generating tumor-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes. Based upon these results, we propose that secondary MTLC stimulation of normal spleen cells with allogeneic nonproducer leukemia cells selects for the proliferation of two subpopulations of antigen-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes. The population capable of effecting syngeneic tumor cell lysis is directed against tumor-associated cell surface antigens which may be distinct from viral structural proteins or glycoproteins. The growth of these tumor-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes may be enhanced by a soluble allogeneic effect factor produced by the proliferation of the second subpopulation of lymphocytes generated in repetitive allogeneic MTLC, namely those lymphocytes with specificities directed against differing histocompatibility antigens.","['Gillis, S', 'Smith, K A']","['Gillis S', 'Smith KA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Epitopes', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Spleen/immunology']",1977/08/01 00:00,1977/08/01 00:01,['1977/08/01 00:00'],"['1977/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.146.2.468 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1977 Aug 1;146(2):468-82. doi: 10.1084/jem.146.2.468.,"['0 (Epitopes)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",PMC2180756,,,,,,,,

Measurements in the cytopherometer were facilitated by using devitalized sheep erythrocytes as indicator particles instead of macrophages. A significant decrease in EM was found in 29/30 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and in 67/75 children with solid tumours, thus giving a false negative rate in malignant disease of 9/105=8-6%, as compared to 6 false positives among 45 children with non-malignant disorders; 5 of the later ""false/positive"" 6 patients had autoimmune disease. Results of the EM test in the children with leukaemia were compared with those in 9 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 2 with Hodgkin's disease at different stages, but no striking change was seen between different diseases, or after cessation of long-term immunosuppressive chemotherapy. Percentage of ""slowing"" ranged from 4 to 30%.

The polymerase of Rauscher mouse leukemia virus was purified by ion exchange and sequential affinity chromatography. Radioimmunoassays that utilized the viral enzyme as a probe detected as little as 1 ng of purified polymerase. No cross-reactivity could be demonstrated between the reverse transcriptase and other known virus-coded proteins. By comparing the immunological reactivity of the purified enzyme with the reactivity of detergent-disrupted virions, Rauscher mouse leukemia virus was shown to contain the antigenic equivalent of 40 molecules of reverse transcriptase. In a homologous competition immunoassay, the Rauscher viral enzyme demonstrated type-specific antigenic determinants, which distinguish it from other mouse type C viral polymerases. In a broadly reactive interspecies immunoassay, the reverse transcriptases of a number of mammalian type C viruses were cross-reactive, indicating their shared antigenic determinants. Various treatments that inhibit or inactivated DNA polymerase activity had little or no effect on the immunological properties of the enzyme. Thus, radioimmunoassays should be useful in the search for type C viral reverse transcriptase as a marker of subviral expression.","['Krakower, J M', 'Barbacid, M', 'Aaronson, S A']","['Krakower JM', 'Barbacid M', 'Aaronson SA']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Cross Reactions', 'Epitopes', '*RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/immunology/isolation & purification', '*Radioimmunoassay', 'Rauscher Virus/*enzymology', 'Retroviridae/*enzymology']",1977/05/01 00:00,1977/05/01 00:01,['1977/05/01 00:00'],"['1977/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.22.2.331-339.1977 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1977 May;22(2):331-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.22.2.331-339.1977.,"['0 (Epitopes)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",PMC515723,,,,,,,,

II. cytotoxic activity in vitro and tumor-neutralizing capacity in vivo of anti-leukemia cytotoxic lymphocytes generated in macrocultures.,39-58,"The main findings of the present study are: (a) highly reactive cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL) against syngeneic and allogeneic murine leukemia cells were generated in vitro in macro 'one-way' mixed leukocyte-tumor cultures (MLTC). Cultures set up in large tissue culture flasks contained up to 400 X 10(6) normal spleen cells (responder cells) and 20--40 X (10(6) mitomycin C-treated leukemia cells (stimulator cells). Successful sensitization in macrocultures was greatly dependent upon the responder cell density and the responder/stimulator cell ratio. Cytotoxic activity, as measured by the 51Cr-release assay, peaked on day 5--7. (b) Sensitized 'memory' lymphocytes produced in primary MLTC could be restimulated with the original tumor cells to give a more rapid and stronger secondary cytotoxic response. (c) lymphocytes sensitized to allogeneic leukemia cells reacted equally well with sensitizing leukemia cells and with the corresponding normal lymphoid target cells, whereas lymphocytes sensitized to syngeneic leukemia cells did not react with the homologous normal lymphocytes. (d) Cryopreserved normal splenocytes and leukemia cells were as efficient as fresh cells in generating allogeneic and syngeneic CTL.

Culture fluids, collected at the same time periods, were also assayed for reverse transcriptase activities. We found that minimally infected cultures expressed virus proteins within 9 days postinfection regardless of method used. Although p27 RIA was consistently more sensitive than CF or reverse transcriptase assays, sensitivity was only two- to fivefold greater when concentrated suspensions of RAV-0, RAV-1, and RAV-2 were compared. In terms of infectious units, the lowest detectable virus titer was 6 X 10(3) infectious units as determined by RIA end point dilutions.

The material comprises 42 patients subjected to the operation in the course of the past 20 years. In the majority the spleen weighed more than 1000 g. The main indication for splenectomy was anaemia, while in 9 cases it was thrombocytopenia and in 14 cases hypercatabolism. Splenectomy is followed by a pronounced increase in the venous haemoglobin level and platelet count to higher values which have been recorded for up to 3 years after the procedure. In cases where data were available, there has been weight gain and a falling basal metabolic rate. Splenectomy is effective especially in cases predominated exclusively by splenomegaly, but even in cases with marked extrasplenic manifestations, splenectomy often greatly reduces the need for prednisone and cytostatics. Increasing hepatomegaly and lymphomas were not more common after splenectomy than in a control series, and the incidence of infections was not increased after the operation. For comparison, 37 non-splenectomised patients with splenomegaly were assessed. X-radiation of the spleen seems to be insufficient, since usually it has to be repeated. Splenomegaly does not decrease spontaneously and rarely after treatment with prednisone/cytostatics. The findings indicate that splenectomy of patients with CLL and increasing splenomegaly should be performed more often and presumably also earlier than recommended in the literature.","['Christensen, B E', 'Hansen, M M', 'Videbaek, A']","['Christensen BE', 'Hansen MM', 'Videbaek A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Aged', 'Anemia/etiology', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Blood Platelets', 'Body Weight', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organ Size', 'Postoperative Complications/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Splenectomy/mortality', 'Splenomegaly/surgery', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology', 'Uric Acid/blood', 'gamma-Globulins/analysis']",1977/04/01 00:00,1977/04/01 00:01,['1977/04/01 00:00'],"['1977/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1977.tb01197.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1977 Apr;18(4):279-87. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1977.tb01197.x.,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (gamma-Globulins)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)']",,,,,,,,,

The maximum activity of T cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) induced with 2-ME was observed on day 4 of culture and the induction of CMC was completely inhibited by the addition of inhibitor of DNA synthesis, hydroxyurea, or cytosin arabinoside. CMC induced with 2-ME was specifically inhibited by the addition of unlabeled target cells to the 51Cr-release assay system. These results indicated that killer T cells were generated in the presence of 2-ME as a result of nonspecific polyclonal activation of precursors into cytotoxic effector cells and that they recognized target cells with antigen-specific recognition receptors. Spleen cells deprived of adherent cells showed impaired induction of CMC with 2-ME. The addition of peritoneal exudate macrophages to splenic T cells restored this response. The result indicated that macrophages were essential for the induction of CMC with 2-ME. The possibility that the function of macrophages was mediated by soluble factor(s) released from macrophages was demonstrated by the separate culture of splenic T cells and macrophages in double-chambered, Marbrook-type vessels and by the addition of supernatants from macrophage cultures to splenic T cells. 2-ME and soluble factor(s) released from macrophages seemed to be required for the activation of precursors into killer cells.","['Igarashi, T', 'Okada, M', 'Kishimoto, T', 'Yamamura, Y']","['Igarashi T', 'Okada M', 'Kishimoto T', 'Yamamura Y']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Epitopes', 'Female', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Immunity, Cellular/*drug effects', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/immunology', 'Mercaptoethanol/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology', 'Plasmacytoma/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology']",1977/05/01 00:00,1977/05/01 00:01,['1977/05/01 00:00'],"['1977/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1977 May;118(5):1697-703.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '60-24-2 (Mercaptoethanol)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,,,,,

HB antiserum also reacted with 5 to 10% of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Absorption with neuroblasts did not alt-r this reactivity. Rabbit antisera raised against normal human thymocytes and leukemic T-cells specifically bound to thymocytes but did not bind to neuroblasts. The reactivity of anti-HB serum against SK-N-SH neuroblasts was removed by absorption with HB, but not with human kidney or liver, or mouse and guinea pig brain. We conclude that human neuroblastoma cells possess cell-surface antigens that are present on HB. These antigens appear to be species specific and are not present on normal or malignant thymic cells. Conversely, thymus-associated antigens are not expressed on neuroblasts.","['Casper, J T', 'Borella, L', 'Sen, L']","['Casper JT', 'Borella L', 'Sen L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['*Antibodies', 'Antibody Specificity', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Brain/*immunology', 'Brain Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Epitopes', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Neuroblastoma/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1977/06/01 00:00,1977/06/01 00:01,['1977/06/01 00:00'],"['1977/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1977 Jun;37(6):1750-6.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)']",,,,,,,,,

Both viruses are endogenous to M. cervicolor and are present in multiple copies in the cellular DNA of these mice. One of the viruses, designated M. cervicolor type CI, replicates readily in the SIRC rabbit cell line and is antigenically related to the infectious primate type C viruses isolated from a woolly monkey (simian sarcoma-associated virus) and gibbon apes (gibbon ape leukemia virus). This virus is also closely related by both immunological and nucleic acid hybridization criteria to a type C virus previously isolated from a second Asian murine species, Mus caroli. The isolation of the M. cervicolor type C I virus thus provides further evidence that the infectious primate type C viruses originated by trans-species infection of primates by an endogenous virus of mice. The second virus, designated M. cervicolor type C II, replicates well in various cell lines derived from the laboratory mouse Mus musculus. While antigenically related to type C viruses derived from M. musculus, the M. cervicolor type C II virus isolate can be readily distinguished from standard murine leukemia viruses. Both new type C viruses from M. cervicolor are unrelated to the previously described retrovirus (M432) isolated from the same Mus species. The DNA of M. cervicolor therefore contains multiple copies of at least three distinct classes of endogenous viral genes. An examination of the cellular DNA of other rodent species for nucleic acid sequences related to the genomes of both M. cervicolor type C I and II reveals that both viruses have been highly conserved evolutionarily, and that other species of rodents, such as laboratory mice and rats, contain endogenous virogenes related to those in the DNA of M. cervicolor.","['Benveniste, R E', 'Callahan, R', 'Sherr, C J', 'Chapman, V', 'Todaro, G J']","['Benveniste RE', 'Callahan R', 'Sherr CJ', 'Chapman V', 'Todaro GJ']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Asia, Southeastern', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Evolution', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/analysis', 'Epitopes', 'Lung', 'Mammals', 'Mice/*microbiology', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/immunology/metabolism', '*Retroviridae/analysis/enzymology/isolation & purification', 'Species Specificity']",1977/03/01 00:00,1977/03/01 00:01,['1977/03/01 00:00'],"['1977/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.21.3.849-862.1977 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1977 Mar;21(3):849-62. doi: 10.1128/JVI.21.3.849-862.1977.,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",PMC515622,,,,,,,,

The late MSV tumor response in F1 hybrids depended on the genetic background of the non-AKR parent. Within the 4-month observation period following virus injection, (CBA X AKR) F1, (DBA/2 X AKR)F1, and (NIH X AKR)F1 developed progressing MSV tumors, which exhibited latency and growth behavior comparable to that seen in AKR mice, (BALB X AKR)F1, (B6 X AKR)F1, and (B10br x akr)f1 mice did not show any late MSV tumors. In contrast to early regressing M-MSV tumors, whose development is independent of Fv-1 genotype, late MSV tumor progression is largely a function of this gene, since all late tumors which appeared in (B10BR x AKR) x AKR were observed in Fv-1n homozygous mice, H-2k halotype is a further factor in the occurrence of late MSV tumors, at least in (B6 x AKR) x AKR mice. In crosses of AKR with Fv-1 compatible mice, tumor appearance was strongly associated with inheritance of AKR-Mulv, and MSV recovered from late tumors of first back-cross animals appeared to be a new pseudotype with the endogenous AKR-MuLV. It is suggested that the host genetic control in both early and late MSV tumors is exerted mainly on the helper component of the leukemia-sarcoma complex.","['Colombatti, A', 'Chieco-Bianchi, L', 'De Rossi, A', ""D'Andrea, E"", 'Collavo, D']","['Colombatti A', 'Chieco-Bianchi L', 'De Rossi A', ""D'Andrea E"", 'Collavo D']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antigens, Viral', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Epitopes', '*Gammaretrovirus', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hybridization, Genetic', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', '*Sarcoma Viruses, Murine', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*genetics/immunology']",1977/04/15 00:00,1977/04/15 00:01,['1977/04/15 00:00'],"['1977/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1977/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910190418 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1977 Apr 15;19(4):565-75. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910190418.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)']",,,,,,,,,

In some instances T1ALD thymic cells were added to the restorative inoculum. It was possible to determine the origin of the leukemic cells by the metacentric marker chromosomes of T1ALD. The T- or B-cell characteristics were further ascertained by the cytotoxicity test for theta antigen and the EAC rosette test. All leukaemias whether thymic (TLS) or extra-thymic (ETL), developed from donor bone-marrow or spleen cells and never from the injected thymic cells. In non-thymectomized animals BNU increased the percentage of TLS and shortened their latency. Most of TLS which occurred after BNU treatment of BM-restored mice were theta-negative whereas the majority of TLS which occurred in controls and in spleen-restored animals were theta-positive. This suggests that during their maturation process BM-derived T precursors transit through a theta-negative compartment. This compartment does not reach a similar size during the maturation process of the spleen-derived precursors. Adding thymic cells to the restorative inoculum enhanced leukaemogenesis and suppressed theta-negative TLS in BM-restored mice. Thymectomized mice, restored either by BM or spleen, had a low incidence of ETL which was not significantly increased by BNU treatment except in the case of mice restored with spleen cells. The leukaemic cells of one ETL were theta-positive whereas all the other leukaemias had no detectable T or B marker. The percentage of ETL was higher in thymectomized mice treated with BNU alone than in those previously subjected to irradiation and restoration. These results strongly suggest that a theta-negative T precursor could be involved in extra-thymic leukaemogenesis but the possible involvement of a B precursor cannot be rule out unless experiments are carried out with specific markers of T- and B-cell sub-classes.","['Shisa, H', 'Legrand, E', 'Daculsi, R']","['Shisa H', 'Legrand E', 'Daculsi R']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Epitopes', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*chemically induced/genetics/immunology', '*Leukemia, Radiation-Induced', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', '*Nitrosourea Compounds', 'Spleen/transplantation', 'Thymectomy', 'Thymus Gland/*immunology']",1977/04/15 00:00,1977/04/15 00:01,['1977/04/15 00:00'],"['1977/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1977/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910190414 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1977 Apr 15;19(4):531-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910190414.,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)']",,,,,,,,,

Antisera against iAp, MTV-B particles, B particle polypeptide p27 and glycoprotein gp52, and leukemia C-type particles were used in these studies. The most prominent antigen of iAp in mammary tumours was found to be identical to the p27 antigen of B particles. This finding was not unexpected in view of recently published data by other authors showing the presence of p27 in iAp of leukemia cells and Leydig cell tumours. The p27 polypeptide is considered to be a group-specific antigen of mouse mammary tumour viruses associated with iAp of different tissue sources and inner structural components of mature B particles. On the other hand, the gp52 antigen and leukemia virus antigens were shown to be absent from iAp of mammary carcinomas. Therefore, the assumption is confirmed that the gp52 glycoprotein represents a group-specific antigen of B type viruses, presumably located at the virion surface. The failure to demonstrate leukemia virus antigens in iAp supports the suggestion that this kind of particles is not related to C type viruses.","['Zotter, S', 'Kryukowa, I N', 'Bukrinskaya, A G', 'Lezhnewa, O M', 'Ilyin, K V', 'Miller, G G', 'Muller, M']","['Zotter S', 'Kryukowa IN', 'Bukrinskaya AG', 'Lezhnewa OM', 'Ilyin KV', 'Miller GG', 'Muller M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Arch Geschwulstforsch,Archiv fur Geschwulstforschung,0372411,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/*analysis', 'Cytoplasm/microbiology', 'Epitopes', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Immunodiffusion', '*Inclusion Bodies, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae/*immunology']",1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Geschwulstforsch. 1976;46(8):621-9.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)']",,,,,,,,,

The amount of viral 60-70S RNA released from DMSO-treated cells was unaffected or increased compared to that from control cells, while RT activity from treated cells was decreased. Accordingly, the specific activity in F-MuLV from DMSO-treated cells expressed as RT/70S RNA was decreased to 8% of the control activity. The 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine added to cultures containing DMSO reversed the differentiation process, and the F-MuLV thus treated did not exhibit the reduced RT activity normally observed in DMSO-treated virus. Cell-free F-MuLV incubated with and without DMSO showed the same RT activity, indicating that DMSO itself did not inhibit RT activity. However, when F-MuLV-containing pellets from control and DMSO-treated culture fluids were mixed, there was marked inhibition of the control RT activity, suggesting that RNase hybrid activity was stimulated or that an inhibitor was produced. Assays of F-MuLV-RNase hybrid released from control and DMSO-treated cells showed no difference in activity, indicating that a specific inhibitor of RT was produced or activated. Additions of certain nucleotide triphosphates to RT incubation mixtures did not result in any stimulation of RT activity in DMSO-treated F-MuLV, suggesting that phosphatase was not responsible for the observed inhibition. The results suggested that DMSO treatment of T3-C12 cells caused a reduction in viral RT activity by stimulating the production of an inhibitor, the nature of which is unknown.","['Ebert, P S', 'Buell, D N']","['Ebert PS', 'Buell DN']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology/etiology/metabolism/pathology', '*Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors', 'Virus Replication']",1977/03/01 00:00,1977/03/01 00:01,['1977/03/01 00:00'],"['1977/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/58.3.635 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1977 Mar;58(3):635-40. doi: 10.1093/jnci/58.3.635.,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,

Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) studies showed that the proportion of early budding virions, which have shallow crescent-shaped ribonucleoprotein cores (Figure 3A), to virions in later stages of assembly (Figures 3B-3D) is relatively higher in interferon-treated cells than in the untreated controls. From a temperature shift-down experiment on a temperature-sensitive mutant of MuLV, ts 3, which produces viral particles that fail to dissociate from the cell surface at the nonpermissive temperature, we demonstrated that ts 3 virions partially assembled on the cell membrane prior to the addition of interferon are able to complete assembly and to dissociate from the cell membrane on temperature shift-down in the presence of interferon action. Our data suggest that interferon neither inhibits the late stages of virion assembly at which ts 3 virions are arrested at the nonpermissive temperature nor prevents release of the virions.

It is now shown that p60 is detected in cells of five mammalian species transformed by m1MSV, indicating that p60 is specified by this genome. Moreover, little or no murine p30 is detected in the m1MSV-transformed cells, suggesting that the murine group p30 antigenic reactivity of S + L- cells is ude to p60. Pulse-chase studies in cells producing m1MSV(FeLV) show that p60 is the largest polypeptide detectable during the pulse, and that intracellular p60 is not cleaved into smaller (for example, p30) polypeptides during chase periods of up to 10 hr. The lack of cleavage of p60 is in contrast to the properties of p30 precursors detected in cells containing replicating avian or mammalian RNA tumor viruses. The inefficient cleavage of intracellular p60 and the kinetics of appearance of murine p30 in extracellular m1MSV(FeLV) suggest that p60 cleavage to p30 occurs in cells shortly before virus release. While only p60 was detected in the m1MSV-transformed cells, p60 and p70 were detected in m3MSV-transformed cells, and no immunoprecipitable polypeptides were detected in HT-1 MSV-transformed cells.

The results also demonstrated that removal of approximately 70% of the carbohydrate portion of gp71 with a preparation of glycosidases did not affect the integrity of its interspecies determinant; these results are in agreement with an earlier study (Bolgnesi et al., 1975) that examined primarily the group- and type-specific sites.","['Collins, J J', 'Bolio, L D', 'Denny, T P', 'Bolognesi, D P']","['Collins JJ', 'Bolio LD', 'Denny TP', 'Bolognesi DP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', '*Epitopes', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Goats/immunology', 'Immune Sera', 'Mice', 'Viral Proteins/immunology']",1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.21.1.113-118.1977 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1977 Jan;21(1):113-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.21.1.113-118.1977.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",PMC353796,,,,,,,,

These B-lymphocyte antigens were detected by 34 human alloantisera that were repeatedly absorbed with pooled platelets to remove all activity against HLA antigens and T-lymphocytes. Absorption studies indicated that a common antigen was present on both B-lymphocytes and positive leukemia cells. Leukemia cells could be subdivided into two groups based on the presence of the B-lymphocyte antigen. Fourteen of 18 acute myelocytic leukemia cells, 10 of 13 acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, 4 of 6 chronic myelocytic leukemia cells, and 2 of 2 chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells were positive. This group of leukemia cells also reacted with rabbit anti-B-cell sera raised to papain digests of spleen cell membranes. F(ab')2 fragments of the rabbit antsera were shown to specifically block the reactions of the human antisera against B-cells and leukemia cells. These results suggested that the rabbit and human anti-B-cell sera were reacting with identical molecules.

The purified enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 70,000 and appears to consist of a single polypeptide chain. The enzyme is free of DNase, but has RNase H activity. Analysis of the requirements for optimal rates of DNA synthesis by this enzyme using synthetic and natural template-primers has revealed template-specific variations in such requirements. During these studies it was observed that DNA synthesis catalyzed by Rauscher leukemia virus DNA polymerase is inhibited by the addition of inorganic phosphate. An analysis of the mechanism of phosphate inhibition was carried out using the synthetic template-primer poly(A)-(dT)10. It appears that by some mechanism, possibly involving the substrate binding site of the enzyme, phosphate ions inhibit DNA synthesis with a more acute effect on the rate of chain growth than on that of initiation. The extension of these studies to DNA synthesis catalyzed by a variety of mammalian type C viral reverse transcriptases revealed that low levels ( less than or equal to 2 mM) of inorganic phosphate strongly inhibited DNA synthesis. The susceptibility to phosphate inhibition appears unique to mammalian type C viral enzymes since the type B viral enzyme, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, avian myeloblastosis virus and Mason Pfizer monkey tumor virus reverse transcriptase and cellular DNA polymerases alpha and gamma are not inhibited by inorganic phosphate. This phenomenon of phosphate inhibition of various DNA polymerases, therefore, provides a new basis for the differentiation of the sources and nature of these enzymes.","['Modak, M J', 'Marcus, S L']","['Modak MJ', 'Marcus SL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Chromatography, Affinity', '*DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Manganese/pharmacology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphates/*pharmacology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Rauscher Virus/*enzymology', '*Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors', 'Species Specificity', 'Templates, Genetic']",1977/01/10 00:00,1977/01/10 00:01,['1977/01/10 00:00'],"['1977/01/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/10 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)32792-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1977 Jan 10;252(1):11-9.,"['0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",,,,,,,,,

By means of cytological and impulse-cytophotometrical investigations the exogenous alkalization of both forms of leukaemia could be proved to have a direct bearing on the proliferative kinetics. In TAL leukaemia the leukaemic proliferation was inhibited by the exogenously involved correction of the acid-base balance; in the L-1210 leukaemia, however, the pH disturbances were enhanced, thus accelerating the leukaemic proliferation.

Rauscher Leukemia Virus (RLV) exhibits a slight but reproducible relatednesse to BLV. The high preference of BLV reverse transcriptase for Mg++ as the divalent cation suggests that BLV might be an atypical mammalian leukemogenic type C virus. Hybridization studies using BLV 3H cDNA as a probe suggest that the DNA of bovine leukemic cells contains viral sequences that cannot be detected in normal bovine DNA.","['Kettmann, R', 'Portetelle, D', 'Mammerickx, M', 'Cleuter, Y', 'Dekegel, D', 'Galoux, M', 'Ghysdael, J', 'Burny, A', 'Chantrenne, H']","['Kettmann R', 'Portetelle D', 'Mammerickx M', 'Cleuter Y', 'Dekegel D', 'Galoux M', 'Ghysdael J', 'Burny A', 'Chantrenne H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Hamatol Bluttransfus,Hamatologie und Bluttransfusion,7804332,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cations, Divalent', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/microbiology', 'Centrifugation, Isopycnic', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Detergents', '*Leukemia Virus, Bovine/analysis/enzymology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/veterinary', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Viral/*analysis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', '*Retroviridae/analysis', 'Species Specificity']",1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-87524-3_37 [doi]'],ppublish,Hamatol Bluttransfus. 1976;19:375-89. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-87524-3_37.,"['0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Detergents)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,,,,,,,

Results obtained using cell culture methods have provided some support for the view that leukemic hemopoiesis, like normla hemopoiesis, may involve 3 levels of differentiation: leukemic stem cells, committed leukemic progenitors, and more mature cells. Evidence is also beginning to emerge that leukemic populations may be regulated by messages from the environment in a manner analogous to normal hemopoiesis. The apparent similarities between leukemic and normal hemopoiesis raise, the possibility that the target cell for leukemic transformation is the normal pluripotent stem cell. The development of culture methods for the production of leukovirus-like particles from human leukemic cells provides a possible first step toward the direct identification of leukemic target cells.","['Till, J E', 'Mak, T W', 'Price, G B', 'Senn, J S', 'McCulloch, E A']","['Till JE', 'Mak TW', 'Price GB', 'Senn JS', 'McCulloch EA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Hamatol Bluttransfus,Hamatologie und Bluttransfusion,7804332,IM,"['Anemia, Sideroblastic/blood', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/blood', 'Granulocytes/cytology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Leukemia/blood/microbiology/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Leukocytes', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism']",1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-87524-3_4 [doi]'],ppublish,Hamatol Bluttransfus. 1976;19:33-45. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-87524-3_4.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,47,,,,,,

LCFU showed rapid reaccumulation in the marrow 12 hr after injection of 0.1 mg of aza-CR per mouse. However, after 0.5 mg of aza-CR, repopulation was delayed for at least 6 days. Experiments were performed to determine the mechanism of this prolonged antileukemic effect. Suspensions of leukemic marrow prepared from mice treated 4 days previously with 0.5 mg of aza-CR were exposed to [3H]thymidine in vitro in order to kill cells in S phase. Suspensions exhibited a 40% reduction in LCFU, indicating the prolonged effect was not due to cell cycle progression delay. Mice given whole-body irradiation prior to receiving L1210 demonstrated the same delayed repopulation following the high dose of aza-CR as nonirradiated mice, suggesting that the effect was likely not due to an immune reaction. aza-CR, when given to normal mice as long as 2 days prior to leukemic transplantation, was able to prolong the survival of leukemic mice, but not when given at longer intervals. Administration of aza-CR to mice 1 day or 1 hr prior to leukemic transplantation resulted in decreased LCFU survival as well as delayed repopulation of LCFU; the rate of repopulation was not changed. This indicated a prolonged residual activity of the drug, but not sufficient to explain the total in vivo suppression. In contrast, administration of aza-CR to leukemic mice suppressed repopulation of a subsequent leukemic transplant for 4 days, even when the cells were given 2 days after the aza-CR. Cytidine was partially able to reverse the delayed repopulation of LCFU when given 1 day after aza-CR, but it was unable to reverse the phenomenon 2 days after aza-CR. Therefore, a high dose of aza-CR produces a prolonged antileukemic effect which is probably mediated by continued availability of an aza-CR metabolite. Since this effect is more pronounced in leukemic mice than in nonleukemic mice, the pharmacokinetics of high doses of aza-CR probably differ in normal and leukemic mice.","['Presant, C A', 'Valeriote, F', 'Vietti, T J']","['Presant CA', 'Valeriote F', 'Vietti TJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytidine/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Immunity', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Thymidine/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",1977/02/01 00:00,1977/02/01 00:01,['1977/02/01 00:00'],"['1977/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1977 Feb;37(2):376-81.,"['5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,,,,

Three kinds of DNA polymerases from spleen were not inhibited by bleomycin, but the fourth enzyme, which was induced in the spleen by virus infection, was inhibited by the antibiotic, when poly-d(AT) and poly-dG with dC were used as template.","['Ono, T', 'Miyaki, M', 'Taguchi, T', 'Ohashi, M']","['Ono T', 'Miyaki M', 'Taguchi T', 'Ohashi M']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Prog Biochem Pharmacol,Progress in biochemical pharmacology,0036761,IM,"['Animals', 'Bleomycin/*pharmacology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mice', 'Oncogenic Viruses/enzymology', 'Polynucleotide Ligases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'RNA Viruses/enzymology', 'Spleen/enzymology', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Tumor Virus Infections/enzymology']",1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Biochem Pharmacol. 1976;11:48-58.,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (Polynucleotide Ligases)']",,,13,,,,,,

RAG cells spontaneously produce an endogenous B-tropic type C virus. Cat-mouse hybrids preferentially segregate feline chromosomes and retain murine chromosomes-demonstrable by karyotypic and isozyme analyses. Despite the presence of the complete mouse genome, including the viral genome, virus production was diminished to 1-5% of the levels observed in RAG parents based upon particle-associated RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) activity in the culture fluid. Thirty-seven hybrids made on four different occasions had suppressed virus levels, and no hybrids expressed parental virus levels. Reverse selection experiments on 6-thioguanine demonstrated that a restriction gene, tentatively named Bvr-1, was linked to the feline structural genes for hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (IMP:pyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase; EC 2.4.4.8) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (D-glucose-6-phosphate: NADP+ 1-oxidoreductase; EC 1.1.1.49) in cats, probably on the X-chromosome. The genetic mode of action of Bvr-1 is trans dominant in restriction of murine leukemia virus. The restriction locus results in a block late in virus maturation but prior to release, since expression of antigens for viral structural proteins and matrue budding particles is apparent on surfaces of restriced hybrid cells but not in high-speed pellets from culture fluid of restricted cells.","[""O'Brien, S J""]","[""O'Brien SJ""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', '*Genes, Regulator', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Hybrid Cells/enzymology/*physiology', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/metabolism', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/growth & development', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/growth & development', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*growth & development', 'Sex Chromosomes', '*Virus Replication']",1976/12/01 00:00,1976/12/01 00:01,['1976/12/01 00:00'],"['1976/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.73.12.4618 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1976 Dec;73(12):4618-22. doi: 10.1073/pnas.73.12.4618.,"['EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",PMC431569,,,,,,,,

Since there is ample evidence that specific immune reactions of the host against malignant neoplastic cells do occur, it becomes important to consider the effectiveness and the relevance of immunity in suppression or elimination of neoplastic growth. Emphasis is placed on experimental results obtained in syngeneic tumor-host combinations, because they more closely resemble the situation of spontaneous tumorigenesis or leukemogenesis than xenogeneic or allogeneic model systems. Studies of types of neoplasia observed in cases of human immunodeficiency syndromes offer an important insight into problems involved in immunoselection of leukemic cell lines: the marked predominance of leukemias and lymphoreticular neoplasias in immunodeficient patients invites speculation on both the mechanisms of leukemogenesis and the relative importance of the immune system in eliminating malignant neoplastic cells.","['Pedrinis, E', 'Zimmermann, A', 'Bertschmann, M', 'Hess, M W', 'Cottier, H']","['Pedrinis E', 'Zimmermann A', 'Bertschmann M', 'Hess MW', 'Cottier H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol Blood Cells,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie; blood cells,7701899,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Clone Cells', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epitopes', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude']",1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-66312-3_23 [doi]'],ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol Blood Cells. 1976;17(1-2):329-43. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-66312-3_23.,['0 (Epitopes)'],,,,,,,,,

Lack of ecotropic virus expression in the majority of lymphomas.,1406-23,"The expression of endogenous ecotropic viruses in radiation-induced thymomas of C57BL/6 mice was examined. Competition radioimmunoassays for AKR MuLV gp71, p30, and p12 were used for viral antigen expression. 3 of 40 lymphomas had readily detectable ecotropic gp71 at levels of 95-689 ng/mg protein; the remainder of the tumors had no detectable gp71 (less than 1.0 ng/mg protein). 30 thymomas were characterized by the presence of MuLV p30 at levels of 1-10 ng/mg protein, levels that were comparable to those found in thymus extracts from age-matched, nonirradiated control. 10 tumors were characterized by having p30 levels of 10-30 ng/mg protein. In one tumor significant levels of AKR MuLV p12 were detectable. Since B-tropic and N-tropic viruses from C57BL/6 mice have glycoproteins (gp71) indistinguishable from AKR MuLV gp71 and the N-tropic virus had a p12 serologically identical to AKR MuLV p12, these results demonstrate that overt endogenous B-tropic virus was detectable in 2 of 40 thymomas and endogenous N-tropic virus was detectable in 1 of 40 thymomas. The lack of overt expression of gp71 or p12 was also confirmed by cytotoxicity assays using monospecific antisera to these viral proteins. Radiation-induced lymphomas were also examined for the presence of reverse transcriptase after chromatography of tissue extracts on poly G-Sepharose. One tumor, which was characterized by the lack of gp71, also had no detectable reverse transcriptase; whereas one tumor with gp71 was characterized by readily detectable levels of reverse transcriptase in cellular extracts. The presence of viral RNA was examined using AKR cDNA. Low levels of RNA capable of hybridizing with AKR cDNA were found in age-matched, nonirradiated mice; these hybrids had Tm's of 72 degrees C, while hybrids with AKR MuLV 70S RNA had Tm's of 80 degrees C. In 1 of 12 thymomas the concentration of hybridizable RNA and the Tm of the hybrids were identical to control values. In 9 of 12 thymomas the concentration of hybridizable sequences increased approximately three-to fivefold and the Tm of these hybrids varied from 73 to 75 degrees C. In 1 of 12 thymomas the concentration of hybridizable sequences increased over 100-fold, hybridized completely with AKR MuLV cDNA, and the hybrids had Tm's of 79 degrees C. This thymoma was also characterized by the presence of the AKR MuLV type of gp71 and p12. One tumor was characterized by a 10-to 100-fold increase in hybridizable sequences, which only partially hybridized with AKR MuLV cDNA, and hybrids had a Tm of 73 degrees C. This tumor was characterized by the presence of AKR MuLV gp71 but not AKR MuLV p12. The results taken together demonstrate that overt endogenous ecotropic virus expression is only rarely detectable in radiation-induced thymomas of C57BL/6 mice.","['Ihle, J N', 'Joseph, D R', 'Pazmino, N H']","['Ihle JN', 'Joseph DR', 'Pazmino NH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Viral/*analysis', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology', '*Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL/*microbiology', 'RNA, Viral/*analysis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/analysis', 'Thymoma/etiology/*microbiology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/etiology/*microbiology']",1976/12/01 00:00,1976/12/01 00:01,['1976/12/01 00:00'],"['1976/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.144.6.1406 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1976 Dec 1;144(6):1406-23. doi: 10.1084/jem.144.6.1406.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",PMC2190491,,,,,,,,

Lack of serological evidence for the role of endogenous ecotropic viruses in pathogenesis.,1391-405,"The humoral immune response against endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) was examined in irradiated and control C57BL/6 mice. Control mice developed antibodies against MuLV slowly throughout life. In contrast, within 2-3 mo after irradiation 90% of irradiated C57BL/6 mice had developed detectable antibodies against MuLV. The characteristics of this immune response, however, were identical in control and irradiated mice in terms of peak titers, specificity for endogenous ecotropic MuLV, and reactivity against the ecotropic viruses' glycoprotein (gp71). Moreover, the rate of appearance of antibodies against MuLV in irradiated mice and the peak titers were generally not affected by age at irradiation, dose of irradiation (two, three, or four treatments of 175 R), or bone marrow reconstitution. Although the ability of irradiation to accelerate the appearance of antibody in a population of C57BL/6 mice suggested activation of endogenous ecotropic MuLV, there was no apparent correlation between the appearance of this immune response or its persistence and the development of lymphoma. Thus, the incidence of lymphoma was comparable in mice that: (a) developed no immune response; (b) developed an immune response only transiently after irradiation; or (c) developed an immune response which persisted until death from lymphoma. Moreover, experimental conditions that alter the ability of irradiation to induce leukemia, such as age, dose, or bone marrow reconstitution did so without significantly altering either the rate of appearance of a humoral immune response to MuLV or its peak titers. The results, therefore, fail to demonstrate any seroepidemological relationship between endogenous ecotropic MuLV and radiation-induced leukemia.","['Ihle, J N', 'McEwan, R', 'Bengali, K']","['Ihle JN', 'McEwan R', 'Bengali K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Antibody Formation/*radiation effects', 'Epitopes', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology', '*Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL/immunology/*microbiology', 'Thymoma/etiology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/etiology']",1976/12/01 00:00,1976/12/01 00:01,['1976/12/01 00:00'],"['1976/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.144.6.1391 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1976 Dec 1;144(6):1391-405. doi: 10.1084/jem.144.6.1391.,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)']",PMC2190492,,,,,,,,

The finding of cross-reacting tumor rejection antigens in methylcholanthrene-induced squamous cell carcinomas encourages prospects for the development of more broadly applicable immunodiagnostic and immunotherapeutic reagents.","['Economou, G C', 'Takelchi, N', 'Boone, C W']","['Economou GC', 'Takelchi N', 'Boone CW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/chemically induced/*immunology', 'Cross Reactions', 'Epitopes', 'Graft Rejection', 'Hypersensitivity, Delayed', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology', 'Male', 'Methylcholanthrene', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/chemically induced/immunology', 'Polyomavirus/immunology', 'Retroviridae/immunology', 'Skin Neoplasms/chemically induced/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1977 Jan;37(1):37-41.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '56-49-5 (Methylcholanthrene)']",,,,,,,,,

Since it has been suspected that blasts found in some patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic crisis might be thymus-derived cells, we have studied several parameters to demonstrate that K-562 cells are not thymus-derived lymphoblasts. The results of this study show: (a) no cross-reactivity of antisera to K-562 cells with normal human thymocytes; (b) lack of cytotoxicity of a specific horse anti-human thymocyte globulin for K-562 cells; (c) failure of the treatment of K-562 cells with bovine thymosin to induce antigenic determinant and erythrocyte rosette receptors on K-562 cells; (d) presence of receptors for the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G; (e) absence of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase; and (f) cytotoxicity of monkey antiserum to K-562 cells for malignant thymus-derived cells (Molt-4). However, absorption with Molt-4 cells abolished the cross-reactivity with Molt-4 cells, whereas 60% of the antibody to K-562 cells remained in the immune serum.

However, the release of SRS-A from the basophils of one patient and the release of chemotactic activity from both patients displayed unusual properties. During acceleration of the disease process, the basophils of one patient released maximal SRS-A activity at progressively lower concentrations of anti-IgE. Both patients released a high molecular weight factor (M.W. greater than 20,000) which enhanced the migration of neutrophils and eosinophils and a low molecular weight chemotactic factor (M.W. less than 500) which selectively attracted eosinophils. A double peak of eosinophil chemotactic activity was routinely observed for the low molecular weight factor; this was shown to represent the eosinophil chemotactic activity of histamine with relative inhibition of migration at the histamine peak. There was little release of the tetrapeptides, ECF-A, in these patients which facilitated demonstration of this eosinophilotactic activity of histamine.

Of two patients who developed lymphosarcoma-cell leukaemia following treatment of poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma, one had high and one low levels of TDT in the leukaemic blast cells. Leukaemic cells from three of seven patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia in blast crisis had TDT levels within the range expected of acute lymphoblastic rather than acute myeloid leukaemia.

The only correlation established was with the Fc receptor determined by direct immunofluorescence. No correlation of EBV genome equivalents per cell with complement receptor or surface Ig was noted, suggesting that the expression of these receptors is not influenced by EBV viral DNA content.

A detailed analysis of the role of the human complement (C) system in mediating this lytic process indicates that human C1q interacts directly, in the absence of immunoglobulin, with oncornaviruses. Binding of C1 via C1q in this manner leads to activation of C1r, C1s, and thus of the classical C pathway. Integrity of the classical pathway is an absolute requirement for lysis although activation of the alternative pathway considerably amplifies the amount of lysis obtained, possibly through involvement of the C3b-dependent feedback mechanism. Activation of C is accompanied by deposition of C components on the viral surface and lysis on completion of the C reaction sequence. Thus in this system, the C1q subunit of C1 subserves a specific recognition function normally associated with antibody. This ability of human serum to inactivate oncornaviruses may represent a natural defense mechanism operative in vivo which deters expression of intact oncornaviruses in human malignancies.","['Cooper, N R', 'Jensen, F C', 'Welsh, R M Jr', 'Oldstone, M B']","['Cooper NR', 'Jensen FC', 'Welsh RM Jr', 'Oldstone MB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Cell Survival', 'Complement C1/metabolism', 'Complement C2', 'Complement C8', '*Complement System Proteins', 'Humans', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Oncogenic Viruses/*immunology', 'RNA Viruses/*immunology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism']",1976/10/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1976/10/01 00:00'],"['1976/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1976/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.144.4.970 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1976 Oct 1;144(4):970-84. doi: 10.1084/jem.144.4.970.,"['0 (Complement C1)', '0 (Complement C2)', '0 (Complement C8)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",PMC2190433,,,,,,,,

The mean granulocyte increment in the recipients was 820/mm3 at 1 hour and 307/mm3 at 15 hours post-transfusion and it showed a correlation with the number of cells transfused, the size of the child, and his pretransfusion granulocyte count. Fifteen (50%) episodes responded clinically by 24 hours and 23 (77%) by 5 days post-transfusion. Two more children recovered more slowly and 5 died. Poor response was associated with multiple-site infections and with a prolonged period of infection before granulocyte transfusion, but the primary diagnosis did not influence the outcome.

On the other hand, other indications to radiotherapy recede into the background. Chronic leucoses: In the foreground of the application is the ray-therapy of the spleen, of which, apart from the local effect on the splenic tumour, also an improvement of the remission rates is expected. At adequate indication also the ray-therapy of infiltrates in the lymph nodes and other localisations achieves good palliative results. The extra-corporeal irradiation of blood is a method, the usability of which must still be proved. With the introduction of the modern cytostatic drugs the exposure of the whole body has lost significance. Lymphogranulomatosis: In this disease the radiotherapy has caused a decisive change: In these cases the recognition of the local development of the disease and its continuous spreading was decisive, and issuing from this also the simultaneous irradiation of the defluxion areas and the application of an oncolytic dose. According to the stage with or without combination of cytostatic drugs an exact plan of therapy is made. Here healing rates of 70-80% in stage I are to be expected. Myeloma: Here the radiotherpy has palliative tasks, with correct indication good effects are to be expected. Polycythaemia vera: In this disease radiotherapy in form of incorporation of radioactive phosphorus is the remedy of choice.","['Keinert, K']",['Keinert K'],['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Z Gesamte Inn Med,Zeitschrift fur die gesamte innere Medizin und ihre Grenzgebiete,21730470R,IM,"['Hematologic Diseases/*radiotherapy', 'Hodgkin Disease/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/radiotherapy', 'Palliative Care', 'Plasmacytoma/radiotherapy', 'Polycythemia Vera/radiotherapy', 'Remission, Spontaneous']",1976/04/15 00:00,1976/04/15 00:01,['1976/04/15 00:00'],"['1976/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1976/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Z Gesamte Inn Med. 1976 Apr 15;31(8):222-6.,,,Die Strahlentherapie hamatologischer Erkrankungen,,,,,,,

Serum vitamin B12 and B12-binding protein studies and simultaneous complete blood counts were done before and during 6 months of high-dose, intermittent combination chemotherapy. The patient presented with extremely high levels of serum vitamin B12, unsaturated B12-binding capacity, and transcobalamin I, all of which resembled the highest values seen in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Serial studies, during and after remission induction, showed a precipitous fall of serum vitamin B12 and unsaturated B12-binding capacity to normal levels.

The reverse transcriptases of both viruses, although antigenically related to polymerases of murine and rat type C viruses, are distinct from those of previously described type C viral groups. Both PP-1R and EP-1R can be transmitted to canine and feline cells and to sarcoma virus-transformed, but not normal, mink cells. Both viruses contain RNA genomes partially homologous to those of endogenous mouse and rat type C viruses and the Kirsten sarcoma virus. In addition, the RNA of PP-1R contains a portion of the nucleic acid sequences found in a type C virus isolated from the baboon species P. papio.

The initially serous sterile secretion turned mucoid, and a low grade infection supervened. For the last 3 months the tympanostomy tubes were open and the ears dry. In the sections, the mastoid air cells showed leukaemic infiltrations and contained AB- and PAS-positive secretion. The drum openings were without reaction and there was no epithelial ingrowth around the margins. The posterior tympanum in both ears contained organizing fibrous tissue extending from the inner surface of the drum to the promontory. In the tympanum the mucosa was flat or columnar and without glands. Distinct AB and PAS-positive mucus film and secretory cells appeared on the promontory epithelium and the inner surface of the drum. In the tubo-tympanic recess some AB- and PAS-positive subepithelial glands appeared and in the tympanic orifice of the tube the secretory cells were prominent and the lumen full of AB-positive mucus. The case reported represents an intermediate stage in the healing of secretory otitis media, most of the glands having disappeared but the intraepithelial secretory elements being still active.","['Palva, T', 'Karma, P', 'Karja, J', 'Palva, A']","['Palva T', 'Karma P', 'Karja J', 'Palva A']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Laryngol Otol,The Journal of laryngology and otology,8706896,IM,"['Aged', 'Eustachian Tube/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications/*pathology', 'Otitis Media/etiology/*pathology', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Temporal Bone/*pathology', 'Tympanic Membrane/pathology']",1976/05/01 00:00,1976/05/01 00:01,['1976/05/01 00:00'],"['1976/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Laryngol Otol. 1976 May 1;90(8):773-83.,,,,,,,,,,

Alterations of splenic B and T cells in Friend virus-infected mice.,197-204,"Lymphoid tissues of mice infected with murine leukemia virus (Friend) (MuLV-F) were examined for the presence of cellular markers of MuLV-F infection. The Friend virus-associated cell membrane antigen (FVMA) and the virus group-specific antigen (GSA) were detectable on cells from the spleen and, to a lesser degree, on cells from the bone-marrow. In contrast, neither FVMA nor GSA was found in cells from the thymus. Alterations in the B-cell and T-cell spleen populations of MuLV-F-infected mice were then studied. The proportion of Ig-positive cells declined from the initial 45% (in non-infected controls) to about 10% after 2 weeks of infection. A similar decline of theta-positive cells was noted. However, complement-bearing cells (EAC rosettes) declined even more rapidly and became undetectable in the second week after infection. The treatment of spleen cells from MuLV-F-infected mice with anti-FVMA serum plus complement in vitro reduced the number of detectable Ig-positive cells, specifically, whereas the number of theta-positive cells remained unchanged. Furthermore, B and T cells from spleens of infected mice were separated on an affinity column with anti-Ig antibody-coated beads. The initial cell suspension contained about 45% FVMA-positive cells, about 40% Ig-positive cells and about 40% theta-positive cells. Ig+ cells were retained on the column. The theta-positive cell fraction was collected in the eluate and contained very few FVMA-positive cells with some ""null"" cells. Most of the FVMA-positive cells were retained on the column, which strongly suggested that they were B cells. These results confirm the previous experiments which showed the selective infections of purified splenic B cells by MuLV-F in cultures.","['Cerny, J', 'Essex, M', 'Thomas, D B']","['Cerny J', 'Essex M', 'Thomas DB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Cell Separation', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Complement System Proteins/analysis', 'Epitopes', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Immune Adherence Reaction', 'Immune Sera/pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1976/08/15 00:00,1976/08/15 00:01,['1976/08/15 00:00'],"['1976/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1976/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910180209 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1976 Aug 15;18(2):197-204. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910180209.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,

Achievements using new staining techniques.,1-13,"Numerical and structural chromosome aberrations are frequently found in neoplastic cells. As demonstrated by the new chromosome banding techniques these aberrations are not random, but tend to show a specific occurrence. A model example is the leukemias where many cytogenetical investigations have been done to date. In leukemia chromosome analysis serves the following purposes: to identify a neoplastic process, to confirm and strengthen the hematological diagnosis, for the early diagnosis of transformation from a chronic leukemia into its blastic phase and for following up the clonal evolution of a leukemic cell line. In the discussion of chromosomes and neoplasms it must be mentioned that individuals demonstrating chromosomal instability and some trisomic patients show a greater tendency toward the development of a malignancy. Malignancy is primarily a cellular phenomenon caused by a disturbance in cellular regulation, whose fine events are not known. Therefore the exact role of the chromosomes in neoplastic processes cannot be stated. From experimental investigations it appears that the affected chromosomes carry cell growth regulating factors and also that a specific aberration is the result of the action of a specific agent.","['Muller, H', 'Stalder, G R']","['Muller H', 'Stalder GR']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes/analysis', 'Chronic Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Precancerous Conditions/genetics', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Trisomy']",1976/08/16 00:00,1976/08/16 00:01,['1976/08/16 00:00'],"['1976/08/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/08/16 00:01 [medline]', '1976/08/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00497675 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 1976 Aug 16;123(1):1-13. doi: 10.1007/BF00497675.,,,,,,,,,,

We now report that this drug inhibits the DNA-polymerase from murine sarcoma leukemia virus. The extent of inhibition was found to vary with the nature of the primer-template used : maximum with poly(rA)n-oligo(dT)10 (nucleotide ratio 20:1), minimum with poly(rA)n-poly(dT)n and intermediate with native calf thymus DNA. Experiments performed with synthetic templates of the (rA)-(dT) type have led to the following conclusions as to the mechanism of inhibition: 1) Amikhellin acts at an early stage of the synthesis reaction because the drug is no longer inhibitory when a limited extension of the oligo(dT) primers has been allowed to occur. However, mere incubation of the enzyme with the template in the absence of dTTP is not sufficient to confer resistance to the drug. 2) Progression of enzyme molecules actively engaged in polymerization is stopped when they reach downstream duplex regions to which amikhellin is bound.","['Rucheton, M', 'Jeanteur, P']","['Rucheton M', 'Jeanteur P']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Biochimie,Biochimie,1264604,IM,"['DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Khellin/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Poly A/metabolism', 'Poly T/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors', 'Thymine Nucleotides/pharmacology']",1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0300-9084(76)80393-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0300-9084(76)80393-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochimie. 1976;58(6):689-95. doi: 10.1016/s0300-9084(76)80393-8.,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '0 (Thymine Nucleotides)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '25086-81-1 (Poly T)', '5G117T0TJZ (Khellin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)']",,,,,,,,,

The 4 X 10(6)-dalton classof RNA from M-MSV (MuLV) was examined for base sequence homology with DNA complementary to the 7 X 10(6)-dalton M-MuLV RNA genome. Approximately 86% of the M-MSV (MuLV) was protected from RNase digestion by hybridization, whereas 95% of M-MuLV was protected under identical conditions. These results indicate that the small RNA class of high-MOI M-MSV (MuLV) contains little (perhaps 10%) genetic information not present in M-MuLV. Virtually all of the 1.8 X 10(6)-dalton subunits of M-MSV (MuLV) RNA contained regions of poly(A) since 94% of the RNA bound to oligo(dT) cellulose in 0.5 M KCl.

Inhibition of rosette formation by specific glycopeptides.,1068-78,"Rosette formation with unsensitized sheep erythrocytes is a characteristic of human thymus dependent lymphocytes. Release of glycopeptides from the sheep erythrocyte by trypsin reduces rosette formation. These tryptic glycopeptides inhibit rosette formation by untrypsinized sheep erythrocytes; this suggests that rosetting is mediated by erythrocyte surface glycopeptides. To investigate the molecular nature of this interaction, we examined the abilities of various model compounds to act as haptenic inhibitors of rosette formation. Inhibition is given by glycopeptides bearing oligosaccharide units rich in sialic acid, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and mannose linked to asparagine residues through glycosylamine bonds. Among compounds tested, fetuin glycopeptide is most effective, but human transferrin glycopeptide and human erythrocyte glycopeptide I also inhibit rosette formation. Other compounds including human erythrocyte glycopeptide II, human IgG glycopeptide, lacto-N-neotetraose, 3'- and 6'-sialyllactose show no significant inhibition. Neither sialic acid, galactose, manose, nor N-acetyl-glucosamine alone inhibits rosette formation. Stepwise degradation of fetuin glycopeptide established the galactose residues as important determinants of inhibitory activity. Fetuin glycopeptide blocks rosette formation when added to a suspension of human lymphocytes and sheep erythrocytes or when preincubated with human lymphocytes, but not when preincubated with sheep erythrocytes. Studies of the binding of [3H] fetuin glycopeptide to normal lymphocytes demonstrate 7.5 x 10(6) saturable binding sites per cell. No saturable binding of this compound to sheep erythrocyte membranes is observed. Compared to normals, lymphocytes from patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia demonstrate decreased fetuin glycopeptide binding with a mean of 0.9 x 10(6) sites per cell. This decreased binding correlates with the impaired ability of these cells to form rosettes. The data suggest that fetuin glycopeptide inhibits rosette formation by binding to the thymus-dependent cell where competition occurs with sheep erythrocytes for specific lymphocyte surface receptors.","['Boldt, D H', 'Armstrong, J P']","['Boldt DH', 'Armstrong JP']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Erythrocytes/*immunology', 'Glycopeptides/*pharmacology', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Humans', '*Immune Adherence Reaction', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Oligosaccharides/pharmacology', 'Sheep', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'Trypsin', 'alpha-Fetoproteins/metabolism']",1976/04/01 00:00,1976/04/01 00:01,['1976/04/01 00:00'],"['1976/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI108349 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1976 Apr;57(4):1068-78. doi: 10.1172/JCI108349.,"['0 (Glycopeptides)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",PMC436751,,,,,,,,

Significant hematologic and clinical benefit was achieved in half of the patients and temporary arrest of the disease was often observed, but in most patients, the basic evolution of CML was not greatly altered. In eight patients, however, long-lasting improvement (one to nine years) was recorded. Measurement of the doubling time of circulating leukemic cells and other observations were consistent with the hypothesis that, in some patients, the spleen contains a more rapidly proliferating and ""more malignant"" population of leukemic cells than the marrow.

These virogenes are genetically transmitted from parent to progeny along with other cellular genes (virogene-oncogene hypothesis). Activation of this endogenous virogene information from a normally repressed state, rather than infection by exogenous oncogenic viruses, has been proposed as the most common mechanism of cancer causation in animals, including man. Recent isolates of baboon type C RNA viruses, while related morphologically and biochemically to other mammalian type C RNA viruses, can be distinguished by nucleic acid hybridization and immunologic criteria. Within primates, type C virogenes have evolved as the species have evolved; virogenes from closely related genera and families have the closest gene sequence homology. Endogenous viruses from one species may infect animals of a distantly related species and become incorporated into their germ line. Genomes of exogenous viruses, such as the murine leukemia viruses, which are infectious from animal to animal within the same species, evolve more rapidly than the endogenous virogenes which replicate solely as cellular genes. A major viral structural protein of baboon type C RNA viruses, p30 was detected by radioimmunoassay in normal primate tissues. Radioimmunoassays have also detected p30 antigen in human tissues which appear to be immunologically related to primate viral p30.

The viruses were analyzed by molecular hybridization experiments after transmission to five secondary cell culture lines. Using the criteria of molecular hybridization, we concluded that all of the transmitted virus isolates have nucleotide sequences related to the genome of simian sarcoma virus (SiSV). In addition, in agreement with data reported elsewhere, some of the transmitted viruses also have nucleotide sequences related to those of the baboon endogenous virus (BaEV). We also used molecular hybridization to ascertain whether both viruses could have originated from the patient HL23. Utilizing [3H] cDNA complementary to RNA from the separated BaEV-related component of HL23V and hybridizing this cDNA to DNA from tissues of the patient, we detected sequences related to BaEV in DNA obtained from the patient's spleen. These BaEV DNA sequences were also detectable when 125I-labeled RNA from BaEV was used as a probe. In agreement with earlier results, however, no SiSV-related sequences were detectable in the DNA of her tissues. Cytoplasmic viral-like particles, which had a buoyant density of 1.15-1.2 g/ml and were capable of synthesizing cDNA in association with a 35S RNA in vitro, were also found in the patient's fresh uncultured leukemic blood cells. cDNA synthesized by the cytoplasmic particles contained some sequences that hybridized to RNA from SiSV and, in addition, some that hybridized to RNA from BaEV. The cDNA also hybridized significantly to DNA isolated from the spleen of patient HL23 and to cytoplasmic RNA from the patient's leukocytes. These molecular hybridization results with nucleic acids obtained from the fresh blood cells of the patient, combined with the repeated isolation of similar viruses from different blood and bone marrow samples from the same patient, suggest that the virus come directly from the leukemic cell samples. The finding of BaEV-related DNA proviral sequences in the spleen of the patient strongly supports this interpretation. The failure so far to find a complete SiSV-related provirus is perplexing, but could be attributable to the existence of such a provirus in DNA of only a small population of cells in most leukemic patient.","['Reitz, M S', 'Miller, N R', 'Wong-Staal, F', 'Gallagher, R E', 'Gallo, R C', 'Gillespie, D H']","['Reitz MS', 'Miller NR', 'Wong-Staal F', 'Gallagher RE', 'Gallo RC', 'Gillespie DH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA/analysis', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*microbiology', 'Leukocytes/microbiology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*RNA, Viral', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', '*Retroviridae/enzymology', 'Spleen/microbiology']",1976/06/01 00:00,1976/06/01 00:01,['1976/06/01 00:00'],"['1976/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.73.6.2113 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1976 Jun;73(6):2113-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.73.6.2113.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",PMC430460,,,,,,,,

All the molecules that are reactive with this serum have subunits of 44,000 and 12,000 and can be identified as H-2 and TL antigens. Thus, the anti-beta2mu serum can deplete lysates of the majority of the TL and H-2 atigens which can be subsequently recognized by alloantisera. If TL and H-2 are precipitated from the lysates before the addition of anti-beta2mu, no beta2mu-reactive molecules remain. Our results indicate that Ia antigens cannot be depleted from the lysates with anti-beta2mu. The studies also suggest that TL and H-2 heavy chains can exist as both monomers and dimers. These observations are discussed with regard to previous studies concerning the native structure of H-2 and TL antigens.","['Vitetta, E S', 'Poulik, M D', 'Klein, J', 'Uhr, J W']","['Vitetta ES', 'Poulik MD', 'Klein J', 'Uhr JW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Beta-Globulins/*immunology', '*Histocompatibility Antigens', '*Isoantigens', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Molecular Weight', 'Protein Conformation', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Surface Properties', 'Thymus Gland/immunology', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*immunology/metabolism']",1976/07/01 00:00,1976/07/01 00:01,['1976/07/01 00:00'],"['1976/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.144.1.179 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1976 Jul 1;144(1):179-92. doi: 10.1084/jem.144.1.179.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Beta-Globulins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",PMC2190358,,,,,,,,

In the group treated with higher doses (from 501 to 760 I.U./kg b. w.) the maximal increase of immunoglobulins was observed in the second half of the cure with l-asparaginase, followed by a decrease of the immunoglobulins levels at the end of treatment.

In these two children and 6 others the lymphocyte count significantly dropped down on the day of shock before l-asparaginase injection.","['Zajaczkowski, J', 'Halikowski, B', 'Pituch, A', 'Legutko, L', 'Pajdak, E']","['Zajaczkowski J', 'Halikowski B', 'Pituch A', 'Legutko L', 'Pajdak E']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Folia Haematol Int Mag Klin Morphol Blutforsch,"Folia haematologica (Leipzig, Germany : 1928)",0374615,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anaphylaxis/immunology', 'Antibodies/analysis', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Asparaginase/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*immunology', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use']",1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Folia Haematol Int Mag Klin Morphol Blutforsch. 1976;103(1):21-8.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,Immunologische Aspekte bei der L-Asparaginase-Behandlung von Kindern mit lymphoproliferativen Erkrankungen,,,,,,,
