Thus, it is suggested that the WT1 gene plays an important role in both leukemogenesis and tumorigenesis. Here we tested the potential of WT1 to serve as a target for immunotherapy against leukemia and solid tumors. Four 9-mer WT1 peptides that contain HLA-A2.1-binding anchor motifs were synthesized. Two of them, Db126 and WH187, were determined to bind to HLA-A2.1 molecules in a binding assay using transporter associated with antigen processing-deficient T2 cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from an HLA-A2.1-positive healthy donor were repeatedly sensitized in vitro with T2 cells pulsed with each of these two WT1 peptides, and CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that specifically lyse WT1 peptide-pulsed T2 cells in an HLA-A2.1-restricted fashion were induced. The CTLs also exerted specific lysis against WT1-expressing, HLA-A2.1-positive leukemia cells, but not against WT1-expressing, HLA-A2.1-negative leukemia cells, or WT1-nonexpressing, HLA-A2. 1-positive B-lymphoblastoid cells. These data provide the first evidence of human CTL responses specific for the WT1 peptides, and provide a rationale for developing WT1 peptide-based adoptive T-cell therapy and vaccination against leukemia and solid tumors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their prevalence can exceed 90% depending on the socioeconomic status of the population. Since the number of immunocompromised patients has increased because of the increased incidence in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and an increase in organ transplantation, herpes virus infection may have a greater clinical significance. While treatment of otherwise healthy individuals will not usually cause any clinical problems herpes infection in an immunocompromised patient can have severe consequences. Additionally, development of viral resistance can be observed that may require alternative drugs in treatment. We present a case history of a man with a B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia that was associated with a very unusual herpes simplex virus infection in the nasal vestibule.

We and others recently reported the generation of MLV-derived vectors pseudotyped by variants of the envelope glycoproteins (Env) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), thus displaying the CD4-dependent tropism of the parental lentivirus (Mammano et al., 1997, J. Virol. 71, 3341-3345; Schnierle et al., 1997, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76, 8640-8645). However, because of their HIV-1-derived envelopes these vectors are neutralized by HIV-specific antibodies present in some infected patients. To circumvent this problem, we pseudotyped MLV capsid particles with variants of Env proteins derived from the apathogenic simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVagm) of African green monkeys (AGM; Chlorocebus pygerythrus). Truncation of the C-terminal domain of the transmembrane protein was found to be necessary to allow formation of infectious pseudotype vectors. These [MLV(SIVagm)] vectors efficiently transduced various human CD4-expressing cell lines using the coreceptors CCR5 and Bonzo to enter target cells. Moreover, they were resistant to neutralization by antibodies directed against HIV-1. Therefore, [MLV(SIVagm)] vectors will be useful to study the mechanisms of SIVagm cell entry and for the selective gene transfer into CD4+ T-cells of AIDS patients.",,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

As Aspergillus species can be readily found in the environment, it has been widely believed that aspergillosis occurs as a consequence of exogenous acquisition of the fungus. Stringent environmental controls in transplant units have included high-efficiency air filtration, positive-pressure ventilation and frequent room air changes. Although there have been several well-documented examples of aspergillosis outbreaks as a result of hospital demolition and reconstruction, it has not always been possible to demonstrate elevated spore counts in clinical areas during building work. The sampling of air for Aspergillus is very problematic. Careful attention must be given to the design of air sampler, sampling protocols and an understanding of air sampling data.

This study was conducted from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) hospital sector. DESIGN: We used our previously reported trial as the clinical basis for the analysis (see Participants and interventions). These data were combined with resource utilisation data, enabling us to construct a decision tree model of the treatment paths attributable to managing patients in each arm of the trial. The model was used to calculate the cost effectiveness of using amphotericin B plus G-CSF compared to amphotericin B monotherapy in neutropenic patients with a presumed deep-seated fungal infection. SETTING: An adult leukaemia/bone marrow transplant (BMT) unit in a large UK teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with a neutrophil count of < 0.5 x 10(9)/L and having a presumed deep-seated fungal infection after either chemotherapy or stem cell/bone marrow transplantation for haematological malignancy. INTERVENTIONS: 29 patients received intravenous amphotericin B (1 mg/kg daily) plus subcutaneous G-CSF (3 to 5 micrograms/kg daily) and 30 patients received intravenous amphotericin B (1 mg/kg daily) monotherapy. The clinical trial showed that 62% of patients responded to antifungal treatment with amphotericin B plus G-CSF compared to 33% of patients who responded to amphotericin B monotherapy (p = 0.027). Nonresponders went on to receive a lipid formulation of amphotericin B. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE AND RESULTS: The mean cost per patient treated with amphotericin B plus G-CSF was 11,247 Pounds and the corresponding cost for amphotericin B monotherapy was 14,317 Pounds (1996/1997 values)--a cost reduction of 3070 Pounds per patient. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the addition of G-CSF to conventional amphotericin B in the treatment of a presumed deep-seated fungal infection offers not only clinical benefits, but cost benefits which are robust to changes in clinical and economic parameters. CONCLUSION: From a UK hospital perspective, amphotericin B plus G-CSF is cost effective compared with amphotericin B monotherapy in managing a presumed deep-seated fungal infection in neutropenic patients. This result should provide strong arguments to clinicians and policy-makers for the adoption of this treatment strategy in such patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been claimed that ISS may be suggestive of intellectual inefficiency, difficulty with recall of specific information, or fluctuating levels of arousal/attention. The research investigating these claims has been inconclusive, possibly because traditional indices of ISS may not adequately measure inconsistent responding. Item Response Theory (IRT) approaches to the detection of unusual response sequences appear to have a much firmer psychometric foundation but have been largely ignored in the neurodiagnostic literature. This study compares the utility of traditional and IRT-based indices of ISS in identifying children known to be experiencing information-processing difficulties. The WISC-R item responses of 100 children who have received cranial irradiation treatment for leukemia are compared with those of 100 healthy children. Results confirm the diagnostic utility of an IRT-based measure of unusual test behavior in this clinical group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On admission, she was treated with anti-cancer drugs, including VCR. On day 24, after the first administration of VCR, a conscious disturbance suddenly occurred and she was diagnosed with SIADH. A plain head CT scan showed a low density lesion through the gray matter to the white matter in the bilateral occipital lobe, as well as diffuse swelling of the cerebrum. This was not seen on the follow up CT scan, and we concluded that it had been a transient abnormal finding due to SIADH. She achieved complete remission after induction chemotherapy and 3 added courses of consolidation chemotherapy. VCR was also administered 4 times in the second consolidation chemotherapy, but hyponatremia did not occur.

The second is that leukemia and lymphoma are very chemosensitive diseases to compare with solid tumor, so the ultimate goal of their therapy is increase of the cure rate. The third is hematologists with high specialty only can manage such serious patients. Thus they have proposed plenty well-designed and well-organized clinical protocols and have performed some of them in this field.

Epidemiological data suggest a radiotherapy associated risk of AML in prostate cancer patients of approximately 0.1% in 10 years. The aim of the study was to determine the range of bone marrow doses from different treatment plans and in different patients in order to develop criteria for optimisation of treatment plans in conformal radiotherapy of prostate cancer to further minimise the small risk of secondary leukaemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Doses to the pelvic bone marrow were calculated for eight different plans used in radiotherapy of prostate cancer to determine the variability of bone marrow doses in radiotherapy of prostate cancer. Computer tomography (CT) slices of the entire pelvic region of an Alderson phantom were acquired and transferred to the TPS. Critical bone marrow structures were outlined in each slice. Different treatment plans were evaluated on this phantom and dose-volume histograms (DVH) for the pelvic bone marrow were obtained. Similarly, the DVH for the bone marrow of 14 patients who received conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer was determined. RESULTS: Mean total bone marrow doses ranged from 3.4 to 5.6 Gy in the phantom study. Approximately 99% of the mean dose to the total bone marrow comes from the dose to bone marrow located in the pelvic bones and lumbar vertebrae. Mean bone marrow doses of 14 patients given the same conformal radiotherapy plan ranged from 3.5 to 7.7 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: No correlation was found between the rectum normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) and the mean bone marrow dose. This means that in the process of treatment planning, exposure to both critical organs, the rectum as well as the bone marrow, should be minimised independently to arrive at the optimal treatment plan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells treated with clofilium led to suppression of viability and proliferation in both time and concentration-dependent manners. Nuclear DAPI staining and electronmicroscopic examination revealed typical nuclear features of apoptosis in cells treated with clofilium that was further verified in DNA fragmentation analysis. Flow cytometry analysis with FITC-annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) revealed that apoptotic cell population with Annexin V+/PI- increased gradually from < 2% at 0 h, to 20% at 4 h and 29% at 16 h after exposure to 10 microM clofilium in HL-60 cells. Furthermore, fluorometric immunosorbent enzyme assay for activity of caspase-3 showed approximately a 10-fold increase of activity in cells treated with 10 microM of clofilium for 2-3 h compared with the basal level of its activity in untreated control cells. Immunoblotting analysis revealed proteolytic cleavage of caspase-3 and subsequent cleavage of PARP. However, there was no significant change of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins. These results indicate that clofilium exerts antiproliferative action and growth inhibition on HL-60 through induction of apoptosis which is mediated via Bcl-2-insensitive activation of caspase-3, and suggest chemotherapeutic and cytostatic potentials of this compound in human leukemias.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This therapeutic effect was abrogated by elimination of activated macrophages. Activated macrophages produce a variety of factors that can contribute to the elimination of tumor cells in vivo, including proteases, TNF, reactive oxygen intermediates, and nitric oxide (NO). Based on the results of previous reports, the contribution of NO in potentiated antileukemic effects of IL-12 + DOX combination seemed to be highly possible. Both DOX and IL-12 given alone increased the production of NO by peritoneal macrophages, however, macrophages derived from the mice treated with the combination of those agents produced significantly less NO than macrophages from IL-12-alone-treated mice. Production of NO by spleen macrophages after IL-12 + DOX treatment was higher than it was in controls, IL-12-alone or DOX-alone-treated groups. In serum, concentrations of NOx- in IL-12- or IL-12 + DOX-treated mice were significantly higher in comparison with controls, however not significantly different from each other. Addition of L-NAME treatment to the IL-12 + DOX therapy in leukemia-bearing mice did not significantly change the antileukemic efficacy of this therapy. Thus, our results indicate that the augmented antileukemic effects of IL-12 + DOX combination therapy in L1210 model are NO-independent. Therefore, further studies on the possible mechanisms of potentiated antileukemic activity of combination of IL-12 and DOX would be worth pursuing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The histologic, cytologic heterogeneity of MCLs may lead to diagnostic confusion. The aim of this study was to reclassify NHLs registered as centrocytic lymphoma and centrocytoid-centroblastoma by the Lymphoma Reference Centrum at the Department of Pathology, University Medical School of Pecs between 1988 and 1995. 63 of 67 selected cases have been classified as mantle cell lymphoma according to histological, cytological appearance, and the pheno- and genotype of tumour cells. 48% of the cases showed diffuse while 52% showed nodular histological pattern. 27% of diffuse MCLs composed of classic MCL cells (small to medium-size cells) 40% blastic and 33% both small and blastic lymphoma cells. In 76% of the nodular MCLs the tumour consisted of small to medium-size cells 15% blastic while 9% both small and blastic lymphoma cells. In 99% of MCL the diagnosis was supported by CD5, CD20 and CD23 positivity and in 67% by the presence of cyclin D1-overexpression. The t(11;14) chromosome translocation PCR amplification was positive in 3 of 17 cases investigated. The authors conclude that MCLs represent a heterogeneous disease based on the cytology of the tumour cells. The nodular architecture was associated with classic MCL cells while the diffuse form was more frequently associated with blastic or combined cytological appearance. The correct diagnosis of MCL could be reached by tumour cell immunophenotyping, while molecular genetic methods proved to be informative only in part of the cases studied.","A kopenysejtes lymphoma patologiai diagnozisa hisztologiai, citologiai, immunhisztologiai es genetikai jellemzok alapjan.",,,52,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-one patients (16.9%) were classified as acute, 21 (16.9%) as chronic, 26 (21.0%) as lymphoma, and 56 (45.2%) as smouldering according to Shimoyama's classification. Many patients had nodules/tumors (34.7%), erythematous plaques (22.6%), and erythematous papules (19.4%) similar to those occurring with other cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Some patients displayed characteristic skin manifestations resembling non-neoplastic cutaneous disorders. The median survival time (MST) of all patients was 12.0 months. The MSTs of individual clinical types were: acute type, 4 months; chronic type, 14 months; lymphoma type, 7 months; and smouldering type, 16 months. In the smouldering type, cases with a deeper infiltration pattern (MST, 14 months) had a more aggressive course than those with a superficial infiltration pattern (MST, 24 months) (p < 0.05). The results indicate that smouldering type ATLL with skin manifestations may have a worse prognosis than without skin manifestations. Moreover, some cases of the smouldering type with specific skin lesions should be classified into another group with a much poorer prognosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A distinct 801-bp deletion mutation associated with amplification of the EGFR gene is present in a large subgroup of primary GBMs and confers enhanced tumorigenicity in vivo. As a result of the deletion mutation, the fusion junction of the gene is created directly upstream of a GTA triplet, which is subsequently transcribed into a ribozyme target codon (GUA). METHODS: In attempts to intercept deltaEGFR gene expression at the mRNA level, the authors designed three different hairpin ribozymes derived from the negative strands of satellite RNAs in tobacco ringspot virus, chicory yellow mottle virus (sCYMV1), and arabis mosaic virus against this target and evaluated their efficiency and specificity in a cell-free system. The sCYMV1, identified as the most active anti-deltaEGFR hairpin ribozyme motif, was cloned into the retroviral plasmid N2A+tRNAi(met). High-titer recombinant retrovirus-containing supernatants (> 10(5) colony-forming units/ml) derived from an amphotropic GP+envAM 12 packaging cell line transfected with the N2A+tRNAi(met)-anti-deltaEGFR-sCYMV1 construct were used to introduce the sCYMV1 hairpin ribozyme into U-87MG.deltaEGFR glioblastoma cells, which overexpress exogenous deltaEGFR. Using a virus/target cell ratio of 40:1 in the absence of drug selection, the ribozyme transfer resulted in a greater than 90% reduction of deltaEGFR mRNA levels, a 69% inhibition of deltaEGFR-mediated proliferation advantage, and a greater than 95% decrease of colony formation in soft agar under relative serum starvation conditions in vitro; transfer of a control mutant ribozyme that was rendered incapable of cleaving its target yielded none of these effects. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the anti-deltaEGFR-sCYMV1 hairpin ribozyme is capable of specifically inhibiting the expression of deltaEGFR and reversing the deltaEGFR-associated malignant phenotype of GBM cells. This strategy may constitute a promising gene therapy approach for a molecularly defined subgroup of GBMs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted this study to determine whether the cytogenetic response after autografting was correlated with the number of BCR ABL-positive cells present within the stem cell grafts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: By BCR-ABL mRNA quantification, we studied the serial pheresis products from 40 Philadelphia (Ph)-positive patients who received ICE/mini-ICE mobilization therapy and underwent autologous stem cell transplantation. We correlated the residual disease within the graft reinfused with the cytogenetic response following transplantation, taking into consideration those responses that lasted 12 months or more. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients received a graft with 0-35% Ph-metaphases and 19 received a graft with BCR-ABL/ABL ratio < or =0.01. After a median of 27 months (range, 12-50) from transplant, 18 patients achieved complete or major cytogenetic response lasting at least 12 months, and 14 of them (78%) received a graft with BCR-ABL/ABL ratio < or =0.01 (range, 0.0003-0.01). Twenty-two patients experienced short-lived responses or had >35% Ph-positive cells in the marrow after transplant, but only 5 of them (23%) had a graft with BCR-ABL/ABL ratio < or =0.01 (range, 0.001-0.01). Therefore, we found a strong association between a BCR-ABL/ABL ratio less than or =0.01 and the achievement of complete or major cytogenetic remission after autografting (chi(2) test, p = 0.0001). Patients reinfused with grafts contaminated at low levels with leukemic cells also showed a longer duration of the response (log-rank test, p = 0.0009). Eleven patients were reinfused with the lowest level of contaminated stem cell collections, according to the BCR-ABL/ABL ratio. None of these patients experienced prolonged neutropenia or thrombocytopenia following stem cell reinfusion and nine of them had long-lasting complete or major cytogenetic responses after transplant.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: [corrected] Normal as well as leukemic B-cell progenitors were examined by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence study. RESULTS: [corrected] In a survey of the expression of a broad range of signal transduction molecules, the Src-family protein tyrosine kinases were found to be differentially expressed in early B-cell differentiation. [corrected] Analysis of freshly prepared precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and B-lineage cell lines showed Hck and Lyn are major Src-family protein tyrosine kinases expressed in this type of leukemic blasts. [corrected] However, heterogeneity of Hck and Lyn expression was found in these cells, and precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells subsequently were classified according to the expression pattern of Hck and Lyn as Hck/Lyn dual-negative, Hck-predominant, Hck/Lyn dual-positive, and Lyn-predominant. Further studies on normal B-lineage cells indicated that the Src-family protein tyrosine kinases are expressed sequentially in a differentiation-dependent fashion during B-cell ontogeny and that the predominant expression of Hck is a common feature in B-cell progenitors, whereas Lyn expression is more significant in mature B cells. CONCLUSIONS: Although the biologic significance remains unknown, sequential expression of Src-family protein tyrosine kinases should play a role in regulation of early B-cell differentiation.",,,,,,['Exp Hematol. 2000 Mar;28(3):347'],,,,,,,,,,

Autocrine growth factor production is a postulated mechanism of autonomous growth. We sought to examine this using murine AML cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have utilized a Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) model of AML to investigate the nature of autonomous in vitro growth of myeloid leukemic cells. RESULTS: Like human AML, M-MuLV-induced myeloid leukemic cells displayed autonomous growth in unstimulated high cell density cultures. However, replating of individual, primary, growth factor autonomous colonies of leukemic cells demonstrated the presence of clonogenic cells capable of autonomous growth when cultured at low cell density. In addition, there was heterogeneity in the progeny of these cells: both factor-dependent leukemic cells and cells autonomous of exogenous factor were observed. CONCLUSION: We propose that clonogenic cells capable of autonomous growth at low cell density represent leukemic progenitors while the majority of leukemic cells derived from these ""autonomous"" leukemic cells are factor-dependent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these cell types, the megakaryocytes are classified as obligate polyploid cells, developing a polyploid DNA content regularly during the normal life cycle of the organism, while other cells may become polyploid only in response to certain stimuli. The objective of this review is to briefly describe the different cell cycle alterations that may lead to high ploidy, while focusing on the megakaryocyte and the importance of high ploidy to platelet level and function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Relevant articles appearing in scientific journals and books published in the United States and in Europe during the years 1910-1999 were used as resources for this review. We selected fundamental studies related to cell cycle regulation as well as studies relevant to the regulation of the endomitotic cell cycle in megakaryocytes. Also surveyed were publications describing the relevance of high ploidy to high platelet count and to platelet reactivity, in normal situations and in a disease state. RESULTS: Different cells may achieve polyploidy through different alterations in the cell cycle machinery. CONCLUSIONS: While upregulation of cyclin D3 further augments ploidy in polyploidizing megakaryocytes in vivo, future investigation should aim to explore how normal megakaryocytes may initiate the processes of skipping late anaphase and cytokinesis associated with high ploidy. In humans, under normal conditions, megakaryocyte ploidy correlates with platelet volume, and large platelets are highly reactive.

METHODS: Data for 0-15 year old children diagnosed between 1990 and 1994 in the United Kingdom West Midlands were used. Postcode addresses were used to locate the point of residence which was compared with proximity to main roads and petrol stations separately, and to both together. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with solid tumours as a control, and incidence ratios (IRs) with population density as a control. RESULTS: The method based on solid tumours as a control showed ORs of 1.61 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.90 to 2.87) and 1.99 (95% CI 0.73 to 5.43), for those living within 100 m of a main road or petrol station respectively. When population was used as a control, the estimated IRs for leukaemia were 1.16 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.72) and 1.48 (95% CI 0.65 to 2.93) for residence within 100 m of a main road or petrol station respectively, but neither reached significance at the 95% level. Results for residence in close proximity to both a main road and petrol station were inconsistent, but there were few. The influence of socioeconomic factors as represented by the Townsend deprivation index on leukaemia incidence was not significant and the results were not explicable on the basis of impact of social class. CONCLUSIONS: The results are suggestive of a small increase in risk of childhood leukaemia, but not solid tumours, for those living in close proximity to a main road or petrol station. This increase in risk is not, however, significant and a larger study is warranted to establish the true risk and causes of any increase in risk.",,PMC1757680,,,,,,['Occup Environ Med. 2000 Jul;57(7):500-1.

Whereas treatment results were significantly improved compared with the results of former non-standard treatment strategies, the substantial toxicity of these protocols required a high standard of supportive care, and the high costs of treatment became a major problem. In 1991, a new protocol was developed with the aim of reducing toxicity and costs without affecting efficacy of the treatment. Since 1991, a single-centre study comparing the new Russian Protocol, Moscow-Berlin 91 (MB), with a modified version of the protocol ALL BFM 90 (BFM) of the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster group was performed in Moscow to evaluate possible advantages of the new protocol under Russian conditions. The aim of the present analysis was to compare toxicity, need of supportive care and expense of both regimens (BFM, 25 pts; MB, 32 pts). Hepatotoxicity (liver enzymes), nephrotoxicity (creatinine), duration of neutropenia, and platelet transfusions were similar in both protocols. The median erythrocyte transfusion level was greater in the BFM (1000 ml/m2) than the MB patients (505 ml/m2, P < 0.01), as was the length of intravenous (i.v.) antibiotic therapy (22 days BFM versus 9 days MB, P < 0.01), treatment delays (39 days BFM versus 21 days MB, P < 0.001), and duration of in-patient treatment (47 days BFM versus 18 days MB, P < 0.001). Side-effects of the MB protocol occurred mainly during induction therapy. Total costs (mean cost/person/m2 body surface) of treatment including supportive care were 1.73-fold higher for the BFM protocol than MB, whereas costs of cytostatic drugs were comparable in both groups. In Russia both protocols were feasible. During consolidation therapy tolerance to treatment was better in MB 91 compared with BFM 90m, whereas toxicity during induction therapy was similar in both protocols. With respect to costs and side-effects, the MB 91 protocol appears to be an alternative to established protocols for countries with limited financial and clinical resources.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The overexpression of the genes directly (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2, BCL-2) or indirectly (multidrug resistance gene-1, MDR1) involved in the suppression of apoptosis, as well as the low-level expression of their antagonists (BCL-2 associated X-protein, BAX) result in longer survival and the development of drug resistance in malignant cells. AIM: The objective of this study was to design our own appropriate primers and to synthesize internal RNA standards and this way to evaluate the rate of expression of the MDR1, BCL-2 and BAX genes using a competitive reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (cRT-PCR). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirates from 5 patients and 3 healthy controls were used for RNA extraction. Competitive RT-PCR was employed utilizing the constructed specific primers and synthesized internal RNA standards. Following electrophoresis, the PCR products stained with ethidium bromide were evaluated on the ""Gel Doc 1000TM"" video image system. RESULTS: The constructed primers specific for each of the three genes and synthesized internal RNA standards with a suitable deletion allow receiving the yield of well-separated competitive amplicons. The measured band's intensity of light and the calculated standard/patient ratio were employed in the analysis of the MDR1, BCL-2 and BAX gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Competitive RT-PCR is a non-radioactive and comparatively rapid molecular biology method suitable for everyday laboratory practice. The possibility for simultaneous evaluation of the expression of several genes could help in the elucidation of some of the mechanisms underlying the prolonged survival of malignant cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Direct involvement of BRCA1 in the development of breast and ovarian cancer is suggested by the finding that the BRCA1 promoter region CpG island is methylated in a proportion of breast and ovarian cancers. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of BRCA1 promoter region methylation in tumours in which loss of BRCA1 has been shown to play a role in pathogenesis (breast and ovarian carcinomas) with the incidence in tumours in which BRCA1 is unlikely to play a role in pathogenesis. Promoter region hypermethylation was significantly more common (P < 0.008) in breast and ovarian cancer (6/38 tumours methylated) than in colon cancer (0/35 tumours methylated) or in leukaemias (0/19 samples methylated). The restriction of BRCA1 promoter region hypermethylation to breast and ovarian cancer is consistent with a pathogenetic role of BRCA1 promoter methylation in these tumours. We suggest that the rarity of observed BRCA1 mutations in sporadic breast and ovarian cancer is due to the greater likelihood of BRCA1 inactivation by non-mutational mechanisms such as methylation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Nineteen patients with isolated CNS relapse and 4 with combined CNS/marrow or CNS/testicular relapse received treatment according to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) protocols CHP-449 and CHP-497. CNS treatment included intrathecal methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone and 1,800 cGy CSI in 16 fractions over 12 months. Systemic therapy consisted of reinductions with vincristine, prednisone, and daunorubicin and reconsolidations with cytarabine, etoposide, and L-asparaginase every 56 days for 2 years. Outcome measures were event-free survival (EFS), survival, growth, and neuropsychologic assessment or school performance. RESULTS: Follow-up of survivors from first relapse ranges from 52 to 133 months(median 91 months). Actuarial survival and EFSat 10 years are 58% (CI95 = 38-78%) and 54% (CI95 = 32-76%). Events include 2 second CNS, 4 marrow, 1 testicular, and 2 testicular/marrow relapses and 1 secondary leukemia. EFS is 100% (CI95 = 93-100%) in 9 patients with recurrence more than 26 months from diagnosis. Three patients have significant treatment-related reduction in stature. Median full-scale IQs of 6 patients tested were 112 pretreatment and 111 posttreatment among surviving patients. All 17 survivors attend regular school, but 2 receive supplementary special services. CONCLUSIONS: Lower dose, hypofractionated CSI, intrathecal chemotherapy, and moderately intensive systemic chemotherapy provide excellent disease control for patients with late isolated CNS or combined marrow and CNS relapse. Children with brief first remissions remain at substantial risk of subsequent relapse with this therapy, especially in the marrow and testes.",,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

While these studies mainly have described aberrations of MDM2 and p53 function at the DNA and mRNA-level, we have examined p53 and MDM2 expression at the protein level. Mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene may result in cellular accumulation of the p53 protein, due to prolonged half-life of the abnormal protein. The p53 protein can also be rendered nonfunctional by overexpression of proteins that bind to p53, such as MDM2. Both pathways have been proposed to disrupt cell cycle regulation in humans. Recent studies have shown that increased expressions of MDM2 as well as of p53 can be detected at the protein level in the absence of gene amplification. PROCEDURE: Forty-three bone marrow samples were analyzed immunohistochemically for p53 and MDM2. Twenty-nine bone marrow samples were obtained in children with active, prognostically unfavorable leukemia and MDS. Fourteen bone marrow samples were from children with non-malignant hematological disorders. RESULTS: p53 protein was expressed in 12 patients and MDM2 in 17 patients with leukemia. In the control group MDM2 expression was detected in one child, while p53 was not found in any of the samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of p53 or MDM2 positive cells in a majority of children with unfavorable prognostic features suggests that dysfunction of the p53-dependent cell growth control have a role in the development of high risk leukemias.",,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: This was a prospective, demographic study of the frequency of molecular markers of MRD in all patients with ALL presenting over 5 years within the Northern Health Region of England (population 3.1 million). Presentation marrow samples were examined to detect informative markers. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-four children (age <15 years) developed non-Burkitt ALL. No material was available for study in 21. Eighty-six had clonal gene rearrangements (BCR/ABL, immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) and/or T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements). All entered remission; 84 (68% of the original cohort) survived to become eligible for MRD studies. One hundred sixteen adults developed ALL, of whom 48 were not studied due to insufficient cellular material in the bone marrow aspirate or to logistical problems in central referral of samples from other hospitals. Material from elderly adults (age >55 years) was less likely to be sent for analysis, 36% vs. 59% (P = 0.024). Thirty-eight had BCR/ABL and/or IGH/TCR gene rearrangements. Thirty-one (27% of the original cohort) entered remission and became eligible for MRD studies. Informative gene rearrangements were more common in children than adults (83% vs. 63%, P < 0.003).

Prior reports on pediatric patients have shown evidence of cost savings in some studies, but no such evidence in others. In this study a retrospective analysis compared the costs of inpatient supportive care for pediatric patients with T-cell leukemia and advanced lymphoblastic lymphoma enrolled in a Pediatric Oncology Group trial. PROCEDURE: Patients 1-22 years of age were randomized to receive either granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; n = 45) or no G-CSF (n = 43) following induction and two cycles of maintenance therapy. There were no significant differences in neutropenia-related outcomes during the induction phase. During maintenance therapy, G-CSF patients had significantly fewer days to an ANC >500 cells/microl and a trend towards fewer days of hospitalization. Data on resource utilization were tabulated from case report forms. Costs were imputed from national data on hospitalization costs, average wholesale prices of pharmaceuticals, and patient billing information from a single institution. RESULTS: Total median costs of supportive care were $34,190 for patients receiving G-CSF and $28,653 for patients not receiving G-CSF (P > 0. 05 for the cost difference). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the total cost difference was not statistically significant, even in scenarios that included reasonable variations in estimates of the range of the length of stay, antibiotic regimen, and dosage and cost of G-CSF. CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of pediatric leukemia, the cost of growth factor may offset potential savings from shorter hospital stays or lower antibiotic use, a finding consistent with that from the Children's Cancer Study Group.",,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,"['CA30969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33603/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA69177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) appear to be the dominant local regulators of these intrauterine inflammatory processes. In the present study we have examined the direct interactions between cytokines and CRH in the endometrium. For this purpose we have measured the effects of IL-1, IL-6 and LIF on the activity of CRH promoter inserted in human endometrial cells in culture. Homologous transient transfection experiments were conducted employing a 0.9-kb fragment of the 5' flanking region of the human CRH gene coupled to the luciferase reporter gene, using Ishikawa human endometrial cells. We have found that IL-1beta increased the activity of CRH gene promoter, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This effect was antagonized by the IL-1 receptor antagonist IL-1ra and blocked completely by the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. Similarly, IL-6 increased the activity of CRH promoter in a dose-dependent fashion, an effect partially reversed by indomethacin. LIF did not have any apparent effect. In conclusion, our data suggest that IL-1 and IL-6 exert a strong stimulatory effect on the expression of endometrial CRH. This effect is most probably mediated via prostaglandins. Based on these data we hypothesize that in the human endometrium interleukins, prostaglandins and CRH form a local network regulating the inflammatory phenomena taking place within the uterine cavity.",,,"['Copyright 1999 S.

This process is controlled by factors intrinsic and extrinsic to the cell. While the effect of extrinsic cues on multipotent stem cells of the murine central nervous system (CNS) is becoming clearer, little is known of neural stem cells of human origin. We sought to establish the roles played by two cytokines, leukemia inhibitory (LIF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and by nerve growth factor (NGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in regulating neuronal and astroglial differentiation in cultured embryonic diencephalic human stem cells. While NGF did not influence either neuronal or glial formation, PDGF surprisingly decreased the percentage of stem cell-generated neurons, an effect opposite to that observed in murine progenitors. Furthermore, while we confirmed the known ability of LIF and CNTF to support astroglial differentiation, we also observed that, in contrast with their murine counterparts, the fraction of CNS stem cell-generated neurons in human cultures was enhanced twofold in the presence of both cytokines. These findings highlight important differences between humans and rodents in regard to the way epigenetic cues regulate the function of neural stem cells.",,,"['Copyright 2000 S.

CLL cells express CD40, a key regulator of B cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. In nonmalignant B cells, CD40 ligation results in nuclear translocation and activation of NF-kappaB proteins. Based on observations that in some CLL cases, the tumor cells express both CD40 and its ligand, CD154 (CD40 ligand), we proposed a model for CLL pathogenesis due to CD40 ligation within the tumor. To evaluate this issue, we used freshly isolated CLL B cells to examine constitutive and inducible NF-kappaB activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. We consistently observed high levels of nuclear NF-kappaB-binding activity in unstimulated CLL B cells relative to that detected in nonmalignant human B cells. In each case examined, CD40 ligation further augmented NF-kappaB activity and prolonged CLL cell survival in vitro. The principle NF-kappaB proteins in stimulated CLL cells appear to be quite similar to those in nonmalignant human B cells and include p50, p65, and c-Rel. In a CD154-positive case, blocking CD154 engagement by mAb to CD154 resulted in inhibition of NF-kappaB activity in the CLL cells. The addition of anti-CD154 mAb resulted in accelerated CLL cell death to a similar degree as was observed in cells exposed to dexamethasone. These data indicate that CD40 engagement has a profound influence on NF-kappaB activity and survival in CLL B cells, and are consistent with a role for CD154-expressing T and B cells in CLL pathogenesis. The data support the development of novel therapies based on blocking the CD154-CD40 interaction in CLL.",,,,,,,"['CA-68155/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-71589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

LIF, oncostatin M (OSM), IL-6, M-CSF, and stem cell factor (SCF) mRNA were elevated in normal and myasthenia gravis-aged thymuses, and correlated with decreased levels of thymopoiesis, as determined by either decreased keratin-positive thymic epithelial space or decreased thymic sjTRECs. IL-7 is a key cytokine required during the early stages of thymocyte development. Interestingly, IL-7 mRNA expression did not fall with aging in either normal or myasthenia gravis thymuses. In vivo administration of LIF, OSM, IL-6, or SCF, but not M-CSF, i.p. to mice over 3 days induced thymic atrophy with loss of CD4+, CD8+ cortical thymocytes.

We have used mAb this approach to demonstrate that cleared prototype pathogens are localized to, phagocytosed in, and destroyed in the liver. Extension of this work to a clinical setting will require a detailed understanding of the mechanism by which the E-bound immune complex substrates are transferred to fixed tissue macrophages in the liver, the transfer reaction. Therefore, we examined an in vitro system to study this process using bacteriophage phiX174 as a model pathogen. E containing phiX174 (bound via an anti-CR1/anti-phiX174 HP) were incubated with P388D1 murine macrophages, and the two cell types were separated by centrifugation through Ficoll. Both E and macrophages were then probed and analyzed by RIA or flow cytometry. The results indicate that all three components of the E-bound IC (phiX174, HP, and CR1) were removed from the E and internalized by the macrophages. We found that transfer requires the Fc portion of IgG, because little transfer of phiX174 occurs when it is bound to E CR1 using a HP containing only Fab fragments. These findings, taken in the context of other studies, suggest a general mechanism for the transfer reaction in which Fc receptors facilitate close juxtaposition of the macrophage to the E-bound IC which then allows a macrophage-associated protease to cleave CR1. The released IC are then internalized and processed by the macrophages.",,,,,,,['AR43307/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The potential Friend MuLV epitope has strong sequence homology with Moloney MuLV and only differs in one amino acid within the CTL epitope and one amino acid just outside the epitope. We now show that failure to recognize Friend MuLV-transformed tumor cells is based on a defect in proteasome-mediated processing of the Friend epitope which is due to a single amino acid substitution (N-->D) immediately flanking the C-terminal anchor residue of the epitope. Proteasome-mediated digestion analysis of a synthetic 26-mer peptide derived from the Friend sequence shows that cleavage takes place predominantly C-terminal of D, instead of V as is the case for the Moloney MuLV sequence. Therefore, the C terminus of the epitope is not properly generated. Epitope-containing peptide fragments extended with an additional C-terminal D are not efficiently translocated by TAP and do not show significant binding affinity to MHC class I-Kb molecules. Thus, a potential CTL epitope present in the Friend virus sequence is not properly processed and presented because of a natural flanking aspartic acid that obliterates the correct C-terminal cleavage site. This constitutes a novel way to subvert proteasome-mediated generation of proper antigenic peptide fragments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only one peptide, Db126, with the highest binding affinity for H-2Db molecules induced vigorous CTL responses. The CTLs specifically lysed not only Db126-pulsed target cells dependently upon Db126 concentrations but also WT1-expressing tumor cells in an H-2Db-restricted manner. The sensitizing activity to the Db126-specific CTLs was recovered from the cell extract of WT1-expressing tumor cells targeted by the CTLs in the same retention time as that needed for the synthetic Db126 peptide in RP-HPLC, indicating that the Db126-specific CTLs recognize the Db126 peptide to kill WT1-expressing target cells. Furthermore, mice immunized with the Db126 peptide rejected challenges by WT1-expressing tumor cells and survived for a long time with no signs of autoaggression by the CTLs. Thus, the WT1 protein was identified as a novel tumor Ag. Immunotherapy targeting the WT1 protein should find clinical application for various types of human cancers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is thus important to find therapeutic agents that can inhibit colon cancer cells with altered p53 status. beta-Lapachone, a novel topoisomerase inhibitor, has been shown to induce cell death in human promyelocytic leukemia and prostate cancer cells through a p53-independent pathway. Here we examined the effects of beta-lapachone on human colon cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Several human colon cancer cell lines, SW480, SW620, and DLD1, with mutant or defective p53, were used. The antiproliferative effects of beta-lapachone were assessed by colony formation assays, cell cycle analysis, and apoptosis analysis, including annexin V staining and DNA laddering analysis. The effects on cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory proteins were examined by immunoblotting. RESULTS: All three cell lines, SW480, SW620, and DLD1, were sensitive to beta-lapachone, with an IC(50) of 2 to 3 microM in colony formation assays, a finding similar to that previously reported for prostate cancer cells. However, these cells were arrested in different stages of S phase. At 24 hr post-treatment, beta-lapachone induced S-, late S/G2-, and early S-phase arrest in SW480, SW620, and DLD1 cells, respectively. The cell cycle alterations induced by beta-lapachone were congruous with changes in cell cycle regulatory proteins such as cyclin A, cyclin B1, cdc2, and cyclin D1. Moreover, beta-lapachone induced apoptosis, as demonstrated by annexin V staining, flow cytometric analysis of DNA content, and DNA laddering analysis. Furthermore, down-regulation of mutant p53 and induction of p27 in SW480 cells, and induction of pro-apoptotic protein Bax in DLD1 cells may be pertinent to the anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of beta-lapachone on these cells. CONCLUSIONS: beta-Lapachone induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human colon cancer cells through a p53-independent pathway. For human colon cancers, which often contain p53 mutations, beta-lapachone may prove to be a promising anticancer agent that can target cancer cells, especially those with mutant p53.",,PMC2230485,,,,,"['2-T32-CA09361/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA61253/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

However, the function of these motifs is still not clear. Studying ALL-1 presents an additional challenge because the gene is the human homologue of Drosophila trithorax. The latter is a member of the trithorax-Polycomb gene family which acts to determine the body pattern of Drosophila by maintaining expression or repression of the Antennapedia-bithorax homeotic gene complex. Here we apply yeast two hybrid methodology, in vivo immunoprecipitation and in vitro 'pull down' techniques to show self association of the SET motifs of ALL-1, TRITHORAX and ASH1 proteins (Drosophila ASH1 is encoded by a trithorax-group gene).

MAbs 2H1, 4E6 and 5Cl demonstrated assay restriction: exhibiting reactivity only in ELISA. The remaining three MAbs (G211D, G312G and V35B) and the PAb 8023 recognised recombinant TRAP (rTRAP) in ELISA and native acid phosphatases in selected tissues and cell lines. The latter were cytochemically assessed for both tartrate-sensitive acid phosphatase (TSAP) and TRAP. V35B showed reactivity against the monocytic leukaemia cell line U937 and guinea pig kidney tissue (both TSAP+ and TRAP+) and ECV304 (TSAP+) cells. Interestingly, the reactivity of MAb G211D co-localised with TRAP activity in the membrane of osteoclasts but also detected cytoplasmic components in U937 cells and human embryonic lung fibroblasts (TRAP+ and TRAP+). G211D exhibited immunoreactivity against placental trophoblasts (positive for total AP).

However, little is known about other possible mechanisms of CB-1954 action. We have examined the toxicity of CB-1954 and its derivatives to bovine leukemia virus-transformed lamb fibroblasts (line FLK), which possessed moderate DT-diaphorase activity, 260 units/mg protein. The action of these compounds was accompanied by lipid peroxidation, their toxicity was decreased by desferrioxamine and antioxidant N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylene diamine (DPPD), but, in most cases, not by dicumarol, an inhibitor of DT-diaphorase. Using multiparameter regression analysis, we have found that the toxicity of CB-1954 derivatives as well as that of several non-alkylating nitroaromatics, increased upon the increase in their single-electron reduction potential (E(1)7) and octanol/water partition coefficient (P), and almost did not depend on their reactivity towards DT-diaphorase. It seems that in cell lines with a moderate amount of DT-diaphorase, the toxicity of CB- 1954 and its analogs is exerted through their redox cycling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present studies were performed to determine the fate of AG957-treated cells and assess the selectivity of AG957 for CML myeloid progenitors. When K562 cells (derived from a patient with blast crisis CML) were treated with AG957, dose- and time-dependent p210bc/abl down-regulation was followed by mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and apoptotic morphological changes. These apoptotic changes were inhibited by transfection with cDNA encoding dominant negative caspase-9 but not dominant-negative FADD or blocking anti-Fas antibodies. In additional experiments, a 24-h AG957 exposure caused dose-dependent inhibition of K562 colony formation in soft agar. To extend these studies to clinical samples of CML, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 10 chronic phase CML patients and normal controls were assayed for the growth of hematopoietic colonies in vitro in the presence of increasing concentrations of AG957. These assays demonstrated selectivity of AG957 for CML progenitors, with median IC50s (CML versus normal) of 7.3 versus >20 microM AG957 in granulocyte colony-forming cells (P < 0.001), 5.3 versus >20 microM in granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming cells (P < 0.05), and 15.5 versus > 20 microM in erythroid colony-forming cells (P > 0.05). The adamantyl ester of AG957 (NSC 680410) down-regulated p210bcr/abl in K562 cells and inhibited granulocyte colony formation in CML specimens at lower concentrations without enhanced toxicity in normal progenitors. These observations not only demonstrate that AG957-induced p210bcr/abl down-regulation is followed by activation of the cytochrome c/Apaf-1/caspase-9 pathway but also indicate that this class of kinase inhibitor exhibits selectivity worthy of further evaluation.",,,,,,,"['R01 CA069008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA69008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA69912/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

All patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive early chronic phase CML (i.e., within 1 year of diagnosis) treated with IFN alpha-based therapy at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1980 and 1997, in whom pretreatment B2M levels were available, were investigated. Two hundred one patients were evaluable. Their median B2M was 2.2 mg/dl (range, 1.1-20 mg/dl). Serum B2M levels were associated with other variables of prognostic significance, including age, spleen size, WBC count, percentage of peripheral and marrow blasts, and percentage of marrow basophils. Patients with B2M levels >2.9 mg/dl (ie., the upper quartile of the distribution) had a significantly lower rate of major cytogenetic response compared to those in the lower three quartiles (20 versus 52%; P < 0.01). They also had a shorter survival, with a 5-year survival rate of 48%, compared with 75% for those in the lower quartiles (P = 0.01). High B2M levels (>2.9 mg/dl) could identify a group of patients with an adverse outcome within patients in stage I disease (P = 0.02). Results for patients in stages 2-4 were inconclusive because of the small number of patients in these groups. We conclude that serum B2M levels are an important, and probably independent, prognostic factor for patients with CML in early chronic phase treated with IFN-based therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Epidemiological investigation and detailed environmental assessment. SETTING: A tertiary-care university hospital with a 37-bed leukemia and BMT unit PARTICIPANTS: Leukemic or BMT patients with invasive aspergillosis identified through prospective surveillance and confirmed by chart review. INTERVENTIONS: We verified the diagnosis of invasive fungal infection by reviewing medical charts of at-risk patients, performing a case-control study to determine risk factors for infection, instituting wet mopping to clean all floors, providing N95 masks to protect patients outside high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered areas, altering traffic patterns into the unit, and performing molecular typing of selected Aspergillus flavus isolates. To assess the environment, we verified pressure relationships between the rooms and hallway and between buildings, and we compared the ability of large-volume (1,200 L) and small-volume (160 L) air samplers to detect Aspergillus spores. RESULTS: Of 29 potential invasive aspergillosis cases, 21 were confirmed by medical chart review. Risk factors for developing invasive aspergillosis included the length of time since malignancy was diagnosed (odds ratio [OR], 1.0; P=.05) and hospitalization in a patient room located near a stairwell door (OR, 3.7; P=.05). Two of five A. flavus patient isolates were identical to one of the environmental isolates. The pressure in most of the rooms was higher than in the corridors, but the pressure in the oncology unit was negative with respect to the physically adjacent hospital; consequently, the unit acted essentially as a vacuum that siphoned non-HEPA-filtered air from the main hospital. Of the 78 samples obtained with a small-volume air sampler, none grew an Aspergillus species, whereas 10 of 40 cultures obtained with a large-volume air sampler did. CONCLUSIONS: During active construction, Aspergillus spores may have entered the oncology unit from the physically adjacent hospital because the air pressure differed. Guidelines that establish the minimum acceptable pressures and specify which pressure relationships to test in healthcare settings are needed. Our data show that large-volume air samples are superior to small-volume samples to assess for Aspergillus in the healthcare environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Two population-based case-control studies of children diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes mellitus from Yorkshire (0-15 years) and Northern Ireland (0-14 years) included 220 and 189 cases and 433 and 465 controls, respectively. Parental occupations were coded using a standard occupational classification. Each job was allocated to high, medium or low levels of social mixing according to a predefined categorization. Odds ratios (OR) for the risk of childhood Type 1 diabetes were estimated for parental social mixing by age at diagnosis. RESULTS: Childhood Type 1 diabetes mellitus was not associated with high levels of parental occupational social mixing (Yorkshire - mothers: OR 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76-1.50; fathers: 1.15, 0.75-1.76; Northern Ireland - heads of household, usually the father: 0.78, 0.49-1.25). A larger proportion of mothers (39%) compared to fathers (18% Yorkshire, 17% Northern Ireland) had jobs involving high levels of social mixing. Mothers with high social mixing jobs conferred a nonsignificant reduced risk of Type 1 diabetes among children diagnosed under 5 years of age (0.58, 0.24-1.38) compared to those diagnosed at age 5 years and above (1.14, 0.77-1.69). CONCLUSIONS: No association between parental occupational social mixing and the risk of childhood Type 1 diabetes mellitus was detected for all ages combined. Mothers were more likely to have jobs involving high levels of social mixing than fathers. The possible protective effect of maternal high occupational social mixing on children diagnosed below 5 years of age merits further investigation.",,,,,,,,['Diabet Med. 2000 Jun;17(6):490-1.

DESIGN: A questionnaire designed by the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IOIBD) was mailed to 300 gastroenterologists, living in North America (n = 76) and Europe (n = 224) (12 countries), to obtain information on clinical experience. PARTICIPANTS: More than half of the respondents (168/298; 56.4%) worked in university hospitals and 58/298 (19.5%) in general (non-university) hospitals. Two-thirds (65%) had more than 10 years' experience in gastroenterology. RESULTS: The respondents had personal experience with AZA (88.4%), 6-MP (33.3%), CyA (48.7%) and MTX (36.3%). AZA was prescribed more frequently in Europe (92.6%) than in North America (74.2%) (P = 0.0002), 6-MP less frequently by the European than the North American respondents (23.8 and 53.3% respectively, P = 0.0001). Two-thirds (69.7%) usually prescribed AZA together with steroids to Crohn's disease patients; 62.4% of the respondents prescribed AZA for periods longer than 24 months. For ulcerative colitis, 77.9% had experience with AZA (Europe > North America, P = 0.0001). AZA had been prescribed by 69 respondents to pregnant patients, without apparent toxicity. Acute pancreatitis had been observed after AZA by 56.7% respondents; 25 malignancies were mentioned (six lymphoma, three leukaemia, three colon cancer, four renal carcinoma, nine others). CyA had been prescribed in acute ulcerative colitis by 140/291 respondents (North America 45.1%, Europe 49.1 %); of all respondents 63.9% treated < 5 patients with CyA, 36.1% 6-20 cases. CyA results were considered good in 29.5%, acceptable but with recurrences in 58.6%, and poor in 14.3%. MTX was prescribed in North America by 47.8% of the respondents, and by 33.9% in Europe (not significant). Several significant differences were observed between the prescription behaviour of respondents working at university hospitals and non-university hospitals, in particular in relation to participation in clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable experience exists in the use of immunosuppressive therapy in IBD; however, differential prescription behaviour exists in the choice of immunosuppressives between North America and Europe. These IOIBD study results may contribute to a better insight in the daily use of immunosuppressive agents in IBD by gastroenterologists and other specialists.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 45 routinely processed bone marrow biopsy specimens (formalin fixed, paraffin embedded and mildly decalcified in EDTA) reported to contain leukaemic infiltrates on the basis of cytomorphological and enzyme-cytochemical analysis of bone marrow smears (22 c-ALL, 11 T-ALL, 2 B-ALL, 10 u-ALL (unclassified)) were immunostained by the ABC method with a broad panel of 26 antibodies against various haemopoietic antigens. RESULTS: Staining with antibodies directed against myeloperoxidase and lysozyme showed that seven cases were either biphenotypic or mixed leukaemias (2), or of myelogenous origin (acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)-M1 (2); AML-M4 (2); AML-M5a (1)). Five of these seven cases had been diagnosed initially as u-ALL. Three further cases with no compact leukaemic infiltrates were excluded. ALL was confirmed in the remaining 35 cases. Because of revised diagnoses, the total numbers of ALL subtypes changed (23 c-ALL, 8 T-ALL, 2 B-ALL, 2 u-ALL). Immunostaining of more than 10% of blast cells in at least one case was found with 19 of the 26 antibodies. The most sensitive lineage specific antibodies for diagnosis were found to be anti-CD10 for c-ALL (22/23) and beta F1 for T-ALL (6/8). Expression of aberrant antigens was fairly common--for example, 7/23 cases of c-ALL stained with antibodies against T cell associated antigens. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical investigation of routinely processed bone marrow biopsy specimens enables reliable detection of ALL subtypes c-ALL and T-ALL. A minimum panel of antibodies, against TdT, CD34, myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, CD10, CD79a, and CD20, and the antibody beta F1, is proposed for the immunophenotyping of acute leukaemia.",,PMC501546,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The differentiation-inducing activity of various hemin-related compounds suggested certain structural requirements for the activity: 1) the iron moiety of hemin is not essential, and 2) the propionic acid side chains of hemin play an important role in the differentiation and induction. In addition, we have examined the influence of some bioresponse-modifying factors on hemin/protoporphyrin IX-induced differentiation of K562 cell line. Retinoids and tubulin-disruptors, themselves did not induce differentiation, enhanced hemin/protoporphyrin IX-induced differentiation of K562 cells. We also examined the possible involvement of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) in hemin/protoporphyrin IX-induced differentiation on K562 cell lines. The PBR specific ligands modified hemin-induced differentiation. These results suggest a requirement for retinoids (or retinoids-like cofactors) for hemin/protoporphyrin IX-induced differentiation of K562 cells and the involvement of PBR in erythroid differentiation of K562 cell line. Further we showed that TPA suppresses hemin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells, while retinoids augment it. TPA is a potent inducer of heme oxygenase (HO), which catabolizes heme to biliverdin. An HO inhibitor, tin protoporphyrin (SnPP), suppresses TPA-induced K562 cell differentiation to monocytes. It was also found that cotreatment of K562 cells with SnPP and TPA induces erythroid differentiation of K562 cells, though SnPP alone or TPA alone does not induce erythroid differentiation, suggesting a role of HO in the directional switch of differentiation.",,,,24,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thawed morulae (n = 206) were randomly distributed between 10 treatment groups: medium alone control (CT), Vero (VR) cells, leukaemia inhibitory factor (1 ng/ml), interleukin-6 (1 ng/ml), transforming growth factor (TGF) alpha (2 ng/ml), epidermal growth factor (EGF) (4 ng/ml), platelet-derived growth factor (1 ng/ml), insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I (30 ng/ml), IGF-II (1 ng/ml) and TGFbeta (2 ng/ml). At 4, 8, 20, 30 and 48 h, a digitized image of each thawed embryo was captured and stored for later analysis. The following parameters were examined: blastocoel formation, blastocyst expansion, zona thickness and hatching. At termination of the experiment, cell number per embryo was determined by bisbenzimide staining. When contrasted to the medium alone control, co-culture consistently accelerated the development of frozen-thawed morulae to the hatched blastocyst stage, allowing embryos to recover rapidly from any damage sustained during the cryopreservation process. While no single growth factor/cytokine was able to completely mimic the results achieved with co-culture, all of the growth factors impacted positively on at least one of the morphological parameters studied. Cell proliferation was significantly stimulated by just 48 h exposure to growth factors, either through co-culture or by direct media supplementation. Co-culture again yielded the best results with a mean cell count of 217 +/- 76 cells per blastocyst as compared with 131 +/- 36 in control medium alone. Amongst the factors tested, IGF-I, IGF-II and EGF had the greatest impact, with mean cell counts of 172 +/- 50, 168 +/- 50 and 179 +/- 55 respectively. Whereas only 5% of CT embryos developed to blastocysts with > 200 cells, 51% of thawed embryos placed on co-culture monolayers and 25-32% of embryos cultured with IGF-I, IGF-II or EGF had > 200 cells. This study for the first time systematically describes the effect of culture regimen and growth factor additives on the post-thaw development of cryopreserved embryos.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rhombomere r4-specific expression of both Hoxb1 and Hoxb2 depends upon bipartite cis Hox response elements for the group 1 paralogous proteins, Hoxal and Hoxbl. The DNA-binding ability and selectivity of these proteins depend upon the formation of specific heterodimeric complexes with members of the PBC homeodomain protein family (Pbx genes). The r4 enhancers from Hoxb1 and Hoxb2 have the same activity, but differ with respect to the number and organisation of bipartite Pbx/Hox (PH) sites required, suggesting the intervention of other components/sequences. We report here that another family of homeodomain proteins (TALE, Three-Amino acids-Loop-Extension: Prep1, Meis, HTH), capable of dimerizing with Pbx/EXD, is involved in the mechanisms of r4-restricted expression. We show that: (1) the r4-specific Hoxb1 and Hoxb2 enhancers are complex elements containing separate PH and Prep/Meis (PM) sites; (2) the PM site of the Hoxb2, but not Hoxb1, enhancer is essential in vivo for r4 expression and also influences other sites of expression; (3) both PM and PH sites are required for in vitro binding of Prepl-Pbx and formation and binding of a ternary Hoxbl-Pbxla (or 1b)-Prepl complex. (4) A similar ternary association forms in nuclear extracts from embryonal P19 cells, but only upon retinoic acid induction. This requires synthesis of Hoxbl and also contains Pbx with either Prepl or Meisl. Together these findings highlight the fact that PM sites are found in close proximity to bipartite PH motifs in several Hox responsive elements shown to be important in vivo and that such sites play an essential role in potentiating regulatory activity in combination with the PH motifs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RA had significantly decreased numbers of cells expressing CD34 (0.21 +/- 0.29 x 10(6)/l) compared with normal subjects (0.81 +/- 0.36 x 10(6)/l)(P < 0.001). This low number of CD34+ cells in RA resembles the case of AA (0.39 +/- 0.73 x 10(6)/l). In light-scatter analysis, the CD34+ cells of RA patients were distributed mainly in low forward scatter (FSC) (lymphocyte region). In contrast, the CD34+ cell counts were extremely high in patients with RAEB (46.54 +/- 71.37 x 10(6)/l) and RAEB-t (57.00 +/- 52.36 x 10(6)/l) (P < 0.001) and the CD34+ cells were observed in high FSC (blast region).CMML patients showed moderately increased numbers of CD34+ cells (3.69 +/- 4.64 x 10(6)/l). Thus, there was a distinct difference in cell size and number of circulating CD34+ cells between RA and RAEB/RAEB-t. In univariate and multivariate analysis, a high CD34+ cell count (> or = 1.0 x 10(6)/l) was a poor prognostic factor. This method allows one to distinguish RA from other MDS subtypes more reliably than by morphology alone and provides early signs of progression to acute leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In CEM leukemia cells, dexamethasone showed an antileukemic effect by inducing G1 arrest and apoptosis. DFMO, which depleted cellular polyamines by inhibiting ornithine decarboxylase, induced G1 arrest but without apoptosis, though it enhanced dexamethasone-induced G1 arrest and apoptosis. The G1 arrest was associated with hypophosphorylation of pRb. Dexamethasone inhibited the increase of mutated p53 expression but had little effect on p2Wafl/Cip1 expression. The p27Kip1, level was increased by dexamethasone or and DFMO in line with the kinetics of G1 arrest.

The course of the disease ranges from a chronic status with progressively impaired hematopoiesis to rapid evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A panel of continuous malignant hematopoietic cell lines has been established from the whole spectrum of MDS variants and also from the different stages of the diseases, namely from the MDS phase or the overt leukemia post-MDS phase. Ten cell lines were derived from the various MDS subtypes; 17 cell lines were established from patients with leukemia (mainly AML) post-MDS. While most cell lines display myelocytic, monocytic or erythroid features, some cell lines carry lymphoid characteristics (precursor B-cell, B-cell, or T-cell), With regard to these lymphoid MDS-derived cell lines, more detailed authentication (prove of derivation from the assumed patient) and verification (prove of the malignant nature of the cell line and derivation from the assumed neoplastic cells) are required to validate the cell lines as true in vitro representatives of MDS and to exclude any cross-contamination with other cells or immortalization of normal bystander cells. On the other hand, lymphoid MDS-derived cell lines may attest to the clonal nature of MDS which may afflict progenitor cells giving rise to lymphoid or myelomonocytoid cells. Many of the MDS-derived cell lines carry cytogenetic and molecular genetic abnormalities typically associated with MDS: gain or loss of all or parts of chromosomes 5, 7, 8 and 20 (-5/5q-, -7/7q-, + 8, 20q-); alterations of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (IRF-1, p15, p16, p53, RAS, RB). In summary, the present panel of cell lines provides continuously growing cells and thus unlimited cell material for use as in vitro paradigms covering the whole spectrum of MDS-related hematopoetic malignancies. Properly authenticated and verified MDS-derived cell lines which should be made freely available will represent important research tools for the study of MDS biology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For four cancer sites, namely lung cancer, bone cancer, ovarian cancer and leukaemia, the relative risks in the comparable (age at exposure, time since exposure, sex matched) subsets of the Japanese data are significantly greater than those in the majority of second cancer studies. Even when the differences between the relative risks in the Japanese atomic bomb survivors and the medical series do not approach conventional levels of statistical significance, relative risks tend to be higher in the Japanese data than in the second cancer studies. At least for leukaemia, the discrepancy between the Japanese and second cancer risks can be largely explained by cell-sterilisation effects. There are few indications of modification of radiation-associated second cancer relative risk among those treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, nor are there strong indications of modification of radiation-associated relative risk by heritable genetic factors. If anything, there is evidence that second cancer relative excess risks are lower among those patients with cancer-prone disorders than among non-susceptible patients. However, the higher underlying cancer risk in some of these medically exposed populations should also be considered, in particular for those with cancer-prone conditions, so that the absolute excess risk is sometimes higher than in the Japanese data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the topological organization of chromosomes 9 and 22 was investigated in cell nuclei of G0-phase lymphocytes. We found that the territories of both chromosomes are predominantly located in the central region of cell nuclei. In addition to this, chromosomes 9 and 22 were frequently associated in pairs detected as false-positive ABL-BCR fusions. Both effects might substantially increase the probability of interaction between chromosomes. Because of this, exchange aberrations were studied in chromosomes 9 and 22 of human lymphocytes irradiated by neutrons. The rate of aberration induction between these chromosomes was 11 times higher than the expected frequency based on the fractional molecular weight of these chromosomes. We show that the increased rate of exchange between chromosomes 9 and 22 induced by neutrons corresponds to the neighborhood relationships of both chromosomes. Similar topological characteristics of ABL and BCR genes were found in several cell lines: T- and B-lymphocytes. HL60 cells and bone marrow cells.

We conclude that unpurged BM grafts contain 2-3 log more residual BCR-ABL+ cells than unpurged PBSC grafts and that purging efficacy is superior in BM compared to PBSC grafts, but median titers in purged BM grafts still exceed those in purged PBSC grafts.

Prior to allogeneic transplant, wt-1 transcripts were detected by PCR in 38 of 46 patients (83%) with AL. After transplant, in 14 of 38 patients (37%) wt-1 transcripts were detected in at least one PCR assay at a median of 12 months post transplant (range 1-89 months). Twelve of the 38 patients relapsed after transplant, but only seven of the 12 were wt-1 positive after transplant. In five relapsing patients the wt-1 test remained negative 0 to 3 months prior to relapse. On the other hand, only seven of 14 patients with a positive test for wt-1 after transplant, relapsed consecutively.

Seventeen patients were diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), six with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and four with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Ages ranged from 22 to 49 years (median 37); 13 patients were female and 14 male. Relapse was diagnosed between 1 and 45 months after the first HSCT. Sixteen patients who relapsed had received an autologous transplant initially and 11 an allogeneic transplant. Ten patients relapsed within 6 months and 17 patients later than 6 months. Chemotherapy was used as reinduction for relapse after HSCT in 16 patients who had received an autologous transplant and in three who had received an allogeneic transplant, since the latter did not respond to reduction of immunosuppression to induce a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reaction. Five of these 19 patients (26%) achieved complete remission (CR), seven patients did not respond to chemotherapy and seven achieved a partial remission (PR). The stem cell source for the second HSCT included bone marrow (n = 12) and PBSC (n = 4) from genotypically identical unrelated donors, PBSC (n = 7) and bone marrow (n = 3) from related donors. Currently eight of the 27 patients are alive and disease-free after the second HSCT. One patient is alive and disease-free after two allogeneic transplants (day +1538), eight patients, who relapsed after an autologous transplant followed by an allogeneic transplant (days +248 to +1140), acute myeloid leukaemia (n = 6) and chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 2) are alive and disease-free. The overall disease-free survival is 30% (8/27). The overall disease-free survival of autologous transplant patients subsequently undergoing an allogeneic transplant is 43% (P = 0.049). It is suggested that a second HSCT is possible for patients with leukemia relapse following the first autologous transplant. A second transplant might also be offered to patients relapsing after the first allogeneic HSCT. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2000) 25, 41-45.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adults with newly diagnosed ALL referred since 1992 were entered onto the study; treatment was initiated in 204 patients between 1992 and January 1998. No exclusions were made because of older age, poor performance status, organ dysfunction, or active infection. Median age was 39.5 years; 37% were at least 50 years old. Mature B-cell disease (Burkitt type) was present in 9%, T-cell disease in 17%. Leukocytosis of more than 30 x 10(9)/L was found in 26%, Philadelphia chromosome-positive disease in 16% (20% of patients with assessable metaphases), CNS leukemia at the time of diagnosis in 7%, and a mediastinal mass in 7%. Treatment consisted of four cycles of Hyper-CVAD alternating with four cycles of high-dose methotrexate (MTX) and cytarabine therapy, together with intrathecal CNS prophylaxis and supportive care with antibiotic prophylaxis and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor therapy. Maintenance in patients with nonmature B-cell ALL included 2 years of treatment with mercaptopurine, MTX, vincristine, and prednisone (POMP). RESULTS: Overall, 185 patients (91%) achieved complete remission (CR) and 12 (6%) died during induction therapy. Estimated 5-year survival and 5-year CR rates were 39% and 38%, respectively. The incidence of CNS relapse was low (4%). Compared with 222 patients treated with vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (VAD) regimens, our patients had a better CR rate (91% v 75%, P <.01) and CR rate after one course (74% v 55%, P <.01) and better survival (P <.01), and a smaller percentage had more than 5% day 14 blasts (34% v 48%, P =.01). Previous prognostic models remained predictive for outcome with Hyper-CVAD therapy.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred eleven patients with leukemia in the early stages and with HLA-matched sibling donors were randomized in this study. One hundred one underwent transplantation. Standard procedures for collection and transplantation were used. Patients did not receive prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor after undergoing transplantation. In addition to clinical end points being established, a prospective and comparative economic evaluation of the first 6 months after transplantation was performed. RESULTS: Groups were balanced for patient, donor, and transplant characteristics. Blood cell collection led to the collection of a higher number of CD34(+) and CD3(+) cells than did bone marrow collection (P < 10(-6)) without reported side effects for the donor. Patients in the BCT group reached platelet counts of 25 and 50 x 10(9) platelets/L 8 and 11 days earlier than did the BMT group (P < 10(-4) and P < 10(-5)), respectively. This resulted in fewer platelet transfusions during the first 180 days after transplantation (P =.002) for the former group. The time to reach neutrophil counts of 0.5 and 1 x 10(9) neutrophils/L was 6 and 7 days shorter, respectively, in the BCT group than in the BMT group (P < 10(-5)). This quicker hematologic recovery was associated with a shorter length of hospitalization and a decrease in total cost of procedure during the first 6 months. CONCLUSION: This study establishes that allogeneic BCT results in quicker hematologic recovery but is associated with a higher occurrence of chronic graft-versus-host disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1985 and October 1995, 99 patients with follicular lymphoma received HDT as consolidation of second or subsequent remission. Bone marrow was treated in vitro with anti-B-cell antibodies and complement. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients remained alive, 49 treatment-failure free, with a median follow-up of 5.5 years (range, 1.5 to 12.5 years). Four ""early"" and 10 ""late"" deaths occurred from treatment-related causes; seven of the latter were due to secondary myelodysplasia (s-MDS) or secondary acute myeloblastic leukemia. Overall, 12 (12%) of the 99 patients developed s-MDS or acute myeloblastic leukemia. Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from recurrence (FFR) and survival rates at 5 years were 63% (95% confidence interval [CI], 52% to 72%) and 69% (95% CI, 58% to 78%), respectively. For all 99 patients, in multivariate analysis, absence of the Bcl-2/IgH rearrangement at the time of diagnosis (hazards ratio [HR], 0.39; P =.04) and three or fewer treatment episodes before HDT (HR, 0.03; P =.001) were significant prognostic factors for improved survival. For patients bearing Bcl-2/IgH rearrangements, in univariate and multivariate analyses, absence of a PCR-detectable Bcl-2/IgH rearrangement during follow-up was associated with a significantly lower risk of recurrence (adjusted HR, 0.13; P <.001) and death (HR, 0.25; P =.02), whereas the PCR status of the reinfused bone marrow did not correlate with outcome. CONCLUSION: Prolonged FFR can be achieved in patients with follicular lymphoma after HDT, but as yet there is no survival advantage compared with conventional treatment.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of 5,519 British patients with Hodgkin's disease treated during 1963 through 1993 was assembled and followed-up for second malignancy and mortality. Follow-up was 97% complete. RESULTS: Three hundred twenty-two second malignancies occurred. Relative risks of gastrointestinal, lung, breast, and bone and soft tissue cancers, and of leukemia, increased significantly with younger age at first treatment. Absolute excess risks and cumulative risks of solid cancers and leukemia, however, were greater at older ages than at younger ages. Gastrointestinal cancer risk was greatest after mixed-modality treatment (relative risk [RR] = 3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1 to 4.8); lung cancer risks were significantly increased after chemotherapy (RR = 3. 3; 95% CI, 2.4 to 4.7), mixed-modality treatment (RR = 4.3; 95% CI, 2.9 to 6.2), and radiotherapy (RR = 2.9; 95% CI, 1.9 to 4.1); breast cancer risk was increased only after radiotherapy without chemotherapy (RR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4 to 4.0); and leukemia risk was significantly increased after chemotherapy (RR = 31.6; 95% CI, 19.7 to 47.6) and mixed-modality treatment (RR = 38.1; 95% CI, 24.6 to 55. 9). These risks were generally greater after treatment at younger ages: for patients treated at ages younger than 25 years, there were RRs of 18.7 (95% CI, 5.8 to 43.5) for gastrointestinal cancer after mixed-modality treatment, 14.4 (95% CI, 5.7 to 29.3) for breast cancer after radiotherapy, and 85.2 (95% CI, 45.3 to 145.7) for leukemia after chemotherapy (with or without radiotherapy). CONCLUSION: Age at treatment has a major effect on risk of second malignancy after Hodgkin's disease. Although absolute excess risks are greater for older patients, RRs of several important malignancies are much greater for patients who are treated when young. The increased risk of gastrointestinal cancers may relate particularly to mixed-modality treatment, and that of lung cancer to chemotherapy as well as radiotherapy; there are also well-known increased risks of breast cancer from radiotherapy and leukemia from chemotherapy. The roles of specific chemotherapeutic agents in the etiology of solid cancers after Hodgkin's disease require detailed investigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its implication in signaling through the mast cell receptor with high affinity for IgE (FcepsilonRI) is less clear, although Lyn, a member of the src family, plays an important role in FcepsilonRI-mediated signaling. To define a role for CD45 in FcepsilonRI signal transduction, we established CD45 high expressing rat basophilic leukemia cell lines (RBL-CD45H) and cell lines expressing trace amounts of CD45 (RBL-CD45L). We demonstrate that although all RBL-CD45L cell lines degranulate following IgE- and antigen-induced FcepsilonRI aggregation, the response is significantly reduced at a low dose of antigen. The cells show a delayed and slowed Ca(2+) mobilization even though at a higher dose where the cells degranulate to a similar extent as RBL-CD45H. This diminished Ca(2+) response is restored by reconstitution of RBL-CD45L with a chimeric molecule containing the cytoplasmic phosphatase domains of rat CD45. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of FcepsilonRI, association of FcepsilonRI with Lyn and PTK activity associated with FcepsilonRI, all of which are enhanced upon FcepsilonRI aggregation in RBL-CD45H, are impaired in RBL-CD45L. Finally, we show that FcepsilonRI is physically associated with CD45 in RBL-CD45H prior to receptor aggregation. Thus, we propose that, although not indispensable in mast cell degranulation, CD45 positively regulates the signaling through FcepsilonRI by promoting the activation of FcepsilonRI-associated Lyn.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mean age at the last visit was 19.0 years. Twenty-five patients (15 boys) were prepubertal at BMT. Data on secondary sexual characteristics, the pituitary-gonadal axis and longitudinal growth were retrospectively collected from the medical records. In boys not receiving additional testicular irradiation (n = 19), penile growth and pubic hair development was normal and all had serum testosterone levels within the adult range. The majority of them, however, had incidental elevations of LH, suggesting minor Leydig cell damage. Testicular volume at last measurement was small (mean: 10.5 ml) and serum FSH levels were elevated in all boys, with normalisation in only one, suggesting severe impairment of reproductive gonadal function. Of the ten girls who received BMT before puberty, six had a spontaneous onset of puberty and menarche; the four other girls needed hormonal substitution therapy. Recovery of gonadal function after cessation of substitution was seen in one girl, who became pregnant but had a spontaneous abortion. Decrease in height SDS was seen in the majority of patients and was positively correlated with male gender and lower age at the time of BMT. CONCLUSION: Careful monitoring of both gonadal function and growth after bone marrow transplantation and total body irradiation is warranted in order to detect disturbances early and ensure normal pubertal development in children treated for haematological malignancies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Medulloblastomas (MEDs) resemble embryonic neuroectodermal stem cells and their immature, uncommitted neuronal and glial progeny. Apoptosis is a basic physiological process wherein the cell initiates a sequence of events culminating in the fragmentation of its DNA, nuclear collapse, and finally, disintegration of the cell into small, membrane-bound apoptotic bodies. Expression of Fas (APO-1, CD95) receptor (FasR) and programmed or active cell death (PCD) was studied in childhood MEDs with varying stages of malignancy, and cell differentiation features. The majority of neoplastically transformed, neuroectodermal in origin cells, particularly in MEDs, express FasR, whereas normal cells in the CNS do not. FasR is a transmembrane glycoprotein, which belongs to the nerve growth factor/tumor necrosis factor (NGF/TNF) receptor superfamily. Apoptosis within childhood PNETs/MEDs is triggered by the binding of FasR to its natural ligand (FasL) or by cross-linking with anti-section i FasR antibodies. The resence of FasL has also been detected in childhood glial tumors. Therefore, a spontaneous, cellular immunophenotype (IP) regulatory, intratumoral apoptotic cell death (autocrine suicide) is possible in childhood brain tumors during neoplastic growth and progression. During our systematic immunocytochemical screening, we employed formalin fixed, paraffin-wax embedded tissue sections, as well as frozen sections of 34 primary human childhood PNETs/MEDs. The use of a sensitive, indirect, six step immunoperoxidase or alkaline phosphatase conjugated streptavidin-biotin antigen detection technique, modified by us, provided excellent immunocyto-chemical results. A systematic observation of the presence of apoptosis related markers (especially FasR) and cells in PCD was carried out. A strong expression (intensity of staining: ""A""-the highest possible; number of stained neoplastic cells: +3 to +4, between 50% to 90%) of FasR, was detected employing 4 microns thick, formalin fixed, paraffin-wax embedded tissue slides. The panel of normal tissues employed as positive and negative tissue controls demonstrated presence of FasR in the prenatal thymus, mature tonsils and colon epithelium. Certainly, the coexpression of FasR, FasL, and other PCD-related proteins have also been reported in other human malignancies: breast cancer, colorectal carcinomas, large granular lymphocytic leukemia of T or NK cell origin, melanomas, lung, prostate, pancreas, and hepatocellular carcinomas. The coexpression of both FasR and FasL on several neoplastic cell types may represent an effective mechanism for tumor escape of the cellular immunological response of the host. It has been well established that brain tumors and melanomas produce their autocrine FasL, and even become capable of switching their signal transduction from the PCD pathway to a tumor growth, proliferative pathway. It seems that the therapeutical use of FasR-FasL (main apoptotic pathway) represents a new and exciting immunotherapeutical possibility in the treatment of primary childhood neuroectodermal tumors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this, there was a small but significant enhancement of cytotoxicity afforded by the liposomal preparation (median 2.8-fold, p < 0.01). The cells from 2 of the patients appeared to be resistant to free daunorubicin. However, incubation for 96 h in DNX appeared to circumvent this resistance. This increase in sensitivity for resistant cells could not be demonstrated in an MDR positive cell line (K562AR) suggesting that another mechanism of resistance may be involved. We conclude that it is feasible to assess sensitivity to DNX using the MTT assay in fresh cells from patients with CLL using a continuous drug exposure of 96 h. Furthermore, DNX appears more effective than free drug in this disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has also been suggested that similar apoptotic alterations may be important in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It is believed that a process of apoptosis at the stage of maturation or differentiation of lymphocytes may be related to the beginning of an autoimmune event, due to the non-elimination of autoreactive lymphocytes. The aim of this study is to test bcl-2 antigen expression in human SLE peripheral blood and to analyze its relationship with disease activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum levels of bcl-2 were studied by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay in whole blood samples in 68 patients with SLE and its correlation with disease activity according to SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI). RESULTS: No significant differences were found in bcl-2 levels between all SLE patients and controls. We observed increased levels of bcl-2 in active SLE patients in relation to inactive (p = 0.0003) and controls (p = 0.02). Our results show a significant correlation between bcl-2 levels and SLEDAI values (R = 0.46, P < 0.001).

At a non-toxic concentration (a range from 25 micrograms/ml to 100 micrograms/ml), CHML has shown to strongly inhibit tumor cell growth by using a typical colony survival assay. At a treatment of concentration of 50 micrograms/ml for 6 hours, CHML is able to suppress 50% of the tumor cell colony formation. At a concentration of 100 micrograms/ml (the therapeutic dosage in the clinical trial), more than 90% of the cells were killed in human breast carcinoma MCF-7, colorectal carcinoma RKO, kidney carcinoma G410, lung carcinoma and human myeloid leukemia ML-1 lines. In contrast, growth suppression of non-cancerous human skin fibroblasts by CHML was observed much less than that seen in tumor lines. These results indicate that CHML is an efficient inhibiting agent in tumor cell growth and is able to generate greater suppression in tumor cells than in noncancerous cells. With the use of DNA fragmentation assay, CHML was found to induce apoptosis in MCF-7, ML-1, H1299 and RKO lines after treatment at a concentration of 75 micrograms/ml for 8 hours. Following the CHML treatment, the tumor suppressor p53 protein elevated in RKO cells at 2 h posttreatment. The induction of p53 reached a peak at 4 hr and returned to normal level 16 hr later. Consistent with this result, Bax, which is regulated by p53 and is able to promote apoptosis, was also found to increase in a same kinetic manner as p53. These results suggest that the p53-pathway is activated by CHML and the activation of p53 may contribute to CHML-induced apoptosis in some tumor cells, such as MCF-7, RKO and ML-1. Considering that CHML is able to induce apoptosis in H1299 cells, which are of p53-negative status, it is speculated that CHML induces programmed cell death through both the p53-dependent and- independent pathways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first study area comprised 4 towns located on the K Islands, which had a population of 26,870 in 1990. The overall HTLV-I seroprevalence estimated from the serologic survey of 18,485 subjects was 16.2%. By using the data from the Nagasaki Prefectural Cancer Registry (NPCR) and reviewing clinical and laboratory information, we identified 40 cases of ATL and 35 cases of other NHL diagnosed between 1985 and 1995. The crude annual incidence of ATL among 100,000 HTLV-I carriers aged 30 or older was estimated at 137.7 for men and 57.4 for women, with a significant sex difference after adjustment for age (rate ratio = 2.50, 95% confidence interval 1.32-4.73). The cumulative risk from 30 to 79 years of age was estimated at approximately 6.6% for men and 2.1% for women. Among the entire population, ATL accounted for 51 to 59% of the total NHL incidence, showing the strong impact of HTLV-I infection. The second study area comprised the whole of Nagasaki Prefecture (total population in 1990 = 1.56 million). Between 1985 and 1995, 989 cases of ATL and 1,745 cases of other NHL were registered in the NPCR. The world age-standardized annual incidence rate of ATL per 100,000 persons aged 30 or older was estimated at 10.5 for men and 6.0 for women, which accounted for approximately 37 to 41% of the total NHL incidence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report the cloning of a novel sentrin-specific protease, SENP1, which has no homology to the known de-ubiquitinating enzymes or ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases. However, SENP1 is distantly related to the yeast Smt3-specific protease, Ulp1. A COS cell expression system was used to demonstrate the activity of SENP1 in vivo. When HA-tagged sentrin-1 was co-expressed with SENP1, the higher molecular weight sentrin-1 conjugates were completely removed. Surprisingly, the major sentrinized band at 90 kDa remained intact. The disappearance of the high molecular weight sentrin-1 conjugates also coincided with an increase in free sentrin-1 monomers. SENP1 is also active against proteins modified by sentrin-2, but not those modified by ubiquitin or NEDD8. In addition, sentrinized PML, a tumor suppressor protein that resides in the nucleus, was selectively affected by SENP1, whereas sentrinized RanGAP1, which is associated with the cytoplasmic fibrils of the nuclear pore complex, remained intact. The inability of SENP1 to process sentrinized RanGAP1 in vivo is most likely due to its nuclear localization because SENP1 is active against sentrinized RanGAP1 in vitro. The identification of a nuclear-localized, sentrin-specific protease will provide a unique tool to study the role of sentrinization in the biological function of PML and in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia.",,,,,,,['GM-57502/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,['GENBANK/AF149770'],,,,,,,

We therefore investigated during the phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA))-induced monocyte/macrophage differentiation of the human HL-60 leukemia cells, if TNFalpha contributed to plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) synthesis that is initiated by a protein kinase Cbeta-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2-dependent pathway (Lopez, S., Peiretti, F., Morange, P., Laouar, A., Fossat, C., Bonardo, B., Huberman, E., Juhan-Vague, I., and Nalbone, G. (1999) Thromb. Haemostasis 81, 415-422). Following PMA treatment, the level of TNFalpha mRNA strongly increased and appeared earlier than PAI-1 mRNA. An anti-TNFalpha antibody significantly inhibited the PMA-induced PAI-1 mRNA and protein levels. The recombinant human TNFalpha, which is inactive on native HL-60 cells in terms of PAI-1 synthesis, optimally potentiates it once HL-60 cells are committed into the differentiation process. The use of 1) the HL-525 cell line, a clone issued from HL-60 cells rendered resistant to PMA-induced differentiation, and 2) the transforming growth factorbeta-1/vitamin D3 differentiative mixture confirmed the relationships between the induction of differentiation and the potency of TNFalpha to up-regulate PAI-1 synthesis. In conclusion, we showed that during the induction of monocyte/macrophage differentiation, TNFalpha and PAI-1 gene expressions are activated and that synthesized TNFalpha up-regulates and prolongs, in an autocrine manner, the synthesis of PAI-1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the latter case, normal processing of the enzyme is also affected, leading to secretion of the immature form of cathepsin. The present study shows how completely different sorting mechanisms, such as those for delivering proteoglycans and cathepsin D to secretory lysosomes, might share common regulatory signals and are similarly affected when the levels of these signals are perturbed. Finally, protein kinase C appears to be a major player in the signal transduction pathways, leading to proteoglycan and cathepsin D missorting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DC cultures were loaded with either purified soluble hCD4 (shCD4) protein or unfractionated L1210/hCD4 extracts and injected as vaccine into mice. The efficacy of these vaccinations was compared with that of vaccination with shCD4 protein emulsified in Freund's adjuvant (FA). We evaluated the immune responses generated after these vaccinal protocols and the survival rate of vaccinated mice subsequently challenged with a lethal injection of L1210/hCD4 cells. Our results demonstrated that vaccination with shCD4 protein or tumour extract-loaded DC mainly generated an hCD4 antigen-specific cell-mediated cytotoxic immune response that was associated with a specific protection against leukaemia. In contrast, vaccination with the protein emulsified in FA only generated potent humoral immune responses that were not protective against leukaemia. Altogether, our results indicate that the unique property of loaded DC to trigger an anti-leukaemia protective effect is mainly associated with cellular immune responses.",,PMC2327137,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that this was associated with 10-fold reduced folate carrier gene amplification and 50-fold overexpression of both the principal 3 kb reduced folate carrier transcript and, surprisingly, a novel truncated 2 kb reduced folate carrier mRNA poorly expressed in parental CEM cells. The molecular basis for the generation of this truncated reduced folate carrier transcript and its potential functional role in folate accumulation were studied. Reduced folate carrier genomic and cDNA sequencing revealed that the truncated transcript had an internal deletion of 987 nucleotides which was a result of an alternative splicing utilizing a cryptic acceptor splice site within exon 6. This deletion consisted of the 3'-most 480 nucleotides of the reduced folate carrier ORF and the following 507 nucleotides of the 3'-UTR. These resulted in a truncated reduced folate carrier protein, which lacks the C-terminal 160 amino acids, but instead contains 58 new C-terminal amino acids obtained from reading through the 3'-UTR. Consequently, a truncated reduced folate carrier protein is generated that lacks the 12th transmembrane domain and contains a new and much shorter C-terminus predicted to reside at the extracellular face. Western analysis with plasma-membrane fraction from CEM-7A cells revealed marked overexpression of both a broadly migrating approximately 65-90 kDa native reduced folate carrier and a approximately 40-45 kDa truncated reduced folate carrier, the core molecular masses of which were confirmed by in vitro translation. However, unlike the native reduced folate carrier, the truncated reduced folate carrier protein failed to bind the affinity labels NHS-[3H]MTX and NHS-[3H]folic acid. Stable transfection of the truncated reduced folate carrier cDNA into mouse L1210 leukemia cells: increased folate accumulation, decreased their leucovorin and folic acid growth requirements, and increased their sensitivity to methotrexate. This constitutes the first documentation of an expressed alternatively spliced truncated reduced folate carrier that, when coexpressed along with the native carrier, augments folate accumulation and consequently decreases the cellular folate growth requirement. The possible mechanisms by which the truncated reduced folate carrier may increase folate accumulation and/or metabolism in cells coexpressing the truncated and native reduced folate carrier are discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In some patients, neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia have also been observed during the course of the disease. We have followed 28 patients with steroid-refractory DBA for up to 13 years with serial peripheral blood counts and bone marrow (BM) aspirates and biopsies. In 21/28 (75%) patients, moderate to severe generalized BM hypoplasia developed, with overall cellularities ranging from 0% to 30%. Marrow hypoplasia correlated with the development of neutropenia (9/21; 43%) and/or thrombocytopenia (6/21; 29%) in many patients. No patient had either cytogenetic abnormalities or progressed to acute leukaemia, although one 13-year-old developed marked marrow fibrosis and trilineage dysplasia.

It is constitutively expressed on haematopoietic precursors and differentiated leucocytes, as well as on most leukaemic cells. ICAM-3/LFA-1 binding during a lymphocyte-mediated cellular immune response has been well established; however, its role in the marrow compartment is unclear. In this study, marrow cells from normal and acute leukaemic donors, as well as leukaemic cell lines, were cultured in the presence of various monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to ICAM-3, and apoptosis was subsequently measured by annexin V binding. Anti-ICAM-3 mAb ICR 1.1 engagement triggered increased percentages of apoptosis among normal and leukaemic marrow myeloid cells. Fab fragments of ICR 1.1 mimicked the intact mAb, suggesting that the apoptotic signal was independent of Fc receptor interactions and did not require bivalent epitope engagement. In addition, the apoptotic signal was found to be independent of ICAM-1/LFA-1 binding interactions, as well as Fas/FasL and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)/TNF receptor-activated pathways, as neutralizing antibodies to CD11a/CD18, Fas and TNF-alpha failed to abrogate the response.",,,,,,,['HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Chimaerism was analysed using red blood cell phenotyping (RCP), and the results were compared with cytogenetic analysis and outcome of qualitative and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for breakpoint molecules. In all patients, an increase in autologous erythrocytes and/or a decrease in donor red cells indicated relapse. Donor erythrocytes started to increase from 4 to 20 (median 12) weeks after DLI. At 6 and 12 months after DLI, complete donor chimaerism was found in 11 and 15 patients, respectively, and all patients were in cytogenic remission. A high percentage of autologous red cells at the time of DLI predicted pancytopenia. During relapse and after DLI, the percentage of autologous red cells was strongly correlated with the reappearance and disappearance of Ph-positive metaphases (r = 0.90; P < 0.001 and r = 0.96; P < 0.001 respectively). The same was true for the correlation between the percentage of autologous red cells and positivity/negativity in PCR for Bcr-Abl breakpoint molecules (r = 0.94; P < 0.001). A normalized Bcr-Abl dose of greater than 10-3 in real-time quantitative PCR correlated well with relapse and the presence of autologous red blood cells (r = 0.77; P < 0.001). We conclude that RCP is a sensitive, easy to perform and fast technique for the prediction of pending relapse after BMT for CML. RCP also predicts the response to DLI and the occurrence of bone marrow aplasia after DLI.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The received dose, as recorded by thermoluminescent dosimeters, ranged between 7. 83 and 12.25 Gy. Patients who received TBI < 9.9 Gy (n = 34) had a significantly higher relapse rate when compared with patients receiving >/= 9.9 Gy (n = 116) (43% vs. 19%; P = 0.002). Graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporin A (CyA) with or without methotrexate (MTX). The dose of CyA was either 1 or 5 mg/kg/day i.v. from day -1 to + 20, then 10 mg/kg/day orally until day + 365. Patients receiving 5 mg/kg CyA (n = 40) had a higher risk of relapse (49% vs. 15%; P = 0.0001). Thus, low-dose TBI (< 9.9 Gy) and high-dose CyA (5 mg/kg) were significant predictors of leukaemia relapse. Patients were then divided into three groups: those who had both negative predictors (< 9.9 Gy TBI and 5 mg/kg CyA; n = 26); those who had only one (either < 9.9 Gy TBI or 5 mg/kg CyA; n = 22); and those who had neither (>/= 9.9 Gy TBI and 1 mg/kg CyA; n = 102). The three groups were comparable for FAB subtype, interval diagnosis transplant and age. The 5-year actuarial relapse rate for these three groups of patients was 49%, 41% and 15%, with no difference between the first two and a significant difference when compared with the latter (P < 0.01). These data indicate that acute myeloid leukaemia can be cured with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation given an intensive conditioning regimen and low-dose immunosuppression post-graft. Either alone is insufficient to produce long-term disease-free survival. These results may be relevant for programmes of reduced intensity conditioning designed for patients with acute leukaemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to strictly defined therapeutic regimens, 38 patients received IFN as monotherapy, 23 patients a combination of IFN and HU and 39 patients HU only. Using standardized intervals of biopsies and histochemical and morphometric methods, a significant increase in reticulin fibre density and in the number of CD61+ megakaryocytes was detectable in the majority of IFN-treated patients. To a lesser degree, these changes were also expressed in the cohort with a combined IFN and HU regimen. In contrast to these findings, in the group of patients with HU as single-agent treatment, a stable state or reversal of myelofibrosis was detectable together with corresponding changes in megakaryopoiesis. Further evaluations revealed that these effects had occurred within the first year, mostly after 6 months of treatment, and were prominently expressed in those patients with a slight to relevant grade of myelofibrosis at presentation. In conclusion, this study provides persuasive evidence that monotherapy by IFN exerts a fibrogenic effect, while HU treatment seems to prevent and even resolves bone marrow fibrosis in CML. Probably, in relation to the complex pathomechanisms responsible for the generation of myelofibrosis, the changing content of reticulin fibres was usually accompanied by corresponding alterations in the number of CD61+ megakaryocytes, including atypical microforms and precursor cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An inverse and significant association was found between IDA and Pgp-related efflux activity (r = -0.31, P = 0.01) and also MRP (r = -0.25, P = 0.04) but not with LRP (r = -0.13, P = 0.28).

There was a non-significant trend for earlier relapse in patients with low IDA levels (leukaemia-free survival of 16.3 months compared with 21.1 months in patients with high IDA levels). Our data suggest that, while the IDA assay is a quick and relatively easy test for the combined efflux MDR phenotype, it is unable to detect other MDR mechanisms, such as LRP, which may be important to the clinical outcome of patients with AML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples were obtained to study the effect of in vitro exposure to ATRA and to measure apoptosis and bcl-2. The response rate was 72% for patients under age 60 years and 46% for patients aged 60 years or above. There was no difference in the percentage of responding patients, time to recurrence or overall survival for patients receiving chemotherapy with ATRA vs. historical controls receiving chemotherapy without ATRA. After in vitro exposure of day 3 bone marrow samples to ATRA, there was an increase in apoptotic cells in 25% of patient samples compared with samples not exposed to ATRA. Later date of peak apoptosis in peripheral blood and higher percentage of apoptotic cells in bone marrow on day 3 of treatment were associated with lack of clinical response to treatment. Increased bcl-2 in patient samples was associated with shorter time to recurrence and poor cytogenetic risk. The addition of ATRA to chemotherapy did not improve patient outcome. However, evidence of in vitro response to ATRA in 25% of patients suggests that retinoid pathways should be studied further in patients with AML.",,,,,,,"['R01 CA028704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA028704-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R-01 CA28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The method is validated on ten protein-ligand complexes and is shown to distinguish precisely where polar and nonpolar groups preferentially bind. Comparisons with existing approaches, like the display of the electrostatic potential or the curvature, illustrate the advantages and the better predictive power of the present method.

The changes in the AgNOR pattern were compared with those of TTM used as a tumour burden parameter. Among 52 cases that entered the study, 29 were in stable phase and 23 had progressive disease and received chemotherapy. During stable phase, the AgNORs as well as TTM remained constant. In treated patients, the relative reduction of tumour mass was correlated with a decrease in the percentage of lymphocytes containing one AgNOR cluster. The percentage of cells with one compact nucleolus before chemotherapy was inversely correlated with the relative amount of tumor reduction after treatment. We conclude that the AgNOR pattern in CLL describes the cell kinetic changes during the evolution of the disease and is a prognostic factor for tumor reduction after treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It can be a platform for people to express their views about cancer, not only in the community but also nationally. Empowerment is the hallmark of a town hall meeting. Those who are in leadership positions in health care and elected officials and community leaders are given the opportunity to hear the opinions of people who represent a broad-based constituency of individuals affected by cancer. The idea of holding a town hall meeting was first introduced in the cancer community by the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship NCCS) as a means of identifying issues, exchanging information and considering creative solutions to problems. The first town hall meeting was held in 1994 in conjunction with the NCCS annual assembly. Since then, utilizing the guidelines set forth by the NCCS, 30 or more town hall meetings have been held across the United States. Cancer survivors have, by and large, been responsible for garnering the necessary support for conducting a town hall in their local area. Organizations such as the American Cancer Society, the Leukemia Society of America, hospitals, clinics, pharmaceutical and healthcare companies and also noncancer groups, such as the YMCA, churches, and radio/T.V. stations, join with the cancer survivors in organizing the meeting, planning related displays, and advertising the event. In 1998, seven town hall meetings were sponsored jointly by OnCare and NCCS in advance and support of the upcoming THE MARCH- Coming Together To Conquer Cancer, a national rally held in Washington, D.C. in September 1998. Attendees at the meetings included not only cancer survivors and their families, but also healthcare professionals, local and state legislators, community leaders and the media. Results of the 1998 town hall meetings are discussed and compared with the topics identified during the meetings held in 1994-1996. Town hall participants were outspoken about what is needed in America if cancer is truly to become the nation's healthcare priority. They are asking for equal access to quality care, increases in financial backing for research, and more support for cancer advocacy efforts. Benefits of holding town hall meetings are identified.",,,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although this complication resolves uneventfully in most patients, fatal cases have been reported. Severe VOD after transplantation has a high mortality rate ranging from 45% to 98%. New hemostatic therapeutic strategies have significantly improved the prognosis of VOD. Chemotherapy-related VOD in Wilms tumor usually has a good prognosis. We describe two patients with Wilms tumor and one with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, who developed severe veno-occlusive disease of the liver according to the Baltimore criteria while undergoing chemotherapy; the symptoms were hepatomegaly, ascites, hyperbilirubinemia, weight gain and, in one patient, short-term lethargy. Elevated LDH levels of 872 to 12,000 U/l were observed in our patients. All patients had thrombocytopenia between 29,000 and 40,000/microl and decreased antithrombin (AT) and protein C levels; two patients had gastrointestinal bleeding. All patients developed a coagulopathy because of severe hepatic dysfunction. Two patients received low-dose heparin at the onset of VOD. The thrombolytic therapy was rapidly changed to AT supplementation (20-80 IU/kg bw 2x per day) without heparin when thrombocytes were very low or gastrointestinal bleeding occurred. Resolution of VOD was observed in all patients receiving AT alone. The chemotherapy was discontinued in a patient with accidental actinomycin D overdosage in view of the severity of symptoms. The remaining two patients received chemotherapy according to the therapy protocol after restitution. All patients survived without sequelae with a median follow-up of 28 months (range 8-48 months). CONCLUSION: Hepatic veno-occlusive disease is a rare but increasingly recognized complication in pediatric cancer patients receiving conventional chemotherapy. AT supplementation constitutes a good alternative treatment of severe VOD in comparison with other thrombolytic therapies, particularly in patients at high risk of bleeding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The factor V G1691A (FV-L), the prothrombin G20210A (FII-L) and the homozygous MTHFR variant were examined. In addition, protein C, protein S and antithrombin (AT) deficiency were evaluated in patients with ALL or thrombosis. The inter-group incidence of risk factors and thrombotic events was compared. 73 of the 137 patients had ALL and 64 another form of leukaemia, lymphoma or a solid tumour. They were treated according to the established paediatric tumour protocols ALL-BFM, NHL-BFM, COSS, CWS and others. All patients had central venous lines. No patient received heparin or any other anticoagulant. Endpoints of the study were thrombosis, regular completion of chemotherapy or death. Incidence of mutations in the whole group: FV-L (7.3% heterozygous, 0.7% homozygous); FII-L (2.9% heterozygous, no homozygotes); MTHFR (51.8% heterozygous, 10.9% homozygous). Ten patients (7.3%), 6 with ALL and 4 with solid tumours, developed thrombosis. 4 of the 6 patients with ALL and thrombosis (67%) but only 21% of ALL patients without thrombosis had a genetic risk factor (P < 0.013, chi2). No genetic defect was found in the 4 patients with other malignancies and thrombosis. However, besides a tumour, these patients had additional exogenous risk factors including diabetes insipidus and hemiparesis. CONCLUSION: Genetic mutations appear to be additional risk factors for the development of thrombosis in patients with ALL. In contrast, these mutations do not appear to be relevant risk factors for thrombosis in the small number of children with other malignant diseases reported here. This difference may be due to asparaginase and corticosteroids being used in ALL but not in solid tumour protocols.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diazeniumdiolates of structure R(2)N-N(O)=N-OR', in which R' = Na, were reacted with BrCH(2)OAc to convert the spontaneously NO-releasing salts 1a (R(2)N = diethylamino) and 1b (R(2)N = pyrrolidino) to prodrugs 2a (AcOM-DEA/NO) and 2b (AcOM-PYRRO/NO), respectively, where R' = CH(2)OAc. In contrast to anions 1a and 1b (half-lives in pH 7.4 phosphate at 37 degrees C of 2 min and 3 s, respectively), 2a and 2b showed only minimal decomposition after 16 h under these conditions. Very rapid hydrolysis occurred in the presence of porcine liver esterase, however, with free anion 1a being observed as an intermediate in the esterase-induced generation of NO from 2a. The potential utility of this prodrug class is illustrated with a comparison of 1 and 2 as antiproliferative agents in NO-sensitive human leukemia cell lines HL-60 and U937. While the 72-h IC(50)'s for 1a and 1b (which generate NO throughout the medium) in HL-60 cell cultures were >600 microM, those of 2a and 2b were 8.3 and 6.4 microM, respectively. This result is consistent with our hypothesis that 2 is selectively hydrolyzed to 1 and thence to NO intracellularly. For U937 cells, the 72-h IC(50) for both 2a and 2b was 53 microM. By contrast, relatively high antiproliferative IC(50)'s (>100 microM in U937 cells) were observed for analogues in which R' = CH(2)CH(2)SC(O)Me, from which acetyl and 2-mercaptoethyl groups must be successively cleaved to free the NO-releasing diazeniumdiolate function. Within 24 h at initial concentrations of 50 microM, 2a and 2b induced apoptosis in 50% and 57% of the HL-60 cells, respectively (35% and 40% of the U937 cells, respectively). The data reveal significant in vitro antileukemic activity on the part of these novel compounds. Moreover, their substantial ease-of-handling advantages over the anionic diazeniumdiolates from which they are derived suggest their use as convenient agents for probing the biological roles of NO.",,,,,,,['N01-CO-56000/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Four different synthetic approaches are set forth, two each for the hydroxylated norspermines and for the hydroxylated homospermines. The key step in the assembly of the norspermines was the coupling of either N-[(2R)-2,3-epoxypropyl]-N-ethyl p-toluenesulfonamide or N-[(2S)-2,3-epoxypropyl]-N-ethyl trifluoromethanesulfonamide to N,N'-dibenzyl-1,3-diaminopropane. The key step with homospermines employed alkylation of putrescine with (3S)-N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-N-ethyl-3,4-epoxybutylamine or of N, N'-bis(mesitylenesulfonyl)-1,4-butanediamine with (2R)-2-benzyloxy-4-[N-(mesitylenesulfonyl)ethylamino]-O-tosyl-1-++ +butan ol. All of the hydroxylated analogues were active against L1210 cells with 96-h IC(50) values of </=2 microM, and they also effectively reduced putrescine and spermidine, although the effect on spermine pools ranged from moderate to insignificant. Interestingly, the impact of the hydroxylated analogues on ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was significantly less than that of unhydroxylated parent drug (e.g., N(1),N(11)-diethylnorspermine [DENSPM]) at 1 microM; however, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) depletion was nearly identical to what was observed in cells treated with parent drug. The most notable difference between the parent and hydroxylated analogues was seen with spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase (SSAT) upregulation in the DENSPM series. The hydroxylated analogues, especially (R, R)-(HO)(2)DENSPM, were much less effective at upregulation than the parent DENSPM. Finally, a comparison of the toxicity of (R, R)-(HO)(2)DENSPM with that of DENSPM at subchronic doses revealed that the neurological effects seen with DENSPM were now absent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, it has been reported that these PAH can be enzymatically oxidized to yield radical cations that form apurinic (AP) sites in DNA via depurinating adducts. The formation of stable adducts and AP sites in DNA of human cells exposed to PAH was examined in cytochrome P450 (P450)-expressing mammary carcinoma MCF-7 cells and in leukemia HL-60 cells, which display a high peroxidase but no P450-mediated activity, after exposure to these PAH. Stable DNA adducts were assessed by (33)P-postlabeling/HPLC analysis, and the induction of AP sites in DNA was analyzed by an aldehyde reactive probe (ARP) and a slot blot method. After exposure for 4 h, the levels of stable DNA adducts were comparable in MCF-7 cells treated with B[a]P and DMBA, but significantly lower than those observed in MCF-7 cells treated with the stronger carcinogen DB[a,l]P. While the levels of stable adducts increased more than 10-fold (B[a]P and DMBA) or 100-fold (DB[a,l]P) after exposure for 24 h, the levels of AP sites remained low after both treatment periods. Thus, the levels of stable adducts were approximately 5-fold higher than the levels of AP sites after treatment with B[a]P or DMBA and more than 100-fold higher in cells exposed to DB[a,l]P for 24 h. None of these carcinogenic PAH formed detectable levels of stable DNA adducts or AP sites in HL-60 cells. The results demonstrate that metabolic activation of B[a]P, DMBA, and DB[a,l]P is catalyzed by P450 enzymes leading to diol epoxides that form predominantly stable DNA adducts but only low levels of AP sites.",,,,,,,"['CA28825/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA40228/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA09634/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

This was expected to lead to hydrolysis of the ester groups, followed by redistribution of the free chlorin to other subcellular sites. In this study, we examined the patterns of localization of CAME and of subsequent photodamage in murine leukemia L1210 cells. The drug was initially localized at intracellular sites, yielding a pattern similar to that obtained with a fluorescent probe for acidic intracellular vesicles and endosomes. A brief (30 min) incubation with 10 microM CAME followed by irradiation led to mitochondrial photodamage and apoptotic cell death. At a higher drug level, or with a longer incubation time, we observed additional photodamage to the plasma membrane and to lysosomes. The higher photodynamic therapy dose led to inhibition of apoptosis, with cell death likely occurring via a necrotic process. Distribution of CAME among the components of human plasma was to albumin > high-density lipoprotein > low-density lipoprotein.

The rate of substrate hydrolysis catalyzed by intact viable cells remained constant for eight successive incubations of 30 min and was optimal at micromolar substrate concentrations over the pH range 7.4-8.5. The value of apparent K(m) for pNPP in P19 and HL-60 cells was 120 microM. Hydrolytic activity of the ecto-enzyme at physiological pH decreased by the addition of levamisole, a specific and noncompetitive inhibitor of ALP (K(i) P19 = 57 microM; K(i) HL-60 = 50 microM). Inhibition of hydrolysis was reversed by removal of levamisole within 30 min. Retinoic acid (RA), which promotes the differentiation of P19 and HL-60 cells, induced levamisole-sensitive ecto-phosphohydrolase activity at pH 7.4. After its autophosphorylation by ecto-kinase activity, a 98-kDa membrane protein in P19 cells was found to be sensitive to ecto-ALP, and protein dephosphorylation increased after incubation of cells with RA for 24 h and 48 h. Orthovanadate, an inhibitor of all phosphatase activities, blocked the levamisole-sensitive dephosphorylation of the membrane phosphoproteins, while (R)-(-)-epinephrine reversed the effect by complexation of the inhibitor. The results demonstrate that the levamisole-sensitive phosphohydrolase activity on the cell surface is consistent with ecto-ALP activity degrading both physiological concentrations of exogenously added substrate and endogenous surface phosphoproteins under physiological pH conditions. The dephosphorylating properties of ecto-ALP are induced by RA, suggesting a specific function in differentiating P19 teratocarcinoma and HL-60 myeloblastic leukemia cells.",,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, neither reduction of the irradiation dose nor the elimination of irradiation entirely appear to have abolished neurocognitive impairment in long term ALL survivors. Positron emission tomography (PET) and [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) can be used to quantitate cerebral glucose metabolism, a potential indicator of treatment-induced adverse central nervous system (CNS) effects. The purpose of this study was to assess whether CRT is associated with defects in cerebral glucose metabolism in long term ALL survivors. The authors also studied whether chemotherapy and/or the severity of disease have deleterious effects on glucose metabolism. METHODS: Forty long-term survivors of childhood ALL were studied using FDG PET. All subjects went through an elaborate neurocognitive assessment. In 20 of these children, the prophylactic treatment of the CNS had been CRT combined with methotrexate (MTX), and it was MTX only in the remaining 20 children. RESULTS: No major differences were found in the regional cerebral glucose utilization or in neurocognitive performance between the irradiated and nonirradiated groups. A high leukocyte count at the time of diagnosis was found to be associated inversely with cerebral glucose utilization. CONCLUSIONS: CRT does not appear to affect cerebral glucose metabolism in long term survivors of ALL. By contrast, the association between the leukocyte count and glucose utilization implies that disease severity may be partly responsible for adverse CNS effects in long term survivors of childhood ALL.",,,['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most significant reported toxicity is dose-related, reversible, myelosuppression characterized primarily by thrombocytopenia. METHODS: A report of two patients in whom acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) developed after treatment with strontium-89 and a review of the literature are presented. RESULTS: The two patients described in the current study developed AML 17 months and 26 months, respectively, after exposure to strontium-89 for the treatment of prostate carcinoma. To the authors' knowledge these patients represent the first two reported cases of AML after strontium-89 therapy for prostate carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggest the leukemogenic potential of strontium-89 treatment in humans. To the authors' knowledge, the current study represents the first report of AML after therapeutic exposure to strontium-89. As this agent is used more frequently (and earlier in the disease course) in patients with prostate carcinoma, an increased incidence of secondary AML complicating the clinical management of patients with prostate carcinoma may be observed.

Thrombopoietin (TPO) and its receptor, c-mpl, support the proliferation of multiple types of immature hematopoietic progenitor cells, and induce clonal growth of leukemic cells. The authors investigated whether TPO or c-mpl overexpression might correlate with progression of CML, disease aggressiveness, or response to therapy. METHODS: Expression of c-mpl and TPO was measured in bone marrow samples from 208 patients with CML by Western blot analysis and solid-phase plate radioimmunoassay (used for quantification). Samples obtained from individuals without evidence of hematologic abnormalities were used as controls. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in TPO or c-mpl expression among patients in different phases of CML or between patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive and negative CML. When TPO and c-mpl levels were analyzed in relation to prognostically important host and disease characteristics in early chronic phase CML, platelet and white blood cell counts demonstrated significant differences in both TPO and c-mpl expression, but age and spleen size demonstrated significant differences in TPO expression only. Responses to interferon (INF)-alpha-based therapy and survival were not influenced by TPO or c-mpl levels. CONCLUSIONS: TPO or c-mpl overexpression did not correlate with different CML phases, suggesting that they were not involved in CML progression from early to advanced phase. Neither TPO nor c-mpl overexpression was particularly evident in any risk group, suggesting lack of correlation between their expression and disease aggressiveness. This was supported by the finding of similar response to IFN-alpha-based therapy and survival regardless of the level of TPO or c-mpl expression.",,,['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients were eligible if they had Stage IIIB (malignant pleural effusion) or Stage IV NSCLC, no prior chemotherapy, and Cancer and Leukemia Group B performance status (PS) 0-2. Patients with brain metastases were eligible if they were neurologically stable after brain irradiation. Thirty-three patients from participating institutions were enrolled. One patient was ineligible due to untreated brain metastases. Patients were treated with gemcitabine 1250 mg/m(2) over 30 minutes (1000 mg/m(2) for the first 6 patients) and vinorelbine 25 mg/m(2) over 6 minutes, both administered intravenously on Days 1 and 8 every 21 days. Treatment was planned for a total of six cycles or more if the patient had persistent benefit. Growth factors were not allowed. RESULTS: Among all 32 eligible patients, there were 8 partial responses, for an overall response rate of 25% (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.5-43. 4%). The median survival time was 8.3 months and the 1-year survival rate was 38% (95% CI, 24-59%). Patients with PS 0-1 had a median survival of 11.7 months and a 1-year survival rate of 48%. Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was observed in 13% and 25% of the 148 treatment cycles, respectively. One patient died of neutropenic sepsis. Only 2 episodes of Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia were observed. Nonhematologic toxicity was minimal. CONCLUSIONS: Gemcitabine and vinorelbine is an active and well-tolerated regimen in patients with advanced NSCLC, with response and survival rates at least comparable to those achieved with standard platinum-based regimens. This combination may be particularly suitable for the elderly or for patients who cannot tolerate more toxic platinum-based regimens.",,,['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using primers located externally to the restriction site the competitor and the DNA from the malignant clone will be amplified under identical conditions. After restriction enzyme cleavage, the PCR products originating from the competitor and the malignant clone can be distinguished by size in a gel electrophoresis step and the amount of residual disease can be determined.

In this study, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to further characterize the role of glutamate-45 in carrier function by replacement with glutamine, arginine, aspartate, leucine, or tryptophan followed by tranfection of the mutated cDNAs into the MTX(r)A line, which lacks a functional endogenous carrier. Alterations in transport function with amino acid substitutions at this residue were not charge related. Hence, E45Q, E45R, and E45K all 1) increased carrier affinity for 5-formyltetrahydrofolate approximately 4-fold, 2) increased affinity for folic acid approximately 6- to 10-fold, 3) did not change affinity for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and 4) except for E45R decreased affinity for methotrexate (2- to 3-fold). In contrast, mutations E45D, E45L, and E45W generally reduced affinity for all these folates except for folic acid. Finally, chloride-dependent influx was only noted in the E45R mutant. These data further substantiate the important role that glutamate-45 plays in the selectivity of binding of folates to RFC1 and establish that it is the addition of a positive charge at this site and not the loss of a negative charge that results in the induced anion dependence. These and other studies indicate that mutations in the first transmembrane domain can have a markedly selective impact on the affinity of RFC1 for folate compounds and in particularly a highly salutary effect on binding of the oxidized folate, folic acid.",,,,,,,['CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

While genetic studies indicate that IKKbeta is the principal kinase involved in proinflammatory cytokine-induced IkappaB phosphorylation, the function of the equivalently expressed IKKalpha is less clear. Here we demonstrate that assembly of IKKalpha with IKKbeta in the heterodimeric signalsome serves two important functions: (i) in unstimulated cells, IKKalpha inhibits the constitutive IkappaB kinase activity of IKKbeta; (ii) in activated cells, IKKalpha kinase activity is required for the induction of IKKbeta. The introduction of kinase-inactive IKKalpha, activation loop mutants of IKKalpha, or IKKalpha antisense RNA into 293 or HeLa cells blocks NIK (NF-kappaB-inducing kinase)-induced phosphorylation of the IKKbeta activation loop occurring in functional signalsomes. In contrast, catalytically inactive mutants of IKKbeta do not block NIK-mediated phosphorylation of IKKalpha in these macromolecular signaling complexes. This requirement for kinase-proficient IKKalpha to activate IKKbeta in heterodimeric IKK signalsomes is also observed with other NF-kappaB inducers, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax, Cot, and MEKK1. Conversely, the theta isoform of protein kinase C, which also induces NF-kappaB/Rel, directly targets IKKbeta for phosphorylation and activation, possibly acting through homodimeric IKKbeta complexes. Together, our findings indicate that activation of the heterodimeric IKK complex by a variety of different inducers proceeds in a directional manner and is dependent on the kinase activity of IKKalpha to activate IKKbeta.",,PMC85235,,,,,['P30A127763/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The majority of cases of CML are associated with the (9;22) chromosome translocation that generates the bcr-abl chimeric gene. Alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) treatment induces hematological remission and prolongs life in 75% of CML patients in the chronic phase. It has been shown that mice deficient in interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP), a member of the interferon regulatory factor family, manifest a CML-like syndrome. We have shown that expression of Bcr-Abl in bone marrow (BM) cells from 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-treated mice by retroviral transduction efficiently induces a myeloproliferative disease in mice resembling human CML. To directly test whether icsbp can function as a tumor suppressor gene, we examined the effect of ICSBP on Bcr-Abl-induced CML-like disease using this murine model for CML. We found that expression of the ICSBP protein was significantly decreased in Bcr-Abl-induced CML-like disease. Forced coexpression of ICSBP inhibited the Bcr-Abl-induced colony formation of BM cells from 5-FU-treated mice in vitro and Bcr-Abl-induced CML-like disease in vivo. Interestingly, coexpression of ICSBP and Bcr-Abl induced a transient B-lymphoproliferative disorder in the murine model of Bcr-Abl-induced CML-like disease. Overexpression of ICSBP consistently promotes rather than inhibits Bcr-Abl-induced B lymphoproliferation in a murine model where BM cells from non-5-FU-treated donors were used, indicating that ICSBP has a specific antitumor activity toward myeloid neoplasms. We also found that overexpression of ICSBP negatively regulated normal hematopoiesis. These data provide direct evidence that ICSBP can act as a tumor suppressor that regulates normal and neoplastic proliferation of hematopoietic cells.",,PMC85233,,,,,"['R01 CA068008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that these cytokines activate NF-kappaB in cytokine-dependent developing sensory neurons. Preventing NF-kappaB activation with a super-repressor IkappaB-alpha protein markedly reduces the number of neurons that survive in the presence of cytokines, but has no effect on the survival response of the same neurons to brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF), an unrelated neurotrophic factor that binds to a different class of receptors. Cytokine-dependent sensory neurons cultured from embryos that lack p65, a transcriptionally active subunit of NF-kappaB, have a markedly impaired ability to survive in response to cytokines, but respond normally to BDNF. There is increased apoptosis of cytokine- dependent neurons in p65(-/)- embryos in vivo, resulting in a reduction in the total number of these neurons compared with their numbers in wild-type embryos. These results demonstrate that NF-kappaB plays a key role in mediating the survival response of developing neurons to cytokines.",,PMC2174280,,,,,,['J Cell Biol. 2000 Jan 24;148(2):223-5.

We identified this receptor by the functional screening of a library of complementary DNAs (cDNA) from feline T cells. The library, which was cloned into a retroviral vector, was introduced into FeLV-C-resistant murine (NIH 3T3) cells. The gene conferring susceptibility to FeLV-C was isolated and reintroduced into the same cell type, as well as into FeLV-C-resistant rat (NRK 52E) cells, to verify its role in viral infection. The receptor cDNA is predicted to encode a protein of 560 amino acids with 12 membrane-spanning domains, termed FLVCR. FLVCR has significant amino acid sequence homology with members of the major facilitator superfamily and especially D-glucarate transporters described in bacteria and in C. elegans. As FeLV-C impairs the in vivo differentiation of burst-forming unit-erythroid to colony-forming unit-erythroid, we hypothesize that this transporter system could have an essential role in early erythropoiesis. In further studies, a 6-kb fragment of the human FLVCR gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA, using homologous cDNA sequences identified in the human Expressed Sequence Tags database. By radiation hybrid mapping, the human gene was localized to a 0.5-centiMorgan region on the long arm of chromosome 1 at q31.3.",,,,,,['Blood 2000 Jul 1;96(1):8'],"['CA51080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL31823/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We sought to determine whether S3a, like bcl-2, influenced the response of cells to chemotherapeutic drugs and ATRA. Cell lines were studied in which S3a was genetically increased or disrupted; increased S3a was regularly associated with increased plating efficiency and increased sensitivity to either cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) or doxorubicin (DNR). S3a did not affect the sensitivity of cells to paclitaxel. Pulse exposures to either (3)HTdR or ara-C showed a greater percentage of clonogenic cells in the S phase of the cell cycle in cells with increased S3a than in controls. Cells with increased S3a responded to ATRA by increased ara-C or DNR sensitivity, whereas cells with reduced S3a protein were either protected by ATRA or not affected. We studied cryopreserved blast cells from patients with AML or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). S3a protein levels were heterogeneous in these populations. In 32 cryopreserved blast populations, S3a levels were significantly correlated with both bcl-2 and with cell growth in culture. As in cell lines, high S3a in cryopreserved blasts was associated with ATRA-induced sensitization to ara-C.

To test these HRS-like cells for a potential clonal relationship to the B-CLL cells, single cells were micromanipulated from immunostained tissue sections, and rearranged immunoglobulin genes were amplified from HRS-like cells and B-CLL cells and sequenced. The same variable (V) gene rearrangements with shared and distinct somatic mutations were found in HRS-like and B-CLL cells from 1 patient, which indicates derivation of these cells from 2 distinct members of a germinal-center B-cell clone. Separate clonal V gene rearrangements were amplified from HRS-like and B-CLL cells from 2 other patients, showing concomitant presence of 2 distinct expanded B-cell clones. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected in the HRS-like cells of these 2 latter cases, indicating clonal expansion of an EBV-harboring B cell in the setting of B-CLL. There is evidence that HRS-like cells in B-CLL, like HRS cells in HD, derive from germinal-center B cells. In all cases, somatic mutations have been detected in the rearranged V genes of the HRS-like cells, and in 1 of the EBV-positive HRS-like cell clones, somatic mutations rendered an originally functional V gene rearrangement nonfunctional.

The growth-inhibitory IC(50) values for As(2)O(3) treatment for 7 days against all these cell types ranged from 0.8 to 1.5 micromol/L. Exposure to 2 micromol/L As(2)O(3) for 7 days induced apoptosis of all cell types, including HL-60/Bcr-Abl and K562 cells. This was associated with the cytosolic accumulation of cyt c and preapoptotic mitochondrial events, such as the loss of inner membrane potential (DeltaPsim) and the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Treatment with As(2)O(3) (2 micromol/L) generated the activities of caspases, which produced the cleavage of the BH3 domain containing proapoptotic Bid protein and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Significantly, As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis of HL-60/Bcr-Abl and K562 cells was associated with a decline in Bcr-Abl protein levels, without any significant alterations in the levels of Bcl-x(L), Bax, Apaf-1, Fas, and FasL.

Here we investigated the potential of CpG-ODNs to cause proliferation, cytokine production, and regulation of surface molecules in human B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. CpG-ODN induced proliferation in both B-CLL cells and normal B cells; however, only B-CLL cells increased proliferative responses when CpG-ODN was added to co-cultures of CD40-ligand transfected mouse fibroblasts (CD40LF) and B cells. Production of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha was detectable at borderline levels, using CpG-ODN as the only stimulus. In contrast, when CpG-ODN was added to co-cultures of B cells and CD40LF, a strong increase in cytokine production occurred in B-CLL cells as well as in normal B cells. The surface molecules CD40, CD58, CD80, CD86, CD54, and MHC class I molecules were up-regulated in B-CLL cells, whereas CD95 expression was not influenced by CpG-ODN stimulation. The same pattern of surface molecule regulation was observed in normal B cells, but up-regulation of CD40 was significantly stronger in B-CLL cells. Costimulation with CpG-ODN and CD40LF resulted in further up-regulation of CD58, CD80, CD86, and MHC class I molecules. In contrast, CD95 expression induced by CD40-ligation was inhibited by CpG-ODN. CpG-ODN activated B-CLL cells acquired a strong stimulatory capacity toward T cells in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction. This effect was completely inhibited by a combination of anti-CD80 and anti-CD86 monoclonal antibody. Taken together, these findings suggest the possible use of CpG-ODN for immunotherapeutic strategies in patients with B-CLL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vector also encoded the human nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) to serve as a cell-surface marker for in vivo tracking of transduced cells. NGFR(+) cells were detected in blood leukocytes of all mice (n=16; range 16%-45%) 4 to 5 weeks after transplantation and were repeatedly detected in blood erythrocytes, platelets, monocytes, granulocytes, T cells, and B cells of all mice for up to 8 months. Transgene expression in individual mice was not blocked in the various cell lineages of the peripheral blood and spleen, in several stages of T-cell maturation in the thymus, or in the Lin(-/lo)Sca-1(+) and c-kit(+)Sca-1(+) subsets of bone marrow cells highly enriched for long-term multilineage-reconstituting activity. Serial transplantation of purified NGFR(+)c-kit(+)Sca-1(+) bone marrow cells resulted in the reconstitution of multilineage hematopoiesis by donor type NGFR(+) cells in all engrafted mice. The authors concluded that MMLV-based vectors were capable of efficient and sustained transgene expression in multiple lineages of peripheral blood cells and hematopoietic organs and in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations. Differentiation of engrafting HSC to peripheral blood cells is not necessarily associated with dramatic suppression of retroviral gene expression. In light of earlier studies showing that vector elements other than the long-terminal repeat enhancer, promoter, and primer binding site can have an impact on long-term transgene expression, these findings accentuate the importance of empirically testing retroviral vectors to determine lasting in vivo expression.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have developed a sensitive competitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for AML1-MTG8 transcripts, coupled with a competitive RT-PCR for the ABL transcript as a control to accurately estimate the level of amplifiable RNA. We have shown that AML1-MTG8 and ABL transcripts have equal degradation rates. Thus, this method is useful for multicenter studies. We studied 25 patients with t(8;21) AML by means of serial analysis done on bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples from 21 patients. Our analysis showed that, in general, a successful induction chemotherapy produces a reduction of 2 to 3 log in the level of AML1-MTG8, followed by a further 2 to 3 log after consolidation/intensification chemotherapy. Levels up to 1 x 10(3) and 1 x 10(2) molecules/microg of RNA in BM and PB, respectively, were compatible with durable remission. On the other hand, 5 patients with levels of 0.71 x 10(5) to 2.27 x 10(5) molecules/microg of RNA in BM and 2.27 x 10(3) to 2.27 x 10(4) molecules/microg of RNA in PB had hematologic relapse within 3 to 6 months. Our data indicate that serial quantitation of AML1-MTG8 transcripts is useful in identifying patients at high risk of relapse and may offer an opportunity for clinical intervention to prevent hematologic relapse. This approach was applied successfully in a patient who had an allogeneic BM transplantation. We also suggest that PB may be used an alternative to BM for quantitating AML1-MTG8 transcripts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with CML show considerable heterogeneity both in their presenting clinical features and in the time taken for evolution to blast crisis. In this study, metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that a substantial minority of patients with CML had large deletions adjacent to the translocation breakpoint on the derivative 9 chromosome, on the additional partner chromosome in variant translocations, or on both. The deletions spanned up to several megabases, had variable breakpoints, and could be detected by microsatellite polymerase chain reaction in unfractionated bone marrow and purified peripheral blood granulocytes. The deletions were likely to occur early and possibly at the time of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome translocation: deletions were detected at diagnosis in 11 patients, were found in all Ph-positive metaphases, and were more prevalent in patients with variant Ph chromosomes. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a median survival time of 36 months in patients with a deletion; patients without a detectable deletion survived > 90 months. The survival-time difference was significant on log-rank analysis (P =. 006). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the prognostic importance of deletion status was independent of age, sex, percentage of peripheral blood blasts, and platelet count. Our data therefore suggest that an apparently simple, balanced translocation may result not only in the generation of a dominantly acting fusion oncogene but also in the loss of one or more genes that influence disease progression.

To determine whether repeated passage would select for functional variants of the receptor, we analyzed mCAT1 amplified by RT-PCR after 12 serial passages. Several amino acid substitutions were identified that encoded functional receptor variants. In independent experiments, variants containing an isoleucine or a leucine instead of a phenylalanine at position 224 in the third extracellular domain of the receptor arose spontaneously and outgrew the parental vector, indicating that mutations at this site are highly selected in this system.

The experimental system used to develop the CTVI strategy for retroviruses is designed to block the production of infectious Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV). Two nucleases, Escherichia coli ribonulease HI and Staphylococcus nuclease, have been shown to be tolerated by the cell as Mo-MLV Gag-nuclease fusion polyproteins and still be active in the viral particles. The goal of this study was to determine what cellular and viral factors limit CTVI in cultured cells. The avian DF-1 cell line greatly expanded our ability to test the antiviral efficacy of CTVI in long-term assays and to determine the mechanism(s) of CTVI action. The CTVI antiviral effect is dependent on the level of Mo-MLV Gag-nuclease fusion polyprotein expressed. The Mo-MLV Gag-nuclease polyproteins produce a long-term prophylactic antiviral effect after a low- or high-dose Mo-MLV challenge. The Mo-MLV Gag-nuclease fusions have a significant therapeutic effect ( approximately 1000-fold) on the production of infectious Mo-MLV. The therapeutic CTVI effect can be improved by a second delivery of the CTVI fusion gene. Both the prophylactic and the therapeutic CTVI antiviral approaches can virtually eliminate the production of infectious Mo-MLV in vitro and are only limited by the number of cells in the population that do not express adequate levels of the CTVI fusion polyprotein.",,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relevant target tissues to consider in the dosimetric evaluation have been the cells on or near endosteal surfaces of bone, from which osteosarcomas are thought to arise, and hematopoietic bone marrow, which is associated with leukemia. The complex geometry of the soft tissue-bone intermixture makes calculations of absorbed doses to these target regions a difficult problem. In the case of photon or neutron radiations, charged particle equilibrium may not exist in the vicinity of a soft tissue-bone mineral interface. In this paper, absorbed fraction data are developed for calculations of the dose in the target tissues from electron emitters deposited within the volume or on the surfaces of trabecular bone. The skeletal average absorbed fractions presented are consistent with usage of this quantity in the contemporary dosimetric formulations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). Implementation of the new bone and marrow model is then developed within the context of the calculational schema of the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) Committee. Model parameters relevant to the calculation of dose conversion factors (S values) for different regions of the skeleton of individuals of various age are described, and an example calculation is performed for a monoclonal antibody which localizes in the marrow. The utility of these calculations for radiation dose calculations in nuclear medicine is discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major health concern associated with benzene exposure is leukemia. Studies using microsomal preparations from human, mouse, rabbit, and rat to determine species differences in the metabolism of benzene to phenol, hydroquinone and catechol, indicate that the rat is most similar, both quantitatively and qualitatively, to the human in pulmonary microsomal metabolism of benzene. With hepatic microsomes, rat is most similar to human in metabolite formation at the two lower concentrations examined (24 and 200 microM), while at the two higher concentrations (700 and 1000 microM) mouse is most similar in phenol formation. In all species, the enzyme system responsible for benzene metabolism approached saturation in hepatic microsomes but not in pulmonary microsomes. In pulmonary microsomes from mouse, rat, and human, phenol appeared to competitively inhibit benzene metabolism resulting in a greater proportion of phenol being converted to hydroquinone when the benzene concentration increased. The opposite effect was seen in hepatic microsomes. These findings support the hypothesis that the lung plays an important role in benzene metabolism, and therefore, toxicity.",,,,,,,['ES04362/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective case series. PARTICIPANTS: Ten cases of RLH of the uvea on file at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology with sufficient formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue for analysis. METHODS: Clinical, histologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) characteristics of uveal lymphoid proliferations were studied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Morphologic, immunohistochemical, and PCR characteristics of study cases. RESULTS: Patient age ranged from 40 to 73 years at time of enucleation, with a mean age of 55 years. Retinal detachment was noted clinically in nine patients and glaucoma in eight. All patients were treated with enucleation, and three received radiotherapy. Histologically, two cases were interpreted as RLH and eight were well-differentiated small-cell lymphoma (WDSCL). Systemic lymphoid infiltrate developed in two patients, but there were no deaths with a mean follow-up of 9.9 years. Mature lymphocytes were noted in the iris and angle structures; the atypical cells of uveal lymphoma were found in the choroid and ciliary body. Eight cases were monoclonal by B-cell and T-cell markers and/or immunoglobulin light chain restriction. Amplifiable DNA was present in 6 of 10 cases by PCR. Three cases monoclonal by cell markers were also monoclonal by PCR, but two cases monoclonal by cell markers could not be confirmed by PCR. Lymphoid follicles with germinal centers were found in two cases of RLH and five cases of WDSCL. Nine specimens demonstrated extraocular lymphoid involvement of the episclera and orbit; most appeared more benign morphologically than the choroidal infiltrates. Extraocular infiltrates of WDSCL were monoclonal by immunohistochemistry in five cases, polyclonal in one case, and indeterminate in two cases. CONCLUSIONS: Most cases (8 of 10) previously described as RLH were low-grade B-cell lymphomas histologically and by immunohistochemistry. PCR results agreed with histologic diagnosis in four of six cases. Open-angle glaucoma was common and related mostly to lymphocytic infiltration of the angle structures. Extraocular involvement is common but may not be representative of the choroidal lesion. Prognosis is excellent in low-grade uveal lymphoid neoplasia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, an in vitro selected RNA aptamer sequence was identified that mediates mRNA transport in vivo when placed in the primary binding site on stem-loop IID of the Rex response element. We present the solution structure of the HTLV-1 arginine-rich Rex peptide bound to its RNA aptamer target determined by multidimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. RESULTS: The Rex peptide in a predominantly extended conformation threads through a channel formed by the shallow and widened RNA major groove and a looped out guanine. The RNA aptamer contains three stems separated by a pair of two-base bulges, and adopts an unanticipated fold in which both junctional sites are anchored through base triple formation. Binding specificity is associated with intermolecular hydrogen bonding between guanidinium groups of three non-adjacent arginines and the guanine base edges of three adjacent G.C pairs. CONCLUSIONS: The extended S-shaped conformation of the Rex peptide, together with previous demonstrations of a beta-hairpin conformation for the bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) Tat peptide and an alpha-helical conformation for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Rev peptide in complex with their respective RNA targets, expands our understanding of the strategies employed by ARMs for adaptive recognition and highlights the importance of RNA tertiary structure in accommodating minimalist elements of protein secondary structure.",,,,,,,"['CA-49982/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P41 RR09793/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,['PDB/1C4J'],,,,,,,

Bone pain as the presenting complaint is common, with a reported incidence of 27% to 50%. Radiologic abnormalities associated with leukemia in children has been described previously. In the literature, the incidence of spinal involvement is controversial, but there is agreement that the spine is less commonly involved than are the long bones. At the onset of the disease, only 10% of children have normal peripheral blood counts. If the patient has spinal involvement and a normal leukocyte count, the diagnosis is often unclear. Only three of these patients have been described in the literature; this article adds one more patient with acute lymphatic leukemia with back pain as the main symptom, vertebral collapse, and a normal peripheral blood cell count at the time of initial presentation. It illustrates that delay in diagnosis frequently occurs, with the classic features of the disease being uniformly absent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, another arsenical, As2O3 was shown to be effective in treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia. We have investigated the anti-tumour activities of Mel-B either with or without all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) using the MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, as well as the PC-3 and DU 145 human prostate cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. The antiproliferative effects of Mel-B and/or ATRA against breast and prostate cancer were tested in vitro using clonogenic assays and in vivo in triple immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, the mechanism of action of these compounds was studied by examining the cell cycle, levels of bcl-2, apoptosis and antiproliferative potency using a pulse-exposure assay. Clonogenic assays showed that the cancer cell lines were sensitive to the inhibitory effect of Mel-B (effective dose that inhibited 50% clonal growth [ED50]: 7 x 10(-9) M for MCF-7, 2 x 10(-7) M for PC-3, 3 x 10(-7) M for DU145 cells. Remarkably, the combination of Mel-B and ATRA had an enhanced antiproliferative activity against all three cancer cell lines. Furthermore, the combination of Mel-B and ATRA induced a high level of apoptosis in all three cell lines. Treatment of PC-3 and MCF-7 tumours growing in triple immunodeficient mice with Mel-B and ATRA either alone or in combination markedly retarded tumour size and weight of the tumours without major side-effects. In conclusion, our results suggest that either Mel-B alone or with ATRA may be a useful, novel therapy for breast and prostate cancers.",,PMC2363281,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Screening of cDNA libraries from the leukemia Jurkat cell line and from the adult human thymus resulted in the isolation of a novel protein of 793 amino acids (89,758 Da). This protein has in vitro CCAAT binding properties and has been called ICBP90. Adult thymus, fetal thymus, fetal liver, and bone marrow, known as active tissues in terms of cell proliferation, are the tissues richest in ICBP90 mRNA. In contrast, highly differentiated tissues and cells such as the central nervous system and peripheral leukocytes are free of ICBP90 mRNA. Western blotting experiments showed a simultaneous expression of topoisomerase IIalpha and ICBP90 in proliferating human lung fibroblasts. Simultaneous expression of both proteins has also been observed in HeLa cells, but in both proliferating and confluent cells. Overexpression of ICBP90 in COS-1-transfected cells induced an enhanced expression of endogenous topoisomerase IIalpha. Immunohistochemistry experiments showed that topoisomerase IIalpha and ICBP90 were coexpressed in proliferating areas of paraffin-embedded human appendix tissues and in high-grade breast carcinoma tissues. We have identified ICBP90, which is a novel CCAAT binding protein, and our results suggest that it may be involved in topoisomerase IIalpha expression. ICBP90 may also be useful as a new proliferation marker for cancer tissues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under these conditions, high levels of NOD/SCID repopulating activity were preserved, but the levels of gene marking in engrafting cell populations measured by expression of a reporter transgene were low. Extension of the transduction period by 24 hr (total culture period, 72 hr) under the same cytokine conditions resulted in high levels of gene marking, but on closer analysis expression was limited predominantly to the myeloid population. Efficient transduction of both lymphoid and myeloid lineages could be achieved only if the transduction protocol was extended by a further 24 hr (total culture period, 96 hr), suggesting that myeloid lineage-committed precursors are capable of repopulation, and that over shorter time periods transduction is largely restricted to this population. This adds to the emerging evidence of heterogeneity within the SRC compartment, and has important implications for the interpretation of this assay in stem cell transplantation and gene transfer studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After retrovirus-mediated gene transfer of tk-neo in PHA/IL-2-stimulated primary T lymphocytes and G418 selection, T cells retained their proliferative activity, alloresponsiveness, ability to produce and to respond to IL-2, and ganciclovir (gcv)-specific sensitivity. When the four different transduction techniques were compared, no significant differences were seen in terms of cellular viability, proliferation capacity, and immunophenotyping. tk gene expression was the same in all transduced selected populations, as indicated by gcv sensitivity. Transduction efficiency was evaluated by semiquantitative PCR. Using the standard supernatant infection method, the rate of infection was extremely low (<5%). After adding the centrifugation step or performing supernatant infection on fibronectin fragment-coated wells, PCR analysis showed a 30%-40% rate of transduced cells. After infection by cocultivation, the rate of transduced cells was 30%-40%. These results demonstrate that supernatant infection plus centrifugation, supernatant infection on fibronectin fragment-coated wells, and cocultivation methods provide equivalent rates of transduced cells. The lack of reproducibility and safety indicates that cocultivation is not suitable for clinical studies. In our view, supernatant infection plus centrifugation is easier to perform than using fibronectin fragments, and it is currently the optimal method for clinical studies when large quantities of T lymphocytes are being processed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The applicability of double APAAP was analyzed on bone marrow (BM) samples obtained from 12 patients (8 with AML, 3 with ALL, and 1 with undifferentiated acute leukemia [AUL]) randomly chosen from a larger group of 22 ULCA+ patients treated at our center in a 3-year period (22% observed ULCA+ AL frequency). The percentages of ULCA+ BM cells before chemotherapy were in the range of 5%-60%, which dropped to 0%-7% in 10 patients who achieved remission (range 0%-7%, p < 0.01). However, these cells could also be found 60 days after the initiation of therapy, ranging from 0%-2% of all nucleated cells. In 2 of 10 patients who achieved remission, 2% ULCA+ BM cells were found on days 35 and 60 after initiation of chemotherapy, and this finding was followed by relapse on days 110 and 270. However, the other 8 patients remained in remission despite positive finding of ULCA+ BM cells ranging from 0.2%-2% on at least one occasion. In 2 patients with AML FAB-M3 and cytomorphologic remission, the finding of ULCA+ cells by double APAAP correlated with the molecular finding of PML/RARalpha junction. These results indicate that double APAAP staining can identify leukemic cells in samples with a cytomorphologic pattern consistent with remission, but its applicability in detection of MRD awaits additional studies on a larger number of patients with ULCA+ AL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells (MNC) from 103 patients suspected of having polycythemia vera (PV, 76 patients) or essential thrombocythemia (ET, 27 patients) were grown in collagen-based, serum-free, cytokine-free semisolid medium. Colony analysis at day 8 or 10 showed that this collagen assay is specific, as endogenous growth of erythroid colonies was never observed in cultures of 16 healthy donors and 6 chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients. Endogenous erythroid colony formation was observed in 53.3% of patients suspected of PV, with only 15.4% of positive cultures for patients with 1 minor PV criterion and 72% (p = 0.009) of positive cultures for patients with > or =2 minor or 1 major PV criterion. Similarly, endogenous growth of erythroid colonies was found in 44.4% of patients suspected of ET, with 31.6% of positive cultures for patients with 1 ET criterion versus 75% for patients with > or =2 ET criteria. In addition, we found that in collagen gels, tests of erythropoietin (EPO) hypersensitivity in the presence of 0.01 or 0.05 U/ml of EPO and tests of endogenous colony-forming units-megakaryocyte (CFU-MK) formation cannot be used to detect PV or ET, as these tests were positive for, respectively, 21.4% and 50% of healthy donors and 83% and 50% of CML patients. A retrospective analysis suggests that collagen assays are more sensitive than methylcellulose assays to assess endogenous growth of erythroid colonies. In summary, serum-free collagen-based colony assays are simple and reliable assays of endogenous growth of erythroid colonies in myeloproliferative diseases. They also appear to be more sensitive than methylcellulose-based assays.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this system, it has been suggested that one contribution made by the co-culture cells to embryo development is production of the cytokine leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). However, there are concerns about exposure of early embryos to serum due to its incompatibility with embryo cryosurvival. In this study, the influence of two protein supplements (synthetic serum substitute (SSS), a lipid-free human serum-derived product) and oestrous cow serum (ECS)) on Vero cell LIF secretion was compared, with the aim of designing a co-culture system that is supportive of bovine embryo cryopreservation. Vero cells cultured for 72 h in medium 199 + 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (recommended maintenance medium for this cell line) secreted detectable amounts of LIF (13.1 +/- 0.9 pg LIF per 10(5) cells). Culture in mSOF, the medium routinely used in this laboratory for embryo culture, also supported LIF secretion in Vero cells. However, the amount of LIF was tenfold higher (24.7 +/- 6.2 pg LIF per 10(5) cells; P < 0.05) when mSOF was supplemented with 10% (v/v) ECS compared with supplementation with 2% (v/v) SSS. Results of a second series of experiments in which supplementation with each protein was normalized to 10% revealed similar differences in LIF secretion, indicating that LIF secretion was affected by the type, not the amount, of protein. Time course analysis revealed stepwise increases (P < 0.05) in cumulative LIF secretion with every 24 h of culture in mSOF + either SSS or ECS. In terms of embryo development and post-cryopreservation viability, medium supplementation with 2% (v/v) SSS alone versus the two-step system of 2% (v/v) SSS (days 1-4) + 10% (v/v) ECS (days 4-10) had no influence (P > 0.05) on the ability of bovine blastocysts to hatch, with or without intervening cryostorage. However, the rate of blastocyst formation (expressed as the percentage of cleaved embryos) was only 27% in the presence of 2% (v/v) SSS, and increased almost twofold (P < 0.05) when ECS was added beginning on day 4 of co-culture. In summary, Vero cell LIF secretion was increased markedly by ECS. A two-step system of medium supplementation, in which embryos are exposed to ECS beginning on day 4 of in vitro development combined high rates of blastocyst formation with cryotolerance. This effect may be a result of limiting embryo exposure to serum-derived lipid until after the eight-cell stage and providing an increase in LIF during the critical developmental stages of compaction and cavitation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to assess indications to surgery in relation to clinical presentation with typical hemorrhagic features or severe thrombocytopenia only; interval between onset of symptoms and splenectomy; failure of medical management and complications from steroid administration; scintigraphic studies predictive of response to splenectomy and preoperative treatment in patients with severe thrombocytopenia were also studied. The Authors reported response rates to splenectomy of 84% without mortality and only 11% of postoperative complications. These results encouraged to surgery for treatment of those patients with severe thrombocytopenia, who fail to obtain remission or develop serious complications after medical therapy. The splenectomy cured severe thrombocytopenia also in some patients with acquired immunodeficiency (HIV+). Moreover the Authors discuss the indications in patients with chronic lymphatic leukaemia and lymphoma diseases. In selected patients the splenectomy has the potential to relieve symptoms due to splenomegaly, correct cytopenias, specify hystological diagnosis and modify the disease course of malignant lymphomas. In fact splenomegaly sometimes complicated the course of malignant lymphomas because of hematologic abnormalities that are inconsistent with active chemotherapy.",La splenectomia nelle trombocitopenie immuni ed in altre malattie ematologiche.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many chemotherapeutic protocols have been designed to try to improve treatment results for adult ALL. Two chemotherapeutic protocols were used to treat young adult ALL patients in our institute and treatment results are reported. METHODS: From 1984 through 1997, 46 young adult patients with ALL were treated. There were 43 males and three females. Their ages ranged from 16 to 38 years, with a median of 24 years. Thirty-two patients (group A) received a four-week conventional induction regimen with daunomycin, vincristine, prednisolone, and L-asparaginase, followed by prophylaxis of the central nervous system (CNS) with intrathecal methotrexate and cranial irradiation, as well as maintenance therapy with oral 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate. Fourteen patients (group B) received the modified protocol of the German multicenter trial for adult ALL (GMALL) with a two-phase induction regimen, CNS prophylaxis and maintenance therapy. RESULTS: In group A, 25 of 32 patients achieved complete remission (CR), three obtained partial remission and four died of treatment-related complications during induction therapy. The median duration of remission (DR) was 12 months (range, 3-39 months) and the median overall survival time (OST) was 13 months (range, 0.5-50 months). Of the 25 patients who achieved CR, 21 relapsed and died. In group B, 11 of 14 patients obtained CR and three died of leukopenia-related infectious complications during induction. The median DR was 12 months (range, 8-37 months) and the median OST was 15 months (range, 0.5-39 months). During follow-up, 10 of 11 patients relapsed from ALL and died. Only one patient who received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation first CR is still alive. No statistical differences between the two groups were noted in terms of CR rate, DR (p = 0.87) and OST (p = 0.34). However, the the GMALL protocol had during the significantly more hematologic toxicity during induction therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that young adult ALL is a disease with a very poor prognosis and conventional chemotherapy is not adequate for its treatment. The notion that GMALL protocol is better than conventional therapy in the treatment of adult ALL cannot be justified by our data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consistent with this finding, we show that IFNs and RA rapidly enhanced CD26 gene and protein expression in chronic B lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells. Immunoblot analyses revealed that unstimulated B-CLL cells expressed detectable levels of serine/tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1alpha, and RA and IFN-gamma treatment led to increased levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1alpha and its nuclear accumulation. As shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, RA and IFN-gamma increased the binding of a nuclear protein to the GAS-CD26 element. Shift-Western blotting identified Stat1alpha as the GAS-CD26 binding factor. Augmented levels of CD26 protein in malignant B cells cultured with IFNs or RA coincided with the enhancement of DPPIV activity. Taken together, our results are in favor of the IFN-/RA-mediated upregulation of CD26/DPPIV in B-CLL through the signaling pathway involving Stat1alpha and the GAS response element of CD26 promoter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GH exerts its biological action by stimulating JAK2, a GH receptor (GHR)-associated tyrosine kinase. Activated JAK2 phosphorylates itself and GHR, thus initiating multiple signaling pathways. In this work, we demonstrate that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) down-regulate GH signaling via a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathway. PDGF substantially reduces tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK2 induced by GH but not interferon-gamma or leukemia inhibitory factor. PDGF, but not epidermal growth factor, decreases tyrosyl phosphorylation of GHR (by approximately 90%) and the amount of both total cellular GHR (by approximately 80%) and GH binding (by approximately 70%). The inhibitory effect of PDGF on GH-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK2 and GHR is abolished by depletion of 4beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-sensitive PKCs with chronic PMA treatment and is severely inhibited by GF109203X, an inhibitor of PKCs. In contrast, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase appear not to be involved in this inhibitory effect of PDGF. LPA, a known activator of PKC, also inhibits GH-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK2 and GHR and reduces the number of GHR. We propose that ligands that activate PKC, including PDGF, LPA, and PMA, down-regulate GH signaling by decreasing the number of cell surface GHR through promoting GHR internalization and degradation and/or cleavage of membrane GHR and release of the extracellular domain of GHR.",,,,,,,"['R01 DK034171/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 34171/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07315/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 HD 18258/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We investigated the SU-receptor interaction by using a naturally occurring soluble SU which was encoded by the envelope (env) gene of a defective endogenous MuLV, Fv-4(r). Binding of the SU to mCAT-1-positive mouse cells was completed by 1 min at 37 degrees C. The SU could not bind to mouse cells that were persistently infected by ecotropic MuLVs (but not amphotropic or dualtropic MuLVs) or transfected with wild-type ecotropic env genes or a mutant env gene which can express only precursor Env protein that is restricted to retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. These cells were also resistant to superinfection by ecotropic MuLVs. Thus, superinfection resistance correlated with the lack of SU-binding capacity. After binding to the cells, the SU appeared to undergo some conformational changes within 1 min in a temperature-dependent manner. This was suggested by the different properties of two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) reactive with the same C-terminal half of the Fv-4(r) SU domain, including a proline-rich motif which was shown to be important for conformation of the SU and interaction between the SU and the transmembrane protein. One MAb reacting with the soluble SU bound to cells was dissociated by a temperature shift from 4 to 37 degrees C. Such dissociation was not observed in cells synthesizing the SU or when another MAb was used, indicating that the dissociation was not due to a temperature-dependent release of the MAb but to possible conformational changes in the SU.",,PMC111660,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In microglia, viral transcription was unaffected but envelope proteins were insufficiently cleaved into mature viral proteins and were not detected on the microglia cell surface.

However, foamy virus replication also resembles that of hepadnaviruses in many respects. Because hepadnaviruses replicate in an integrase-independent manner, we were interested in investigating the characteristics of human foamy virus (HFV) integration. We have shown that HFV requires a functional integrase protein for infectivity. Our analyses have revealed that in single-cell clones derived from HFV-infected erythroleukemia-derived cells (H92), there were up to 20 proviral copies per host cell genome as determined by Southern blot and fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis. Use of specific probes has also shown that a majority of the proviruses contain the complete tas gene, which encodes the viral transactivator, and are not derived from Deltatas cDNAs, which have been shown to arise rapidly in infected cells. To demonstrate that the multiple proviral sequences are due to integration instead of recombination, we have sequenced the junctions between the proviral sequences and the host genome and found that the proviruses have authentic long terminal repeat ends and that each integration is at a different chromosomal site. A virus lacking the Gag nuclear localization signal accumulates fewer proviruses, suggesting that nuclear translocation is important for high proviral load. Since persistently infected H92 clones are not resistant to superinfection, the relative importance of an intracellular versus extracellular mechanism in proviral acquisition has yet to be determined.",,PMC111647,,,,,"['T32 CA009229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM07270/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA018282/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007270/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA18282/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL053762/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL53762/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA080416/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

As for most internal viral fusion peptides, there is a proline near the center of this sequence. Robson-Garnier structure predictions of the ASLV fusion peptide and immediate surrounding sequences indicate a region of order (beta-sheet), a tight reverse turn containing the proline, and a second region of order (alpha-helix). Similar motifs (order, turn or loop, order) are predicted for other internal fusion peptides. In this study, we made and analyzed 12 Env proteins with substitutions for the central proline of the fusion peptide. Env proteins were expressed in 293T cells and in murine leukemia virus pseudotyped virions. We found the following. (i) All mutant Envs form trimers, but when the bulky hydrophobic residues phenylalanine or leucine are substituted for proline, trimerization is weakened. (ii) Surprisingly, the proline is required for maximal processing of the Env precursor into its surface and TM subunits; the amount of processing correlates linearly with the propensity of the substituted residue to be found in a reverse turn. (iii) Nonetheless, proteolytically processed forms of all Envs are preferentially incorporated into pseudotyped virions. (iv) All Envs bind receptor with affinity greater than or equal to wild-type affinity. (v) Residues that support high infectivity cluster with proline at intermediate hydrophobicity. Infectivity is not supported by mutant Envs in which charged residues are substituted for proline, nor is it supported by the trimerization-defective phenylalanine and leucine mutants. Our findings suggest that the central proline in the ASLV fusion peptide is important for the formation of the native (metastable) Env structure as well as for membrane interactions that lead to fusion.",,PMC111643,,,,,"['R01 AI022470/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI22470/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Serum analyses revealed hyperferremia, 87% transferrin saturation, and 5- to 10-fold elevations in ferritin concentration, reflecting markedly increased tissue iron stores. Since both toxic and therapeutic effects of anthracyclines are mediated by formation of reactive free radicals via iron-catalyzed reactions, these observations suggest that iron overload may have enhanced myocardial susceptibility to cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin. Impairments in other myocardial antioxidant defenses, such as deficiencies in catalase and glutathione S-transferase that are known to exist in rhinoceros erythrocytes, may have been underlying factors contributing to an inherent sensitivity of rhinoceros tissues to oxidant-induced injury.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the expression kinetics of cyclins A, B, D1, E and cdks 1, 2, 4, 6 by RT-PCR coupled with densitometry and correlated to the growth fraction (percentage of S cells). This analysis was performed using an experimental murine leukemic model, generated by in vivo administration of murine clonogenic cells Wehi-3b injected into balb-c mice. Differential expression of cyclins and cdks was observed between normal and tumoral cells with different patterns of expression between G1 and G2M cyclins-cdks. G1 cyclins cdks expression was significantly increased in tumor cells when compared to normal cells. In the same manner, G2M cyclins cdks expression was only observed in tumor cells at a lower level than for G1 cyclins cdks, but not detected in normal cells. These differences correlated with the growth fraction for both the G1 cyclins cdks (r = 0.91, 0.94, 0.85, 0.90 and 0.96 for cyclin D1, cyclin E, cdk2, cdk4 and cdk6, respectively) and the G2M cyclins cdks (r = 0.96, 0.97 and 0.93 for cyclins A, B and cdkl respectively). Analysis of cyclins cdks expression kinetics during tumoral progression shows that cyclins A, B and cdkl were expressed from the 12th day on of disease, increased until the death of the animals and correlated with the growth fraction (r = 0.94, 0.95 and 0.97 for cyclins A, B and cdk1 respectively) (n = 20). Overexpression of other cyclins cdks were observed, from the 6th day on for cyclin D1, the 12th day for cdk2 and cdk4, the 15th day for cdk6 and the 20th day for cyclin E. These increases persisted during tumoral progression and correlated with the growth fraction (r = 0.85, 0.94, 0.93, 0.96, and 0.98 for cyclin D1, cyclin E, cdk2, cdk4 and cdk6, respectively) (n = 20).

The role of the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations and INF-gamma in the development of IP were analyzed using a murine model of retroviral-associated IP. Infected mice depleted of CD8+ T cells developed IP similarly to untreated infected mice, suggesting that the CD8+ T cell population does not play a role in IP. Furthermore, depletion of CD8+ T cells did not alter the level of viral RNA in lungs, suggesting that cytotoxic T cells may not serve a role in controlling virus burden in lungs. In contrast, depletion of CD4+ T cells in infected mice prevented the development of IP and inhibited inflammatory cytokine expression, suggesting that CD4+ T cells are important for the development of IP. IFN-gamma -/- mice infected with virus for 10 weeks developed IP, although the severity of lymphocytic infiltration was substantially reduced compared to infected wild-type mice. The data suggest that persistent viral antigen in the lung may drive a CD4+ T cell-mediated immune response, resulting in the chronic production of IFN-gamma which amplifies a chronic inflammatory response in the lung resulting in tissue injury.",,,,,,,['HL53246/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported the results in T- and B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and hairy cell leukemia. This report focuses on the outcome in T-cell malignancies: T-CLL, Sezary syndrome (Sezary), mycosis fungoides (MF) and T-zone lymphoma (TZL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of the 92 patients with these diagnoses enrolled, 76 were evaluable for response and toxicity, i.e., 25 of 28 with T-CLL, 21 of 26 with Sezary, 22 of 26 with MF, and 8 of 12 with TZL. All patients had progressive and advanced disease. Pentostatin was administered at a dosage of 4 mg/m2 every week for the first 3 weeks, then 4 mg/m2 every 14 days for another 6 weeks, followed by maintenance therapy of 4 mg/m2 monthly for a maximum of 6 months. RESULTS: Response rates (complete and partial responses) in patients with Sezary (n = 22) or MF (n = 21) were 33% and 23%, respectively, and in patients with T-CLL (n = 21) or TZL (n = 8) 8% and 25%, respectively. Sixteen (21%) patients died during the first ten weeks of treatment: twelve of progressive disease, two of infectious complications with progressive disease, one of myocard infarction and one of renal failure related to administration of i.v. contrast. Major toxicity (grade 3-4) included infection in 11% of patients, nausea/vomiting in 4%, diarrhea in 3%. Hematologic toxicity was mild to non-existent. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that pentostatin is active in Sezary and MF but showed marginal activity in T-CLL or TZL. Toxicities are mild to moderate at the dose schedule administered. Due to its relatively specific lympholytic effect and its favorable toxicity spectrum, pentostatin might be especially useful for the palliative treatment of T-cell malignancies.",,,,,,,"['5U10 CA11488-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U10 CA11488-23/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The classification includes lymphoid, myeloid, histiocytic, and mast cell neoplasms. DESIGN: The WHO project involves 10 committees of pathologists, who have developed lists and definitions of disease entities. A Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC)) of international hematologists and oncologists was formed to ensure that the classification will be useful to clinicians. A meeting was held in November, 1997, to discuss clinical issues related to the classification. RESULTS: The WHO has adopted the 'Revised European American Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms' (R.E.A.L.), published in 1994 by the International Lymphoma Study Group (ILSG), as the classification of lymphoid neoplasms. This approach to classification is based on the principle that a classification is a list of 'real' disease entities, which are defined by a combination of morphology, immunophenotype, genetic features, and clinical features. The relative importance of each of these features varies among diseases, and there is no one 'gold standard'. The WHO Classification has applied the principles of the R.E.A.L. Classification to myeloid and histiocytic neoplasms. The classification of myeloid neoplasms recognizes distinct entities defined by a combination of morphology and cytogenetic abnormalities. The CAC meeting, which was organized around a series of clinical questions, was able to reach a consensus on most of the questions posed. The questions and the consensus are discussed in detail below. Among other things, the CAC concluded that clinical groupings of lymphoid neoplasms were neither necessary nor desirable. Patient treatment is determined by the specific type of lymphoma, with the addition of grade within the tumor type, if applicable, and clinical prognostic factors such as the international prognostic index (IPI). CONCLUSION: The experience of developing the WHO Classification has produced a new and exciting degree of cooperation and communication between oncologists and pathologists from around the world, which should facilitate progress in the understanding and treatment of hematologic malignancies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We carried out in vitro tests with a 4-day culture and a methyl-thiazol-tetrazolium assay on bone marrow samples from 209 children newly diagnosed with ALL. After testing the resistance of leukemic cells to 14 drugs, we classified the patients into two groups according to their sensitivity to three drugs (prednisolone, L-asparaginase, and vincristine) used in remission induction therapy. The three-drug resistant group (RR: sensitive to no drugs or to one drug) correlated with both short-term and long-term treatment failure. Three-year event-free survival (95% confidence interval) for the sensitive group (SS: sensitive to two or three drugs) was 0.813 (0.773-0.853) and that of the RR group was 0.616 (0.569-0.669) (P = 0.0001). Univariate analysis showed that Philadelphia-chromosome (Ph1) positivity and immunophenotype of mixed lineage were also prognostic factors in the 209 patients. The prognosis of the SS/RR drug resistance profile within 14 Ph1 patients was marginally significant (P = 0.062). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that Ph1 was an overwhelmingly adverse factor in event-free survival, with a relative hazard of 5.37 (2.57-11.21, P < 0.0001), followed by RR, with a relative hazard of 2.98 (1.69-5.25, P = 0.0001). Furthermore, we clarified the characteristics of the RR group by examination of the pattern of drug resistance to other drugs in comparison with the SS group. The leukemic cells of RR patients were more resistant than those of SS patients (P < 0.0001) to all the drugs tested, with resistance ratios of 1.6 to 13.1 (mean 3.4). In conclusion, in vitro three-drug resistance at the initial stage is an important independent predictor of treatment failure for both induction response and long-term outcome in childhood ALL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present a single institutional retrospective study with long-term follow-up to better define the prognostic factors and a rationale for the use of ATRA, chemotherapy, and As2O3 in the treatment of newly diagnosed and relapsed APL patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Newly diagnosed patients with APL entering complete remission were followed up for 3 to 95 months (n = 120). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify potential prognostic factors, including age and sex; initial white blood cell (WBC) count and peak WBC level of hyperleukocytosis during induction therapy; dose of ATRA in induction; days from induction therapy to remission; postremission therapy; type of PML-RAR alpha isoform; and follow-up of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: The median relapse-free survival (RFS) was 26 months, and median overall survival (OS) was still not reached. The estimated 5-year RFS and OS were 34.0% +/- 6.0% and 52.5% +/- 7.9%, respectively. Initial WBC count (> or = 20 x 10(9)/l), peak level of WBC during induction, and type of postremission therapy were significantly related to survival. Our multivariate study showed that only peak level of WBC count during induction therapy and type of postremission therapy were associated with RFS and that initial WBC count was associated with OS. In relapsed patients, As2O3 was very effective and remained as the most important factor for their entering remission and survival after relapse. CONCLUSION: Through this retrospective study with long-term follow-up, some conclusions can be drawn: 1) Low-dose ATRA is as effective as the standard dose in terms of survival; 2) Initial and peak levels of WBC count during induction therapy are associated with survival; 3) A combination of chemotherapy and ATRA is better than chemotherapy or ATRA alone as postremission therapy; 4) Patients with the long form of PML-RAR alpha tend to have a more favorable OS but not RFS when compared with patients with the short form; 5) Persistent negative RT-PCR in remission is associated with favorable RFS and OS; 6) As2O3 is an effective agent for relapsed patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that ligation of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) on human monocytes from nonatopic individuals markedly reduces apoptosis induced by serum deprivation or by CD95/Fas ligation. Aggregation of FcepsilonRI reduces its own expression but fails to modulate CD95/Fas expression. In contrast, FcepsilonRI ligation enhances the expression of the antiapoptotic molecules Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, but not Mcl-1, in monocytes. Incubation of unstimulated cells with culture supernatants of FcepsilonRI-activated monocytes prolongs their life span, whereas CD95/Fas expression remains unaffected. The incidence of apoptosis is restored considerably when the supernatant is depleted of TNF-alpha, whereas elimination of IL-1beta, GM-CSF, or IL-12 has no effect. These results indicate that FcepsilonRI mediates signals preventing monocyte apoptosis directly by increasing the levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, and indirectly by means of TNF-alpha in an autocrine and paracrine fashion. This process may contribute to the establishment of chronic allergic disorders such as atopic dermatitis.",,PMC377424,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas previous studies have used various iron chelators to examine the relationship between cellular iron metabolism and ribonucleotide reductase activity in cells, they have not elucidated the relationship between iron transport into cells and the expression of the gene for ribonucleotide reductase. To investigate this, we examined ribonucleotide reductase mRNA, protein and enzyme activity in a novel line of CCRF-CEM cells (DFe-T cells) that display an approx. 60% decrease in their uptake of iron compared with the parental wild-type cell line. We found that DFe-T cells displayed an approx. 40% decrease in ribonucleotide reductase specific enzyme activity relative to wild-type cells without a change in their proliferation. Kinetic analysis of CDP reductase activity revealed an approx. 60% decrease in V(max) in DFe-T cells without a change in K(m). Despite the decrease in enzyme activity, the mRNA and protein for the R1 and R2 subunits of ribonucleotide reductase in DFe-T cells were similar to those of wild-type cells. ESR spectroscopy studies revealed that DFe-T cells had a 22% decrease in the tyrosyl free radical of the R2 subunit, suggesting that a larger amount of R2 protein was present as functionally inactive apo-R2 in these cells. Our studies indicate that ribonucleotide reductase activity in CCRF-CEM cells can be down-regulated by more than 50% in response to down-regulated iron transport without an adverse effect on cell proliferation. Furthermore, our studies suggest a regulatory link between ribonucleotide reductase activity and iron transport into these cells.",,PMC1220804,,,,,['R01CA68028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The elderly are generally less able to tolerate the intensive chemotherapy required to achieve a sustained remission, and there is an increased incidence of resistant disease in this age group. Granulocyte- and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors have been demonstrated to shorten the duration of severe neutropenia following chemotherapy for solid tumours and after bone marrow/peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, and the effect of these growth factors in the treatment of AML has been investigated in a number of trials using 2 distinct strategies. Growth factors may be administered following chemotherapy in an attempt to accelerate neutrophil recovery, and they may be given before and during chemotherapy with the aim to increase the number of leukaemic blast cells in cell cycle and enhance their responsiveness to chemotherapy. Both of these approaches have proved safe despite initial theoretical concerns regarding the expression of receptors for these growth factors on leukaemic cells. The results of trials using these growth factors in the treatment of AML in the elderly generally show a significant reduction in the duration of neutropenia following induction chemotherapy. However, consistent benefits with respect to morbidity and early mortality together with improvements in long term disease outcome have not been observed. The 'priming' approach using growth factors before and during induction chemotherapy has proved equally disappointing in failing to improve response rates or survival. The routine use of these growth factors in the treatment of AML in the elderly population as a whole would, therefore, not seem to be cost effective.",,,,49,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcl-2 protein is believed to be involved in imparting resistance to programmed cell death or apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents and radiation. The anti-apoptotic function of the Bcl-2 protein appears to be modulated by its ability to heterodimerize with other members of the gene family, predominantly Bax, a protein favouring induction of apoptosis. Susceptibility to undergoing apoptosis may, therefore, be dependent on the ratio between Bcl-2 and Bax. Both Bax and Bcl-2 are regulated by the tumour-suppressor protein p53. The present study therefore aims to study the significance of the Bcl-2:Bax ratio, p53 expression and apoptosis in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). METHODS: Expression of Bax, Bcl-2 and p53 was determined by immunocytochemistry, and apoptosis was evaluated by an enzymatic end-labelling technique using biotin-dUTP and further confirmed by annexin binding. The presence of mutant p53 was determined using a mutant-p53-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: A total of 32 cases and 20 controls were evaluated. Bcl-2 was found to be expressed in 22/32 of the ALL cases. Pretreatment (spontaneous) apoptosis was observed in 23/32 cases. The mean pretreatment apoptotic index was 11.34 +/- 2.04% with a median value of 7.5%. CONCLUSIONS: There was a positive correlation between apoptosis and Bax expression (r = 0.5044; P = 0.0038). There was good correlation between the immunoreactivity of p53 and detection of mutant p53 by ELISA (r = 0.4605; P = 0.0079). The apoptosis index showed a negative borderline correlation to the expression of Bcl-2 protein (r = -0.3181; P = 0.076). There was an inverse correlation between extent of apoptosis and the presence of mutant p53 protein (r = -0.4732; P = 0.006). p53 protein expression also showed a correlation with both Bcl-2 (r = 0.4647; P = 0.007) and Bax (r = 0.4128; P = 0.018). The Bcl-2/Bax ratio, however, showed no significant correlation with apoptosis (r = -0.3131; P = 0.08) or with p53 expression. No significant association was evident between clinical and laboratory parameters with the Bcl-2/Bax protein expression except lymphadenopathy (r = 0.5774; P = 0.03). However, Bax expression showed a borderline correlation with the immediate tumour response to chemotherapy (r = -0.338; P = 0.0628). These patients are being followed-up to look for any association between clinical outcome, Bcl-2/Bax ratio and apoptosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since clinical response can be accompanied by extramedullary manifestations, we have investigated the influence of RA on cell adhesion to and migration through reconstituted basement membranes (Matrigel) in the APL cell line NB4. No apparent cellular differentiation was observed during a 24-h incubation with 1 microM RA, as indicated by the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test. However, exposure to RA significantly enhanced NB4 cell adhesion to Matrigel and consecutive migration through Matrigel barriers in a dose-dependent manner. Several integrin molecules potentially involved in this process, i.e., CD29, CD18, CD11a, CD11b and CD11c, were therefore studied by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. The expression of the beta subunit of the beta2 integrins (CD18), but not that of beta1 integrins (CD29), was increased during 24-h RA treatment. Among the beta2 integrins, the expression of LFA-1 (CD11a) and of Mac-1 (CD11b), but not of p150,95 (CD11c), was induced by RA. When monoclonal antibodies that specifically block the interaction of these integrins with their ligands were used, we observed that CD29 is only involved in adhesion and CD11b only in migration, whereas CD11a participates in both processes. NB4 cells constitutively secreted the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-9 and MMP-2, which are known to promote cellular invasion processes by degradation of the extracellular matrix. RA treatment had no influence on the quantity of secreted MMP-9 or MMP-2 in these cells as determined by zymography. Addition of Batimastat (BB-94), a synthetic inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases, blocked RA-induced cell migration without affecting cellular adhesion to Matrigel. These findings indicate that adhesion molecules as well as matrix metalloproteinases are involved in RA-stimulated migration of NB4 cells through Matrigel, possibly providing some explanation of tissue infiltration by leukemic cells as observed during treatment of APL patients with RA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, they also identified some transplant difficulties, such as failure to collect sufficient numbers of stem cells, slow kinetics of engraftment, and a high transplant-related mortality that diminished or negated positive impact on overall survival. Data for ABMT are inconclusive in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in adults. We retrospectively analyzed patients with acute leukemia autografted with marrow purged with mafosfamide after January 1983 in our institution. The population comprised 229 consecutive patients; 165 with AML [123 in first remission (CR1), 32 in second remission (CR2)]; 61 with ALL (46 in CR1, 4 in CR2); and 3 with undifferentiated acute leukemia. All patients were autografted with marrow purged with mafosfamide. Mafosfamide was given at a constant dose of 50 microg/mL in 103 and adjusted individually to produce a CFU-GM LD 95 (5% residual CFU-GM post purging) in 126. The outcome was analyzed for correlation with patient characteristics, the disease including cytogenetics, and the graft itself. Prognostic factors identified by multivariate analysis were used to derive a prognostic classification. Patients receiving higher doses of marrow submitted to purging (>5.46 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg) experienced a lower treatment-related mortality (RR = 0.11, p = 0.005) and a higher leukemia-free (RR = 0.5, p = 0.005) and overall survival (RR = 0.4, p = 0.001). Patients receiving <0.004% CFU-GM of marrow actually infused post purging had a lower relapse rate (RR = 0.51, p = 0.003).

Patients receiving a stem cell dose evaluated before purging of >5.46 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg and doses actually infused post purging of < or =0.02 x 10(4)/kg had a treatment-related mortality of only 2+/-2%, a leukemia-free survival of 70%, and an overall survival of 77+/-7% at 10 years.

However, in some cases leukemic blasts can harbor gene lesions on a submicroscopic level without evidence of a corresponding abnormality by conventional cytogenetic studies. This can result in failure to recognize chromosomal abnormalities and inappropriate evaluation with respect to therapy assignments. To study the discrepancy in the detection of deletions of the short arm of chromosome 9 and deletions of tumor suppressor genes p15/p16/p14 on chromosome 9p21, we analyzed bone marrow samples from 92 patients with ALL both by cytogenetic analysis and by Southern blot. In 41 patients (45%), we found deletions of p15/p16/p14, which were homozygous in 27 and hemizygous in 14. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated abnormalities of the short arm of chromosome 9 in the form of 9p- or del(9p21-22) in only 5 of the 41 patients (12%). Only 2 of 51 patients without gene deletions as detected by Southern blot revealed a 9p- abnormality, which was found only in a subpopulation of the cells. We demonstrate that deletions of the p15/p16/p14 genes on chromosome 9p21 are more frequent than indicated by cytogenetic analysis.

GVL effects can also be induced by donor lymphocyte infusion following alloBMT. We have investigated the role of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the development of GVL in mice with B-cell leukemia/lymphoma (BCL1) following allogeneic cell therapy. Sublethally irradiated (C57BL/6 x BALB/c)F1 mice were intravenously inoculated with 10(5) BCL1 cells and given untreated or recombinant human Interleukin-2 (rIL-2)-activated C57BL/6 spleen cells. Effective elimination of clonogenic BCL1 cells was confirmed by adoptive transfer of spleen cells obtained from treated mice into secondary BALB/c recipients. GVL effects were maintained after inactivation of CD4+ cells with monoclonal anti-CD4 antibodies in the inoculum, while inactivation of CD8+ cells with monoclonal anti-CD8 antibodies resulted in complete loss of GVL effects induced both by resting and rIL-2-activated allogeneic spleen lymphocytes. These results indicate that Thy-1 cells play the major role in the induction of GVL effects, mediated by C57BL/6 effector T cells in this model. Since the number of natural killer (NK) cells also increased during in vitro culture with rIL-2, their contribution, especially that of CD8+ NK cells, in GVL effects mediated by rIL-2-activated CD8+ cells cannot be ruled out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eradication of BCL1 was confirmed in vivo by adoptive transfer of 10(5) spleen cells obtained from treated mice into syngeneic BALB/c recipients. Immunotherapy induced by allogeneic but not syngeneic spleen and lymph node lymphocytes was therapeutically more effective than thymocytes and bone marrow cells (BMC). Alloreactive cells could be further activated in vivo with recombinant human interleukin-2 (rIL-2). The GVL effect of allogeneic lymphocytes was cell-dose-dependent; a heavy leukemia load was more efficiently eradicated after three doses than after a single dose of allogeneic spleen cells (100% versus 23% disease-free survival rate of secondary adoptive recipients respectively). The GVL effect induced by allogeneic spleen cells was preserved after ex vivo exposure of cells to 250 cGy, but not 500 cGy or more. Interestingly, GVL was preserved following administration of ex vivo irradiated (500 cGy) spleen cells when rIL-2 was administered in vivo (p < 0.05). Syngeneic effector cells did not induce GVL, regardless of in vitro and in vivo activation with rIL-2. Our data suggest that allogeneic but not syngeneic (in analogy to autologous) cell therapy may be an effective tool to control residual leukemia following high-dose chemo-radiotherapy. The feasibility of augmenting GVL by successive doses of activated allogeneic donor lymphocytes, partly inactivated in vitro by low-dose ionizing irradiation to prevent severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), may lead to safer therapeutic approaches that can be used to reduce the incidence of relapse while avoiding the risk of uncontrolled GVHD.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A standard methylcellulose colony assay was used for analysing the number of CFU-GGM and BFU-E on all of the days. In addition, high proliferative potential-colony forming cells (HPP-CFC) of the harvested PBSC from donors and day 1 PB from recipients were assayed in 5 allo-PBSCT patients. Furthermore, a proportion of CD38- cells among CD34+ cells in the harvested PBSC and day 1 PB was evaluated by two-color flow cytometric analysis in 5 allo-PBSCT patients. The number of CFU-GM on day 1 ranged from 7 to 119 per 10 ml PB after auto-PBSCT, and from 15 to 61 per 10 ml PB after allo-PBSCT. After these transient increases, PTCPC diminished rapidly. Then, PTCPC emerged again on day 7 after auto-PBSCT and on day 10 or 14 after allo-PBSCT along with neutrophil recovery. A proportion of HPP-CFC among myeloid colonies from day 1 PB of recipients was significantly higher than that from the harvested PBSC from donors (65.6 +/- 12.7% vs. 17.4 +/- 13.0%, respectively, n = 5, P = 0.0013). In addition, two-color flow cytometric analysis revealed that the proportion of CD34+CD38- cells was significantly higher in day 1 PB of recipients than in the harvested PBSC from donors (57.5 +/- 17.6% vs. 11.7 +/- 4.9%, n = 5, P = 0.005).

A phase I-II clinical study was performed to assess the safety and efficacy of this partial T cell depletion method for the prevention of acute graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) in 10 leukemia patients at high risk for GVHD (defined as 1) unrelated transplant from MLC-positive or HLA-DRB1 mismatched donor or 2) related transplant from serologically HLA-A, -B, or -DR one-locus mismatched donor). Cyclosporine (CSP) and methotrexate (MTX) were used for additional prophylaxis against GVHD in all cases. Sustained engraftment occurred in 9 of the 10 patients. Although acute GVHD developed in 6 of the 9 evaluable patients, none developed more than grade III severe acute GVHD. Five patients were alive in remission at a median follow-up of 32 months after bone marrow transplantation, and no relapse of leukemia was observed. We conclude from this pilot study that selective T cell depletion with anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody coupled with CSP and MTX posttransplant immunosuppressive therapy is safe.

Molecular characterization of these changes, in particular chromosomal translocations, has yielded a wealth of information on the mechanisms of leukemogenesis. These findings have also allowed the development of sensitive assays for the identification of underlying molecular defects, which is applicable to disease diagnosis and to monitor response to treatment. Genetic alterations in childhood leukemia are powerful prognostic indicators. TEL-AML1 fusion and hyperdiploidy >50 chromosomes are associated with a good prognosis in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, whereas BCR-ABL fusion and MLL rearrangements are associated with a poor prognosis. Hence cytogenetic and molecular genetic classification of childhood leukemia will significantly improve the ability of clinicians to predict therapeutic response and prognosis, which paves the way for risk stratification based on clinical and genetic features. Finally, deciphering of genetic lesions in leukemia has allowed elucidation of the molecular basis of current treatment, as typified by the success of all-trans retinoic treatment in acute promyelocytic leukemia, and has identified targets for novel therapeutic approaches. It is envisaged that efforts in characterization of molecular defects in childhood leukemia will ultimately be translated into better clinical outcome for patients.",,,"['Copyright 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",122,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors investigated the frequency with which splenic rupture is diagnosed in pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies and reviewed its clinical profile and outcome. METHODS: The data base of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital was searched for cases coded as splenic laceration or rupture, splenic infarction, or splenectomy in patients diagnosed with lymphoma or leukemia between January 1962 and December 1997. The medical records of patients with histopathologic or radiologic evidence of splenic rupture were reviewed. The time spanned by the study was divided into early (1962-1990) and recent (1991-1997) eras to reflect the availability of modern diagnostic imaging techniques. RESULTS: Seven children experienced splenic rupture. They were between ages 5-17 years. There were four males and three females. Primary diagnoses included acute myeloid leukemia (four patients), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (two patients), and Hodgkin lymphoma (one patient). Five patients were diagnosed in the recent era and two in the early era. Four patients had radiologic or bacteriologic evidence of fungal infection concomitant with the splenic event. Of five deaths, only two were related causally to splenic rupture; these occurred in the early era. All seven acute episodes of splenic rupture were managed conservatively without surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The overall frequency with which splenic rupture was detected in children with hematologic malignancy at the study institution was 0.18%. In the recent era, the frequency of detection was 9-fold higher (0.55%) than that of the early era (0.06%). Improved imaging techniques and increased utilization of imaging studies may account for the increased incidental detection of ""preclinical"" splenic rupture.

METHODS: The family reported herein was first described 2 decades ago. Now extensive follow-up has shown the predictable occurrence of these tumor types, in addition to an excess of brain tumors and the finding of Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) in an LFS-affected family member. RESULTS: A possible new feature of the disorder, suggestive of SWS, was identified in a patient in the direct genetic lineage. This patient had a rhabdomyosarcoma of the eyelid at age 29 months and at age 14 years was diagnosed with lymphoblastic lymphoma/acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A remarkable excess of brain tumors was identified in this family through this current update. The p53 germ-line mutation was not identified in any affected member of this family. CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first example of SWS in the context of LFS. Brain tumors appear to be an important component of the tumor spectrum of LFS, as evidenced in this family.",,,['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data regarding the rate of incidence from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program cancer registry (1973-1993) were used to compare directly second malignancy risks in 51,584 men with prostate carcinoma who received radiotherapy (3549 of whom developed second malignancies) with 70,539 men who underwent surgery without radiotherapy (5055 of whom developed second malignancies). Data were stratified by latency period, age at diagnosis, and site of the second malignancy. Directly comparing the risks in the radiotherapy group with those in the surgery group largely avoids problems associated with underreporting second malignancies. RESULTS: Radiotherapy for prostate carcinoma was associated with a small, statistically significant increase in the risk of solid tumors (6%; P = 0.02) relative to treatment with surgery. Among patients who survived for >/= 5 years, the increased relative risk reached 15%, and was 34% for patients surviving >/= 10 years. The most significant contributors to the increased risk in the irradiated group were carcinomas of the bladder, rectum, and lung, and sarcomas within the treatment field. No significant increase in rates of leukemia was noted. CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy for prostate carcinoma was associated with a statistically significant, although fairly small, enhancement in the risk of second solid tumors, particularly for long term survivors. The pattern of excess second malignancies among men treated with radiotherapy was consistent with radiobiologic principles in terms of site, dose, and latency. In absolute terms, the estimated risk of developing a radiation-associated second malignancy was 1 in 290 for all prostate carcinoma patients treated with radiotherapy, increasing to 1 in 70 for long term survivors (>/= 10 years). Improvements in radiotherapeutic techniques, along with diagnosis at younger ages and earlier stages, are resulting in longer survival times for patients with prostate carcinoma. Because of the long latency period for radiation-induced tumors, this may result in radiation-related second malignancy risk becoming a more significant issue.",,,['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],,,,['CA-530722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Between 1988-1997, DCF (4 mg/m(2)/day, every 2 weeks) was administered to 80 HCL patients in 32 Spanish institutions. In 35 of 78 evaluable patients DCF was the first-line therapy; the remaining 43 patients had received other therapies. Pretreatment variables influencing the achievement of complete remission (CR) and event free survival were identified by multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The median number of cycles administered was 7 (range, 1-22 cycles). A CR was obtained in 56 patients (72%) and a partial remission was obtained in 13 patients, for an overall response rate of 88%. In the multivariate analysis previous splenectomy and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status > or = 2 were the parameters adversely influencing CR achievement. With a median follow-up of 31.2 months (range, 0.4-126.5 months), disease recurrence was observed in 11 of the CR patients, 5 of whom showed a further response to DCF. An ECOG performance status > or = 2 was the only pretreatment variable associated with a shorter event free survival. Seven patients died, four during the treatment period. The actuarial median event free survival was 46 months (95% confidence interval, 22.5-69.5 months), and 48.7% of the 56 patients who achieved a CR were expected to be alive and disease free at 5 years. Hematologic toxicity (marked neutropenia [22 cases], anemia [6 cases], and thrombocytopenia [1 case]) was the main side effect, followed by nausea and emesis (5 cases); 14 patients required hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study confirm the effectiveness and acceptable toxicity of DCF in the treatment of patients with HCL.",,,['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether cells with this dual differentiation potential persist during postnatal life is unknown. METHODS: A cell line was derived from a patient with secondary acute leukemia. Because of its ability to grow in soft agar and in SCID mice, this cell line was analyzed for expression of differentiation antigens by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, immunocytochemistry, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with simultaneous cell surface staining, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: A new cell line was established from a patient with essential thrombocytosis that transformed into acute leukemia. The patient's initial clinical presentation included skin and lymph node infiltrations that were taken for an angiosarcoma due to positivity for CD34, CD31, and von Willebrand factor on immunohistology. In addition to hematopoietic markers, leukemic cells expressed endothelial antigens such as CD62E, CD105, and bound Ulex europaeus lectin-1. Immunocytochemistry revealed positive staining for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2 (KDR), Tie-2/Tek, the angiopoietin receptor, and vascular endothelial cadherin. These results were confirmed by PCR analysis. Simultaneous staining for CD62E and FISH analysis showed that cells with endothelial characteristics belonged to the leukemia. FISH analysis of histologic sections of the lymph node infiltration confirmed this manifestation as part of the leukemic process. The derived cell line, UKE-1, forms colonies in soft agar and is tumorigenic in SCID mice. CONCLUSIONS: This new cell line, UKE-1, appears to combine hematopoietic and endothelial features, indicating the close ontogenic relation of both lineages.",,,['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,['Cancer. 2000 Jul 1;89(1):221-3.

To investigate the role of SHP-1 in mast cells we overexpressed the wild-type and the phosphatase-inactive forms of SHP-1 in rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 (RBL-2H3) mast cell line. The phosphatase-inactive SHP-1 (C453S or D419A) retains its ability to bind tyrosine phosphorylated substrates and thereby competes with the endogenous wild-type enzyme. Overexpression of wild-type SHP-1 decreased the FcepsilonRI aggregation-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta and gamma subunits of the receptor whereas the dominant negative SHP-1 enhanced phosphorylation. There were also similar changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk. However, receptor-induced histamine release in the cells expressing either wild-type or dominant negative SHP-1 was similar to that in the parental control cells. In contrast, compared with the parental RBL-2H3 cells, FcepsilonRI-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation and the level of TNF-alpha mRNA was increased in the cells overexpressing wild-type SHP-1 whereas the dominant negative SHP-1 had the opposite effect.

It is well established, however, that T cell help can augment CTL function, raising the question of how best to present tumor-associated MHC class I epitopes to induce effective tumor immunity. To this end, we have examined the role of MHC class II peptide-complexes present on the immunizing DCs in a murine melanoma model. To present MHC class I- and II-restricted Ags reliably on the same cell, we retrovirally transduced bone marrow-derived DCs with the model Ag OVA encoding well-defined class I- and II-restricted epitopes. The importance of CD4+ T cells activated by the immunizing DCs in this model is demonstrated by the following findings: 1) transduced DCs presenting class I and class II epitopes are more efficient than class I peptide-pulsed DCs; 2) MHC class II-deficient DCs fail to induce tumor protection; 3) CD4+ T cell depletion abolishes induction of tumor protection; and 4) DCs presenting bovine serum Ags are more effective in establishing tumor immunity than DCs cultured in syngeneic serum. When MHC class II-deficient DCs were directly activated via their CD40 receptor, we indeed observed a moderate elevation of OVA-specific CTL activity. However, this increase in CTL activity was not sufficient to induce in vivo tumor rejection. Thus, our results demonstrate the potency of genetically modified DCs that express both MHC class I and II epitopes, but caution against the use of DCs presenting only the former.",,,,,,,"['P01 CA-59530/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA-83070/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Interaction between B7 on APC and CD28 on naive T cells is necessary for priming the T cells. On the other hand, interaction between B7 on APC and CTLA-4 on activated T cells transduces a negative regulatory signal to the activated T cells. In the present study, we attempted to generate tumor-specific CTL by s.c. administration of antigenic peptides encapsulated in multilamellar liposomes (liposomal peptide vaccine) with anti-CD40 mAb and/or anti-CTLA-4 mAb. Liposomal OVA257-264 and anti-CD40 mAb or anti-CTLA-4 mAb were administrated to C57BL/6 mice and the splenocytes were cocultured with OVA257-264 for 4 days. The splenic CD8+ T cells showed a significant cytotoxicity against EL4 cells transfected with cDNA of OVA. In addition, administration of both anti-CD40 and anti-CTLA-4 mAb enhanced the CTL responses. Considerable CTL responses were induced in MHC class II deficient mice by the same procedure. This finding indicated that CTL responses could be generated even in the absence of Th cells. When BALB/c mice were immunized with pRL1a peptide that are tumor-associated Ag of RLmale symbol1 leukemia cells using the same procedure, significant CTL responses were induced and prolonged survival of the BALB/c mice was observed following RLmale symbol1 inoculation. These results demonstrate that anti-CD40 mAb and anti-CTLA-4 mAb function as immunomodulators and may be applicable to specific cancer immunotherapy with antitumor peptide vaccine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This long clinical latency period may be explained by cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage (M/M) becoming infected and acting as a reservoir for the virus, as shown for other retroviruses (human immunodeficiency virus-1, feline immunodeficiency virus). M/M cells in different stages of differentiation (HL-60, THP-1, U-937, J774, BGM, PM2, primary macrophages of sheep and cows) were cultured with BLV produced by permanently infected donor cells (FLKBLV and BLV-bat(2)). Donor cells were inhibited from multiplying by either irradiation or treatment with mitomycin C. In other experiments, supernatant from donor cells containing virus was used. In co-culture with the donor cells, the less differentiated monocytic cells showed severe cellular changes such as differentiation, vacuolization, cell lysis and membrane blebbing; apoptosis was a frequent phenomenon. Budding and extracellular viruses were also observed. The more differentiated macrophage cells, although they showed less signs of infection by microscopy, had a complete BLV protein profile, as seen by Western blotting; bands corresponding to p24CA (Gag) and its precursors were clearly seen. In addition, gp51SU was identified by syncytia formation assays.

We report here an interesting patient with small cell carcinoma (SCC) and hypotetraploidy initially referred to us because of a question of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, M3 subtype, with a question of a 15;17 translocation characteristic of acute promyelocytic leukemia. However, the patient did not have a 15;17 translocation and the final hematopathologic analysis of the bone marrow aspirates and immunohistochemistry studies subsequently revealed the patient to have SCC. Small cell carcinoma is a highly malignant and a very aggressive neoplasm. A review of the literature, using Medline, Cancerlit, and the Science Citation Index, revealed that in most, if not all, reports, the presence of polyploidy is noted as a rare entity. In leukemia, reports of polyploidy point to a distinct category of patients with a poor risk for which more intensive treatment is needed. Limited information is currently available to assess the risk of polyploidy in small cell carcinoma. Our case is important not only because of the relative rarity of polyploidy, but also because insights gained from the study of this and other similar patients may help shed additional light on the mechanism of carcinogenesis, which is not fully known to date. As polyploidization is a manifestation of genetic instability and as genetic instability has been implicated in the genesis and progression of many cancers, it is perhaps not too surprising that polyploidy in our case was associated with a poor disease outcome.

Differential display was used to identify putative early regulatory genes that are differentially expressed in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells treated with retinoic acid. One of the cDNAs cloned encodes sequences identifying Burkitt's lymphoma receptor 1 (BLR1), a recently described chemokine receptor. Northern blot analysis demonstrates that blr1 mRNA expression increases within 9 h of retinoic acid treatment, well before functional differentiation or G(1)/G(0) growth arrest at 48 h or onset of morphological changes, suggesting a possible regulatory function. The expression of blr1 mRNA is transient, peaking at 72 h when cells are differentiated. blr1 mRNA also is induced by other differentiation-inducing agents, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and DMSO. Induction of blr1 mRNA by retinoic acid is not blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. In HL-60 cells stably transfected with blr1 cDNA, ectopic expression of blr1 causes an increase in ERK2 MAPK activation and promotes retinoic acid-induced G(1)/G(0) growth arrest and cell differentiation. The early expression of blr1 mRNA during differentiation, its ability to increase ERK2 activation, and its enhancement of retinoic acid-induced differentiation suggest that blr1 expression may be involved in retinoic acid-induced HL-60 differentiation.",,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,['ESO7052/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

As such, the abnormalities of increased myeloproliferation in childhood (AIMC) should be considered under the same heading. Constitutional and other genetic factors play an essential role in children and include the NF1 gene, whereas toxic exposure is of greater importance in adults. The most common cytogenetic alteration is that of monosomy or deletion of the long arm of chromosome 7. Critical regions have been identified and mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). It appears that the similar critical regions on chromosome 7 are involved, and suggests that these regions may contain genes important in the pathogenesis of AIMC.",,,,167,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with essential thrombocythaemia (ET), and, less frequently, those with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) or polycythaemia vera (PV), present at a childbearing age. Pregnancy itself does not appear to affect adversely the natural course and prognosis of the MPD. However, fertility might be reduced, and an adverse outcome of pregnancy due to thrombotic or bleeding complications is a matter of concern. It ET, first-trimester abortion is the most frequent complication but increased perinatal mortality and premature delivery are also observed. Placental infarction due to thrombosis seems to be the most consistent event. Maternal thrombotic or haemorrhagic complications are rare but are more common than seen in normal pregnancy. The outcome of pregnancy seems to be positively influenced by aspirin, at least in some cases. The value of cytoreduction and/or heparin prophylaxis has not been established but may have a role in selected cases. In CML, the potential adverse effects of hyperleukocytosis, and sometimes thrombocytosis, generally make myelosuppressive treatment essential. In PV, the number of reported pregnancies is low. Maintaining the PCV below 0.45 is of the utmost importance relating to the outcome of pregnancy. Although cytoreductive drugs should generally be avoided, if possible, until at least after the first trimester of pregnancy, interferon-alpha seems to be the drug of choice when myelosuppression is indicated. In summary, the available information about pregnancy occurring during the course of an MPD indicates that successful management of pregnancy is possible. However, optimal management of these patients is poorly defined and agreed protocols are not available. In view of these problems, it is timely to consider the establishment of a national or European registry to monitor prospectively the management offered to pregnant women found to have an MPD.",,,,84,,,,,,,,,,,,

Histological staging of the four haematologically defined diseases is performed by grading the three most prominent variables: megakaryocytes, fibres and blasts. Histological outcome is correlated to the staging of diagnostic bone marrow biopsies; megakaryocytic involvement is correlated with the risk of myelofibrosis. An excess of blasts is related to the risk of leukaemic transformation. The progression of myelofibrosis depends on the grade of fibre increase at diagnosis. These three statements are highly significant and valid for all types of chronic myeloproliferative disorders. The results of cytogenetics are discussed in relation to the histological classification for these patient groups. Changes in bone marrow histology following myelosuppressive therapy is presented. Prospective studies under standardized protocol therapy are recommended, so that the long-term effects of therapy can be assessed.",,,,100,,,,,,,,,,,,

The salient features included a young median age (8 years) at presentation, equal sex preference, and occurrence of cytopenias and myelodysplasia in nonleukemic family members. Owing to its rarity and the fact that many cases were reported quite some time ago, detailed clinicopathologic features of familial monosomy 7 were not available. We describe a family with three siblings affected by AML in whom monosomy 7 was demonstrated. This family showed several unique features, including the late onset of AML (at 34 and 37 years of age in two siblings), and the presence of an antecedent myelodysplastic phase before leukemia development. With fluorescence in situ hybridization, the monosomy 7 clone was shown to be capable of partial maturation, which was consistent with the biologic behavior of myelodysplasia. These observations suggest that familial leukemia with monosomy 7 is probably a multistep leukemogenic process in which monosomy 7 might be but one of the critical steps. Finally, the prognosis in these cases was poor, suggesting that more aggressive therapy may be needed to improve treatment outcome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the novelty and potential role of bryostatin 1, a macrocyclic lactone isolated from the marine bryozoan, Bugula neritina, in inducing the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of the oncoprotein Bcl-2. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analyses revealed that Bcl-2 is ubiquitinated following exposure of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line Reh to 1 nM bryostatin 1. Bcl-2 protein rapidly decreases to 50% of that recorded in the control after 24 h of bryostatin 1 treatment. In the subsequent 24 h, Bcl-2 protein again rapidly decreases to 6% of its pre-bryostatin 1 level at which time a plateau is reached and maintained for another 72 h. Furthermore, ubiquitin-Bcl-2 conjugates are detected in untreated as well as bryostatin 1 treated cells, indicating that ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis plays a role in the normal turnover of Bcl-2. However, ubiquitin-Bcl-2 conjugates increase in a time-dependent manner following bryostatin 1 treatment. Lactacystin, which inhibits the proteinase activities of the proteasome, inhibited the bryostatin 1-induced decrease of Bcl-2 protein. The effect of bryostatin 1 on the proteolytic efficiency of the 26S proteasome in Reh cell extracts was also investigated and shown to increase following 1 h of bryostatin 1 treatment. Proteolytic activity reached its highest point by 3 h, and subsequently returned to control levels by 12 h, post-bryostatin 1 treatment. In addition, bryostatin 1 treatment of the Reh cell line decreased expression of bcl-2 mRNA within 3 h. However, bcl-2 mRNA expression returned after 24 h. We speculate that this decrease in mRNA together with increased 26S proteolytic activity accounts for the initial rapid decrease recorded in Bcl-2 protein. These findings indicate that bryostatin 1 treatment of Reh ALL cells decreases Bcl-2 expression through two processes: a) enhanced Bcl-2 protein degradation through the activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and b) decreased bcl-2 mRNA expression.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, none of the 29 patients with primary MDS nor the seven with disease progression in this study exhibited MSI.

Radiation exposure caused prolonged ( approximately 1 h) MAPK activations in U937 cells. In contrast, low dose irradiation weakly modulated JNK1 activity in these cells. Inhibition of the MAPK pathway by use of the specific MEK1/2 inhibitor (10 microM PD98059) in both U937/pREP4 and U937/TAM67 cells prior to radiation exposure permitted strong prolonged radiation-induced activations of JNK1. Expression of TAM67 decreased the ability of radiation to cause apoptosis compared to control transfected cells. However, combined MEK1/2 inhibition and radiation exposure in both cell types caused a large decrease in suspension culture growth and a large increase in apoptosis, when compared to either treatment alone. Reduced proliferation after combined irradiation and PD98059 treatment in both cell types correlated with prolonged cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. Prolonged growth arrest was abolished when MEK1/2 inhibitor was removed 6 h following irradiation, which was associated with a reduction in apoptosis. The ability of MEK1/2 inhibition to cause prolonged G2/M growth arrest was reduced in U937 cells stably transfected with a p21Cip-1/WAF1 antisense construct (U937/p21AS). This data correlated with an enhancement of radiation-induced apoptosis and a reduced ability of MEK1/2 inhibition to potentiate apoptosis. Collectively our data demonstrate that inhibition of MEK1/2 function increases the radiation sensitivity of U937 cells, independently of c-Jun function, and decreases the ability of these cells to recover from the radiation-induced G2/M cell cycle checkpoint arrest. In addition, our data also demonstrate that the ability of MEK1/2 inhibition to potentiate radiation-induced cell death in U937 cells in part requires an ability of cells to express low levels of p21Cip-1/WAF1.",,,,,,,"['P01-CA72955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA77141/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

It is also characteristic of monohistiocytes, particularly alveolar macrophages, and is associated with diverse pathological conditions, including hairy cell leukemia and AIDS encephalopathy. To study the biology of this enzyme, we investigated its expression and activity in mouse tissues. Confocal fluorescence studies showed that TRAP is localized to the lysosomal compartment of macrophages. In adult mice, high activities of the enzyme were demonstrated in bone, spleen, liver, thymus, and colon, with lower amounts in lung, stomach, skin, brain, and kidney. Trace amounts were detected in testis, muscle, and heart. Expression of TRAP mRNA was investigated in tissue sections by in situ hybridization and protein expression was monitored by histochemical staining or immunohistochemically. TRAP is widely expressed in many tissues, where it is associated with cells principally originating from the bone marrow, including those of osteoclast/macrophage lineage. The cellular distribution of TRAP mRNA and enzyme antigen in the tissues corresponds closely to that of cells staining with an antibody directed to the CD80 (B7) antigen. Therefore, to confirm its putative localization in dendritic cells, isolated bone marrow dendritic cells were matured in culture. These co-stained strongly for TRAP protein and the CD80 antigen. These studies demonstrate that TRAP is a lysosomal enzyme that is found in diverse murine tissues, where it is expressed in dendritic cells as well as osteoclasts and macrophages, as previously shown.

Pluripotent cells were differentiated in vitro as aggregates (embryoid bodies) and the appearance and abundance of cell lineages were assessed by morphology and gene expression. Differentiation in EPL cell embryoid bodies recapitulated normal developmental progression in vivo, but was advanced in comparison to ES cell embryoid bodies, with the rapid establishment of late primitive ectoderm specific gene expression, and subsequent loss of pluripotent cell markers. Nascent mesoderm was formed earlier and more extensively in EPL cell embryoid bodies, and resulted in the appearance of terminally differentiated mesodermal cell types prior to and at higher levels than in ES cell embryoid bodies. Nascent mesoderm in EPL cell embryoid bodies was not specified but could be programmed to alternative fates by the addition of exogenous factors. EPL cells remained competent to form primitive endoderm even though this is not the normal fate of primitive ectoderm in vivo. The establishment of primitive ectoderm-like gene expression and inability to participate in embryogenesis following blastocyst injection is therefore not directly associated with restriction in the ability to form extra-embryonic lineages. However, the EPL cell embryoid body environment did not support differentiation of primitive endoderm to visceral endoderm, indicating the lack of an inductive signal for visceral endoderm formation deduced to originate from the pluripotent cells. Similarly, the inability of EPL cells to form neurons when differentiated as embryoid bodies was attributable to perturbation of the differentiation environment and loss of inductive signals rather than a restricted differentiation potential. Reversion of EPL cells to ES cells was accompanied by restoration of ES cell-like differentiation potential. These results demonstrate the ability of pluripotent cells to adopt developmentally distinct, stable cell states with altered differentiation potentials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The average GI(50) value (the molar drug concentration required for 50% growth inhibition) of 2b was 0.3 microM. Against three breast cancer cell lines, 2b had a GI(50) value of <10 nM. Methylation, reduction of the double bond of the C(3)-side chain, reduction of the methoxycarbonyl functionalities to primary alcohols, or oxidation of the dihydrobenzofuran ring to a benzofuran system resulted in a decrease or loss of cytotoxic activity. Compound 2b inhibited mitosis at micromolar concentrations in cell culture through a relatively weak interaction at the colchicine binding site of tubulin. In vitro it inhibited tubulin polymerization by 50% at a concentration of 13 +/- 1 microM. The 2R, 3R-enantiomer of 2b was twice as active as the racemic mixture, while the 2S,3S-enantiomer had minimal activity as an inhibitor of tubulin polymerization.

Tight-seal whole-cell patch clamp experiments were performed to examine the ability of different intracellular Ca2+ mobilising agents to activate the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current (ICRAC) in rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL-1) cells under conditions of weak cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffering. 2. Dialysis with a maximal concentration of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) routinely failed to activate macroscopic ICRAC in low buffer (0.mM EGTA, BAPTA or dimethyl BAPTA), whereas it activated the current to its maximal extent in high buffer (10 mM EGTA). Dialysis with a poorly metabolisable analogue of IP3, with ionomycin, or with IP3 and ionomycin all failed to generate macroscopic ICRAC in low Ca2+ buffering conditions. 3. Dialysis with the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pump blocker thapsigargin was able to activate ICRAC even in the presence of low cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffering, albeit at a slow rate. Exposure to IP3 together with the SERCA blockers thapsigargin, thapsigargicin or cyclopiazonic acid rapidly activated ICRAC in low buffer. 4. Following activation of ICRAC by intracellular dialysis with IP3 and thapsigargin in low buffer, the current was very selective for Ca2+ (apparent KD of 1 mM) Sr2+ and Ba2+ were less effective charge carriers and Na+ was not conducted to any appreciable extent. The ionic selectivity of ICRAC was very similar in low or high intracellular Ca2+ buffer. 5. Fast Ca2+-dependent inactivation of ICRAC occurred at a similar rate and to a similar extent in low or high Ca2+ buffer. Ca2+-dependent inactivation is not the reason why macroscopic ICRAC cannot be seen under conditions of low cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffering. 6. ICRAC could be activated by combining IP3 with thapsigargin, even in the presence of 100 microM Ca2+ and the absence of any exogenous Ca2+ chelator, where ATP and glutamate represented the only Ca2+ buffers in the pipette solution. 7. Our results suggest that a threshold exists within the IP3-sensitive Ca2+ store, below which intraluminal Ca2+ needs to fall before ICRAC activates. Possible models to explain the results are discussed.",,PMC2269755,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to investigate the potential usefulness of these molecules as prognostic markers in B-CLL. DESIGN AND METHODS: Therefore, TN, cICAM-1, and IL-10 were assessed (ELISA) in the serum of 53 B-CLL patients, classified in Binet A, B, and C stages in comparison with those in 45 healthy subjects (HS). RESULTS: TN was significantly lower in B-CLL patients than in HS (9.63 [8.75-11.51] mg/L, 13.75 [12.56-14.64] ng/mL, respectively, p<10(-5)), being lower (p = 0.05) in B and C stage patients (subgroup B+C) than in A stage ones (subgroup A). cICAM-1 levels were significantly higher in B-CLL patients than in HS (475.86 [355.86-593.79] ng/mL vs. 225.62 [118.49-312.83] ng/mL, respectively, p<10(-5)) with a tendency for higher levels in subgroup B+C than in subgroup A. A significant correlation of cICAM-1 with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (r(s) = 0.532, p = 0.049), and a significant increase in cICAM-1 in B-CLL with diffuse bone marrow infiltration (BMI) compared to that in B-CLL with nondiffuse BMI (624.48 [557.24-726.55] ng/mL vs. 480.34 [368.96-590.34] ng/mL, respectively, p = 0.0172) were found. A significant negative correlation between TN and cICAM-1 (r = -0.5017, p = 0.0001) was observed. IL-10 was detected in all B-CLL patients and in no HS (7.37 [5.30-10.55] pg/mL), being higher (p = 0.0153) in C than in A stage patients. A significant correlation of IL-10 with TN and cICAM-1 in subgroup B+C (r(s) = -0.659 [p = 0.014] and r = 0.679 [p = 0.011], respectively) was found. CONCLUSIONS: The abovementioned findings and good performance characteristics of TN and cICAM-1 in B-CLL suggest the potential usefulness of these adhesive/recognition molecules as prognostic markers in B-CLL.

Only 28 observations have been reported so far, all with a very poor prognosis: a median survival of 12.5 weeks. The authors report the case of a 78-year-old male with primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the right adrenal gland. Disease onset was characterized by severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and diagnosis was made by echo-guided biopsy. The patient was admitted to our Department with severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia; the hemoglobin value was 6.5 g/dL and both indirect and direct Coombs' tests were positive. Steroid treatment with methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day did not improve the hemolytic process. Abdominal ultrasound examination disclosed a right hypoechogenic suprarenal mass of 10 x 9 cm; imaging techniques such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were not useful in the etiologic diagnosis of the right suprarenal mass; fine needle aspiration and tissue-core biopsy revealed low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Staging procedures, including clinical examination, total body computed tomography scan, bone-marrow biopsy, gallium scan, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging, did not disclose other sites of involvement and strongly supported a diagnosis of primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the right adrenal gland. Hormone assays were within normal limits. The patient was treated with chemotherapy, cyclophosphamide-vincristine-prednisone regimen, with good regression of the adrenal mass after 6 courses, and normalization of hemoglobin level and negativity of Coombs' tests. The importance of this case lies in the very rare occurrence of this disease, its association with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, the diagnosis made by ultrasound-guided biopsy, and good response to treatment with respect to cases reported in the literature. The patient remains in clinical remission 12 months after onset of the disease.",,,,35,,,,,,,,,,,,

This infection may give rise to a broad spectrum of disorders including T-cell leucemia/lymphoma, the myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis complex (M/TSP), and to a lesser extent, uveitis, arthritis, polymyositis and peripheral neuropathy. M/TSP is a progressive, chronic myelopathy characterized by spasticity, hypereflexia, muscle weakness and sphincter disorders. Much less frequently it may precede, or give rise to, a cerebellar syndrome with ataxia and intention tremor. CLINICAL CASE: We describe the case of a 13 year old adolescent girl who presented with a neurological syndrome which had started with tremor of the head and limbs, ataxia, dysmetria, frequent falls and sphincter disorders. During the two and a half years that she had had this illness she had developed spastic paraparesis of the legs and had repeated urinary infections. Serology of blood and CSF was positive for HTLV-I using the ELISA technique and confirmed by Western-blot. EMG showed predominantly axonal sensomotor neuropathy. A neurogenic bladder was detected on functional urodynamic studies. On MR there was moderate atrophy of the thoracic spinal cord and slight alterations of the subcortical white matter. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a cerebellar syndrome or neuropathy of uncertain origin, in endemic areas, should lead to the inclusion of HTLV-I infection in the differential diagnosis, even in the absence of pyramidal symptoms or defined M/TSP. Maternal seropositivity supports the hypothesis of mother-daughter transmission during lactation.","Sindrome cerebelar y neuropatia periferica como manifestacion de la infeccion por el virus linfotropico humano de celulas T, HTLV-I.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this series, we will learn of animal models used to investigate diseases caused by a wide variety of pathogens, including HIV, Vibrio cholerae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A description of a model system specifically designed to study intracellular pathogens will be presented, as will a variety of the techniques currently used to exploit other useful models of infection.

E2a-Pbx1 is an oncogenic derrivative of Pbx1 produced by the t(1;19) translocation in pediatric pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. E2a-Pbx1 heterodimerizes with Hox but not with Meis/Prep1 proteins, produces acute myeloid leukemia in mice, and blocks differentiation of cultured murine myeloid progenitors. Here, we characterize negative and positive regulatory sequences that flank the Pbx1 HD and determine their importance for myeloid immortalization by E2a-Pbx1. A 25 residue predicted alpha helix preceding the Pbx1 HD bound the HD and prevented both its binding to DNA and its ability to heterodimerize with Hox proteins. Addition of 39 residues N-terminal to this inhibitory helix exposed a Pbx dimerization interface that orchestrated cooperative DNA-binding of E2a-Pbx1 and all Pbx proteins as homodimers and heterdimers. Sequences inhibiting DNA-binding and mediating Pbx dimerization coincided with those reported to have nuclear export function. An additional 103 residues N-terminal to the Pbx dimerization interface restored heterodimerization with Hox and Meis1/Prep1 proteins. This negative switch domain - comprised of the inhibitory helix and N-terminal regions required for its partner-mediated derepression - was dispensable for myeloid immortalization by E2a-Pbx1. While stabilizing the heterodimer, the 310 helix C-terminal to the Pbx1 HD was also dispensable for the ability of E2a-Pbx1 to heterodimerize with Hox proteins and immortalize myeloblasts. Retention of myeloid immortalization by E2a-Pbx1 proteins lacking all Pbx1 sequences N- or C-terminal to the HD indicates that Hox proteins, or a yet undefined factor that binds the Pbx1 HD and derepresses DNA-binding by the HD, cooperate with E2a-Pbx1 in myeloid immortalization.",,,,,,,['CA56876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The Bloom syndrome gene BLM encodes a RecQ DNA helicase, whose absence from the cell results in genomic instability epitomized by high levels of sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) and cancer predisposition. We show here that BLM co-localizes with PML to the NB. In cells from persons with Bloom syndrome the localization of PML is unperturbed, whereas in APL cells carrying the PML-RARalpha oncoprotein, both PML and BLM are delocalized from the NB into microspeckled nuclear regions. Treatment with retinoic acid (RA) induces the relocalization of both proteins to the NB. In primary PML-/- cells, BLM fails to accumulate in the NB. Strikingly, in PML-/- cells the frequency of SCEs is increased relative to PML+/+ cells. These data demonstrate that BLM is a constituent of the NB and that PML is required for its accumulation in these nuclear domains and for the normal function of BLM. Thus, our findings suggest a role for BLM in APL pathogenesis and implicate the PML NB in the maintenance of genomic stability.",,,,,,,"['CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA71692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We introduce a novel method to analyze XCI pattern, named HUMARA methylation-specific PCR (HUMARA-MSP) assay, which analyzes methylation status of the HUMARA gene by bisulfite modification instead of a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme. Although the original MSP method shows whether there is a methylated band or not, our HUMARA-MSP method identifies the patterns of methylated and unmethylated bands. Because this method identifies either unmethylated or methylated alleles in each PCR tube and shows opposite band patterns dependent on methylation status, we can assess the XCI pattern independently twice. This method can avoid false results by incomplete enzyme digestion and incomplete bisulfite modification will not affect the results. Extremely small quantities of samples, such as hematopoietic colonies, were also available for HUMARA-MSP assay. Because DNA modified by sodium bisulfite is also available for assessment of methylation status of other genes by setting specific primers for them, we performed the simultaneous assessment of clonality and aberrant hypermethylation of p15INK4B gene in myelodysplastic syndromes. These simultaneous assessments were easily possible and provided much information despite requiring only a small volume of DNA. The HUMARA-MSP assay may facilitate the analyses for pathogenesis of hematological disorders because of its simplicity, sensitivity and wide applicability.

The inactivation of p53 tumor suppressor function can be caused by chromosome deletion, gene deletion, or mainly by point mutations. p53 mutations occur moderately often in hematopoietic malignancies. A significantly higher frequency of p53 alterations in cell lines vs primary samples has been observed for all types of malignant hematopoietic cell lines. It has been postulated that p53 gene abnormalities arise in cell lines during in vitro establishment of the culture or prolonged culture; but it is also conceivable that those cases that carry p53 mutations may be more suitable for in vitro establishment as permanent cell lines. We analyzed data on the p53 gene status in a panel of matched primary hematopoietic tumor cells and the respective cell lines derived from this original material. In 85% (53/62) of the pairs of matched primary cells and cell lines, the in vivo and in vitro data were identical (both with p53 wild-type or both with the same p53 mutation). In some instances, serial clinical samples (eg at presentation and relapse) and serial sister cell lines were available. These cases showed that a clinical sample at presentation often had a p53 wild-type configuration whereas the derived cell line and a relapse specimen carried an identical p53 point mutation. These findings suggest that a minor clone, at first undetectable by standard analysis, represents a reservoir for the outgrowth of resistant cells in vivo and also a pool of cells with a growth advantage in vitro, providing a significantly higher chance of immortalization in culture. This was further supported by studies employing mutant allele-specific gene amplifications, a technique which is significantly more sensitive (100- to 1000-fold) than the commonly applied SSCP assay with a sensitivity threshold of about 10% mutated cells within a pool of wild-type cells. Taken together, this analysis confirms the usefulness of human hematopoietic cell lines as in vitro model systems for the study of the biology of hematopoietic malignancies. It further underlines the notion that p53 gene alterations confer a survival advantage to, at least some, malignant cells in vitro and presumably also in vivo; however, it is highly unlikely that a p53 mutation alone would suffice for the immortalization of a cell line in vitro or tumor development in vivo.

We report here that these mAb induce gp130-mediated signaling in human myeloma cells and support the survival and the long-term growth of five IL-6-dependent human myeloma cell lines. Their agonist activity is not affected by neutralizing antibodies to IL-6 or IL-6R. These mAb induce a transient proliferation of primary myeloma cells from most patients with multiple myeloma. Again, IL-6 inhibitors do not affect this agonist activity. By using highly purified primary myeloma cells, we found that these anti-gp130 mAb supported the long-term survival of primary myeloma cells from five patients with primary plasma cell leukemia but failed to induce their long-term growth. For patients with fulminant disease and secondary extramedullary proliferation, the antibodies supported a long-term survival and growth, and anti-gp130 mAb-dependent cell lines were obtained.

Homozygous deletions have been rarely found in multiple myeloma (MM) and no point mutations have been reported. Two recent studies have reported a high prevalence of methylation in the exon E1alpha of the p16 gene, but included only a small number of cases. We have analyzed the methylation pattern of exon E1alpha of the p16 gene in 101 untreated MM and five primary plasma cell leukemias (PCL). A PCR assay, relying on the inability of some restriction enzymes to digest methylated sequences, was used to analyze the methylation status. Southern blot analysis was used to confirm these results. Forty-one of 101 MM patients (40.5%) as well as four of the five (80%) primary PCL patients had shown methylation of the exon E1alpha.

Lymph node biopsy of patient 1 was initially diagnosed as diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL, T cell rich variant), but at relapse showed immunoblastic features with a marked decrease of admixed lymphocyte components. Patient 2 presented with thickened parietal pleura which revealed a CD30-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma showing null cell phenotype and genotype with abundant admixed neutrophils and lymphocytes. At the time of lymphoma diagnosis, the patients had CML for 33 and 10 months, respectively. DNA obtained from bone marrow cells at the time of lymphoma diagnosis showed BCR/ABL gene rearrangements by both Southern blot analysis and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), but lacked both immunoglobulin and T cell receptor gene rearrangements. BCR gene rearrangement and BCR/ABL fusion gene were also identified in lymph node and pleural biopsies by Southern blot and RT-PCR analysis, respectively. However, both biopsy specimens also contained reactive lymphocytes and neutrophils, and no fusion signals between BCR and ABL genes were identified in the hyperdiploid lymphoma cells of either case by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). These data suggest the lymphoma cells in both cases were not genetically associated with BCR/ABL. Therefore, these cases were not diagnosed as an extramedullary localized blast crisis in CML, but as Ph(-) NHLs. This represents the first definitive demonstration of peripheral B cell lymphoma occurring by a separate genetic pathway, lacking BCR/ABL, in patients with Ph(+) CML. A review of the literature identified two different subtypes of malignant lymphomas arising in patients with an antecedent or concurrent diagnosis of CML. The most common are T cell lymphomas displaying an immature thymic phenotype, while peripheral B cell lymphomas are more rare. Our study shows, however, that 'Ph(+) NHL' occurring in CML or acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) may represent an unrelated neoplasm, even if standard cytogenetic analysis reveals a Ph(+) chromosome, and that FISH is required to confirm whether a localized lymphoid neoplasm is either a true extramedullary localized blast crisis or genetically distinct neoplasm.

The t(15;17), inv/del(16), 11q23 aberrations and 5/7/8 abnormalities were seen at similar frequencies. Immunophenotypically, Japanese M4/M5 more frequently displayed CD13 and CD14 than Australian, whereas the stem cell markers, CD34 and HLA-DR were observed at a relatively higher rate in Australian M3 than in Japanese M3. The B cell antigen, CD19 was more frequently seen in Japanese M2 than in Australian M2, but found more often in Australian M5 than in Japanese M5. In both populations, a close relationship was observed between the expression of CD19 and t(8;21). These findings suggest different biological characteristics of AML between the two populations, the main differences being generated by a higher frequency of t(8;21) chromosomal abnormality in Japanese AML.

In this study, we show that endothelial cells (EC) produce large amounts of soluble FL and express a membrane-bound form of the molecule. Bone marrow microvascular EC also produce FL, suggesting that EC are an important source of FL in the bone marrow. High concentrations of FL in EC supernatants contrast with its undetectable levels in long-term bone marrow cultures. A single mRNA for FL is detected, suggesting that soluble FL derives from the membrane-bound species by proteolytic release. FL mRNA is stable with a half-life of about 3 h. II-1alpha increases FL mRNA levels and membrane and soluble FL expression. Glucocorticoids, known inhibitors for many hematopoietic growth factors do not down-regulate the expression of FL. On the contrary, GC increase the expression of both species of FL. The neutralization of FL in cocultures EC/ hematopoietic progenitors results in an acceleration of the maturation of the progenitors. IFN-alpha, MIP-1 alpha and TGF-beta stimulate production of membrane-bound and soluble FL. This stimulation is essential to explain their modulatory effect on the generation of clonogenic cells in cocultures EC/hematopoietic progenitors. Leukemia (2000) 14, 153-162.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the marked preclinical efficacy of MGI 114 against a variety of solid tumor xenografts, the current phase II human trials are restricted to solid tumor (breast, lung, colon, ovarian, pancreas, prostate, etc) malignancies. The present studies were undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of MGI 114 in the HL60/MRI myeloid leukemia xenograft. In addition, because of the reported synergistic cytotoxic activity between MGI 114 and the topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan towards pediatric human tumor cell lines, we tested the activity of MGI 114 and topotecan combinations against HL60 cells in vitro and the HL60/MRI myelocytic xenograft. Our results indicate that MGI 114 at maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of 7 mg/kg, five times per week for 3 weeks does display anti-myeloid leukemic properties in the HL60/MRI xenograft model which exceeds activity noted with other conventional agents (TGI > 70%). A marked therapeutic synergistic action was observed with MGI 114 and topotecan combinations of (1/2) MTD of each agent producing complete tumor remission in 50% of animals, without development of excessive or additive toxicity in animals. These results support further in vitro and clinical investigation into both the anti-myeloid leukemic activity of MGI-114, and the cooperative pharmacologic interaction noted between MGI-114 and topoisomerase I inhibitors.

We focused our attention on minimally differentiated acute myeloid leukemia (AML-M0), an aggressive hematological malignancy in which severe prognosis suggests the requirement for innovative therapeutic strategies. Here we demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, a CD40-triggered IL-8, RANTES and IL-12 secretion by leukemic cells. Supernatants from CD40-stimulated leukemia cells had chemoattractant effects on T-lymphocytes, natural killer cells and monocytes. Moreover, these supernatants, when complemented with low-dose IL-2, induced significant lymphokine-activated and natural killer cytotoxicity, leading to leukemia lysis both in allogenic HLA-matched and autologous settings. Stimulation of leukemia cells via CD40 could participate significantly to the anti-leukemia immune response by contributing to the development of an inflammatory response and to in situ cytotoxicity.

Six had myeloid leukemia (AML-M0, AML-M1, AML-M4 and AML-M5) and three had T cell lymphoblastic leukemia. We identified four different CALM/AF10 fusion products in five patients and AF10/CALM reciprocal message in one. We conclude that fusion of CALM and AF10 is a recurring abnormality in both lymphoid and myeloid leukemias of various types including AML-M5, and that the breakpoints in the two types of leukemia do not differ. Our data indicate that the CALM/AF10 fusion product on the der(10) chromosome is critical to leukemogenesis. Leukemia (2000) 14, 100-104.",,,,,,,['CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

In all six patients the breakpoint in CALM is at the 3' end of the coding region (nt1926/1927 or nt 2091/2092). Three breakpoints could be identified in AF10 (nt 588/589, nt 882/883 and nt 978/979).

It was demonstrated through genetic analysis that interaction between the viral transactivator EBNA2 and RBP-Jkappa is essential for EBV immortalization of primary B lymphocytes. We have shown that the association of RBP-Jkappa with intracellular NOTCH1 differs significantly in B and T cells. Immunoprecipitation analyses with antibodies to both the intracellular forms of NOTCH1 and to RBP-Jkappa demonstrated that little or no RBP-Jkappa is associated with NOTCH1 in B cell lines compared to the RBP-Jkappa associated with NOTCH1 in T cell lines and was further demonstrated in human primary lymphocytes. Additionally, EBNA2 can compete with intracellular NOTCH1 for binding to GST-RBP-Jkappa in vitro. Northern blot for the cellular gene hairy enhancer of split (HES1) demonstrated that HES1 is upregulated in the EBV transformed lymphoblastoid cells expressing high levels of EBNA2 and in a T cell line SupT1 overexpressing intracellular activated NOTCH1. Hence, EBNA2 may be able to compete for the available pool of RBP-Jkappa more effectively in human B cells than in T cells and provides a possible explanation for the ability of EBV to potently and efficiently infect and immortalize human B cells.

The difference in response to ATRA therapy between acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients with PML-RARalpha fusion and PLZF-RARalpha fusion has recently been found to be partially due to the strong association of the transcriptional co-repressor, SMRT/N-CoR, with PLZF domain. We demonstrate that SMRT association, as with PML-RARalpha, can be released from NPM-RARalpha at pharmacological concentration of ATRA (10-6 M). Moreover, we show for the first time that the interaction between the transcriptional co-activator, RIP-140, and PML-, PLZF- or NPM-RARalpha fusion proteins can be positively stimulated by ATRA although they are less sensitive as compared with the wild-type RARalpha. Our results suggest that the dissociation of transcriptional co-repressors, SMRT/N-CoR, and recruitment of co-activators, eg RIP-140, to APL-associated fusion proteins constitute a common molecular mechanism in APL and underlie the responsiveness of the disease to RA therapy.

In the present study, we evaluated the incidence of MDM2 overexpression by ALL cells from pediatric patients at first relapse and compared MDM2 protein levels with in vitro response to adriamycin and with duration of initial complete remission (CR1). Since an important role of MDM2 in enhancing cell proliferation and survival appears to be inhibition of p53 activity, we also evaluated the status of p53 in these patients' leukemic cells. MDM2 protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis of leukemic bone marrow cells obtained from 42 patients with B cell precursor (BCP) ALL who relapsed during or following therapy on standard POG ALL protocols. Twelve of 42 (29%) cases have MDM2 levels >/=10-fold higher than those detected in normal bone marrow mononuclear (NMMC) cells, which express relatively low levels of protein. Thirty cases (71%) expressed MDM2 at levels <10-fold those in NMMC, including 24 MDM2-negative cases (57%). P53 mutations were detected by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis in two cases. Overexpression of MDM2 (>/=10-fold) was significantly correlated with adriamycin resistance and decreased duration of CR1. Eight of 12 (75%) overexpressers showed high levels of in vitro resistance to adriamycin, compared to four of 30 (13%) non-overexpressers (P < 0.005). The median CR1 for MDM2 overexpressers was 20.5 months (range: 3-75 months) compared to 41 months (range: 8-98 months) for non-overexpressers (P < 0.01). Four of 42 patients failed to achieve CR following re-induction: leukemic cells from three of these patients either overexpressed MDM2 or contained a mutant p53. These results indicate that overexpression of MDM2 plays a significant role in refractory pediatric ALL and is associated with early relapse, adriamycin resistance, and failure to respond to re-induction therapy.

Suspensions of 2-CdA-loaded cells were diluted 10-fold with 2-CdA-free medium to initiate the cellular 2-CdA decay processes, which followed a biexponential time course. When diluting media contained NBMPR or DPM, intracellular levels of 2-CdA and its metabolites were substantially increased (P < 0.001) compared with cells in media lacking the transport inhibitors, and 2-CdA loss followed a monoexponential time course. As a consequence, the AUCs (area under time-course plots of intracellular 2-CdA and its metabolites) were significantly (P < 0.001) lower in untreated control cells compared to inhibitor-treated cells. These results suggest that nucleoside transport processes contribute to the efflux of 2-CdA from the cultured lymphoblasts. The cytotoxicity of 1-h exposure to 2-CdA of Reh-A2 and CCRF-CEM cells was enhanced three-fold by subsequent exposure to 0.5 microM NBMPR relative to that of control cells subjected to the same manipulations without NBMPR exposure.

A cell-free system, three human leukemia cell lines (CEM/CCRF, HL-60, U937) and 15 bone marrow samples from children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were studied. VCR cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assay and by quantitative measurement of apoptosis. In vitro levels of VCR in cell-free systems were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and intracellular HOCl levels by oxidation of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid with the accompanying decrease in the absorbency at 412 nm. VCR was degraded by increasing concentrations of HOCl in cell-free systems and this activity was inhibited by taurine, which is known to block HOCl activity. This finding was confirmed by the VCR cytotoxicity studies on cell lines. The HOCl-producing myeloblasts from patients were resistant to VCR. In five samples out of eight HOCl was also detected extracellularly. These results suggest that oxidation by HOCl may be the final step in VCR degradation catalyzed by MPO through its action on intracellular H2O2 and Cl.

The reasons for the dysregulation of these two key cellular events in B-CLL are unclear. The present study aimed at determining correlations between the expression levels of proteins regulating apoptosis, cell cycle and DNA repair in B-CLL cells and normal B cells. In addition, the differential sensitivity of B-CLL cells to drug-induced apoptosis was quantified. We show that in B-CLL cells levels of the death-suppressor Bcl-2 correlated positively with those of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and of the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor p27Kip1. In B-CLL cells levels of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL showed a positive correlation with levels of the 80 kDa regulatory component (Ku80) of the DNA-dependent protein kinase that is involved in DNA double-stranded break repair. These correlations were not detected in normal B cells. The sensitivity of leukemic cells to FLUD but not to ADM, CPM or to DEX was reduced in pre-treated patients. These data support the hypothesis that in B-CLL cells death-modulators and molecules modulating cell cycle and DNA repair are regulated in a coordinated manner.

These mature, leukemic B cells often produce autoantibodies. Under normal circumstances, immunologically committed lymphocytes that are autoreactive are deleted by a programmed cell death mechanism. In CLL cells, these mechanisms appear to be inhibited; therefore, cells accumulate rather than be destroyed. To understand the mechanism by which cell survival is selected over death in CLL cells, we studied the role of beta2 integrins and their ligands in the regulation of apoptosis. CLL cells were treated with monoclonal antibodies directed against beta2 integrins. Antibodies directed against the I-domain of the alpha chain of CD11b/CD18 inhibited apoptosis. The identity of the physiological ligand or counter-receptor for beta2 integrins that was required for the inhibition of apoptosis induction was sought. The ligand iC3b, but not ICAM-1 or fibrinogen, was identified as a ligand that could prevent apoptosis of CLL B cells. Free iC3b levels were elevated in CLL patients indicating that this ligand is available in vivowhere it may interact with beta2 integrins on CLL B cells and sustain their viability by preventing activation of the programmed cell death pathway.

Hence, we examined whether cellular levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 in acute myeloid leukemia could be used to predict clinical outcome in AML. Using immunoblot analysis, levels of p27 were assessed in blast cells from 72 AML patients who were registered and treated by the identical chemotherapy protocol. AML cases were classified into three groups on the basis of the percentage of the expression level of p27 compared to a control cell line. AML cases exhibiting p27 expression at low, moderate, and high levels were 43, 9, and 20 cases, respectively. No significant differences in the rates of complete remission (CR) were observed among the three groups. Although the level of p27 expression was not correlated with any other possible prognostic markers, such as age, white blood cell count, chromosome abnormalities, and FAB subclasses, patients with high p27 expression had a significantly increased disease-free survival (DFS) (78% vs 19%, P = 0.004). We further examined the expression of cyclin E at the protein level in all 72 AML cases. We observed a statistically significant correlation between a high cyclin E level and a high p27 level (P < 0.005). However, we failed to find any correlation between the rates of CR or DFS and cyclin E expression. The present study reveals that levels of p27 expression can be one of the useful prognostic molecular markers for AML. Leukemia (2000) 14, 28-33.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used alpha-IFN to treat 10 adult P190BCR-ABL+ ALL patients (eight newly diagnosed; two in first relapse). All received a remission induction chemotherapy (modified L-20 protocol). Patients achieving morphological, immunological and cytogenetic complete remission (CR) were then submitted to a rotational consolidation regimen lasting 6 months. When no HLA-identical donor was available, patients aged <55 years underwent stem cell harvest followed by autologous transplantation; patients aged >/=55 years received standard maintenance treatment for 6 months. In the second year, maintenance treatment (all ages) was based on cycles of alpha-IFN (3 MU three times a week for 6 weeks) alternated with methotrexate/6-mercaptopurine continuously for up to 2 years from first demonstration of CR. Thereafter, patients maintaining CR had the same schedule of alpha-IFN (6 weeks on, 6 off). Eight patients (6/8 first diagnosis, 2/2 relapsed) obtained morphological, immunological and cytogenetic CR with persistent molecular positivity. Two with an HLA-identical donor had allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Six proceeded with chemotherapy: one experienced early relapse, three were autotransplanted, and two received maintenance. Five patients then received alpha-IFN as scheduled. All five are in continuous morphological and cytogenetic CR, with a longer mean duration of maintained morphological CR (mean 46 months; range: 20-88) than in previous reports of Ph+ ALL patients treated with chemotherapy regimens (excluding allogeneic BMT). alpha-IFN thus appears effective in this poor-risk subset of patients. This well-tolerated IFN-containing maintenance treatment could be considered to reinforce intensified programs based on autologous stem cell transplantation as an alternative to allogeneic transplantation in P190BCR-ABL+ ALL patients (and by extension for Ph+ ALL patients) lacking an HLA-matched donor.

Only relatively recently have the roles of serine/threonine kinases in cytokine-induced signal transduction and anti-apoptotic pathways been examined. Cytokine receptors without intrinsic kinase activity such as interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and the interferons were thought to transmit their regulatory signals primarily by the receptor-associated Jak family of tyrosine kinases. This family of tyrosine kinases activates STAT transcription factors, which subsequently transduced their signals into the nucleus to modulate gene expression. Cytokine receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity such as c-Kit were initially thought to transduce their signals independently of serine/threonine kinase cascades. Recently, both of these types of receptor signaling pathways have been shown to interact with serine/threonine kinase pathways as maximal activation of these tyrosine kinase regulated cascades involve serine/threonine phosphorylation modulated by, for example MAP kinases. A common intermediate pathway initiating from cytokine receptors is the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK (MAPK) cascade, which can result in the phosphorylation and activation of additional downstream kinases and transcription factors such as p90Rsk, CREB, Elk and Egr-1. Serine/threonine phosphorylation is also involved in the regulation of the apoptosis-controlling Bcl-2 protein, as certain phosphorylation events induced by cytokines such as IL-3 are anti-apoptotic, whereas other phosphorylation events triggered by chemotherapeutic drugs such as Paclitaxel are associated with cell death. Serine/threonine phosphorylation is implicated in the etiology of certain human cancers as constitutive serine phosphorylation of STATs 1 and 3 is observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and can be inhibited by the chemotherapeutic drug fludarabine. Serine/threonine phosphorylation also plays a role in the etiology of immunodeficiencies. Activated STAT5 proteins are detected in reduced levels in lymphocytes recovered from HIV-infected individuals and immunocompromised mice. Serine/threonine phosphorylation may be an important target of certain chemotherapeutic drugs which recognize the activated proteins. This meeting report and mini-review will discuss the interactions of serine/threonine kinases with signal transduction and apoptotic molecules and how some of these pathways can be controlled by chemotherapeutic drugs.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied a cohort of 3, 182 children diagnosed with acute leukemia before the age of 17 years who received allogeneic BMT between 1964 and 1992 at 235 centers. Observed second cancers were compared with expected cancers in an age- and sex-matched general population. Risks factors were evaluated using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Twenty-five solid tumors and 20 posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) were observed compared with 1.0 case expected (P <.001). Cumulative risk of solid cancers increased sharply to 11.0% (95% confidence interval, 2.3% to 19.8%) at 15 years and was highest among children at ages younger than 5 years at transplantation. Thyroid and brain cancers (n = 14) accounted for most of the strong age trend; many of these patients received cranial irradiation before BMT. Multivariate analyses showed increased solid tumor risks associated with high-dose total-body irradiation (relative risk [RR] = 3.1) and younger age at transplantation (RR = 3.7), whereas chronic graft-versus-host disease was associated with a decreased risk (RR = 0.2). Risk factors for PTLD included chronic graft-versus-host disease (RR = 6.5), unrelated or HLA-disparate related donor (RR = 7. 5), T-cell-depleted graft (RR = 4.8), and antithymocyte globulin therapy (RR = 3.1).

Busulfan is often used as an alternative to TBI, but there are few data regarding its relative efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared outcomes of HLA-identical sibling transplants for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children (< 20 years of age) who received cyclophosphamide plus TBI (CY/TBI) (n = 451) versus those who received busulfan plus cyclophosphamide (Bu/CY) (n = 176) for pretransplant conditioning. Patients received transplants between 1988 and 1995 and their results were reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry by 144 participating institutions. The CY/TBI and Bu/CY groups did not differ in gender, immune phenotype, leukocyte count at the time of diagnosis, chromosome abnormalities, remission status, or length of initial remission. T-cell depletion was used more frequently in the CY/TBI group; the Bu/CY group included a higher proportion of children who were less than 5 years of age. The median follow-up period was 37 months. RESULTS: The 3-year probabilities of survival were 55% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50% to 60%) with TBI/CY and 40% (95% CI, 32% to 48%) with Bu/CY (univariate P =.003). The 3-year probabilities of leukemia-free survival were 50% (95% CI, 45% to 55%) and 35% (95% CI, 28% to 43%), respectively (univariate P =.005). In a multivariate analysis, the risks of relapse were similar in the two groups (relative risk [RR], 1.30 for Bu/CY v CY/TBI; P =.1). Treatment-related mortality was higher in the Bu/CY group (RR, 1.68; P =.012). Death and treatment failure (relapse or death, inverse of leukemia-free survival) were more frequent in the Bu/CY group (RR, 1. 39; P =.017 for death; RR, 1.42; P =.006 for treatment failure). CONCLUSION: These data indicate superior survival with CY/TBI conditioning, compared with Bu/CY conditioning, for HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplants in children with ALL.",,,,,,,"['P01-CA-40053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-76518/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

A multicenter phase II study was conducted to assess the toxicity and the overall response rates (RR) and complete response (CR) rates to rituximab (chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1997 and January 1998, 131 patients with newly diagnosed MCL (MCL1; n = 34) and previously treated MCL (MCL2; n = 40), IMC (n = 28), and SLL (n = 29) received rituximab 375 mg/m(2)/wk for 4 weeks via intravenous infusion. Restaging studies were performed 1 and 2 months after treatment. An analysis of the duration of response was conducted in December 1998. RESULTS: Eleven patients were unassessable, including one who died of splenic rupture after the first infusion. The RR among the 120 assessable patients was 30% (36 of 120 patients). The RR by histology was as follows: MCL1, 38%; MCL2, 37%; IMC, 28%; and SLL, 14%. Ten patients, all with MCL, achieved CR. The median duration of response in MCL was 1.2 years. Immediate side effects were common and usually responded to adjustments in the infusion rate. There were 31 episodes of infection after treatment; most cases were mild. Cardiac arrhythmia and ophthalmologic side effects occurred in 10 and nine patients, respectively, including one case of severe loss of visual acuity. CONCLUSION: Single-agent rituximab has moderate activity in MCL and IMC but only limited activity in SLL. The duration of response in MCL was similar to that previously reported in follicular lymphoma. Its use in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy to increase the CR rate is warranted in MCL and IMC.",,,,,,['J Clin Oncol 2000 May;18(9):2006'],,,,,,,,,,

Using our recently devised in vitro decay assay, we demonstrate that the alpha-complex also functions by protecting the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) from an erythroid-enriched, sequence-specific endoribonuclease activity. The cleavage site was mapped to a region protected by the alpha-complex and is regulated by the presence of the alpha-complex. Similar endoribonuclease cleavage products were also detected in erythroid cells expressing an exogenous alpha-globin gene. Nucleotide substitution of the target sequence renders the RNA refractory to the endoribonuclease activity. Insertion of the target sequence onto a heterologous RNA confers sequence-specific cleavage on the chimeric RNA, demonstrating the sequence specificity of this activity. We conclude that the alpha-complex stabilizes the alpha-globin mRNA in erythroid cells by a multifaceted approach, one aspect of which is to protect the 3'-UTR from specific endoribonuclease cleavage.",,PMC305563,,,,,"['R01 DK051611/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK51611/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The increasing total accumulated dose over the years might be expected to cause increased frequency of radiation-induced cancer. The rate should increase with number of flight hours per year, number of years of flying, and higher flight altitude. If the cumulative radiation exposure during flights is of concern, we would expect an increased cancer risk to be present among those crew members flying jets. METHODS: Cockpit-crew medical records (pilots and flight engineers) from 1946 onwards, holding information on the individual, flight hours, aircraft type, and date of commercial certification and decertification, were linked to the population-based Danish Cancer Registry, the central population registry, and the National Death Index. FINDINGS: Altogether 3877 cockpit crew members could be traced for follow-up, accruing 61095 person-years at risk in 3790 men and 661 in 87 women. The total number of cancers observed was 169 whereas 153.1 were expected (standardised incidence ratio 1.1 [95% CI 0.94-1.28]). Significantly increased risks of acute myeloid leukaemia (5.1 [1.03-14.91]), skin cancer, excluding melanoma (3.0 [2.12-4.23]), and total cancer (1.2 [1.00-1.53]) were observed among Danish male jet cockpit crew members flying more than 5000 h. Increased risk of malignant melanoma irrespective of aircraft type was also found among those flying more than 5000 h. INTERPRETATION: Both malignant melanoma and skin cancer were found in excess in cockpit crew members with a long flying history, probably attributable to sun exposure during leisure time at holiday destinations. We cannot confirm previously reported increased risk of brain and rectal cancers in pilots. The study shows that male cockpit crew members in jets flying more than 5000 h have significantly increased frequency of acute myeloid leukaemia.",,,,,,,,['Lancet. 2007 Feb 3;369(9559):367.

The HPRT gene detects a wide variety of mutation types, many of which are similar at the molecular level to those found in oncogenes in cancers. However, it remains to be determined whether the assay for mutations in T lymphocytes is reflective of mutagenic events in tissues or cells which have high frequencies of malignancy in humans. We now demonstrate that the HPRT gene can be utilized to detect mutations in myeloid stem cells, which are frequent progenitor cells of leukemias. This myeloid stem cell assay shows an age related increase in mutation at HPRT and also detects increases in mutant frequency (M-MF) in patients who have undergone chemotherapy. The myeloid mutants are confirmed to have mutations in the HPRT gene by DNA sequence analysis. Increases in M-MF are seen as expected in the clonally unstable myeloid stem cells of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes; however, unexpectedly these patients also have elevated T-lymphocyte mutant frequencies (T-MF). A good correlation is shown between M-MFs and T-MFs in the same patients. Thus, it appears that the T-lymphocyte assay, which is technically much less demanding than the myeloid assay, appears to faithfully represent the frequency of mutagenic events in the myeloid lineage.",,,,,,,['P30CA22435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Mutat Res. 1999 Dec 17;431(2):vii-xii.

In this communication, we report MC540-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) was effective in purging leukemic cells expressing P-gp. When K562 and K562/ADM were exposed to MC540 (15 micrograms/ml) and white light (145.8 kJ/m2), the concentration of K562 and K 562/ADR was reduced by 1.8 and 3.0 log, respectively. Using flow cytometry and confocal laser scan microscopy, MC540 and calcein-AM were bound intracellularly and effluxed by P-gp in K562/ADM. In K562/ADM, calcein-AM efflux was inhibited by P-gp modulator, cyclosporin A (5 microM) and verapamil (15 micrograms/ml). In contrast, MC540 efflux was inhibited by cyclosporin A but not verapamil. Furthermore, MC540-mediated PDT inhibited efflux of calcein-AM and MC540, and induced the accumulation of dyes in K562/ADM. We conclude that MC540 is a substrate of P-gp and that MC540-mediated PDT is useful for purging MDR cells through inhibition of P-gp activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its role in nonmacrophage cell lines remains unknown. To test the hypothesis that SR-A activity leads to proatherogenic changes in nonmacrophage cell lines, we generated Moloney murine leukemia virus- and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein-pseudotyped retroviruses containing SR-A type II cDNA, which were used for stable transfection of SR-A activity into mouse fibroblasts and rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs). beta-Galactosidase-transfected cell lines were used as controls. Transfected cell lines expressed functional SR-A mRNA and protein. Expression of SR-A activity was stable for at least 9 months. By electron microscopy, transfected receptors were located in coated pits and in intracellular structures resembling endocytotic vesicles. Expression of SR-A on the cell surface was verified by flow cytometry and by uptake and degradation of (125)I-labeled acetylated low density lipoprotein (LDL). Increases of 5- to 25-fold and of 6- to 8-fold in the rate of acetylated LDL degradation were observed in transfected fibroblasts and SMCs, respectively, compared with beta-galactosidase-transfected control cell lines. Incubation of the transfected SMCs and fibroblasts with acetylated or oxidized LDL led to foam cell formation. Incubation with oxidized LDL also led to increased apoptosis and cell death. An altered morphology with increased cell size and granularity was observed in the most active SR-A SMC clones. It is concluded that stable overexpression of SR-A leads to foam cell formation and other proatherogenic changes in nonmacrophage cell lines. Stable SMC and fibroblast cell lines can be used as models for foam cell formation. The results also suggest that increased SR activity may play an important role in SMC-related pathology in atherosclerotic arteries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The following algorithm appears generally applicable, although individual variations must necessarily be anticipated. It appears that there is an initial transforming event which in all dysplasias except that affecting the marrow has been found to be infectious. Increased cellular proliferation-increased apoptosis, telomere shortening, appearance of telomerase expression and clonal expansion follow the initial insult. Abnormalities in the cytokine environment are universally described and it is likely that the quintessential monoclonality aspect of dysplasia predisposes to accumulation of genetic mutations, and microsatellite instability leading to the appearance of evolved sub-clones. The conversion of a dysplastic phenotype to a malignant one reflects the success of one such sub-clone in developing a survival advantage over a large population of prematurely apoptotic neighbors. This state is usually acquired by silencing tumor suppressor genes through hypermethylation or actual loss or dysfunction. Thus, excessive apoptosis of cells resulting from a persistent infectious process predisposes the organ towards developing a cancerous phenotype. Evidence for the shared pathology is presented at length with the hope that these parallels between dysplastic states will be helpful in both biologic and therapeutic research.",,,,116,,,['P01 CA 75606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Since mutational activation of RAS occurs at high frequency in human leukaemia, we have investigated the contribution of signalling from mutant RAF in mediating the transforming effects of the N-RAS oncogene in the growth factor-dependent cell line, FDC-P1. Independent activation of N-RAS extended the period of exponential growth leading to an increased saturating density under optimal growth conditions. Under conditions of growth factor withdrawal, cells expressing mutant RAS, but not control cells, demonstrated protection against apoptotic death. Although RAF promoted cell proliferation in a similar manner to that observed in FDCP-RAS cells, expression of mutant RAF was not as effective at protecting these cells against apoptotic death following growth factor withdrawal. The results suggest that RAS utilises RAF-dependent signals in promoting the proliferation of FDC-P1 cells but the anti-apoptotic effects of this oncogene are mediated through a RAF- and BCL-2-independent pathway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In hematological malignancies, deletion of p16/p15 locus has been shown to be highly specific to lymphoid malignancies, and more particularly to T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). However, in the other subsets of ALL, deletions of p16 and p15 are relatively rare events. To investigate whether these genes are inactivated by methylation of the 5' CpG islands, we examined 35 leukemia cell lines and 29 childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients by Southern blot, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot analyses. We found methylation of p16 in 12 (50%) of 24 ALL cell lines, 5 (50%) of 10 AML cell lines without homozygous deletion of p16, and 11 (38%) of 29 AML patients. Those leukemia cell lines subjected to p16 methylation were found to have lost p16 protein expression. The p15 gene was methylated in 10 (34%) of 29 ALL cell lines, 6 (60%) of 10 AML cell lines without homozygous deletion of p15, and 15 (52%) of 29 AML patients. These results revealed the frequent methylation of p16 and p15 genes in B-ALL and AML despite a low frequency of p16 and p15 deletions and mutations in these leukemias. In the study for expression of RB protein, we found no expression of RB in 4 of 16 leukemia cell lines. Inactivation of the p16 gene was found in all the cell lines with expression of RB. Neither amplification nor rearrangement of cyclin D1 gene was found in any cell lines. These results suggest that inactivation of p16 and p15 genes is one of the most common genetic events in acute leukemia, and plays an important role for the RB/p16 pathway in the pathogenesis of acute leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells from 21 patients were incubated in 0.2 microM daunorubicin for 1 h or in 1 microM ATRA or 9-cis-RA continuously and in the combinations of DNR with both retinoids. Cell toxicity and apoptosis were analyzed after 96 h. Both ATRA and 9-cis-RA reduced the viability significantly to 86 and 84%, respectively (P = 0.003 for ATRA and 0.02 for 9-cis-RA). The expression of CD34 correlated to a higher sensitivity to ATRA (P = 0.003). When retinoids were added to DNR the mean decrease in viability was 11 percentage points with ATRA (P = 0.003) and nine percentage points with 9-cis-RA (P = 0.02). Apoptosis was induced by both retinoids and the percentage of apoptotic cells was increased from 16% in the controls to 24% with ATRA (P = 0.03) and to 26% with 9-cis-RA (P = 0.04). When the retinoids were added to DNR the apoptotic rate increased from 41% with DNR alone to 51% with ATRA (P = 0.01) and to 49% with 9-cis-RA (P = 0.03).

Monocytoid leukemia cells were more sensitive to the analogs than were erythroid or myeloid leukemia cells based on the inhibition of cell growth and induction of cell differentiation. Monocytoid leukemia cells were highly sensitive to combined treatment with 2'-deoxycoformycin (dCF) and 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine (Ara A) for inducing cell differentiation. Ara A induced the differentiation of monocytoid leukemia U937 and THP-1 cells at concentrations which were 1/1000-10000 of that at which it induced the differentiation of other cell lines in the presence of dCF. In combination with a low concentration of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3), the induction of the monocytic differentiation was greater in monoblastic U937 cells. Adenosine deaminase-resistant analogs such as fludarabine (FLU) and cladribine (CdA) also induced the differentiation of human myelomonocytic leukemia cells, and these analogs synergistically enhanced the differentiation induced by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or VD3. CdA was the most potent analog for inducing the differentiation of myeloid leukemia NB4 and HL-60 cells in the presence or absence of ATRA. These findings indicate that dCF + Ara A and CdA may be effective for the therapy of acute monocytoid and myeloid leukemia, respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, when using native AML blasts as stimulator cells during ex vivo generation of leukemia-reactive T cells, one has to ensure that the T cell population is not contaminated with proliferating AML blasts. Our results demonstrate that gamma-irradiation could be used to stop AML blast proliferation for all patients investigated. However, gamma-irradiation also caused a dose-dependent reduction in the constitutive AML blast secretion of the potentially T cell stimulatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). At the same time, gamma-irradiation resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in anti-CD3-stimulated proliferative responses of T cell clones in the presence of AML blast accessory cells. When using 50 Gy irradiation, however, AML blast expansion was avoided, and anti-CD3 and PHA-stimulated T cell proliferation was detected in the presence of accessory AML blasts for most AML/T cell combinations investigated. When AML blasts were cultured with GM-CSF + IL-4 to develop a dendritic cell phenotype, enhanced T cell proliferation in the presence of in vitro precultured AML blasts was observed for most patients even after 50 Gy irradiation. We conclude that when using native AML blasts as accessory cells during in vitro generation of leukemia-reactive T cells, an irradiation dose of 50 Gy can be used for a majority of AML patients to avoid the risk of leukemia cell expansion during culture and with the maintenance of AML blast accessory cell function. However, when in vitro expanded cells are used in clinical trials, this antiproliferative effect should be documented with appropriate in vitro testing for every patient so that the possibility of decreased sensitivity to gamma-irradiation in exceptional patients is excluded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene-modified lymphocytes have been used successfully to treat adenosine deaminase (ADA)-deficient patients and to control GvHD after allogeneic BMT. Because activation and proliferation of T cells are necessary for efficient retrovirus-mediated gene transfer and subsequent selection of transduced cells, mononuclear cells (MNC) from steady-state and G-CSF-stimulated peripheral blood were activated by short exposure to the mitogen PHA, the anti-CD3 antibody OKT3, or both in the presence of different concentrations of recombinant IL-2. Using OKT3 (10 or 30 ng/ml) and IL-2 (100 U/ml), T cells expanded efficiently during a 14-day culture period. Cell expansion was similar under serum-free conditions. The immunophenotypic profile over time showed a marked increase in CD8+ cells, leading to a reversed CD4/CD8 ratio of 1:2 and a slight increase in CD56+ cells. Supernatant-based centrifugal transduction of primary human T lymphocytes was compared with supernatant transduction on the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin. Transduction with cell-free retrovirus-containing supernatant in tissue culture flasks coated with human plasma fibronectin led to significantly higher transduction efficiencies (20% +/- 7.5%) than centrifugal transduction in uncoated culture flasks (13.6% +/- 5.1%)(p = 0.041). To both rapidly characterize transduced cells and isolate these from residual nontransduced but biologically equivalent cells, an amphotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV)-based retroviral vector containing the intracytoplasmically truncated human low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (deltaLNGFR) cDNA as a marker gene was used. FACS sorting of T cells after transduction resulted in >90% LNGFR+ cells and was much faster than enrichment of transduced cells through growth in G418-selection medium. These results show that supernatant-based retroviral gene transfer into primary human T lymphocytes can be enhanced by fibronectin. Ectopic expression of a cell surface protein can be used to rapidly and conveniently quantitate transduction efficiency through FACS analysis and to efficiently enrich transduced cells through FACS sorting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, all mutant alleles in the Kenyan population were TPMT*3C compared with 4.8% in Caucasians. In contrast TPMT*3A was the most common mutant allele in the Caucasian individuals.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-four patients underwent total body irradiation prior to bone marrow transplantation in the last 15 years. A special cobalt unit has been used, the dose rate was 6 to 8 cGy/min in the midline of the abdomen. The source-midline distance (SMD) was 340 cm and the field size was 80 x 200 cm. The dose calculation was done on the basis of a tissue-phantom ratio curve measured in total body irradiation conditions and effective tissue thickness (ETT). Between 1984 and 1992 the beam direction was horizontal, the patients laid in lateral position. In 11 cases the total dose to the abdominal midline was 10 Gy in 1 fraction. From 1986 the fractionation changed to 4 x 3 Gy in 4 days. Within individual lung shielding the average lung dose was 8.5 Gy. In 44/124 cases the order of conditioning treatment was chemo-radiotherapy. Since 1992 vertical beams were used, and the patients (80/124) laid in prone/supine position. The fractionation remained the same but radio-chemotherapy regime has been used. RESULTS: The irradiation in prone position proved to be safer than lateral because of smaller patient motion and it resulted in a more accurate positioning of lung shielding too.

The classification includes lymphoid, myeloid, histiocytic and mast cell neoplasms. DESIGN: The WHO project involves 10 committees of pathologists, who have developed lists and definitions of disease entities. A Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) of international haematologists and oncologists was formed to ensure that the classification will be useful to clinicians. A meeting was held in November 1997 to discuss clinical issues related to the classification. RESULTS: The WHO has adopted the 'Revised European-American Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms' (REAL), published in 1994 by the International Lymphoma Study Group (ILSG), as the classification of lymphoid neoplasms. This approach to classification is based on the principle that a classification is a list of 'real' disease entities, which are defined by a combination of morphology, immunophenotype, genetic features and clinical features. The relative importance of each of these features varies among diseases, and there is no one 'gold standard'. The WHO classification has applied the principles of the REAL classification to myeloid and histiocytic neoplasms. The classification of myeloid neoplasms recognizes distinct entities defined by a combination of morphology and cytogenetic abnormalities. The CAC meeting, which was organized around a series of clinical questions, was able to reach a consensus on most of the questions posed. The questions and the consensus are discussed in detail below. Among other things, the CAC concluded that clinical groupings of lymphoid neoplasms was neither necessary nor desirable. Patient treatment is determined by the specific type of lymphoma, with the addition of grade within the tumour type, if applicable, and clinical prognostic factors such as the international prognostic index (IPI). CONCLUSION: The experience of developing the WHO classification has produced a new and exciting degree of cooperation and communication between oncologists and pathologists from around the world, which should facilitate progress in the understanding and treatment of haematological malignancies.",,,,,,,,['Histopathology. 2000 Sep;37(3):282-3.

In an attempt to avoid the cardiotoxicity and drug resistance of doxorubicin therapy, several analogues were synthesized. The cyanomorpholinyl derivative is the most cytotoxic. They differ greatly from their parent compound in their biological and pharmacological properties, inducing cross-links in drug DNA complexes. The present study concerns N-cyanomethyl-N-(2-methoxyethyl)-daunomycin (CMDa), a synthetic analogue of cyanomorpholino-daunomycin. Compared to doxorubicin, CMDa displays a cytotoxic activity on L1210 leukemia cells at higher concentration but is effective on doxorubicin resistant cells. The results of fluorescence quenching experiments as well as the melting temperature (DeltaTm = 7.5 degrees C) studies are consistent with a drug molecule which intercalates between the DNA base pairs and stabilizes the DNA double helix. The crystal structure of CMDa complexed to the hexanucleotide d(CGATCG) has been determined at 1.5 A resolution. The complex crystallizes in the space group P41212 and is similar to other anthracycline-hexanucleotide complexes. In the crystal state, the observed densities indicate the formation of N-hydroxymethyl-N-(2-methoxyethyl)-daunomycin (HMDa) with the release of the cyano moiety without DNA alkylation. The formation of this degradation compound is discussed in relation with other drug modifications when binding to DNA. Comparison with two other drug-DNA crystal structures suggests a correlation between a slight change in DNA conformation and the nature of the amino sugar substituents at the N3' position located in the minor groove.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OB and BMSC were isolated from femora of RA, OA and post-traumatic (PT) patients, cultured in vitro in the presence or absence of IL-1beta and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and assessed for the production and mRNA expression of IL-6-type cytokines. Trabecular bone biopsies were obtained from the inner portions of femoral heads and used for cytokine in situ immunostaining. Cultured OB and BMSC from different patients constitutively secreted IL-11 and IL-6 but not OSM. LIF was secreted only by BMSC, at very low levels. Interestingly, IL-11 basal production was significantly higher in BMSC than in OB in all three groups tested. IL-1beta and TNF-alpha strongly stimulated IL-6-type cytokine release (except for OSM) by both OB and BMSC. OSM was expressed only at mRNA levels in all groups studied. Cytokine immunostaining on bone biopsies confirmed the data obtained on cultured cells: IL-11, IL-6 and LIF proteins were detected both in mesenchymal (BMSC and OB) and mononuclear cells; OSM was found only in mononuclear cells. These data demonstrate that IL-6-type cytokines are constitutively expressed in the bone compartment in RA, OA and PT patients and can be secreted by bone cells at different stages of differentiation (BMSC and OB). This suggests that these cytokines may be involved in the mechanisms of bone remodelling in OA and RA.",,PMC1905501,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Geldanamycin (GA), a benzoquinone ansamycin, specifically binds to HSP90 and disrupts the interaction of HSP90 and target proteins. Thus, GA has been used as a specific inhibitor of HSP90. In this study, we examined whether GA could affect protein synthesis and gene expression in the human erythroleukemic cell line K562. Treatment with GA, but not herbimycin A (another benzoquinone ansamycin), highly induced a 70-kDa protein, which was revealed to be HSP70 by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation with anti-HSP70 antibody. The expression of HSP28 was also enhanced by GA. Furthermore, GA induced the activation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), but not HSF2, as determined by electromobility shift and electromobility supershift assay. In addition, similar to heat shock treatment, GA induced the phosphorylation of HSF1. Heat shock element-binding activity and phosphorylation of HSF1 were attenuated 3 h after GA treatment. These results indicate that the functional inactivation of HSP90 by GA potentially stimulates the expression of heat shock proteins through activation of HSF1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its spectrum of clinical and histologic presentation is highly variable and is not necessarily correlated with prognosis. Mast cell disorders presenting as atypical infiltrates in the bone marrow may simulate or be associated with other hematolymphoid malignancies, from which they must be distinguished. The paucity of reliable histochemical and immunohistochemical markers for the detection of mast cells in paraffin sections further confounds this diagnosis. The authors have employed immunohistochemistry for the C-KIT encoded tyrosine kinase receptor protein, CD117, for detection of mast cells on paraffin sections of 89 bone marrow specimens including systemic mast cell disease and other disorders. CD117 staining was found in all cases of mast cell disorders (seven of seven), and in one case of chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis. None of the other myeloid disorders tested (0 of 16), or any of the cases of Hodgkin's disease (0 of 12), B-cell lymphomas (0 of 32), T-cell lymphomas (0 of 3), or histiocytic proliferations (0 of 3) showed staining for CD117.

However, not all of the progenitor cells express the bcr/abl hybrid mRNA or the p210 fusion protein. These cells, therefore, might escape detection by techniques that are based on expression of the fusion gene. To circumvent this problem, we established a new detection method for the rearrangement at the DNA level. Because breakpoints might occur in a very large genomic region (>200 kb), we developed a long-template DNA-PCR (LT-DNA-PCR). In 22 of 59 CML patients, fragments of up to 19 kb could be amplified. Furthermore, 6 of 7 leukapheresis products of three bcr/abl-positive patients which were collected after mobilization chemotherapy and had been shown to be negative for the bcr/abl rearrangement by FISH and by RT-PCR were clearly positive by LT-DNA-PCR. Using a specific pair of primers, it is possible to detect the presence of, and to characterize, the individual gene rearrangement. This approach could serve for diagnostic purposes as well as detection of minimal residual disease under cytotoxic therapy or after purging regimens, being independent of expression of the bcr/abl hybrid mRNA or the fusion protein.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of the FHIT gene in the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or its progression from a chronic phase to the accelerated and blastic phases is not known. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether Fhit protein expression is altered in CML, and whether it plays any role in CML progression, disease responsiveness to therapy, or prognosis. A total of 195 patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML were evaluated, including 129 patients in early chronic phase (time from diagnosis to study, 12 months or less), 30 patients in late chronic phase, and 36 patients in the accelerated and blastic phases. The levels of cellular Fhit protein expression were determined using Western blot analysis and solid-phase RIA and compared to the levels in 31 normal marrows. The median Fhit expression in normal marrows was assigned a value of 1, and the levels in CML samples were normalized to the median of the normal control. Fhit levels in CML samples were evaluated in relation to CML phase and patient characteristics and prognosis in the early chronic phase. The median Fhit value in CML samples was 0.89 (range, 0.34-2.62). Eight of the 195 (4%) CML samples showed Fhit levels <0.5 and lacked detectable Fhit protein by Western blot. There was no difference in the levels of Fhit expression by different CML phases. In early chronic phase, reduced Fhit expression tended to be associated with leukocytosis (P = 0.04) and lower platelet counts (P = 0.01), but not with poorer-risk groups. No differences in response to IFN-alpha therapy or in survival were observed by different Fhit levels. Lack of Fhit protein expression was detected in 4% of CML cases, and reduced expression occurred in a subpopulation of patients. However, reduced Fhit expression is not associated with progression, response to therapy, or prognosis in CML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Caspases are cysteine proteases that play a major role in the activation of apoptotic pathways and chemotherapy-induced cell death. High levels of inactive, uncleaved caspase 2 and caspase 3 have recently been associated with poor survival in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. We hypothesized a similarly significant role for caspase 2 and caspase 3 in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We determined levels of uncleaved caspase 2 and caspase 3 by quantitative Western blot analysis in peripheral blood samples of 45 adults with newly diagnosed ALL. We evaluated patient prognostic variables and caspase levels using multivariate logistic and Cox regression models to determine their impact on complete remission rate and overall survival probability. Levels of caspase 2 and, to a lesser degree, caspase 3 were highly associated with cytogenetic abnormalities, with lower levels in the diploid group (P = 0.016 and P = 0.10, respectively). No association between either caspase level and the percentage of bone marrow blasts was found. A high level of caspase 3 (>0.37 as determined graphically) was significantly associated with achieving complete remission (CR; P = 0.006). A multivariate logistic regression analysis including age, WBC count, percentage of peripheral and marrow blasts, hemoglobin, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, and creatinine determined that a high level of caspase 3 was the most significant predictor of CR (P = 0.025, adjusted), with albumin the only other significant variable (P = 0.031). Caspase 2 levels were not associated with probability of CR. In a multivariate Cox model for survival, however, levels of caspase 2 above 0.37 were associated with a lower survival probability than were levels below that threshold (P = 0.064). High levels of caspase 3 may have a significant effect on achieving CR. Because of the limited power (n = 45) of our study, the significance of caspase 2 and caspase 3 on overall survival remains to be validated by further investigations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The maximum tolerated dose was found to be 0.3 g/kg per day of this preparation. This means that a 70-kg patient can generally tolerate up to 21 1-g capsules/day containing 13.1 g of eicosapentaenoic acid + docosahexaenoic acid, the two major omega-3 fatty acids. Dose-limiting toxicity was gastrointestinal, mainly diarrhea, and a poorly described toxicity designated as ""unable to tolerate in esophagus or stomach."" A patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia taking the fish oil provided an unusual opportunity to perform a detailed biochemical study of the effect of fish oil capsules on the lipids of malignant cells at several sequential time points in treatment. Studies of the malignant lymphocytes, serum, and whole blood of this one patient revealed an increase in eicosapentaenoic acid, the major component of the fish oil capsules, during fish oil capsule treatment. This study provides a scientific basis for the selection of omega-3 fatty acid doses for future studies in cancer. The maximum tolerated dose found is considerably higher than anticipated from published studies of many human diseases.

Pancreatitis occurred at a median of 10 days following day one of cytarabine administration with resolution at a median of 11 days after initial diagnosis. Six patients did not suffer major complications. One patient died of causes unrelated to pancreatitis. Five of six patients was rechallenged and all remained free of pancreatitis. One patient subsequently did develop pancreatitis on a later rechallenge. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatitis in the setting of AML therapy may be an infrequent and self-limited toxicity of cytarabine. A schedule dependent toxicity with cytarabine was not identified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, mechanisms which regulate apoptosis should also affect drug resistance. Oxidants and antioxidants have been shown to participate in the regulation of apoptosis. We were interested in studying whether responsiveness of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) cells to etoposide is mediated by oxidative stress and glutathione levels. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two subclones of the OCI/AML-2 cell line which are etoposide-sensitive (ES), and etoposide-resistant (ER), were established by the authors at the University of Oulu, and used as models. Assays for apoptosis included externalization of phosphatidylserine (as evidenced by annexin V binding), and caspase activation as indicated by cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (Western blotting). Peroxide formation was analyzed by flow cytometry. Glutathione and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) levels were determined spectrophotometrically and by Western blotting, respectively. RESULTS: Etoposide-induced apoptosis was evident 12 hours after treatment in the ES subclone, but was apparent in the ER subclone only after 24 hours. The basal glutathione and gamma-GCS levels were higher in the ER than the ES subclone. Etoposide increased peroxide formation in both subclones after 12-hour exposure. Significant depletion of glutathione was observed in the ES subclone during etoposide exposure, while glutathione levels were maintained in the ER subclone. In neither of the subclones was induction of gamma-GCS observed during 24-hour exposure to etoposide. Furthermore, the catalytic subunit of gamma-GCS was cleaved during apoptosis, concurrent with depletion of intracellular glutathione. When glutathione was depleted by treatment with buthionine sulfoximine, a direct inhibitor of gamma-GCS, the sensitivity to etoposide was increased, particularly in the ER subclone. CONCLUSIONS: The results underline the significance of glutathione biosynthesis in the responsiveness of AML cells to etoposide. The molecular mechanisms mediating glutathione depletion during etoposide exposure might include the cleavage of the catalytic subunit of gamma-GCS.",,,,,,,"['CA75316/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES04696/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES07033/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

In 1996, revised guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) indicated that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were unlikely to be harmful for older acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and suggested that physicians could consider their use in this setting. In 1997, the ASCO health services research committee evaluated whether physician reimbursement was a primary determinant in the decision to use G-CSF and GM-CSF in this clinical situation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A questionnaire describing clinical scenarios for a 67-year-old man with newly diagnosed de novo AML was mailed to 1500 ASCO members who practiced medical oncology and hematology. Physicians were queried about their preferences for adjunctive CSF use following induction and consolidation chemotherapy. RESULTS: Of 1020 potentially eligible respondents, returned surveys were received from 672. Following induction chemotherapy, support for CSF use was 40%, similar in magnitude for that for non-use of these agents. The most important determinant of support for CSF use was being in a fee-for-service practice (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians in the US are mixed in their support for CSFs for older AML patients. Support was high in settings where CSF use was accompanied by financial profit to the physician practice, and support was low otherwise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional risk assessment with low-linear-energy-transfer (LET)-based risk from Japanese atomic bomb survivor studies may be inappropriate for relativistic protons and nuclei in space due to track structure effects. This paper develops a Monte Carlo mixture model (MCMM) for transferring additive, National Institutes of Health multiplicative, and multiplicative excess cancer incidence risks based on Japanese atomic bomb survivor data to determine excess incidence risk for various US astronaut exposure profiles. The MCMM serves as an anchor point for future risk projection methods involving biophysical models of DNA damage from space radiation. Lifetime incidence risks of radiation-induced cancer for the MCMM based on low-LET Japanese data for nonleukemia (all cancers except leukemia) were 2.77 (90% confidence limit, 0.75-11.34) for males exposed to 1 Sv at age 45 and 2.20 (90% confidence limit, 0.59-10.12) for males exposed at age 55. For females, mixture model risks for nonleukemia exposed separately to 1 Sv at ages of 45 and 55 were 2.98 (90% confidence limit, 0.90-11.70) and 2.44 (90% confidence limit, 0.70-10.30), respectively. Risks for high-LET 200 MeV protons (LET=0.45 keV/micrometer), 1 MeV alpha-particles (LET=100 keV/micrometer), and 600 MeV iron particles (LET=180 keV/micrometer) were scored on a per particle basis by determining the particle fluence required for an average of one particle per cell nucleus of area 100 micrometer(2). Lifetime risk per proton was 2.68x10(-2)% (90% confidence limit, 0.79x10(-3)%-0. 514x10(-2)%). For alpha-particles, lifetime risk was 14.2% (90% confidence limit, 2.5%-31.2%). Conversely, lifetime risk per iron particle was 23.7% (90% confidence limit, 4.5%-53.0%). Uncertainty in the DDREF for high-LET particles may be less than that for low-LET radiation because typically there is very little dose-rate dependence. Probability density functions for high-LET radiation quality and dose-rate may be preferable to conventional risk assessment approaches. Nuclear reactions and track structure effects in tissue may not be properly estimated by existing data using in vitro models for estimating RBEs. The method used here is being extended to estimate uncertainty in spacecraft shielding effectiveness in various space radiation environments.",,,,,,,,,,['NASA'],"['NASA Center LaRC', 'NASA Discipline Radiation Health', 'NASA Program Biomedical Research and Countermeasures']",['Wilson JW'],"['Wilson, J W']",['LaRC'],,

Limitations in databases needed to predict cancer hazards in human beings from such radiations are significant and currently do not provide confidence that such predictions are acceptably precise or accurate. In this article, we outline the need for animal carcinogenesis data based on a more sophisticated understanding of the dose-response relationship for induction of cancer and correlative cellular endpoints by representative space radiations. We stress the need for a model that can interrelate human and animal carcinogenesis data with cellular mechanisms. Using a broad model for dose-response patterns which we term the ""subalpha-alpha-omega (SAO) model"", we explore examples in the literature for radiation-induced cancer and for radiation-induced cellular events to illustrate the need for data that define the dose-response patterns more precisely over specific dose ranges, with special attention to low dose, low dose-rate exposure. We present data for multiple endpoints in cells, which vary in their radiosensitivity, that also support the proposed model. We have measured induction of complex chromosome aberrations in multiple cell types by two space radiations, Fe-ions and protons, and compared these to photons delivered at high dose-rate or low dose-rate. Our data demonstrate that at least three factors modulate the relative efficacy of Fe-ions compared to photons: (i) intrinsic radiosensitivity of irradiated cells; (ii) dose-rate; and (iii) another unspecified effect perhaps related to reparability of DNA lesions. These factors can produce respectively up to at least 7-, 6- and 3-fold variability. These data demonstrate the need to understand better the role of intrinsic radiosensitivity and dose-rate effects in mammalian cell response to ionizing radiation. Such understanding is critical in extrapolating databases between cellular response, animal carcinogenesis and human carcinogenesis, and we suggest that the SAO model is a useful tool for such extrapolation.",,,,,,,['R01 ES07076/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,['NASA'],"['NASA Discipline Radiation Health', 'NASA Program Biomedical Research and Countermeasures', 'Non-NASA Center']",['Dicello JF'],"['Dicello, J F']","['Johns Hopkins U, Baltimore, MD']",,

We describe here the molecular cloning of a novel human cDNA encoding a vitamin C transporter SVCT1. SVCT1 is largely confined to bulk-transporting epithelia (e.g., kidney and small intestine) with a putative alternative-splice product present in thymus. Applying radiotracer and voltage-clamp approaches in cRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes, we found that SVCT1 mediates saturable, concentrative, high-affinity l-ascorbic acid transport (K(0.5) = 50-100 microM) that is electrogenic and can be inhibited by phloretin. SVCT1 displays exquisite substrate selectivity, greatly favoring l-ascorbic acid over its isomers d-isoascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid and 2- or 6-substituted analogues, whereas glucose and nucleobases are excluded. We have mapped the SLC23A2 gene (coding for SVCT1) to human chromosome 5 in band 5q31.2-31.3, within a region commonly deleted in malignant myeloid (leukemia) diseases. In addition, we have demonstrated that the human SLC23A1 gene product is a related high-affinity l-ascorbic acid transporter (SVCT2) that is widely distributed in brain, retina, and a host of endocrine and neuroendocrine tissues.

METHODS: A retrospective study of patients with de novo AML under the age of 60 over a 20-year period in which two induction therapy regimens: 7:3 (1975-1983) and 7:3:7 (1984-1996) and three consolidation chemotherapy regimens: 5:2 (1975-1983), 5:2:5 (1984-1990) and Ara-C/mitoxantrone (1991-1996) were used. Disease-free (DFS), overall survivals (OS) and prognostic factors were analysed. RESULTS: Two-hundred and two of 276 (73%) patients attained complete remission (CR). The CR rates of 7:3 and 7:3:7 regimens were 70.5% and 74.5% respectively (p=0.92). The median DFS was 12 months and the projected DFS at 10- and 20-years were 23% and 21% respectively.

Ninety per cent of relapses occurred within two years from remission but there were two late relapses at 109 m and 120 m respectively. Young age and FAB M3 subtype were favourable prognostic factors to OS (p=0.04) and DFS (p=0.006) respectively. There was no secondary solid tumour in the long-term survivors.

Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the BCR-ABL fusion mRNA has identified patients with the fusion mRNA without cytogenetic evidence of the 9;22 translocation. The reason for discrepancies between cytogenetic and molecular diagnoses is unclear. AIM: Our aim was to study cases of ALL with discordant cytogenetic and RT-PCR results and identify any reasons for such discrepancies. METHODS: Laboratory records were scanned for cases of ALL tested by both RT-PCR and cytogenetics and positive by either for the 9;22 translocation. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was used to study discordant results where a specimen was available. RESULTS: We identified 15 patients with ALL who had both cytogenetic and RT-PCR studies for BCR-ABL. Seven had discordant results; five patients had positive RT-PCR studies with normal (four/five) or abnormal but Ph negative cytogenetics (one/five), and two were Ph+ but RT-PCR negative. FISH, using Vysis LSI bcr/abl translocation probes, showed fused signals in 12% interphase cells but not in metaphase cells in one specimen with normal cytogenetics, and 6% interphase cells in the Ph negative patient with abnormal cytogenetics. This second patient subsequently relapsed with a minor Ph+ cell line derived from the Ph negative line. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirmed the need for both cytogenetics and RT-PCR to identify Ph+ ALL. FISH did not show sub-microscopic rearrangements of BCR-ABL in normal metaphases. Failure to identify the Philadelphia chromosome cytogenetically appeared due rather to Ph+ cells failing to divide.",,,,18,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), two cytokines sharing the common gp130 receptor subunit and functioning through activation of the intracellular JAK/STAT pathway, induce POMC synthesis and ACTH release. We investigated the effects of LIF and IL-6 on PC1 expression and its subsequent processing of POMC. A significant time-dependent up-regulation of both PC1 protein and mRNA by LIF and IL-6 was seen in mouse corticotroph AtT-20 cells. IL-6 or LIF increased the synthesis of ACTH-related products with a concomitant increase in bioactive 5 and 13 kDa ACTH indicating coordinated regulation of substrate and processing enzyme. AtT-20 cells transiently transfected with a human PC1-promoter-luciferase reporter construct and treated with LIF or IL-6 showed significantly increased luciferase activity. Additionally, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration to rats resulted in an increase in both pituitary PC1 and POMC mRNA. These findings suggest that the ACTH increase induced by LIF and IL-6 is due to both increased POMC synthesis as well as increased POMC processing by up-regulation of PC1.

For clinical use, humanised antibodies can have a number of advantages over their original murine version, including mediation of higher effector cell function with human cells, longer serum half-life and lower immunogenicity. In this study, we have produced a mouse/human chimeric HuLym3 antibody (cHuLym3) where the murine antibody constant regions have been replaced with human constant regions. We report the production and preclinical characterisation of the antibody, cHuLym3, with potent in vitro and in vivo antitumour activity. The genes encoding the variable heavy and light chains were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, sequenced and cloned into eukaryotic expression vectors containing the human light- and heavy-chain constant regions (kappa and IgG1). The chimeric and murine HuLym3 antibodies had similar cell-binding specificity and affinity. In the human Raji cell severe combined immunodeficient mouse model the i.v. injection of cHuLym3 and mHu-Lym3 produced similar antitumour responses. Doses of cHuLym3 and mHuLym3 (100 microg) on days 1, 2 and 4 after i.v. Raji cell injection produced a 40% longer time to hind-leg paralysis than when a control antibody was used. cHuLym3 had more potent activity than mHuLym3 in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays in vitro, with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells as effectors. Up to 60% specific cell lysis was observed with cHuLym3 in ADCC assays.

TZT-1027 showed remarkable activity and was selected for further development. TZT-1027 was found to inhibit the assembly of porcine brain microtubule proteins and to depolymerize the polymerized microtubule proteins. Therefore, its mechanism of antitumor activity seems to be at least partially ascribed to the inhibition of microtubule assembly. We further studied the binding site of TZT-1027 on tubulin. Scatchard analysis of 3H-TZT-1027 binding data suggested two binding sites including a high affinity site and a low affinity site. TZT-1027 affected the binding of vinblastine (VBL) on tubulin but its binding site isn't identical to the VBL binding site. TZT-1027 induced apoptosis within 24 h, not only in human leukemia cells such as HL-60, but also in solid tumors such as human prostate carcinoma cells DU145 and human mammary carcinoma cells MCF-7. TZT-1027 showed good antitumor activity against human xenografts (MX-1 and LX-1) without causing serious body weight reduction, which resulted in tumor regression.

The association between chronic hepatitis C and progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma has been reported in about 20% and 5% of patients, respectively, within 20-30 years of infection. In adult patients, interferon has proved to be effective in decreasing the abnormal values of transaminases and the level of HCV viremia. Our purpose was to assess efficacy of and tolerance to interferon in a group of young patients who had acquired HCV infection during a period of chemotherapy. DESIGN AND METHODS: Interferon-a (IFN) was administered to 26 adolescents and young adults (13 males, age range 17-36 years; median age 24) with chronic hepatitis C, including 4 with hepatitis B virus co-infection, who had been treated for leukemia or solid tumor 5 to 19 years before joining this trial. Patients were treated with natural IFN alpha at a dose of 4 MU/m(2) thrice weekly for 12 months and followed up for another 6 months thereafter. RESULTS: Nine patients stopped treatment during the first 6 months because of side effects (2 cases) or lack of response. At the end of the trial, 8 (31%) cases had responded, with alanine amino-transferase normalization and clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA. A sustained response was only documented in 15% of cases, however, irrespective of any hepatitis B virus co-infection. The 2 patients with HCV genotype 2 were both responders, whereas only 8% of those with genotype 1 responded. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These data show that the efficacy of IFN in this series of young patients is similar to that reported for otherwise healthy adults with hepatitis C. Patients with genotype 2 are strong candidates for IFN treatment while other therapeutic strategies should be designed for patients with HCV genotype 1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: We used reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequence analysis of the fusion region of the amplified cDNA fragment. Western analysis was performed on total protein. RESULTS: Part of exon e8 of the BCR gene was joined to an intronic sequence of ABL intron Ib spliced on exon a2 of the ABL gene, giving rise to an in-frame e8-int-a2 BCR-ABL transcript. Only part of exon 8 of the BCR gene (e8) (intra-exonic break) was retained. The consequent BCR-int-ABL transcript was translated into a BCR-ABL protein of 1804 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 197.5 kilodaltons (kDa) called p200 BCR-ABL. The 3' part of bcr exon 8 recombined within or alongside Alu elements at the additional sites. Sequence motifs similar to consensus binding sites of the lymphoid-associated TRAX and translisin proteins were present on both participating strands at 22q11 and 9q34 recombination sites, respectively. No differences in clinical or laboratory findings at diagnosis were found between this patient and CML patients with bcr-abl fusion. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The presence of Alu sequences and of the translisin binding motif on both sides of the breaks in this novel translocation suggests a possible general mechanism of molecular recombination in CML patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The formation mechanisms and clinical significance of variant Ph translocations are still unclear. The BCR/ABL chimeric gene encoding for chimeric proteins is always present and maps on the 22q- regardless of the type of translocation. We studied two apparently Ph negative CML patients with unusual karyotypes both showing a typical b3a2 rearrangement. DESIGN AND METHODS: Dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can visualize BCR and ABL genes and localize the BCR/ABL fusion gene. We used FISH to study the formation mechanisms of variant Ph translocations in two patients. RESULTS: The chimeric BCR/ABL gene was located on a locus other than the expected 22q11 in both patients. In the first case the fusion signal was present on the 9q34 band whereas in the second patient it was detected on chromosome 8, involved in masked Ph formation. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The location of the hybrid BCR/ABL gene on chromosomes other than 22q- is a rare event which can only be observed using the FISH technique. When these unusual translocations occur the hypothesis most often put forward is that several consecutive cytogenetic events have taken place. The factors which regulate the formation of these breakpoints have yet to be clarified. The FISH technique allows the identification of chromosome rearrangements that could not otherwise be detected by conventional banding procedures. The location of the hybrid BCR/ABL gene on sites other than 22q11 represents a rare type of variant Ph translocation. The real frequency and clinical significance of such rearrangements need to be investigated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Side effects reported during treatment with ATRA include retinoic acid syndrome and Sweet's syndrome. Sweet's syndrome has been associated with acute myelogenous leukemia at presentation, but only two cases of Sweet's syndrome involving the musculoskeletal system in patients treated with ATRA have been described. We describe two additional patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia who had unexplained fever and myalgias (cutaneous lesions in one patient) during induction therapy with ATRA. Radiologic findings were similar to those in previously reported ATRA-associated Sweet's syndrome of the musculoskeletal system.

Usually, although not uniformly, histopathological examination of the lymph nodes shows a pleomorphic type. In addition, some patients with pre-overt ATLL show a Hodgkin's disease-like morphology and lymph nodes in non-neoplastic carriers show features of lymphadenitis. To characterize further the clinicopathological features of HTLV-I-associated lymphadenopathy, the histopathological features of the lymph nodes of 289 patients were classified into five types: lymphadenitis ( n=14), Hodgkin's-like (Hodgkin's) ( n=18), pleomorphic (medium and large cells) ( n=219), pleomorphic small cell ( n=11), and anaplastic large cell (ALC) ( n=27). Survival data were analysed according to the histopathological features of the lymph nodes. The pleomorphic type, which showed typical features of ATLL, was associated with a highly aggressive course and an initially high mortality, followed by a rapid decrease in survival. This pattern was also observed in patients with the ALC type. All cases with lymphadenitis were still alive at the end of the study, while survival progressively decreased in the Hodgkin's type. The small cell type showed an initial rapid decrease in survival followed by a plateau. These results show that the survival trends of patients with pleomorphic and anaplastic lymph node lesions are similar to those with ATL lymphoma, while patients with the lymphadenitis type of lesion were considered to have a non-neoplatic status. There is at present no effective therapy for ATLL, but in the future, these classification and survival data might be useful for the selection of appropriate chemotherapeutic regimens for patients with ATLL.",,,"['Copyright 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The commonest subtypes of NHL have no well-defined aetiological factors but lymphoma development has been linked with exposure to a variety of chemicals, including nitrates, pesticides, herbicides, and solvents. Benzene, a solvent and important constituent of petrochemical products, is a potent lymphomagen in experimental animals and high-dose exposure in humans is associated with both acute myeloid leukaemia and NHL. Much current interest centres on the possibility that environmental benzene exposure in the general public may underlie a proportion of the increase in NHL. Seventy per cent of benzene exposure in the environment is derived from vehicle exhaust emissions, whose increase has closely paralleled the rise in frequency of the disease. Mathematical modelling has been used to calculate an acceptable concentration of benzene in air based on risk estimates derived from industrial exposure, but the recommended target concentration in the U.K. of 1 ppb is regularly exceeded in urban locations. Detailed investigation of the health effects of low-level benzene exposure awaits an accurate assay for quantifying long-term human exposure. The (32)P post-labelling technique for the detection of toxin-specific DNA adducts is extremely sensitive and has been applied in the biomonitoring of exposure to a number of carcinogens, but benzene-DNA adducts have to date proved elusive of detection.",,,"['Copyright 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",112,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mast cells of the rat basophilic leukemia cell line (RBL-2H3), cholera toxin (CT) potentiates antigen-driven uptake of (45)Ca(2+) through cAMP-independent means. Here, we have used perforated patch clamp recording at physiological temperature to test whether cholera toxin or its substrate, Gs, directly modulates the activity of CRAC channels. Cholera toxin dramatically amplified (two- to fourfold) the Ca(2)+ release-activated Ca(2+) current (I(CRAC)) elicited by suboptimal concentrations of antigen, without itself inducing I(CRAC), and this enhancement was not mimicked by cAMP elevation. In contrast, cholera toxin did not affect the induction of I(CRAC) by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of organelle Ca(2+) pumps, or by intracellular dialysis with low Ca(2+) pipette solutions. Thus, the activity of CRAC channels is not directly controlled by cholera toxin or Gsalpha. Nor was the potentiation of I(CRAC) due to enhancement of phosphoinositide hydrolysis or calcium release. Because Gs and the A subunit of cholera toxin bind to ADP ribosylation factor (ARF) and could modulate its activity, we tested the sensitivity of antigen-evoked I(CRAC) to brefeldin A, an inhibitor of ARF-dependent functions, including vesicle transport. Brefeldin A blocked the enhancement of antigen-evoked I(CRAC) without inhibiting ADP ribosylation of Gsalpha, but it did not affect I(CRAC) induced by suboptimal antigen or by thapsigargin. These data provide new evidence that CRAC channels are a major route for Fcin receptor I-triggered Ca(2+) influx, and they suggest that ARF may modulate the induction of I(CRAC) by antigen.",,PMC3207143,,,,,['GM48144/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The frequency of TdT-negative ALL is not known. Here we report 3 TdT-negative ALL cases that met the criteria for T-cell ALL. DESIGN: We reviewed approximately 200 cases of ALL retrieved from the database at our institution. All cases were evaluated using Wright-Giemsa, myeloperoxidase, butyrate, and TdT staining; immunophenotyped using flow cytometry; and studied using Southern blot analyses for T-cell receptors and immunoglobulin gene rearrangement. RESULTS: All ALL cases (L1 and L2) were TdT-positive, except for 3 cases that were of early T-cell lineage. None of the 3 cases demonstrated positivity for TdT in immunofluorescence staining with polyclonal antibodies or flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed a pre-T-cell immunophenotype in all 3 cases. One of the cases showed rearrangement of a T-cell antigen receptor and immunoglobulin heavy chain (J(H)). A second case showed germline configuration of T-cell receptors, but also showed rearrangement of the J(H), despite the expression of T-cell markers only.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analyses of histone acetylation in in vitro-methylated transfected plasmids support this model; however, little is known about the relationships among de novo DNA methylation, transcriptional repression, and histone acetylation state. To examine these relationships in vivo, we have developed a novel approach that permits the isolation and expansion of cells harboring expressing or silent retroviruses. MEL cells were infected with a Moloney murine leukemia virus encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP), and single-copy, silent proviral clones were treated weekly with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A or the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine. Expression was monitored concurrently by flow cytometry, allowing for repeated phenotypic analysis over time, and proviral methylation was determined by Southern blotting and bisulfite methylation mapping. Shortly after infection, proviral expression was inducible and the reporter gene and proviral enhancer showed a low density of methylation. Over time, the efficacy of drug induction diminished, coincident with the accumulation of methyl-CpGs across the provirus. Bisulfite analysis of cells in which 5-azacytidine treatment induced GFP expression revealed measurable but incomplete demethylation of the provirus. Repression could be overcome in late-passage clones only by pretreatment with 5-azacytidine followed by trichostatin A, suggesting that partial demethylation reestablishes the trichostatin-inducible state. These experiments reveal the presence of a silencing mechanism which acts on densely methylated DNA and appears to function independently of histone deacetylase activity.",,PMC85201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its activity was compared with ciprofloxacin and cephazolin. The effect on therapeutic efficacy of the addition of recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rGCSF) was also examined. Our study showed that both quinolones successfully cured pneumonia owing to infection with K. pneumoniae in mice without tumours but that all antibiotics failed in tumour-bearing mice if DNR was withheld. Substantial differences were noted in DNR-treated tumour-bearing mice with infection-the cure rate with trovafloxacin was 91% whereas the cure rate with ciprofloxacin or cephazolin was 57%. Addition of rGCSF to ciprofloxacin did not substantially improve its efficacy (when assessed by protection against death owing to infection; the survival rate was 41%). Trovafloxacin cure rates ranged from 80 to 90% whether or not rGCSF was added to the treatment regimen.

CONCLUSION: Only 1 or 2 copies of JCV genome were calculated to exist in a cell based on the time course analysis of PCR. Only B lymphocytes and glial brain cells are known to produce nuclear factors which support the growth of the virus.

Both our own experience and the literature reports on the subject show that each subtype of lymphoma can be recognised from a distinct combination of a suggestive growth pattern and a particular cytological composition. A predominantly paratrabecular infiltrate composed of centrocytes is characteristic of follicle centre cell lymphoma. In mantle cell lymphoma, prominent intertrabecular nodules, each consisting of a monotonous proliferation of small to intermediate-sized lymphoid cells with an irregular nucleus, are the most frequent finding. Marginal zone cell lymphoma displays similar intertrabecular nodules, but the infiltrates are rather loose and polymorphic, whereas the lymphoid cells exhibit monocytoid features. Diffuse infiltrates composed of small lymphocytes with clumped chromatin, of plasma cells with Dutcher bodies and of mast cells are observed in most cases of lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma/immunocytoma. Although chronic lymphocytic leukaemia / small lymphocytic lymphoma can present with a comparable pattern of bone marrow involvement, an interstitial infiltrate of small lymphoid cells is usually observed. A comparable interstitial pattern also prevails in hairy cell leukaemia. This lymphoma subtype, however, can be readily identified by the abundant clear cytoplasm of the neoplastic cells, erythrocyte extravasation and associated abnormalities in the haematopoietic series.",,,,47,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infection of a CD8+, CD5- large granular lymphocyte (LGL) cell line with FeLV-A activated expression of interleukin-7 (IL-7), induced modest (4-fold) increases in granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) transcripts, and decreased transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) mRNA (4-fold). The LGL cells were not susceptible to infection by FIV. Infection of MYA-1 cells, a CD4+ T-lymphoblastoid cell line, with FeLV-A activated expression of macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), increased transcript levels of GM-CSF (8-fold), macrophage CSF (M-CSF) (16-fold) and stem cell factor (SCF) (250-fold), and decreased (4-fold) expression of IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Productive infection with four different FIV molecular clones caused progressive MYA-1 cell death; however, the mRNA expression profiles were unchanged except for 2- to 4-fold increases in M-CSF and 16- to 500-fold increases in SCF. Thus, FIV-induced MYA-1 cytopathicity was not associated with dysregulation of pro-apoptotic or survival factor transcript levels. Lastly, productive infection of PNI cells, a marrow-derived fibroendothelial cell line, with FeLV-A or any of three FIV strains induced 4-fold higher levels of IL-12p40 transcripts and variably higher levels (4- to 64-fold) of GM-CSF. Two viral strains, the FIV-14 molecular clone and the clinical isolate FIV-5122, caused syncytia formation and unique activation of IL-1beta and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) expression, suggesting a potential role for those factors in viral spread and/or cytopathicity. In addition, infection with FIV-5122, but not the other FIV strains or FeLV-A, induced significant increases in mRNA levels of the hematopoietic inhibitors TNF-alpha and MIP-1alpha, along with increased concentrations of soluble proteins in culture supernatants. Consistent with this, supernatant from FIV-5122 infected PNI cells suppressed hematopoietic progenitor growth in colony assays, compared to supportive activities in supernatants from other infected or uninfected PNI cell cultures. Together, these data demonstrate that feline retroviruses alter cytokine mRNA levels in general and strain-specific patterns. These changes may result in specific alterations in cell function and contribute to retroviral pathogenesis. Our observations provide a basis for directed studies of candidate factors within the hematopoietic, thymic and lymphoid microenvironments.",,,,,,,['DK49888/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

IC50 values of the two water-soluble derivatives were, on the whole, comparable to 7 beta HC lying in the range of 3-10 microM. In addition, the water-soluble derivatives were able to induce apoptosis in the examined DLD-1 and KM20L2 colon carcinoma cell lines in contrast to the parent compound 7 beta HC, as shown by DNA fragmentation, by the cleavage of DNA repair enzyme poly(ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP), and by the proteolytic cleavage of caspase-3 (CPP32).

In order to study the possible concomitant role of protein kinase C and actin in megakaryocyte polyploidization, three cell lines (DAMI, HEL and K562), expressing some properties of the megakaryocytic lineage and known to differentiate into the megakaryocytic pathway in the presence of phorbol esters, were cultivated in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate alone (PMA, 5 x 10(-9) M, activator of protein kinase C, PKC) or concomitantly with cytochalasin B (2 micrograms/ml, inhibitor of actin polymerization). We have previously shown that DAMI, HEL and K562 cells in which actin polymerization was inhibited by cytochalasin B, acquired megakaryocytic properties in the way that they became polyploid, acquired a megakaryocytic phenotype and arrested proliferation (4). After four days of culture in the presence of PMA and cytochalasin B, the number of polyploid cells (estimated by flow cytometry) increased in comparison with control or PMA-treated cells. However, it was lower than in cytochalasin B-treated cells. Indeed, control cells predominantly diploid (2N) became polyploid with the appearance of 8N, 16N and 32N cells after addition of PMA, cytochalasin B or PMA + cytochalasin B. The endomitotic index (EI, as described in 5) which corresponds to the mean of ( inverted question marklog2 DNA content expressed in N inverted question mark-1) was 0.5 +/- 0.1, 0.7 +/- 0.1 and 0.3 +/- 0.1 in control DAMI, HEL and K562 cells, respectively. The EI increased to 0.9 +/- 0.2; 1.0 +/- 0.2 and 0.4 + 0.1 in cells treated with PMA and to 1.6 +/- 0.3; 1.4 +/- 0, and 0.9 +/- 0.2 when PMA was added concomitantly to cytochalasin B. Total DNA estimated from the cell content and the percentage of cells present at each ploidy stage did not change in cytochalasin B-treated cells in comparison to control conditions. However, treatment of DAMI, HEL and K562 cells with PMA alone or concomitantly with cytochalasin B revealed that the total DNA content significantly decreased in these conditions. At last, treatment of the three cell lines with PMA alone or concomitantly with cytochalasin B for 4 days caused a complete inhibition of proliferation. In conclusion, the concomitant addition of PMA and cytochalasin B to the three cell lines lead to an augmentation of cell ploidy and to a cessation of proliferation. However, we did not observe any synergistic effect of the two compounds. The possible interaction between actin and protein kinase C is discussed in the paper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the effect of ponalrestat on cachexia symptoms in nude mice bearing human melanomas G361 and SEKI was investigated because it has been suggested that the suppression of LPL has an important role in cachexia induction by these two melanomas in nude mice. Mice bearing G361 subcutaneously did not gain weight and became cachectic, associated with the tumor growth. Tumor growth was not affected by ponalrestat, nevertheless treatment with ponalrestat resulted in an amelioration of the reduction in the weight of body mass, epididymal fat, gastrocnemius muscle, carcass and whole body lipid induced by the presence of G361. A severe weight loss observed in nude mice bearing SEKI was also partially attenuated by ponalrestat treatment.

Apoptotic destruction of predisposed cells may reduce the proportion of cells available for malignant progression. Thus, pharmacologic manipulation of apoptotic pathway is regarded as a novel strategy in cancer chemoprevention as well as therapy. 2-(Allylthio)pyrazine (2-AP), a pyrazine derivative of allylsulfide synthesized for use as a chemoprotective agent, has been shown to protect against experimental carcinogenesis and mutagenesis. The present study examined the capability of 2-AP to induce apoptosis in cultured human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells. Treatment of HL-60 cells with 2-AP led to suppression of viability and proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. Microscopic examination of the treated cells revealed typical morphological features of apoptosis, such as nuclear fragmentation and chromatin condensation. Furthermore, cells treated with 2-AP exhibited internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Flow cytometric analysis of HL-60 cells exposed to 2-AP showed appearance of a distinct peak representing the subdiploid cell population. 2-AP treatment decreased the ratio of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 to the death stimulating protein Bax, which may account for the molecular basis of apoptosis-inducing activity of this chemopreventive organosulfur derivative.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin-6 was reported to induce proliferation of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) cells, and to enhance survival of these cells through inhibition of spontaneous apoptosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To more clearly define the effects of an in vitro stimulation of B-CLL cells, lymphocytes from 13 patients with B-CLL and from 6 healthy individuals were incubated for 7 d with immunomodulators such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), pokeweed mitogen (PWM), lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and extracts from Viscum album L. (VAL; Helixor), which were recognised to induce apoptosis but also to induce a release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha. RESULTS: Although both, IL-6 and PWM induced a release of IL-6 and expression of the activation markers CD25 and CD71 on the surface of B-CLL cells, IL-6 did not increase or accelerate the proliferation of these cells. In contrast, VAL extracts did not result in an upregulation of activation markers or proliferation of B-CLL cells but induced both, cell death via apoptosis and IL-6 release. In response to PWM, only few clones of leukemic B cells incorporated the thymidine-analogue 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine. Moreover, a remarkable response of B-CLL cells towards the immunomodulators was observed only in one patient with an advanced stage. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results do not support theoretical objections of a B-CLL stimulation via induction of IL-6 in vitro.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This shift in catalase mobility can be indicative of singlet oxygen production in vivo. Catalase from human cells, as from many organisms, is susceptible to in vitro modification by singlet oxygen. Human myeloid leukemia (U937) cells were treated under different stress conditions and catalase activity and its electrophoretic mobility was monitored. The U937 cells were found to have high levels of catalase activity, as compared to cultured fibroblasts, and to be very resistant to oxidative stress. Hydrogen peroxide did not modify the electrophoretic mobility of catalase, even at doses that produced cell damage. Conditions that primarily generate superoxide, such as treatment with paraquat or heat shock, also failed to modify the enzyme. In contrast, photosensitization reactions using rose Bengal gave rise to a more acidic conformer of catalase. Singlet oxygen quenchers prevented catalase modification by rose Bengal and light. The growth medium had a photosensitizing activity. Catalase was not modified in cells illuminated in phosphate buffer but was modified in cells illuminated in phosphate buffer containing riboflavin. Intense light per se also generated a slight shift in the electrophoretic mobility of catalase. Ultraviolet light (350 or 366 nm) did cause a change in catalase, but to a less acidic catalase conformer, indicating other modifications of the enzyme. The main effect of photosensitization with methylene blue was crosslinking of the enzyme, although some shift to acidic conformers was observed at a low concentration of the photoactive compound.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of cells principally quench 1O2 by chemical mechanisms, producing lipid hydroperoxides, while proteins physically and chemically quench 1O2. Because cell lines can have different PUFA and protein levels, we hypothesized that 1O2 toxicity will vary between cell lines. We used Photofrin as a source of 1O2. Exposure of nine different leukemia cell lines (CEM, HEL, HL-60, K-562, KG-1, L1210, Molt-4, THP-1 and U-937) to Photofrin and light results in changes in membrane permeability (trypan blue) that vary with cell line. The greater the lipid content of the cell line, the less susceptible they are to membrane damage. When the cell media was supplemented with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6), the overall unsaturation of cellular lipids increased. Photofrin and light resulted in increased radical formation in these supplemented cells compared to controls; however, there was no difference in membrane permeability between DHA-supplemented and control cells. Lipid-derived radical formation (electron paramagnetic resonance spin trapping) was cell line dependent; but no correlation between lipid content of cells and radical formation was found. However, we found that the greater the protein content of cells the more they were protected against membrane damage induced by Photofrin photosensitization. This suggests that cellular proteins are a key target for 1O2-mediated toxicity. A remarkable observation is that cell size correlates inversely with ability of cells to cope with a given flux of 1O2.",,,,,,,['CA-66081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Cold adaptation was obtained by a programme of immersion of the whole body up to the neck in a water-filled bath, the temperature of which was gradually decreased from 22 degrees C to 14 degrees C, time of exposure being increased from 5 to 20 min over a period of 90 days.

Of the nine tumors examined, six showed the presence of deleted env species of variable sizes in the tumor DNA. One env mutant, which was detected in a FRA-induced thymic lymphosarcoma, had a large internal deletion beginning from almost the N-terminal surface glycoprotein (SU) up to the middle region of the transmembrane (TM) protein of the env gene. The deduced polypeptide of this truncated env (tenv) retained the complete signal peptide and seven amino acids of the N-terminal mature SU of FRA env gene, followed by eight amino acids from the frameshift in the TM region. To study the biological function of tenv, we used a murine retrovirus vector to produce amphotropic virions. Infection of feline fibroblasts (H927), human fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080), or human B-lymphoma cells (Raji) led to pronounced cytotoxicity, while the tenv virus did not induce significant cytotoxicity to feline T-lymphoma cells (3201B) or human T-lymphoma cells (CEM).

These vectors have a number of advantages, particularly in regard to the ability to infect cells which are not actively dividing. However, the use of vectors based on human immunodeficiency virus raises a number of issues, not the least of which is safety; therefore, further characterization of marking and gene expression in different hematopoietic lineages in primate animal model systems is desirable. We use two animal model systems for gene therapy to test the efficiency of transduction and marking, as well as the safety of these vectors. The first utilizes the rhesus animal model for cytokine-mobilized autologous peripheral blood CD34(+) cell transplantation. The second uses the SCID-human (SCID-hu) thymus/liver chimeric graft animal model useful specifically for human T-lymphoid progenitor cell reconstitution. In the rhesus macaques, detectable levels of vector were observed in granulocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, and, in one animal with the highest levels of marking, erythrocytes and platelets. In transplanted SCID-hu mice, we directly compared marking and gene expression of the lentivirus vector and a murine leukemia virus-derived vector in thymocytes. Marking was observed at comparable levels, but the lentivirus vector bearing an internal cytomegalovirus promoter expressed less efficiently than did the murine retroviral vector expressed from its own long terminal repeats. In assays for infectious HIV type 1 (HIV-1), no replication-competent HIV-1 was detected in either animal model system. Thus, these results indicate that while lentivirus vectors have no apparent deleterious effects and may have advantages over murine retroviral vectors, further study of the requirements for optimal use are warranted.",,PMC111463,,,,,"['R01 AI039975/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI36555/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI39975/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The role of four open reading frames (ORFs), located between env and the 3' long terminal repeat of HTLV-1, in mediating disease is not entirely clear. By differential splicing, ORF II encodes two proteins, p13(II) and p30(II), both of which have not been functionally defined. p13(II) localizes to mitochondria and may alter the configuration of the tubular network of this cellular organelle. p30(II) localizes to the nucleolus and shares homology with the transcription factors Oct-1 and -2, Pit-1, and POU-M1. Both p13(II) and p30(II) are dispensable for infection and immortalization of primary human and rabbit lymphocytes in vitro. To test the role of ORF II gene products in vivo, we inoculated rabbits with lethally irradiated cell lines expressing the wild-type molecular clone of HTLV-1 (ACH.1) or a clone containing selected mutations in ORF II (ACH.30/13.1). ACH.1-inoculated animals maintained higher HTLV-1-specific antibody titers than animals inoculated with ACH.30/13.1. Viral p19 antigen was transiently detected in ex vivo cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from only two ACH.30/13.1-inoculated rabbits, while PBMC cultures from all ACH.1-inoculated rabbits routinely produced p19 antigen. In only three of six animals exposed to the ACH. p30(II)/p13(II) clone could provirus be consistently PCR amplified from extracted PBMC DNA and quantitative competitive PCR showed the proviral loads in PBMC from ACH.p30(II)/p13(II)-infected rabbits to be dramatically lower than the proviral loads in rabbits exposed to ACH.

Lethally irradiated BALB/c (H-2(d)) recipients of B10.D2 (H-2(d)) donor grafts were given daily intraperitoneal injections of PG27 (40 mg/kg per day) for the first 35 days after transplantation. Control mice were given daily injections of solvent vehicle (Ethanol and Cremophor EL). All the control recipients (15/15) died of GVHD within 90 days, but all the recipients given prophylactic treatment with PG27 (15/15) survived beyond 100 days without any signs of GVHD. Furthermore, the GVHD-free recipients were used as donors, and their bone marrow and spleen cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated normal BALB/c (same party) or lethally irradiated normal C3H (H-2(k), third party) mice. Although 10 of 10 same-party recipients survived more than 100 days without any signs of GVHD, 10 of 10 third-party C3H recipients died of GVHD within 40 days. Further studies of PG27 in the murine BCL1 leukemia/lymphoma model demonstrated that animals treated with PG27 partially retained the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect of the graft without GVHD. These results suggest that treatment with PG27 induces host-specific tolerance and retains the GVL effect of allogeneic marrow grafts. (Blood. 2000;95:705-710)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the basis of a comprehensive analysis of 308 B-cell neoplasms, we (1) expand the spectrum of tumors associated with BCL-6 mutations; (2) corroborate the notion that mutations cluster with GC and post-GC B-cell neoplasms; and (3) identify heterogeneous mutation frequency among B-lineage diffuse large cell lymphoma (B-DLCL) subsets. Mutations are virtually absent in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P <.001) and mantle cell lymphoma (P <.05), whereas they occur frequently in GC or post-GC neoplasms, including lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, MALT lymphomas, B-DLCL and Burkitt lymphoma. Among B-DLCL, mutations occur frequently in systemic nodal B-DLCL, primary extranodal B-DLCL, CD5(+) B-DLCL, CD30(+) B-DLCL, and primary splenic B-DLCL, suggesting a similar histogenesis of these B-DLCL subsets. Conversely, mutations are rare in primary mediastinal B-DLCL with sclerosis (10.0%; P <.01), supporting a distinct histogenesis for this lymphoma. Longitudinal follow-up of B-DLCL transformed from follicular lymphoma shows that they BCL-6 mutations may accumulate during histologic progression. Mutations also occur in some B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias, small lymphocytic lymphomas, and hairy cell leukemias, consistent with the hypothesis that a fraction of these lymphoproliferations are related to GC-like cells. Finally, the molecular pattern of 193 mutational events reinforces the hypothesis that mutations of BCL-6 and immunoglobulin genes are caused by similar mechanisms.

To investigate the potential involvement of N-RAS gene mutations in the predisposition to leukemic evolution, a subset of patients at potentially increased risk for clonal disease was selected based on evidence of existing clonal evolution. Nine patients showed a monoclonal pattern of X-chromosome inactivation, 18 demonstrated a PNH clone, and in 3 MDS developed during the course of this study. No mutations were detected during the aplastic phase of disease; 2 of 3 patients with MDS after AA also showed no mutations. However, in 1 patient in whom the disease transformed from AA/PNH to MDS, a mutation of GGT --> GAT at N-RAS codon 13 became detectable, whereas the PNH mutation disappeared. The authors conclude that N-RAS mutations are not an early event preceding transformation of AA or AA/PNH to leukemia. In a subset of patients, RAS mutations may occur at the time of evolution to MDS, but preexisting RAS mutations do not explain the propensity of AA to leukemogenesis. Although PNH is also associated with leukemia, this may arise in the non-PNH cells, indicating that PIG-A gene mutation is not per se oncogenic. (Blood. 2000;95:646-650)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapy with 13-cis retinoic acid or low-dose chemotherapy can induce some responses, but neither mode is curative. Stem cell transplantation can produce lasting remissions but is hampered by high rates of relapse. The pathogenesis of JMML involves deregulated cytokine signal transduction through the Ras signaling pathway, with resultant selective hypersensitivity of JMML cells to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). A JMML mouse model, achieved through homozygous deletion of the neurofibromatosis gene, confirmed the involvement of deregulated Ras in JMML pathogenesis. With this pathogenetic knowledge, mechanism-based treatments are now being developed and tested. Ras is critically dependent on a prenylation reaction for its signal transduction abilities. Farnesyltransferase inhibitors are compounds that were developed specifically to block the prenylation of Ras. Two of these compounds, L-739,749 and L-744, 832, were tested for their ability to inhibit spontaneous JMML granulocyte-macrophage colony growth. Within a dose range of 1 to 10 micromol/L, each compound demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of JMML colony growth. An age-matched patient with a different disease and GM-CSF-stimulated normal adult marrow cells also demonstrated dose-dependent inhibitory effects on colony growth, but they were far less sensitive to these compounds than JMML hematopoietic progenitors. Even if the addition of L-739,749 were delayed for 5 days, significant inhibitory effects would still show in JMML cultures. These results demonstrate that a putative Ras-blocking compound can have significant growth inhibitory effects in vitro, perhaps indicating a potential treatment for JMML.

The chemokine receptor CXCR3 has been previously shown to be widely expressed on activated T cells and to mediate T-cell chemotaxis on binding to various ligands, including Mig, IP-10, and ITAC. By using immunohistochemical and flow cytometric analysis, we report that CXCR3 is also expressed on a subset of peripheral blood B cells and in distinct subtypes of B-cell lymphoma. CXCR3 immunohistochemical or flow cytometric expression was seen in 37 of 39 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (diffusely positive in 33 cases), whereas mantle cell lymphoma (30 cases), follicular lymphoma (27 cases), and small noncleaved cell lymphoma (8 cases) were negative in all but 2 cases. Strong CXCR3 expression was also seen in splenic marginal zone lymphoma (14 of 14 cases) and in the monocytoid and plasmacytic cells in extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (15 of 16 cases). This differential expression of CXCR3 in B-cell tumors contrasts with that of another B-cell-associated chemokine receptor, BLR1/CXCR5, which we show here is expressed on all types of B-cell lymphoma tested. We also report that the CXCR3 ligand, Mig, is coexpressed on tumor cells in many cases of CLL/SLL (10 of 13 cases examined) with Mig expression less frequently seen in other B-cell lymphoma subtypes.

The authors report that the binding of sVCAM-1 to alpha4 integrin-bearing cells is a dynamically regulated, active cellular process. Binding of recombinant sVCAM-1 to alpha4 integrins on peripheral blood mononuclear cells was cell-type specific. Circulating CD16+ NK cells constitutively bound sVCAM-1 with high affinity, whereas a subpopulation of T-lymphocytes, primarily CD45RO+ (memory), bound sVCAM-1 only after phorbol ester stimulation. sVCAM-1 binding to homogenous stable cell lines was also cell-type specific, and required active cellular processes because it was blocked by the inhibition of ATP synthesis and by Fas-induced apoptosis. Indeed, the loss of high-affinity VCAM-1 binding was an early event in apoptosis. Furthermore, an H-Ras/Raf-initiated signaling pathway also suppressed sVCAM-1 binding to alpha4beta1 integrins. Collectively, these results showed that the capacity of alpha4 integrins to bind VCAM-1 is actively regulated and that this regulation may control alpha4 integrin-dependent cellular functions.

We used stroma-supported cultures of human myeloid cells to assess the effects of CD38 ligation on myeloid differentiation. In 8 experiments with CD34(+ )cells purified from normal bone marrow or cord blood, flow cytometry used with antibodies to CD34 and myeloperoxidase (MPO) identified 4 cell populations after 7 days of culture. Addition of anti-CD38 (T16) to the cultures induced a profound reduction of the most mature (CD34(-)MPO(++)) cell population, which includes promyelocytes, myelocytes and metamyelocytes; mean (+/- SD) cell recovery was 12.8% +/- 9.8% of that in parallel cultures with an isotype-matched control antibody. The suppressive effect of CD38 ligation on phenotypically more immature normal cells was inconsistent but generally less pronounced. Recovery of CD34(++)MPO(-) cells was 63.3% +/- 24.4%, recovery of CD34([+/-] )MPO(- )cells was 95.3% +/- 35.1%, and recovery of CD34(-)MPO(+) cells was 42.0% +/- 18.7% of that in control cultures. However, anti-CD38 suppressed recovery of cells obtained from 6 patients with CD38(+) acute myeloid leukemia; after 7-day cultures, cell recovery was 25.2% +/- 21.7% of that in control cultures. Cell recovery was also reduced by F(ab')(2) or Fab fragments of anti-CD38. CD38 ligation dramatically suppressed recovery of murine 32D myeloid cells transfected with human CD38 and cocultured with stroma (3.8% +/- 7.3%; n = 7). CD38 ligation of CD38( + )32D cells also induced cell aggregation, tyrosine kinase activity, and Ca(++) influx. We conclude that CD38 mediates signals that culminate in suppression of myeloid cell growth and survival.

However, these mice remain healthy and show no signs of spontaneous hemorrhage, implying that TPO-independent mechanisms for platelet production exist and are sufficient for hemostasis. To investigate the roles of cytokines that act through the gp130 signaling chain in the residual platelet production of mpl (-/-) mice, mpl (-/-)IL-6(-/-), mpl(-/-)LIF(-/-), and mpl(-/-)IL-11Ralpha(-/-) double-mutant mice were generated. In each of these compound mutants, the number of circulating platelets was no lower than that observed in mice lacking only the c-mpl gene. Moreover, the deficits in the numbers of megakaryocytes and megakaryocyte progenitor cells in the bone marrow and spleen were no further exacerbated in mpl(-/-)IL-6(-/-), mpl(-/-)LIF(-/-), or mpl(-/-)IL-11Ralpha(-/-) double-mutant mice compared with those in Mpl-deficient animals. In single IL-6(-/-), LIF(-/-), and IL-11Ralpha(-/-) mutant mice, platelet production was normal. These data establish that, as single regulators, IL-6, IL-11, and LIF have no essential role in normal steady-state megakaryocytopoiesis, and are not required for the residual megakaryocyte and platelet production seen in the c-mpl(-/-) mouse.

From April 1990 to March 1995, 105 evaluable patients, 1.1 to 16.4 years of age, with T-LBL were enrolled in study NHL-BFM 90 (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster 90). They received an 8-drug induction over 9 weeks followed by an 8-week consolidation including methotrexate (MTX) 5 g/m(2) x 4. Patients with stage I (n = 2) and II (n = 2) continued with maintenance therapy (6-mercaptopurine daily and MTX weekly, both orally) until a total therapy duration of 24 months. Patients with stage III (n = 82) and IV (n = 19) received an 8-drug intensification over 7 weeks and cranial radiotherapy (12 Gy for prophylaxis) after consolidation, followed by maintenance. Residual tumor after induction had to be resected. Patients received intensified chemotherapy if tumor regression on day 33 of induction was less than 70% or when vital residual tumor was present after the complete induction phase. With a median follow-up of 4.5 years, the estimated event-free survival at 5 years is 90% (95% confidence interval, 82%-100%). Events were 1 early death, 8 tumor failures, and 1 secondary acute myeloid leukemia. A total of 101 patients were evaluable for the speed of tumor response. Two patients received intensified therapy due to less than 70% tumor regression on day 33. Of 19 patients with tumor residues after induction, 2 relapsed as compared to 4 of 80 patients with complete tumor regression. We conclude that, with intensive ALL-type chemotherapy including moderate cumulative doses of anthracyclines 240 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide (3 g/m(2)) and moderate-dose prophylactic cranial irradiation but no local radiotherapy, an event-free survival rate of 90% can be achieved in childhood T-LBL.

IFN-alpha is now often used as initial therapy for CML, before donor availability is known. Because identifying potential donors can take several weeks to months, it is important to know whether IFN-alpha adversely affects outcome of a subsequent BMT. If it does, initiation of IFN-alpha therapy might be delayed until donor availability is determined and avoided in patients for whom BMT is planned. We studied 873 patients who received HLA-identical sibling BMT for chronic-phase CML in 153 centers participating in the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry. The object was to compare outcome in the 664 who received only hydroxyurea before BMT with outcome in the 209 who received IFN-alpha with or without hydroxyurea. The median duration of IFN-alpha therapy was 2 months (range, 1 to 39 months). Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to compare engraftment, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), nonrelapse mortality, relapse, survival, and leukemia-free survival after adjustment for other prognostic variables. We found a higher risk of nonengraftment among patients given IFN-alpha than among those given hydroxyurea alone (2% versus 0.2%; P = 0.01). Patients who received IFN-alpha had a lower risk of relapse (relative risk, 0.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.70). Probabilities of GVHD, nonrelapse mortality, survival, and leukemia-free survival were similar in the two treatment groups. These results suggest that a short course of IFN-alpha does not adversely affect survival after a subsequent HLA-identical sibling BMT for chronic-phase CML.

Samples from bone marrow aspirates or peripheral blood or both were analyzed by conventional cytogenetics, Southern blot, interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR). In all patients, FISH detected 1% to 12% nuclei with a BCR-ABL fusion gene, whereas Q-RT-PCR experiments were negative or weakly positive. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the BCR-ABL genomic rearrangement persists unexpressed in nonproliferating cells whatever the treatment (IFN-alpha or BMT). These data point to the need for follow-up of CML patients in CCR over an extensive period at the DNA level (FISH) to evaluate the residual disease and at the RNA level (Q-RT-PCR) to estimate the risk of relapse.

To more fully characterize the molecular features of PML-RARalpha V-type transcripts and to determine whether V-form APL patients have a distinct clinical presentation or prognosis, we analyzed 18 adult V-form APL patients enrolled on Intergroup protocol 0129 (INT-0129).

They are rare manifestations of acute and chronic leukemias and can occasionally precede the development of systemic disease by weeks to years. Spinal complications of chloromas, such as cord compression secondary to epidural tumor or cauda equina syndrome, have been described but are uncommon. METHODS: We present eight new cases of spinal chloroma. Three patients displayed significant motor deficit in the form of paraparesis or paraplegia. All patients complained of lower back pain, with other complaints including generalized pain, abdominal pain, numbness and pain in the lower extremities and perianal region, and poor appetite. The average age of the patients was 37 years. Treatment strategies included surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Three patients underwent surgical decompression. Six patients received chemotherapy, and six patients received radiotherapy at doses of 2000 to 3000 cGy in up to 30 fractions. RESULTS: Patient survival ranged from 18 days to 9.5 years after diagnosis. A review of the previously reported cases of granulocytic sarcoma in addition to our new cases reveals that the most effective treatment is multimodality therapy coupled with early diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Increased awareness of this entity will facilitate early diagnosis and minimize potentially preventable neurological morbidity.",,,,41,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, RNase protection assays, transfection of cDNAs into FPGS-deficient cells, and kinetic analysis of recombinant enzymes expressed in insect cells, it was determined that the species of active FPGS in mouse liver and kidney was different from that in mouse tumor cells, bone marrow, and intestine. The NH2-terminal peptide of hepatic enzyme contained 18 amino acids not found in enzyme from dividing tissues, and the specificity of the two isoforms for antifolates also differed, suggesting different architecture of the active sites. In most tissues, the expression of one isozyme or the other was an all-or-nothing event.

All complexes are potent cytotoxic agents against the wild type cell line. Only BBR3464 shows enhanced activity against the cisplatin-resistant cell line following a brief exposure. This enhanced activity is attributable, in part, to preserved accumulation, which contrasts with diminished accumulation of cisplatin and both dinuclear platinum complexes. The cisplatin-resistant cell line is relatively tolerant of DNA adducts induced by both cisplatin and BBR3464, but BBR3464 is much less affected. All complexes induce DNA interstrand cross-links. Di/trinuclear complex-induced interstrand cross-linking peaks early, suggesting rapid genomic access and interaction. Subsequent decay suggests susceptibility to DNA repair mechanisms. Peak and area-under-the-curve values for interstrand cross-linking among the complexes correlate poorly with cytotoxic effects, especially in the cisplatin-resistant cell line. This suggests that all interstrand cross-linking adducts are not equal in their cytotoxic effect, or other, non-interstrand cross-linking adducts are significant. BBR3464 has been selected for clinical development largely on the basis of results from in vivo activity and toxicity studies. These results show BBR3464 to have unique properties in the context of acquired cisplatin-resistance that enhance its candidacy as a potential anticancer agent.",,,,,,,['R01-CA78754/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Besides murine L1210 cell lines sensitive (/0) and resistant (/DDP) to cisplatin, the efficacy of the compounds in a cell line rendered resistant to BBR3464 (/3464) was examined. Finally, to examine possible uptake pathways of these novel charged complexes, cytotoxicity in a cell line resistant to the polyamine synthesis inhibitor, methylglyoxal-bis(guanylhydrazone) (/MGBG), was studied. Cytotoxicity profiles of BBR3571 most closely matched that of BBR3464. Both agents showed significantly reduced cytotoxicity in L1210/ BBR3464. The cytotoxicity of neither agent was affected by the polyamine uptake-deficient cell line and indeed both complexes showed significantly enhanced cytotoxicity in L1210/MGBG relative to wild-type L1210/0. The cellular uptake of both BBR3464 and BBR3571 was enhanced in L1210/DDP. These studies suggest that the chemical feature of a diamine linker containing an internal charge contributes significantly to the anticancer profiles of both the trinuclear platinum complex, BBR3464, which incorporates a charged platinum into a diamine linker, and the dinuclear platinum complex, BBR3571, which incorporates only a naturally occurring polyamine as diamine linker.",,,,,,,['R01-CA78754/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

In agreement with the n-octanol/saline partition ratios, intracellular platinum content (and DNA platination) after a 2-h exposure to equimolar drug concentrations was in the order 1 > 2 >> cisplatin, thus indicating that substitution of imminoethers for ammines determines a major lipophilicity and cellular uptake of the platinum drug.

Epidemiological evidence indicates a relationship between exposure to benzene and the occurrence of acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia in humans. Working groups convened by IARC and other organizations have therefore judged that there is sufficient evidence for classifying benzene as a human carcinogen. Despite much research, including numerous studies in animals, the detailed mechanism of the carcinogenicity of benzene is unknown. The significant differences in the responses of rodents and humans to benzene are not understood. Benzene forms many metabolites, some of which are reactive towards biomolecules, but the metabolite(s) responsible for the induction of leukaemia is unknown. Candidate metabolites, either singly or in combination, include epoxides, oxepins, quinones and aldehydes, all of which are reactive towards proteins and DNA. Our studies on muconaldehydes and benzene oxide-oxepin are discussed in this context. The significance of DNA adduct formation in respect of human leukaemia is uncertain. The overall reactivity of benzene towards DNA has been shown to be very low in experimental animals, although dose-related reactivity of metabolites with DNA was observed. The lack of significant DNA reactivity is reflected in the lack of activity of benzene in short-term tests for genotoxicity; however, benzene causes oxidative stress, which can be detected as oxidative damage to DNA. Mechanisms other than DNA damage may play a role in benzene-related toxicity, e.g. reactions of benzene metabolites with essential enzymes such as topoisomerase II.",,,,79,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presenting features of nonsecretory myeloma are similar to those in patients with a detectable M-protein, except for the absence of renal function impairment. The response to therapy and survival of patients with nonsecretory myeloma are similar to those of patients with measurable M-protein. Immunoglobulin D myeloma represents 2% of all myelomas. Patients with IgD myeloma usually present with a small band or no evident M-spike on serum electrophoresis and heavy light-chain proteinuria. Thus, IgD myeloma can be considered a variant of Bence Jones myeloma; the presence of the IgD M-protein and the predominance of the lambda light chain are the only distinctive features. The median survival of patients with IgD myeloma is almost 2 years, with one fifth of them surviving for more than 5 years. Plasma cell leukemia is also a rare form of plasma cell dyscrasia (2% to 4% of all myelomas). The primary form accounts for 60% of the cases. In primary PCL, the constellation of adverse biologic prognostic factors in patients with advanced aggressive myeloma is already present at diagnosis. In fact, primary PCL has a more aggressive clinical presentation than MM, with a higher frequency of extramedullary involvement, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercalcemia, and renal failure. Treatment with a single alkylating agent plus prednisone is not appropriate. Combination chemotherapy with VAD, cyclophosphamide and etoposide, or VCMP/VBAP is a better initial option.

It has been demonstrated that phospholipase C specific for inositol lipids (PLC) is one of the main steps of the inositol lipid cycle. The PLC beta family, and especially type beta 1, has given rise to considerable interest since, due to their common COOH-terminus they show nuclear localisation in addition to that at the plasma membrane. It is well established that an autonomous intranuclear inositide cycle exists, and that this cycle is endowed with conventional lipid kinases, phosphatases and PLCs. Among this latter the beta 1 type undergoes stimulation or inhibition under different stimuli and this implicates the beta 1 isoform as a key enzyme for mitogen-activated cell growth as well as for differentiation.

We have previously described a downstream initiation of tal-1 transcription specifically associated with a subset of T cell leukemias that leads to the production of NH(2)-truncated TAL-1 proteins. In this study, we characterize the human promoter (promoter IV), embedded within a GC-rich region in exon IV, responsible for this transcriptional activity. The restriction of promoter IV usage is assured by a novel silencer element in the 3'-untranslated region of the human gene that represses its activity in erythroid but not in T cells. The silencer activity is mediated through binding of a tissue-specific nuclear factor to a novel protein recognition motif (designated tal-RE) in the silencer. Mutation of a single residue within the tal-RE abolishes both specific protein binding and silencing activity. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the tal-1 promoter IV is actively repressed in cells of the erythro-megakaryocytic lineage and that this repression is released in leukemic T cells, resulting in the expression of the tal-1 truncated transcript.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using electrophysiological measurements, we have shown that beta-purothionin from wheat flour can form cation-selective ion channels in artificial lipid bilayer membranes and in the plasmalemma of rat hippocampal neurons.

RT-PCR and nuclear run-on assays revealed that the expression of MDR1 mRNA is regulated by increased transcriptional initiation in HL60/VCR cells. Transient transfections with a 241 bp MDR1 promoter (spanning the -198 to +43 region) DNA fragment/pGL3-basic plasmid construct resulted in about 6-fold increased luciferase activity in HL60/VCR but not in HL60 cells. Moreover, ds CAAT-oligomer from the MDR1 promoter cloned upstream of the SV-40 promoter in the pGL3-promoter plasmid caused about a 7-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with plasmid constructs containing CAAT-deleted, GC-box, and nonspecific oligomers in HL60/VCR transfectants. These results were confirmed by transfecting HL60/VCR cells with the pGL3-basic plasmid containing a 237 bp mutated MDR1 proximal promoter lacking the CAAT sequence in which no change in luciferase activity was observed. However, a 5-6-fold increase in luciferase activity was measured in these cells when transfected with the wt MDR1 promoter DNA/pGL3-basic plasmid constructs. These results show that the CAAT-region is involved in upregulating the MDR1 promoter in HL60/VCR cells. A nuclear factor binding to the CAAT-region of the MDR1 promoter specifically was detected in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) in HL60/VCR but not in HL60 extracts. Two MDR1 promoter-associated polypeptides with molecular masses of about 130 and 162 kDa were identified in HL60/VCR cells by electroelution, specific DNA-affinity chromatography, and silver staining. Interestingly, cross-linking and Southwestern analysis indicate that only the 130 kDa protein, which we refer to as MDR1-promoter enhancing factor 1 (MEF1), has a strong DNA-binding ability, interacting with the 5'-GTCAATCC-3' element of the MDR1 promoter, as determined by DNase I protection assay. These data reveal that MEF1 upregulates the MDR1 promoter activity.",,,,,,,['CA 56078/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Combined stimulation with estradiol-17beta and menaquinone 4 (MK4), homologue of vitamin K2, showed a remarkable increase of total TM antigen level only in U937 cells among these leukemic cell lines, whereas a single treatment of each agent showed a modest or a moderate increase. A synergistic effect of cotreatment with estradiol-17beta and MK4 was observed in an optimum concentration of 1.0 micromol of estradiol-17beta and 1.0 micromol of MK4. Estrogen receptors were detected only in U937 cells among these cell lines, and the competitive assay with an antiestrogenic agent showed a suppression on TM expression in a dose-dependent manner. In the mean time, concerning expression of TF antigens, if at all, only a very slight decrease was observed by costimulation with estradiol-17beta and MK4 in U937 and NB4 cells, whereas all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) showed a remarkable decrease in surface TF antigen levels in NB4 cells and also a modest decrease in U937 cells.

Initial analysis of chemokine receptors has demonstrated unique receptor events in different cell types, indicating the importance of investigating CCR-3 events in eosinophilic cell lines. We now report that the eosinophilic cell line, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) 14.3D10, expresses eosinophil granule proteins and eotaxin, but has no detectable expression of eosinophil chemokine receptors. Treatment of the cell line with butyric acid and IL-5 results in a dose-dependent synergistic induction of CCR-3 and, to a lesser extent, CCR-1 and CCR-5. Interestingly, using a luciferase reporter construct under the control of the hCCR-3 promoter, the uninduced and induced cells display high, but comparable, levels of promoter activity. Differentiated AML cells developed enhanced functional activation, as indicated by adhesion to respiratory epithelial cells and chemokine-induced transepithelial migration. Chemokine signaling did not inhibit adenylate cyclase activity even though calcium transients were blocked by pertussis toxin. Additionally, chemokine-induced calcium transients were inhibited by pretreatment with PMA, but not forskolin. Eotaxin treatment of differentiated AML cells resulted in marked down-modulation of CCR-3 expression for at least 18 h. Receptor internalization was not dependent upon chronic ligand exposure and was not accompanied by receptor degradation. Thus, CCR-3 is a late differentiation marker on AML cells and uses a signal transduction pathway involving rapid and prolonged receptor internalization, calcium transients inhibitable by protein kinase C but not protein kinase A, and the paradoxical lack of inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we demonstrate that binding of high-affinity alpha 4 beta 1 integrins to VCAM-1 strengthens alpha L beta 2 integrin-mediated adhesion. The strength of adhesion of Jurkat cells, a human leukemia T cell line, or MnCl2-treated peripheral blood T cells to immobilized chimeric human VCAM-1/Fc, ICAM-1/Fc, or both was quantified using parallel plate flow chamber leukocyte detachment assays in which shear stress was increased incrementally (0.5-30 dynes/cm2). The strength of adhesion to VCAM-1 plus ICAM-1, or to a 40-kDa fragment of fibronectin containing the CS-1 exon plus ICAM-1, was greater than the sum of adhesion to each molecule alone. Treatment of Jurkat or blood T cells with soluble cross-linked VCAM-1/Fc or HP2/1, a mAb to alpha 4, significantly increased adhesion to ICAM-1. These treatments induced clustering of alpha L beta 2 integrins, but not the high-affinity beta 2 integrin epitope recognized by mAb 24. Up-regulated adhesion to ICAM-1 was abolished by cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of cytoskeletal rearrangement. Taken together, our data suggest that the binding of VCAM-1 or fibronectin to alpha 4 beta 1 integrins initiates a signaling pathway that increases beta 2 integrin avidity but not affinity. A role for the cytoskeleton is implicated in this process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the presence of external Ca2+, vanadium compounds produced sustained or oscillatory Ca2+ elevations; in nominally Ca2+-free medium, a transient Ca2+ rise was generated. Vanadate-induced Ca2+ signaling was blocked by heparin, a competitive inhibitor of the 1,4, 5-inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptor, suggesting that Ca2+ influx is secondary to depletion of IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores. In Jurkat T cells, vanadate also activated the Ca2+-dependent transcription factor, NF-AT. Intracellular dialysis with vanadate activated Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels with kinetics comparable to those of dialysis with IP3. Neither phosphatase inhibitors nor nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analogues modified CRAC channel activation. The action of vanadate, but not IP3, was prevented by the thiol-reducing agent DTT. In addition, the activation of CRAC channels by vanadate was mimicked by the thiol-oxidizing agent chloramine T. These results suggest that vanadate enhances Ca2+ signaling via thiol oxidation of a proximal element in the signal transduction cascade.",,,,,,,"['5T32CA09054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM41514/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS14609/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Sequencing of the viruses derived from the D17 cell lines revealed second-site changes within the env gene. Changes were detected in the receptor binding domain, the proline-rich region, the C terminus of SU, and the ectodomain of TM. Second-site changes were subcloned into the parental DNA, singly and in combination, and tested for viability. All viruses had maintained their original cloned mutations and junctions. Reconstruction and passage of AE7 or AE6 virus with single point mutations recovered the additional second-site changes identified in the parental population. The AE5 isolate required changes in the VRA, the VRC, the VRB-hinge region, and the C terminus of SU for efficient infection.

In the present study we investigated the translational features of the 5' leader of MLV subgenomic RNA (env RNA) encoding the Env polyprotein precursor. When the env leader was inserted between two genes, such as lacZ and the neomycin resistance cassette, in a dicistronic vector, it allowed IRES-dependent translation of the 3' cistron in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system and in murine cells. The drug rapamycin and the foot-and-mouth disease virus L protease, known to inhibit cap-dependent translation, caused an enhancement of the translation driven by the env leader sequence, consistent with an IRES activity promoting Env expression.

In contrast, adenoviruses (Ad) can efficiently infect nondividing cells. This property may be due to the presence of multiple nuclear translocation signals in a number of Ad proteins, which are associated with the incoming viral genomes. Of particular interest is the Ad preterminal protein (pTP), which binds alone or in complex with the Ad polymerase to specific sequences in the Ad inverted terminal repeat. The goal of this study was to test whether coexpression of pTP with retroviral DNA carrying pTP-binding sites would facilitate nuclear import of the viral preintegration complex and transduction of quiescent cells. In preliminary experiments, we demonstrated that the karyophylic pTP can coimport plasmid DNA into the nuclei of growth-arrested cells. Retroviral transduction studies were performed with G(1)/S-arrested LTA cells or stationary-phase human primary fibroblasts. These studies demonstrated that pTP or pTP-Ad polymerase conferred nuclear import of retroviral DNA upon arrested cells when the retrovirus vector contained the corresponding binding motifs. However, pTP-mediated nuclear translocation of MoMLV DNA in nondividing cells was not sufficient for stable transduction.

By use of a forced recombination approach based on single-cycle transfer of Akv murine leukemia virus-based vectors harboring defective primer binding site sequences, we now report that modifications of the kissing-loop structure, ranging from a deletion of the entire sequence to introduction of a single point mutation in the loop motif, significantly disturb site specificity of recombination within the highly structured 5' leader region. In addition, we find that an intact kissing-loop sequence favors optimal RNA encapsidation and vector transduction.

First identified in a myeloid leukemia cell line, immunohistological reactivity with anti-CD34 antibodies is also encountered in a histologically diverse subset of nonhematolymphoid neoplasms including angiosarcoma, solitary fibrous tumors, epithelioid sarcomas, spindle cell lipomas, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, and myofibroblastomas. Immunohistological reactivity for CD34 in hematopoietic stem cells and endothelial cells has been shown to correspond to the expression of the CD34 protein. With the exception of gastrointestinal stromal tumors, CD34 protein expression has not been investigated in other CD34 immunohistologically reactive nonhematolymphoid neoplasms. We undertook this study to examine whether the observed reactivity for anti-CD34 antibodies in apparently unrelated tumors is due to the expression of the same protein or whether shared epitopes elaborated by other proteins could account for this reactivity. Immunoblot analyses with anti-CD34 antibodies of six different CD34 immunohistologically reactive lesions show the same approximately 110-kd molecular weight protein. In addition, two cases of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans show double bands at approximately 110 kd. Laser-capture microdissection of CD34 immunohistologically reactive epithelioid sarcoma and nonreactive epidermal cells illustrates that this reactivity is specific to tumor cells. These results show that the observed immunohistological reactivity with anti-CD34 antibodies is due to the expression of the CD34 protein and not to shared epitopes on unrelated proteins.",,PMC1868614,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we present evidence that nuclear extracts from staurosporine-treated cells elicit DNase II activity that is not detected in nuclear extracts from cisplatin-treated cells. This activity correlates with the accumulation of two nuclear proteins (70 and 30 kDa) which are detected by an anti-L-DNase II antibody. Partial purification of this DNase II activity suggests that the 30-kDa protein could be the nuclease responsible for staurosporine-induced DNA fragmentation. The 70-kDa protein is also recognized by an anti-elastase antibody, suggesting that it carries residues belonging to both L-DNase II and elastase. Since previous findings showed that L-DNase II was generated from the leukocyte inhibitor of elastase, we propose that the 70-kDa protein results from an SDS-stable association between these two proteins and is translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during staurosporine-induced apoptosis.",,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In osteoarthritis (OA), other cytokines are believed to play a role by interacting with TNF-alpha. Using OA synovial fibroblasts, we investigated the effects of interleukin 8 (IL-8), leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and IL-11 on the level of TNF-alpha-induced PGE(2), and their impact on the TNF-alpha-induced cellular signalling cascades including the TNF-receptor (TNF-R), soluble TNF-R (TNF-sR), cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and the transcription factors NF-kappaB, C/EBP, CREB and AP-1.IL-8 increased in a synergistic manner (282% at 5 ng/ml) and LIF in an additive fashion (69% at 50 ng/ml) the TNF-alpha-induced PGE(2)release, while IL-11 reduced it (52% at 5 ng/ml). IL-8 (5 ng/ml) and LIF (50 ng/ml) alone upregulated (30%) the TNF-R binding level, but significantly downregulated the TNF-alpha-induced levels (P<0.007 and P<0.004, respectively) and the TNF-sR55 level. In contrast, IL-11 reduced the basal level by 18% (P<0.005) and the TNF-alpha-induced level of TNF-R by 51% (P<0.01) as well as decreasing both TNF-sR55 and TNF-sR75. The COX-2 synthesis level was increased by IL-8 and LIF under TNF-alpha treatment but downregulated by IL-11. IL-8 and LIF either alone or under TNF-alpha treatment increased the cPLA2 synthesis, while IL-11 decreased the level under both conditions. Interestingly, IL-8 induced in a synergistic manner and LIF in an additive fashion, the level of cPLA2 activity. IL-8 and LIF had no effect on the TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB accumulation, while IL-11 significantly decreased it (P<0. 02). All three cytokines inhibited TNF-alpha-induced C/EBP, but no true effect was noted for AP-1 and CREB in the presence of TNF-alpha. These results indicate that IL-8 synergizes and LIF potentiates the TNF-alpha PGE(2)effect which appears to be mediated mostly by increasing cPLA2 activity level. On the other hand, IL-11 alone had no effect on the PGE(2)release, but in conjunction with TNF-alpha, this cytokine showed anti-inflammatory properties. This study provides a rational foundation to develop therapeutic strategies for the treatment of OA by shedding light on the mechanisms of action of three prominent cytokines at work in articular joint tissues.",,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their action was accompanied by malondialdehyde formation, and was partly prevented by desferrioxamine and the antioxidant N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylene diamine. This points to a prooxidant character of their cytotoxicity. A quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) has been obtained to describe the cytotoxicity of 13 polyphenolic antioxidants belonging to three different groups (flavonoids, derivatives of gallic and caffeic acid): log cL50 (microM) = (2.7829+/-0.2339)+(1.2734+/-0.4715) Ep/2 (V)-(0.3438+/-0.0582) log P (r2 = 0.8129), where cL50 represents the concentration for 50% cell survival, Ep/2 represents the voltammetric midpoint potential, and P represents the octanol/water partition coefficient. Analogous QSARs were obtained using enthalpies of single-electron oxidation of these compounds, obtained by quantum-mechanical calculations.

We investigated the relation between all childhood cancer and exposure to power-frequency magnetic fields. METHODS: The UK Childhood Cancer Study was a population case-control study covering the whole of England, Wales, and Scotland. All children with a confirmed malignant disorder were potentially eligible. For each case, we matched two controls on date of birth and sex, randomly chosen from the list of the Family Health Services Authority in England and Wales or Health Board in Scotland. In the main study, 3838 cases and 7629 controls were interviewed. The EMF part of the study included only one control per case, and household EMF measurements and school measurements where relevant were taken on 2226 matched pairs. These measurements, adjusted for historical line load and appliance fields, were used to estimate average exposure in the year before the date of diagnosis, or an equivalent date for controls. Analyses were by conditional logistic regression, incorporating a census-derived deprivation index used as a measure of socioeconomic status. FINDINGS: For children with mean exposures of more than 0.2 microT compared with children with mean exposures of less than 0-1 microT, the adjusted odds ratios were 0.92 (95% CI 0.47-1.79) for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, 0.90 (0.49-1.63) for all leukaemia, 0.46 (0.11-1.86) for central-nervous-system tumours, 0.97 (0.46-2.05) for other malignant disease, and 0.87 (0.56-1.35) for all malignant disease combined. Higher exposures (>0.4 microT) were recorded for only 17 (<0.4%) individuals (eight cases, nine controls). INTERPRETATION: This study provides no evidence that exposure to magnetic fields associated with the electricity supply in the UK increases risks for childhood leukaemia, cancers of the central nervous system, or any other childhood cancer.",,,,,,,,['Lancet. 1999 Dec 4;354(9194):1918-9.

METHOD: The effect of the wind in the absence of electric fields was calculated using the Reynolds Analogy between heat and mass transfer. The effect of the electric field was shown to be large compared with that of turbulence. A 'capture radius' due to the field was then estimated and charged 218Po particles blown into this region were assumed to be captured. RESULTS: The deposition ratio was proportional to gammaV0.4E0(0.67), where gamma = charged fraction of 218Po, V = velocity and E0 = surface electric field. With the charged fraction ranging from 0.9% to 3.2%, a surface field on 280 kV m(-1) and a wind speed of 3 m s(-1), the deposition ratio ranged from 3.4 to 9.3. The surface field is several orders of magnitude higher than the average personal exposures that have been measured in epidemiological studies and the effect does not appear to be of epidemiological significance. At low velocities, the predictions of this model are in agreement with the measurements of Henshaw et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The behaviour of aerosols in outdoor air including those carrying 222Rn decay products was modelled theoretically in the presence of an AC field. TASTRAK alpha-particle spectroscopy was used to characterize 218Po and 214Po aerosols outdoors. Sampling points were chosen along a line at right angles up to 200 m from a number of high voltage power (transmission) lines. Each sampling point comprised an arrangement of mutually orthogonal TASTRAK detectors. Exposures were carried out at different power line locations in various weather conditions. RESULTS: The model predicts a two- to three-fold increase in deposition of aerosols on spherical surfaces mimicking the human head under high voltage power lines. Experimental measurements using detectors mounted on grounded metal spheres showed an enhanced deposition of both 218Po and 214Po aerosols. Enhanced 218Po deposition on 400 kV lines ranged from 1.96+/-0.15 to 2.86+/-0.32. Enhanced 214Po deposition on 275 kV and 132 kV lines were 1.43+/-0.07 and 1.11+/-0.21, respectively, where the latter value was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The observations demonstrate a mode of increased exposure to pollutant aerosols under high voltage power lines by increased deposition on the body. The total (indoor + outdoor) 218Po and 214Po dose to the basal layer of facial skin is estimated to be increased by between 1.2 and 2.0 for 10% of time spent outdoors under high voltage power lines.",,,,,,,,['Int J Radiat Biol. 2000 Dec;76(12):1685-91.

This rare response is demonstrated for the first time with human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line. The apoptosis induced by G-CSF or IL-6 was not preceded by terminal differentiation characterized by morphological maturation, capability to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium, or surface CD11b expression. Interestingly, Western blot analysis revealed that the stimulation of UF-1 with either G-CSF or IL-6 resulted in excessive activation of both signal transducer and activator of transcription 3alpha (Stat3alpha) and Stat3beta. Furthermore, an additional 18 kDa Bax-related protein was expressed by the stimulation of G-CSF or IL-6, while Bcl-2 and Bcl-X proteins remained unchanged.

Abnormal megakaryopoiesis is a frequent finding in CMPD, often associated with thrombocythaemic cell counts. Recent experimental data have suggested that the c-Mpl thrombopoietin receptor, together with its ligand thrombopoietin, are not only the major physiological regulators of megakaryopoiesis and platelet production, but also play a crucial role in chronic myeloproliferation. METHODS: A total of 18 peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples obtained from patients with CMPD (chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML), n = 10; polycythaemia vera (PV), n = 6; and primary thrombocythaemia (PTH), n = 2) were analysed for c-mpl mRNA using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR). In another 20 patients (CML, n = 10; chronic megakaryocytic granulocytic myelosis (CMGM), n = 3; PV, n = 3; PTH, n = 4), we compared the number of haematopoietic progenitors expressing c-Mpl, as characterised by coexpression with the CD34 antigen, in the bone marrow using double immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: c-mpl mRNA was detected in all samples from patients with CML analysed, whereas only two of six PV and one of two PTH samples were positive (p < or = 0.008; chi 2 test). Expression of the c-mpl receptor gene was absent in healthy subjects used as controls. Similarly, an increase of c-Mpl expressing CD34 positive haematopoietic cells was detected in seven of 10 bone marrow aspirates obtained from patients with CML. Increased numbers of c-Mpl positive CD34 positive cells were found in only one of four patients with PTH, whereas in PV and CMGM the numbers of c-Mpl positive CD34 positive cells did not exceed normal values, despite thrombocythaemic cell counts. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm recent findings showing an impaired expression of the c-mpl thrombopoietin receptor gene in Philadelphia chromosome negative CMPD when compared with patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive CML. The relevance of this observation to the functional and morphological characteristics of abnormal megakaryopoiesis remains unclear. Thrombocythaemic cell counts and a mature phenotype in megakaryocytes occur frequently in Philadelphia chromosome negative CMPD but require an intact c-Mpl receptor under physiological conditions. Therefore, further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms contributing to megakaryopoiesis in CMPD disease entities with decreased c-mpl gene expression.",,PMC395689,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results for other specific neoplasms were sparse, but the available data did not suggest a strong association for any type of tumor. No clear evidence of dose response was present in the studies that addressed this issue. The results on exposure to maternal tobacco smoke before or after pregnancy are too sparse to allow a conclusion. The results on exposure to paternal tobacco smoke suggest an association with brain tumors (RR 1.22; CI, 1.05-1. 40; based on 10 studies) and lymphomas (RR 2.08; CI, 1.08-3.98; 4 studies). The data are too sparse for the other neoplasms, although the results of a few recent large studies are compatible with a weak carcinogenic effect of paternal smoke. For exposure from either maternal or paternal smoke, bias and confounding cannot yet be ruled out. Further studies are needed to confirm the hypothesis that parental tobacco smoke, from the father in particular, is a risk factor of childhood cancer. Results on the risk of lung cancer in adulthood and childhood passive smoking exposure are available from 11 studies: they do not provide evidence of an increased risk (summary RR 0.91; CI, 0.80-1.05).",,PMC1637845,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To attribute any or all health effects observed in the exposed cohort to benzene without examining other concomitant exposures is not appropriate. Although it was stated that one of the major objectives of the expanded study was to examine the effects of other risk factors, no such examination was made in any of the analyses in the expanded CAPM-NCI study. The CAPM-NCI study suffered from a number of limitations. One of the most serious limitations of the study involved the exposure estimates developed by the US NCI team. Comparing the assumptions used in the development of estimates and the exposure estimates themselves to actual data reported previously by the Chinese investigators revealed numerous inconsistencies and, in many cases, large discrepancies. It appeared that the exposure estimates were consistently lower than the actual exposure data. The so-called indirect validation conducted by the NCI team served no useful purpose, since by definition it could not validate the absolute values of the estimates. NCI was fully aware of some of the inadequacies of its exposure estimates. Although in a 1994 paper, the NCI team recognized that little confidence could be attached to the estimated (e.g., only 2% of the estimates for the time interval 1949-1959 and only 6% of the estimates prior to 1975 were rated in the high confidence category), the inadequacy of the estimates was never mentioned or discussed in any subsequent analyses or in the latest report (Hayes et al., 1998). Instead, the exposure of the workers was hailed as ""well characterized"" (Hayes et al., 1998). In conclusion both CAPM and NCI have made substantial efforts in studying the relationship between benzene exposure and various malignancies. Unfortunately, there were many inherent problems in the data as well as serious limitations in the exposure estimates.

Recently, relative risks and excess cancer mortality attributed to occupational benzene exposure have been published in collaborative studies conducted by Chinese investigators and scientists from the National Cancer Institute. The results of these studies suggest increased risk of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia at relatively low benzene concentrations and associations with cancers not previously associated with benzene exposure. These studies are potentially important due to their size and potential to more thoroughly investigate the link between benzene exposure and cancer. However, there are questions concerning the validity of exposure and dose estimates supporting relative risk characterizations in these studies. Apparent discrepancies between modeled exposure and dose estimates and sources of actual measured exposure information and clinical markers of benzene toxicity raise serious concerns questioning the reliability of relative risk and cancer associations stated in these studies.",,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],44,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified the selenoprotein thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) as a new molecular target for 1,25(OH)2D3 in monocytes during this process. In THP1 monocytic leukemia cells 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulated TrxR mRNA levels 2-4-fold by 4-8 h and enhanced TrxR activity (60%) (as measured by the dithionitrobenzole-assay) after 24 h, which declined below baseline after 96 h. The addition of 100 nM selenite enhanced (approx. 50%) basal and stimulated enzyme activity in THP1 cells. The relative stimulation by 1,25(OH)2D3 was very similar but peak levels were sustained in THP1 cells up to 48 h. Human peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) of different donors showed very low basal TrxR steady state mRNA levels which were markedly enhanced (as analyzed by Northern blotting) after 4 h of adherence to culture dishes. 1,25(OH)2D3 (100 nM) further stimulated TrxR mRNA expression (4 h, 3-fold). TrxR enzyme activity mirrored the mRNA changes. Basal activity was stimulated approx. 25% by adhesion in culture alone and was further stimulated (approximately 15%) by 1,25(OH)2D3 after 4 h. By 24 h similar results were achieved but the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 could be seen in the presence of 100 nM selenium only. The expression of TrxR and its regulation by 1,25(OH)2D3 and selenite in monocytes might be important for their induction of differentiation and maintenance of function.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The drug loaded nanoparticles were prepared using the well established emulsion polymerization process without using any modification for the hydrophilic doxorubicin drug whereas the incorporation of cyclosporin A needed to wait a moment after the polymerization reaction started. This was necessary to avoid cyclosporin A precipitation and polymer aggregation. Cyclosporin A release from the nanoparticles was rapid probably because the drug was adsorbed onto the nanoparticles surface rather than embedded into the polymeric core. Doxorubicin displayed also a burst effect but with a slower second phase probably related with the nanoparticles bioerosion rate owing to its entrapment in the polymeric network. Finally, it was shown in resistant cell culture experiments that the association of both cyclosporin A and doxorubicin within a single nanoparticle formulation elicited the most effective growth rate inhibition as compared to other combinations of both drugs while using a lower amount of polymer compared to separated nanoparticle formulations. This result was probably due to the synergistic effect achieved by combining the chemo-sensitizing compound cyclosporin A, with an effective cytotoxic drug like doxorubicin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia in remission, who developed a purely intraparenchymal cerebellar myeloblastoma with megakaryocytic differentiation. The neoplastic cells expressed the megakaryocytic markers factor VIII-related antigen and platelet glycoprotein-IIIa (CD61), and showed ultrastructural features that were indicative of megakaryocytic differentiation. Clinically, myeloblastomas of the CNS invoke a broad differential diagnosis that includes abscess, hemorrhage, and metastatic neoplasms because of their intraparenchymal location and radiologic features.

A variety of immunohistochemical markers can potentially improve the specificity and sensitivity of PC detection on routine histological sections obtained from trephine BM biopsies, but most of them are not completely satisfactory. In this study, we investigated whether the antibody CD138/B-B4, which is an optimal marker for PC detection on BM aspirates by flow cytometry, can be used successfully for the identification of PCs also on formalin-fixed, decalcified biopsies. A series of samples including normal BM [12], MM [65], monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance [44], and B-cell lymphoma of various types [94], including B-cell precursor lymphoblastic leukemia [9], lymphoplasmacytoid [17], immunoblastic [14], lymphocytic/CLL [23], hairy cell leukemia [4], large B-cell [8], mantle-cell [3], marginal zone [6] and follicular [10] lymphomas, have been investigated for CD138 expression using a sensitive immunohistochemical technique. Within the BM microenvironment, CD138 was characterized by excellent sensitivity and specificity. Virtually all normal and neoplastic PCs expressed clear-cut membrane CD138 immunostaining, whereas all other cell types did not. All cases of MM, including plasmablastic and leukemic cases, showed strong immunoreactivity. Conversely, all B-cell lymphomas, including all cases characterized by secretive features, lymphoplasmacytoid, and immunoblastic lymphomas, were completely negative. These results demonstrate that CD138 is a highly sensitive and specific marker that is useful for the rapid and precise localization of normal and neoplastic PCs on routine BM sections. In addition, because of its clear-cut cell membrane localization, CD138 can be used successfully in double-marker immunostaining reactions to evaluate precisely nuclear prognostic markers such as Ki67 and p53 in MMs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The time-dependent linear model and the piece-wise proportional hazard model (two or four intervals) take into account the variation of the risk over the entire follow-up period. METHOD: The three existing models were applied to a series of 266 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), diagnosed between 1980 and 1992 and recorded by the Registry of Hematopoietic Neoplasms in Cote d'Or, France. RESULTS: A non-proportional effect of age, period of diagnosis, whether the illness was primary or secondary and French-American-British (FAB) subtype was found significant. In particular, the effect of M2 versus M4-M5 subtypes was revealed by the non-proportional analyses, although this effect was non-significant using the Cox model. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical explanation of the variation of these effects over time is discussed, for example, relating the increase over time of the positive effect of the period of diagnosis to therapeutic improvements. Confirmation of these results on an independent data set is required.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also uncover an antagonistic relationship between the secreted factors Gremlin and BMPs required to maintain the Shh/FGF loop that regulates distal outgrowth. These proximal and distal factors have coordinated activities: Meis2 can repress distal genes, and Bmps and Hoxd genes restrict Meis2 expression to the proximal limb bud. Moreover, combinations of BMPs and AER factors are sufficient to distalize proximal limb cells.

METHODS: Expression of the MDR1, MRP and LRP genes in leukemic cells from 40 pediatric patients was quantitated using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction method. The associations of expression of these genes with age and leukocyte count, which are known as risk factors for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), were analyzed. Moreover, the associations with clinically classified risk-related groups (high-risk ALL and low-risk ALL) were also investigated. RESULTS: No positive correlations between expression of these genes and age or leukocyte count were found. The expression of these genes was not different among clinically classified risk-related groups.

Of interest, Max overexpression attenuates aberrant growth of B cells triggered by c-Myc. However, the clinical significance of Max in human lymphoid tissue remains to be clarified. In the present studies, we studied the expression of the c-Myc and Max proteins in normal lymph nodes and in childhood LL. In normal lymph nodes, c-Myc protein was expressed by the majority of cells in germinal center and marginal zone, but Max protein was expressed only by some of them. In contrast, c-Myc and Max were absent in mantle zone. Cells positive for c-Myc and Max expression in LL were 70.6 +/- 19.8% and 47.3 +/- 32.4%, respectively, determined by immunohistochemical staining using paraffin blocks from 23 cases of childhood LL.

DDA3 was expressed in multiple mouse tissues including brain, spleen, lung, kidney and testis.

The transforming activity of the v-Abl oncogene of Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) in immortal cell lines has been well studied, while the effects of v-Abl in primary fibroblasts are less clear. Here we show that v-Abl causes cell cycle arrest in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and elevated levels of both p53 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip. p53-/- or p19ARF-/- MEFs were resistant to v-Abl-induced cell cycle arrest. Although wild-type MEFs were resistant to v-Abl transforming activity, p53-/- or p19ARF-/- MEFs were susceptible. The results indicate that loss of p19ARF and p53 function plays an important role during the transformation of primary cells by v-Abl. We suggest that although v-Abl is a potent oncogene, its full potential transforming activity cannot be realized until the ARF-, and p53-dependent growth inhibitory pathway is disabled. We also show that p53 is not the mediator of v-Abl toxicity in immortal fibroblasts and does not determine the susceptibility of immortal fibroblasts to v-Abl transformation.",,,,,,,['P01 CA75399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Attempts to replace CRT with intensified intrathecal therapy (IT) have shown promise in lower risk subgroups. In the Israel National Study (INS) 89 trial, the efficacy of extended triple IT (TIT) alone for cranial prophylaxis in an enlarged non-high risk group (Non-HRG) was assessed in the context of a modified ALL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) systemic chemotherapy program. METHODS: Non-HRG patients included the standard-risk group (SRG) and the risk group (RG), as defined in ALL-BFM 86. In the INS 89 protocol, all Non-HRG patients were treated with extended TIT x 18 times and systemic therapy based on the BFM 86 protocol, with the addition of etoposide x 4 times. The HRG patients, classified according to BFM 86 criteria, were treated with the BFM 90 HRG protocol including CRT. RESULTS: A total of 250 patients were enrolled. At a median follow-up of 58 months (range, 2-8.5 years), the overall 5-year event free survival (EFS) was 73.5% +/- 3% (standard error inverted question markSE), and the cumulative central nervous system (CNS) recurrence rate was 4.3% +/- 1.4% (SE) (isolated, 2.3%; combined, 2%). Of the 220 eligible children, 189 (86%) were in the Non-HRG group, and their 5-year EFS was 77.8% +/- 3% (SE). The cumulative CNS recurrence rate for patients without CNS disease at presentation was 3.1% +/- 1% (SE) (isolated, 1.7%; combined, 1.4%). Within the risk subsets defined by the BFM 86 of the Non-HRG, the 5-year EFS rates of the RG (148 patients) and the SRG (41 patients) were 74.8% +/- 4% (SE) and 89.5% +/- 5% (SE), respectively, and the rates of CNS recurrence (isolated and combined) were 4% and 0%, respectively. For the HRG (31 patients), the 5-year EFS and CNS recurrence rates were 47.9% +/- 9% (SE) and 8. 5% +/- 6% (SE), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Early extended TIT therapy in the context of modified BFM 86 systemic chemotherapy was found to provide adequate CNS protection and systemic leukemia control in patients with non-high risk ALL. However, no benefit for etoposide could be proven in this study.",,,['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Childhood HPC comprises two distinct clinical entities. In children older than 1 year, it behaves in a manner similar to adult HPC. Infantile HPC, however, although histologically identical to adult HPC, has a more benign clinical course. The reasons for these differences in the natural history of HPC are not well understood. METHODS: The authors reviewed the clinicopathologic features of HPC as well as the treatment and outcomes of the 12 children (9 males and 3 females) treated for this disease at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital over a 35-year period. RESULTS: At diagnosis, 9 patients were older than 1 year and 3 were younger than 1 year. Among the 9 older patients, tumors were most commonly found in the lower extremities (n = 5). One patient had been treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia 15 years earlier. One patient had metastatic disease at diagnosis, and three had unresectable tumors. Two patients experienced objective responses to chemotherapy. Three patients died of disease progression. Among the three infants, two had unresectable disease at diagnosis, and both experienced excellent responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In one case, the response of the tumor to chemotherapy correlated with maturation to hemangioma. All three infants are alive without evidence of disease. CONCLUSIONS: HPC in children older than 1 year does not differ from adult HPC, and aggressive multimodality therapy is required. Infantile HPC, on the other hand, is characterized by better clinical behavior, with documented chemoresponsiveness and spontaneous regression, and requires a more conservative surgical approach. In some cases of infantile HPC, this benign behavior correlates with maturation to hemangioma.",,,['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],,,,"['R25 CA023944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'LA-23099/PHS HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

This marker also has been found to be increased in patients with serosal effusion derived from nonneoplastic inflammatory disease and in a few instances of advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma with serosal involvement. METHODS: CA 125 levels were tested in the serum of 15 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) at the time of diagnosis and in 3 patients with advanced leukemia with serosal involvement. In two patients with elevated serum CA 125 levels, a CA 125 assay was performed on leukemic cells and on the supernatant fluid of short term liquid culture. RESULTS: Increased serum CA 125 was found in the three patients with acute leukemia with extramedullary localization and serosal effusion, whereas it was normal in 15 AML patients tested at the time of diagnosis. CA 125 was not detectable in leukemic cell extracts nor in the supernatant fluid of primary cultures. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that leukemic cells were unable to produce CA 125 and suggest that its elevation in the serum is likely due to a serosal inflammatory reaction caused by the leukemic infiltration.",,,['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],13,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia and treated with induction chemotherapy. She was discharged in stable condition with an absolute neutrophil count of 100 cells per microliter. Four days after discharge, she presented to the Cancer Clinic with fever and pancytopenia. A solitary pulmonary nodule was found in the right middle lobe which was resected by video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATHS). Histopathological examination revealed septate branching hyphae, suggesting a diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis; however, occasional yeast-like cells were also present. The culture grew a mold that appeared dull white with a slight brownish tint that failed to sporulate on standard media. The mold was found to be positive by the AccuProbe Blastomyces dermatitidis Culture ID Test (Gen-Probe Inc., San Diego, Calif.), but this result appeared to be incompatible with the morphology of the structures in tissue. The patient was removed from consideration for stem cell transplant and was treated for 6 weeks with amphotericin B (AmB), followed by itraconazole (Itr). A VATHS with biopsy performed 6 months later showed no evidence of mold infection. In vitro, the isolate appeared to be susceptible to AmB and resistant to fluconazole and 5-fluorocytosine. Results for Itr could not be obtained for the case isolate due to its failure to grow in polyethylene glycol used to solubilize the drug; however, MICs for a second isolate appeared to be elevated. The case isolate was subsequently identified as G. hyalinospora based on its formation of oblate, smooth-walled ascospores within yellow or yellow-green tufts of aerial hyphae on sporulation media. Repeat testing with the Blastomyces probe demonstrated false-positive results with the case isolate and a reference isolate of G. hyalinospora. This case demonstrates that both histopathologic and cultural features should be considered for the proper interpretation of this molecular test and extends the list of fungi recognized as a cause of human mycosis in immunocompromised patients.",,PMC88727,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously demonstrated that that the 5'-triphosphate metabolite of 2CdA (2CdATP), similar to dATP, can cooperate with cytochrome c and apoptosis protein-activating factor-1 (APAF-1) to trigger a caspase pathway in a HeLa cell-free system. We used a fluorometry-based assay of caspase activation to extend the analysis to several other clinically relevant adenine deoxynucleotides in B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia extracts. The nucleotide-induced caspase activation displayed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. As estimated by the V(max)/K(m) ratios, the relative efficiencies of different nucleotides were Ara-ATP > 9-fluoro-9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine 5'-triphosphate > dATP > 2CdATP > 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosylguanine 5'-triphosphate > dADP > ATP. In contrast to dADP, both ADP and its nonhydrolyzable alpha, beta-methylphosphonate analog were strong inhibitors of APAF-1-dependent caspase activation. The hierarchy of nucleotide activation was confirmed in a fully reconstituted system using recombinant APAF-1 and recombinant procaspase-9. These results suggest that the potency of adenine deoxynucleotides as co-factors for APAF-1-dependent caspase activation is due both to stimulation by the 5'-triphosphates and lack of inhibition by the 5'-diphosphates. The capacity of adenine deoxynucleoside metabolites to activate the apoptosome pathway may be an additional biochemical mechanism that plays a role in the chemotherapy of indolent lymphoproliferative diseases.",,,,,,,"['CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM23200/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy was given to patients with an estimated low risk of developing GVHD, whereas MTX + cyclosporine (CsA) was given to 'high-risk' patients. After engraftment, CsA was discontinued, and weekly MTX was reinstituted and given until 3 months post-bone marrow transplant. Conditioning consisted of busulfan (BU) + cyclophosphamide (CY) (n = 35) or CY + total body irradiation (TBI) (n = 38). Retrospective controls were given CY + TBI and MTX + CsA (n = 39). The median observation time was 5 yr 11 months. Chronic GVHD increased to 53% in the individual BU + CY group and 46% in the individual CY + TBI group, compared to 25% in the control group (p = 0.05). This increase was restricted to the limited form. The actuarial relapse incidence decreased to 20% in the individual BU + CY group, compared to 52% in the control group, p = 0.03. In the individual CY + TBI group, the relapse incidence was 44% (n.s. versus controls, p = 0.04 versus individual BU + CY). The 5-yr relapse-free survival (RFS) in the individual BU + CY group was 66%, in the control group, 41% (p = 0.07), and in the individual CY + TBI group, 45% (p = 0.1 versus individual BU + CY). Patients with early leukemia in the individual BU + CY group had a RFS of 83%, compared to 44% in the control group (p = 0.02) and 42% in the individual CY + TBI group (p = 0.01). In the multivariate analysis, advanced leukemia beyond first complete remission and first chronic phase and conditioning with CY + TBI were correlated to poor RFS. In summary, the individualized prophylaxis itself did not reduce the relapse incidence. However, in patients with early leukemia conditioning with BU + CY, our method of individualizing the GVHD prophylaxis might be of value, since this group had the best RFS in this study.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An interest in the dose-response of radiation induced CML therefore leads naturally to an interest in the dose-response of BCR-ABL formation. To predict the BCR-ABL dose-response to low-linear energy transfer (LET) ionizing radiation, three models valid over three different dose ranges are examined: the first for doses greater than 80 Gy, the second for doses less than 5 Gy and the third for doses greater than 2 Gy. The first of the models, due to Holley and Chatterjee, ignores the accidental binary eurejoining of DNA double-strand break (DSB) free ends ('eurejoining' refers to the accidental restitution of DSB free ends with their own proper mates). As a result, the model is valid only in the limit of high doses. The second model is derived directly from cytogenetic data. This model has the attractive feature that it implicitly accounts for single-track effects at low doses. The third model, based on the Sax-Markov binary eurejoining/misrejoining (SMBE) algorithm, does not account for single-track effects and is therefore limited to moderate doses greater than approximately 2 Gy. Comparing the second model to lifetime excess CML risks expected after 1 Gy, estimates of the number of hematopoietic stem cells capable of causing CML were obtained for male and female atomic bomb survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The stem cell number estimates lie in the range of 5 x 10(7)-3 x 10(8) cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the partial cDNAs cloned, a novel cDNA was identified, which showed 54% identity to the recently cloned cDNA of the retinoblastoma binding protein-2 (RBP2). The 6.5-kB full-length cDNA of this RBP2-related gene, termed RBP2 homolog 1 (RBP2-H1), was obtained from a human teratocarcinoma cDNA library. Two independent libraries from human malignant melanomas were negative. A computerized sequence analysis revealed highly conserved motifs with possible functional meaning: two domains that, in the RBP2 homolog, mediate the binding and interaction with the proteins encoded by the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, the TATA-binding protein, and the oncoprotein rhombotin 2; in addition, two DNA-binding zinc finger/leukemia-associated protein motifs were detected. Because a functional role in cell-cycle control and transcriptional activation can be envisioned, we investigated the expression of this novel transcript in normal fetal and adult tissues, as well as tissues of benign and malignant melanocytic tumors. By conducting multiple Northern blot, RT-PCR, and in situ hybridization analyses, the authors showed that the corresponding mRNA is expressed in virtually all normal tissues. Accordingly, they found RBP2-H1 expression in microdissected tissue samples from benign melanocytic nevi (n = 10). In contrast, the transcript is significantly down-regulated or even lost in tissue samples from human malignant melanomas (n = 13), melanoma metastases (n = 10), and melanoma cell lines (n = 7). The authors concluded that the loss or down-regulation of RBP2-H1 expression could be a useful molecular marker for a transformed phenotype in the human melanocytic system.",,,,,,,"['CA68822/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NS33377/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The stimuli were auditory Finnish words presented as a Sternberg-type memory-scanning paradigm. Each trial started with the presentation of a 4 word set for memorization whereafter a probe word was presented to be identified by the subject as belonging or not belonging to the memorized set. RESULTS: Encoding of the memory set elicited ERS and retrieval ERD at both frequency bands. However, in the survivors of leukemia, ERS was turned to ERD during encoding at the lower alpha frequency band. ERD was lasting longer at the lower frequency band than at the higher frequency band, in each study group. At both frequency bands, the maximum of ERD was achieved later in the cancer survivors than in the control group. CONCLUSION: The previously reported type of ERD/ERS during an auditory memory task was reproducible also in the survivors of childhood cancer, at different alpha frequency bands. However, the temporal deviance in ERD/ERS magnitudes, in the cancer survivors, was interpreted to indicate that both survivor groups had prolonged information processing time and/or they used ineffective cognitive strategies. This finding was more pronounced in the group of leukemia survivors, at the lower alpha frequency band, suggesting that the main problem of this patient group might be in the field of attention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: One milliliter of endotoxin-free normal saline (vehicle) containing either 40 ng, 200 ng, or 1,000 ng of rHuOSM was injected into the right radiocarpal joints (RCJs) of 12 male angora goats, while the left RCJs were injected with an equivalent volume of vehicle alone. In subsequent studies, the right and left RCJs of 8 male angora goats were injected with 200 ng of rHuOSM, and 1 hour later, the right RCJs were injected with either 5 microg of recombinant murine leukemia inhibitory factor binding protein (rMuLBP) or 1 mg of recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (rHuIL-1Ra) in 1 ml of vehicle, while the left RCJs received 1 ml of vehicle alone. Goat joints were examined for clinical features of inflammation, and synovial fluid (SF) was aspirated on day 0 (before injection) and at days 2 and 6 postinjection. RESULTS: Injections of rHuOSM stimulated dose-dependent increases in the carpal:metacarpal ratio, SF volume, and SF leukocyte numbers, and stimulated dose-dependent decreases in the cartilage proteoglycan (PG) content ex vivo and PG synthesis. No significant changes were observed in the control joints that received saline alone, or between RCJs that were injected with 200 ng rHuOSM followed by 5 microg rMuLBP and RCJs that were injected with 200 ng of rHuOSM alone, except in respect to synovial fluid keratan sulfate concentrations, where a modest statistically significant reduction was observed in the joints injected with the combination of rHuOSM and rMuLPB. In contrast, RCJs injected with 200 ng rHuOSM followed by 1 mg of rHuIL-1Ra had significantly lower SF volumes (P<0.0001) and a significantly higher rate of ex vivo PG synthesis (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that rHuOSM stimulates inflammation and modulates cartilage PG metabolism in vivo. Some of the effects of rHuOSM in vivo appear to be due, in part, to elaboration of IL-1. Even at very high doses, however, the rHuIL-1Ra did not attenuate OSM-mediated cartilage PG resorption. Thus, OSM has the potential to contribute to synovitis in vivo and can stimulate cartilage PG resorption in vivo, independent of IL-1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have taken a new approach to determine if ablation of the genetic abnormality is sufficient for reversion by generating a conditional transgenic model of BCR-ABL1 (also known as BCR-ABL)-induced leukaemia. This oncogene is the result of a reciprocal translocation and is associated with different forms of leukaemia. The most common form, p210 BCR-ABL1, is found in more than 90% of patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) and in up to 15% of adult patients with de novoacute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Efforts to establish a useful transgenic model have been hampered by embryonic lethality when the oncogene is expressed during embryogenesis, by reduced penetrance or by extremely long latency periods. One model uses the 'knock-in' approach to induce leukaemia by p190 BCR-ABL1(ref. 10). Given the limitations of models with p210, we used a different experimental approach. Lethal leukaemia developed within an acceptable time frame in all animals, and complete remission was achieved by suppression of BCR-ABL1expression, even after multiple rounds of induction and reversion. Our results demonstrate that BCR-ABL1is required for both induction and maintenance of leukaemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anthracyclines such as daunorubicin (DNR) are typically used to treat AML and can induce drug resistance. The goal of the studies described here was to select a combination of fluorescent probes that could be used in combination with flow cytometry to monitor cell proliferation vs. cell death/necrosis as a function of anthracycline uptake. Propidium iodide (PI), the most commonly used marker of membrane integrity, cannot be used to evaluate necrosis in DNR-containing cells because of spectral overlap. A membrane integrity probe compatible with the use of a dye dilution method using PKH67 to study cell proliferation was also selected. The results show that DAPI and Cascade Blue (CB), like PI, were able to detect necrotic cells when no DNR was present, although CB gave less resolution between viable and necrotic cells than PI or DAPI. In the presence of DNR, DAPI cannot be used owing to the fluorescence quenching by DNR. However, it was found that a combination of DNR, CB, and PKH67 allows simultaneous identification of chemoresistant cells, based on reduced DNR accumulation, necrotic cells based on CB incorporation, and proliferating cells based on partitioning of PKH67 fluorescence between daughter cells. It was also found that unless a marker of necrosis is used in combination with the dye dilution assay, a moderate decrease of fluorescence as a result of necrosis may be incorrectly interpreted as proliferation.",,PMC6726333,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effectiveness of the 3D-compensating filters in producing a homogeneous dose distribution was checked by a thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) and semiconductor detectors in all patients. At the pelvis, the dose was measured simultaneously with an ionization chamber. The average dose distribution to each site when the 3D-compensating filter was used was 93% to the head, 97% to the neck, 99% to the thorax, and 98% to the pelvis in TLD when the scheduled dose was taken as 100%. There was no significant difference between the TBI and non-TBI groups with regard to the frequency of lung toxicity. Clinical interstitial pneumonitis occurred in 22.7% of the patients, interstitial pneumonitis with CMV in 13.6%, and idiopathic pneumonitis in 6.1% without any virus infection.

We evaluated in vitro drug-induced apoptosis in leukemic cells using TdT-dependent labeling of DNA breaks with digoxigenine-dUTP and PI DNA staining in multiparameter flowcytometry. In cell lines developing drug resistance, a significant inhibition of proliferation and increased cell clearance via apoptosis was shown. Moreover, in drug resistant sub-lines and in blasts from AML patients, a variable apoptotic response to in vitro exposure to cytostatics was seen. Half of the studied AML cases were completely resistant to Novantrone-induced apoptosis with no correlation between sensitivity to Novantrone and bcl-2 expression. One case showed intraclonal heterogeneity with two coexisting populations: an immature blast population resistant to Novantrone and a differentiating blast population showing apoptotic response. Another case showed complete resistance to various cytostatics, but incubation with anti-CD95 monoclonal antibody resulted in a considerable apoptotic response. This case demonstrates that a lack of apoptotic response to cytostatics does not preclude sensitivity to other apoptotic stimuli. Our results confirm the role apoptosis plays in selection of drug-resistant clones and suggest different signaling pathways for apoptosis operating in various leukemic blasts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results showed that space-time clustering of onsets was limited to the nodular sclerosing cases. It was more prominent in young adult nodular sclerosing cases aged 15-34 years (particularly females) diagnosed in the period 1984-88, than in those diagnosed in 1989-93.

Severe toxicity included infections (45%), diarrhea (21%), bleeding (9%), vomiting (7%), hyperbilirubinemia (6%), mucositis (4%) (no statistical difference was seen between both arms). Nephrotoxicity was observed in only one case in the IDA arm. Cardiac toxicity included reversible pulmonary oedema in one patient in the IDA arm. No severe ototoxicity was noted. CR patients received maintenance courses with 3 days of CBP and one day of IDA or MIT. Median survival was 2 months (range, 1-30+ months) and 2.5 months (range, 0.5-19.5 months), and median disease-free survival (DFS) 2 months (range, 1-30+ months) and 2.5 months (range, 1-14 months) in the IDA and MIT arms respectively.

Thirty-five patients were transplanted with autologous peripheral stem cells (APSCT): 30 had non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 5 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Nineteen patients were transplanted with autologous bone marrow stem cells (ABMT): 17 had NHL and 2 ALL. The number of progenitor cells (CFU-GM, BFU-E) and nucleated cells was significantly higher in peripheral blood transplants. The duration of cytopenia was shorter after APSCT. The leucocyte recovery to 0.5 x 10(9)/L was 13 days for recipients of peripheral stem cells compared to 20 days for bone marrow recipients (P <0.001). The platelet recoveries to 20 x 10(9)/L were 13 and 29 days, respectively (P = 0.001). This resulted in significantly shorter admission duration 24 days after APSCT versus 30 days (P = 0.003) after ABMT. Furthermore, a statistically significant difference between both groups was observed for antimicrobial costs (mean: fl 2,939 vs fl 4,888; P = 0.008), platelet transfusions (median: 3 vs 7 units; P = 0.01) and erythrocyte transfusions (median: 6 vs 10 units; P = 0.03). The mean overall costs were lower in patients transplanted with stem cells from peripheral blood: fl 34,178 versus fl 43,469 (P = 0.007). This study suggests that the APSCT results in significant cost savings due to shorter hospital stay and less costs of supportive care, despite higher mobilisation costs. The costs of blood transfusions and antimicrobials for patients with ALL were significantly higher when compared to patients with NHL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukocyte migration from circulation into tissue depends on integrin-mediated adhesion to endothelium and integrins are tightly regulated by several stimuli such as inflammatory chemokines. We have investigated the mechanisms of extravasation of ATL cells and reported the novel features of endogenous chemokine-induced adhesion of ATL cells to the endothelium. We propose that ATL cells adhere to endothelial cells through an adhesion cascade similar to normal leukocytes, and that the chemokines produced by ATL cells are involved in triggering integrin LFA-1 through cytoskeletal rearrangement induced by G-protein-dependent activation of PI 3-kinases in an autocrine manner. Furthermore, the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan particularly on ATL cells is involved in chemokine-dependent autocrine stimulation of integrin-triggering by immobilizing the chemokine on them. These events result in a strong adhesion of ATL cells to the endothelium and spontaneous transendothelial migration.",,,,57,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukaemic colony forming unit L-CFU is considered to be the clonogenic cell in AML and more immature than the blast cell population. Our studies have shown that in leukaemic hematopoiesis colony forming cells can exist among both cell fractions CD34+ and CD34-. Optimal ""in vitro"" proliferation of L-CFU is dependent upon the addition of exogenous growth factors. However, it has been observed that leukaemic progenitor cells frequently display a certain degree of autonomous proliferation. In order to quantify the ""in vitro"" behaviour of L-CFU, we have explored 3 parameters: 1) plating efficiency (PE); 2) autonomous growth (AG); and 3) autonomous proliferative index (API) which was calculated as AG divided by PE and we have correlated them with other clinico-biological data. According to the FAB classification we could observe that patients with M3 subtype showed an higher PE than other AML subgroups and a significantly lower API. Regarding CD34 expression we observed that AG was enhanced in CD34+ cases and also in those showing a higher rh123 elimination. In order to determine whether PE could condition clinical evolution, we analysed this parameter in a large series of patients but failed to demonstrate any relationship. By contrast, we observed that patients who displayed a higher API showed a shorter survival than patients with lower API (18% vs 48% surviving at 3 years). We have also shown that abnormalities in the CFU-GM growth pattern could be associated with risk the of relapse in AML patients; a switch from normal to abnormal ""in vitro"" growth should alert us. But for the assessment of the real value of these analyses sequential follow-up studies are mandatory. In summary, cell culture studies contribute not only to a better understanding of leukaemic hematopoiesis but may also contribute to better disease monitoring.",,,,35,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the role of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in the growth inhibition of human acute myeloid leukemia cell line, HL-60, by EB1089. Clonal growth of HL-60 cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by EB1089. Although TGF-beta1 alone slightly inhibited proliferation of HL-60 cells, the addition of TGF-beta1 into culture treated with 10(-8) M of EB1089 showed a significant synergistic antiproliferative effect in a dose-dependent manner. EB1089 up-regulated the expression of TGF-beta receptor type I (TGF-beta RI), type II (TGF-beta RII) and TGF-beta1. Antiproliferative effect of EB1089 was partially reversed by TGF-beta1 neutralizing antibody (anti-TGF-beta1). Vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression was increased by TGF-beta1, suggesting synergistic action of TGF-beta1 and EB1089. Combined treatment of EB1089 and TGF-beta1 resulted in an increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI), p27 protein, compared to either ligand alone.

Five of these leukaemias were clonal by the IgH and/or TCRG gene status. We therefore conclude that ALL is a clonal disease despite the presence of heterogeneous TCRD rearrangements.

Several of these studies do, however, lend themselves to application of the meta-analysis technique. For this purpose we carried out searches using MEDLINE and other sources, and 14 case-control studies and one cohort study were identified and evaluated for epidemiological quality and included in the meta-analysis. Relative risk estimates were extracted from each of the studies and pooled. Separate meta-analyses were performed on the basis of the assessed EMF exposure (wiring configuration codes, distance to power distribution equipment, spot and 24-h measures of magnetic field strength (magnetic flux density) and calculated magnetic field). The meta-analysis based on wiring configuration codes yielded a pooled relative risk estimate of 1.46 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05-2.04, P = 0.024) and for that for exposure to 24-h measurements of magnetic fields, 1.59 (95% CI = 1.14-2.22, P = 0.006), indicating a potential effect of residential EMF exposure on childhood leukaemia. In most cases, lower risk estimates were obtained by pooling high-quality studies than pooling low-quality studies. There appears to be a clear trend for more recent studies to be of higher quality. Enough evidence exists to conclude that dismissing concerns about residential EMFs and childhood leukaemia is unwarranted. Additional high-quality epidemiological studies incorporating comparable measures for both exposure and outcomes are, however, needed to confirm these findings and, should they prove to be true, the case options for minimizing exposure should be thoroughly investigated to provide definitive answers for policy-makers.",,PMC2557764,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All displayed 11q23/MLL abnormalities, t(9;11)(p22;q23) in two cases and t(11;17)(q23;q21) in one case, constituting around 20% of all 11q23-positive AML cytogenetically investigated in our department. Two of the patients had GS in multiple locations, and all three had abdominal GS. In two of them, t(9;11)-positive GS was diagnosed prior to the diagnosis of AML. Fourteen (1.9%) of 752 published AML cases with 11q23 aberrations have had GS, either as a presenting feature or during disease progression. The incidence of GS has varied significantly (P < 0.05) between children (3.8%) and adults (0.8%). The most common AML subtype has been AML M5 ( approximately 75%) and the most frequent GS sites have been the skin, abdomen, orbit, and thorax. Considering the possibility of underreporting of GS in published cases and the relatively high frequency in our own series, we believe that 11q23/MLL rearrangements may predispose to GS development. Although extramedullary infiltrates in the skin are known to be frequent in cases of AML M5, which is often associated with 11q23 aberrations, the present findings indicate that GS in the abdomen, orbit, and thorax may also be common, especially in pediatric AML. Thus, the possibility of 11q23/MLL-positive GS should be suspected when tumors of uncertain derivation occur in these sites. Finally, the identification of 11q23/MLL abnormalities in GSs in two patients without overt AML underscores the importance of using cytogenetic and molecular genetic investigations as a diagnostic approach in the evaluation of tumorous lesions of unknown origin.

Studies were undertaken to determine the origin and structure of this RCR. Receptor interference assays demonstrated that the virus was pseudotyped with an ecotropic envelope. Molecular analysis demonstrated the presence of a MoMLV ecotropic env recombinant where the neomycin resistance gene of the MFG-S-Neo vector was replaced by MoMLV ecotropic env. Additional recombinants linking the retroviral pol gene to neo and the neo gene to MoMLV env were also identified. A full-length MoMLV retroviral genome was detected by nested PCR in the contaminated amphotropic producer cells and in cells infected with its supernatant. Unexpectedly, this was also present in the GP+E86 packaging cells together with a previously undescribed envelope construct possessing a full 5' and 3' LTR, although these cells were consistently negative for the presence of RCR. These anomalies in the GP+E86 packaging cell line result in increased homology with the MFG-S-Neo vector, leading to an increased risk for the production of RCR. Our findings point to a need for increased vigilance when using these packaging lines to generate replication-defective retrovirus.",,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bcl-2 protein inhibits apoptosis and bcl-2 overexpression has been associated with drug resistance. It is our hypothesis that higher levels of bcl-2 expression will be seen in colon cancer cells resistant to PYY treatment. METHODS: Caco2 and HCT116 colon cancer cells were treated with 2 microM PYY for 24 hours. Protein was extracted from cells surviving PYY treatment; bcl-2 expression was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and confirmed by Western blotting. RESULTS: Caco2 and HCT116 cells surviving PYY treatment demonstrated increased bcl-2 from 20.54+/-2.7 to 28.63+/-2.20 units/mL (P <0.05) and 21.98+/-1.28 to 29.32*+/-2.26 units/mL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Increased expression of bcl-2 is seen in a population of colon cancer cells resistant to PYY.

When injected into blastocysts they can give rise to every cell type of a derived chimeric mouse including germ cells. Embryonic stem cells also possess remarkable in vitro differentiation potential. When removed from stromal support and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ES cells differentiate into structures known as embryoid bodies (EBs), in which all three germ layers develop and interact. As ES cells from humans become available there is increasing interest in the potential for EBs to provide an unlimited supply of stem cells for somatic transplantation therapies. Realisation of this potential will require greater understanding of the molecular determinants of cell fate within EBs. Also, culture techniques for selective expansion of cell lineages of interest will reduce the risks associated with transplantation of EB-derived cells. In this paper the kinetics of expression of mRNA and protein for early mesoderm markers within EBs is reported. In addition, a three-step culture system incorporating co-cultivation on the bone marrow derived stromal cell line, MC3T3-G2/PA6 (PA6), is explored as a way to select for haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and against undifferentiated ES cells. A system like this could enhance purification of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from ES cells for bone marrow transplantation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study covered 68 ALL patients. The diagnosis was made by cytological, histological and cytochemical tests of the peripheral blood and bone marrow. Immunophenotyping was performed in 48 patients. The treatment followed the German protocol 04.89 in modification of the Hematological Research Center of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. Prevention of NL consisted in intrathecal administration of cytosar (30 mg), methotrexate (15 mg) and dexamethasone (4 mg) once a week for 6 weeks beginning on induction day 1, further in consolidation, reinduction and once in 3 months in maintenance. Radiation of the brain was not conducted. Treatment of leuroleukemia consisted of intrathecal administration of the above drugs twice a week up to normalization of the liquor with subsequent their administration 5 times and craniospinal radiation in a dose 36 Gy. Further intrathecal administrations were made according to the protocol. RESULTS: Correlation was not found between age of the patients and frequency of neuroleukemia onset, between neuroleukemia incidence and peripheral blood leukocytosis at diagnosis. Results of NL prevention with cytosar and methotrexate given intrathecally in induction of remission (14.6% of neurorecurrences) are comparable with the results of NL prevention by radiation of the brain with intrathecal administration of methotrexate obtained in the German cooperative trial.

This patient received 5-day course of DaunoXome in a dose 100 mg in the presence of ATRA therapy. 4 patients were given single dose daunorubicin associated with autoerythrocytes in the courses RACOP and 7 + 3 in a dose 45 mg/m2. Concentrations of free, bound and liposomal daunorubicin were determined spectrofluorimetrically in chlorophorm extracts of plasm, blood, liquor and bone marrow specimens. RESULTS: Immobilization of daunorubicin on the red cells and liposomes changes pharmacokinetics of the drug: peak concentrations change and the area under the concentration curve increases. Tolerance of DaunoXome and daunorubicine associated with red cells was satisfactory in all the cases: clinical and echo-CG signs of cordiotoxicity were absent, myelotoxicity was similar to that of free daunorubicine. DaunoXome was effective in 2 of 3 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia. CONCLUSION: The findings are of practical interest for physicians designing new programs of therapy of acute leukemia.",Primenenie immobilizirovannykh form daunorubitsina u bol'nykh ostrymi leikozami.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is still uncertainty as to its action mechanism. The present work was designed to determine how Al could affect the iron (Fe) metabolism in the human erythroleukaemia cell line K562. These cells, that express surface transferrin receptors (TfRs), were induced to erythroid differentiation by either haemin or hydroxyurea in 72 h cultures in media containing apotransferrin (apoTf). In the presence of aluminium citrate, the number of benzidine-positive cells decreased 18% when the cultures were induced by haemin, and 30% when hydroxyurea was the inducer. Cell viability was always unaffected. From competition assays, surface binding of 125I-Tf-Fe2 was found to be inversely related (p < 0.05) to Tf-Al2 concentration (from 2.5 to 10 nM). The dissociation constants (Kd) of the binding reaction between TfRs and the ligands Tf-Fe2 and Tf-Al2 were calculated. Kd values of the same order of magnitude demonstrated that TfR has a similar affinity for Tf-Fe2 (Kd = 1.75 x 10(-9) M) and Tf-Al2 (Kd = 1.37 x 10(-9) M). The number of surface TfRs, measured by kinetic 125I-Tf-Fe2 binding assays, was higher in induced cells cultured in the presence of Al. Nevertheless, in spite of the inhibition of cell haemoglobinization observed, 59Fe incorporation values were not different from those measured in control cultures for 72 h. As a consequence, it can be suggested that cellular Fe utilisation, and not Fe uptake, might be the main metabolic pathway impaired by Al.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary indications for bone marrow transplantation are malignancies, usually relapsed lymphomas or acute/chronic leukemias. Autologous bone marrow transplantation is used as a high-dose consolidation therapy in some solid tumor patients with varied success. Peripheral blood stem cells are a feasible source of autologous stem cells in adolescents. The process of stem cell transplantation and the complications are the same in adolescents as in younger children and adults. Adolescents face the same biologic barriers to allogeneic transplant (minimal residual disease, availability of donor), but may also face more problems with their insurance status. The psychological and social aspects of bone marrow transplantation during adolescence are unique to their developmental stage. With appropriate medical, nursing, and psychosocial support, bone marrow transplantation offers cure for the adolescent with high-risk disease.",,,,33,,,,,,,,,,,,

Older children and adolescents are included in that high-risk group. Approximately 80-85% of cases of leukemia in the pediatric population are of the lymphocytic subtype. Overall disease-free survival rates for acute lymphocytic leukemia have increased to 80% for those with standard or low-risk disease and 65-70% for those with high-risk disease. This is a product of both a better understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of ALL and the development of better treatment strategies based on risk. In acute myelogenous leukemia, we have not achieved such success, and disease-free survival rates are in the 30-40% range.

While MDS is uncommon in the adolescent patient, a surprising number of affected individuals are also affected with a predisposing constitutional syndrome. The treatment of MDS in the adolescent patient is in part determined by symptoms and also by the historical outcomes associated with each of five morphologic categories of presentation.

Neutropenia is a well known side effect of this drug. We report a case of a 73 year old woman who was admitted because of severe prolonged ticlopidine induced leucopenia. The past medical history included an immunocytoma of the IgM-kappa type diagnosed seven years ago with less than 10% infiltration of the bone marrow and a chronic hepatitis C. On admission the white cell count was 1000/microL. Ticlopidine was stopped. The white cell count did not increase within one week, thus filgastrim was applied on two consecutive days. The leucocyte count promptly increased to 6000/microL but consecutively dropped within the next fortnight again to levels below 500/microL forcing daily filgastrim application for another 9 days. Four months after the initiation of the therapy with filgastrim the patient had a white cell count of 4300/microL. We therefore conclude that in patients with a history of potentially bone marrow suppressing diseases the use of ticlopidine has to be carefully weighed against possible myelosuppressive effects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: The adult heights of 56 patients treated with GH (0.4-0.6 U/kg/week) as daily sc injections were analysed. They had been given 18 or 24 Grays (Gy) cranial irradiation for leukemia (group 1, 26 cases), 50 +/- 1 Gy for various tumors (group 2, 13 cases), 46 +/- 1 Gy for retinoblastoma (group 3, 8 cases), or 34 +/- 2 Gy with spinal irradiation for medulloblastoma (group 4, 9 cases). Twenty- five of these 56 patients had early puberty and were also treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog. RESULTS: The standing (-1.0 +/- 0.2 in group 1, -0.7 +/- 0.3 in group 2, -1.1 +/- 0.3 in group 3, and -2.0 +/- 0.4 SD in group 4) and sitting (-1.8 +/- 0.2 in group 1, -0.4 +/- 0.4 in group 2, -1.2 +/- 0.4 in group 3, and -3. 4 +/-0.4 SD in group 4) adult heights were shor ter (P < 0.05 for standing and P < 0.001 for sitting heights) for group 4 than for each of the other groups. Of the 47 patients given cranial (and not craniospinal) irradiation, sitting adult height was shorter (P = 0. 02) and the difference between standing adult and target heights greater (P = 0.03) in those patients in whom puberty occurred at a normal age than in those treated with GnRH analog. Conclusion. The incomplete catch-up of growth seems to be mainly due to the reduction in sitting height of patients given spinal irradiation and in whom puberty occurred at a normal age. This suggests that GnRH analog treatment should be more widely used to treat children with early and/or rapidly progressing puberty after cranial irradiation.",,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we investigated the biological role of a bcr-3 isoform of RARalpha-PML for the development of APML in a transgenic mouse model. Expression of RARalpha-PML alone in the early myeloid cells of transgenic mice did not alter myeloid development or cause APML, but its expression significantly increased the penetrance of APML in mice expressing a bcr-1 isoform of PML-RARalpha (15% of animals developed APML with PML-RARalpha alone vs. 57% with both transgenes, P < 0.001). The latency of APML development was not altered substantially by the expression of RARalpha-PML, suggesting that it does not behave as a classical ""second hit"" for development of the disease. Leukemias that arose from doubly transgenic mice were less mature than those from PML-RARalpha transgenic mice, but they both responded to all-trans retinoic acid in vitro.

In this study, we show that p75/AIRM1 is also expressed by cells of the myelomonocytic cell lineage, in which it appears at a later stage as compared with CD33. In vitro proliferation and differentiation of cord blood-derived CD34(+) cells (induced by stem cell factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) were consistently inhibited by the addition of anti-p75/AIRM1 mAb. Engagement of CD33 led to inhibition in some experiments. A sharp decrease of cell proliferation/survival was detected in all three p75/AIRM1+ chronic myeloid leukemias analyzed when cultured in the presence of either anti-p75/AIRM1 or anti-CD33 mAbs. Thus, the present study suggests that p75/AIRM1 and CD33 may play a regulatory role in normal myelopoiesis and may be viewed as suitable target molecules to counteract the proliferation/survival of chronic myeloid leukemias.",,PMC24778,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that substitution of the chromosome 8-derived ETO protein for the multifunctional C terminus of AML1 precludes targeting of the factor to AML1 subnuclear domains. Instead, the AML1/ETO fusion protein is redirected by the ETO component to alternate nuclear matrix-associated foci.

In the human B cell lymphoma (BCL-6) and promyelocityc leukemia (PLZF) oncoproteins, this domain mediates transcriptional repression through its ability to recruit a silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT)/nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR)-mSin3A-histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex, a mechanism shared with numerous transcription factors. HIC-1 appears unique because it contains a 13-aa insertion acquired late in evolution, because it is not found in its avian homologue, gammaF1-binding protein isoform B (gammaFBP-B), a transcriptional repressor of the gammaF-crystallin gene. This insertion, located in a conserved region involved in the dimerization and scaffolding of the BTB/POZ domain, mainly affects slightly the ability of the HIC-1 and gammaFBP-B BTB/POZ domains to homo- and heterodimerize in vivo, as shown by mammalian two-hybrid experiments. Both the HIC-1 and gammaFBP-B BTB/POZ domains behave as autonomous transcriptional repression domains. However, in striking contrast with BCL-6 and PLZF, both HIC-1 and gammaFBP-B similarly fail to interact with members of the HDAC complexes (SMRT/N-CoR, mSin3A or HDAC-1) in vivo and in vitro. In addition, a general and specific inhibitor of HDACs, trichostatin A, did not alleviate the HIC-1- and gammaFBP-B-mediated transcriptional repression, as previously shown for BCL-6. Taken together, our studies show that the recruitment onto target promoters of an HDAC complex is not a general property of transcriptional repressors containing a conserved BTB/POZ domain.",,PMC24733,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarly, in non-APL cells, RA directly targeted RARalpha and RARalpha fusions to the proteasome degradation pathway. Activation of either RARalpha or RXRalpha by specific agonists induced degradation of both proteins. Conversely, a mutation in RARalpha that abolishes heterodimer formation and DNA binding, blocked both RARalpha and RXRalpha degradation. Mutations in the RARalpha DNA-binding domain or AF-2 transcriptional activation region also impaired RARalpha catabolism. Hence, our results link transcriptional activation to receptor catabolism and suggest that transcriptional up-regulation of nuclear receptors by their ligands may be a feedback mechanism allowing sustained target-gene activation.",,PMC24729,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In transfection analyses, this region activated reporter gene expression from an artificial promoter in a position- and orientation-independent manner, indicating that the region functions as the GATA-1 gene hematopoietic enhancer (G1HE). However, when analyzed in transgenic embryos in vivo, G1HE activity was orientation dependent and also required the presence of the endogenous GATA-1 gene hematopoietic promoter. To define the boundaries of G1HE, a series of deletion constructs were prepared and tested in transfection and transgenic mice analyses. We show that G1HE contains a 149-bp core region which is critical for GATA-1 gene expression in both primitive and definitive erythroid cells but that expression in megakaryocytes requires the core plus additional sequences from G1HE. This core region contains one GATA, one GAT, and two E boxes. Mutational analyses revealed that only the GATA box is critical for gene-regulatory activity. Importantly, G1HE was active in SCL(-/-) embryos.

Its transforming protein, v-Abl, is a tyrosine kinase related to v-Src but containing an extended C-terminal domain. Many mutations affecting the C-terminal portion of the molecule block the pre-B-transforming activity of v-Abl without affecting the fibroblast-transforming ability. In this study we have determined the abilities of both wild-type and C-terminally truncated (p90) forms of v-Abl to transform cells from p53(-/-) mice. Lack of p53 increases the susceptibility of bone marrow cells to transformation by v-Abl by a factor of more than 7 but does not alter v-Abl's preference for B220(+) IgM(-) pre-B cells. p53-deficient mice have earlier tumor onset, more rapid tumor progression, and decreased survival time following A-MuLV infection, but all of the tumors are pre-B lymphomas. Thus, p53-dependent pathways inhibit v-Abl transformation but play no role in conferring preferential transformation of pre-B cells. Surprisingly, the C-terminally truncated form of v-Abl (p90) transforms pre-B cells very efficiently in mice lacking p53, thus demonstrating that the C terminus of v-Abl does not determine preB tropism but is necessary to overcome p53-dependent inhibition of transformation.",,PMC85151,,,,,['P01 CA75339/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

A successful pregnancy ensued following the surgical removal of a large endometrioma and treating a luteal phase deficiency. Though this may be the fifth case of proven parentage in cases of bone marrow conditioning and bone marrow transplantation in a male for control of leukaemia, we believe it is the first documented case showing a normal semen analysis despite treatment.

Although many leukaemia disease genes have been identified over the years, many more remain to be cloned. Here we describe an inverse PCR (IPCR) method for proviral tagging that makes use of automated DNA sequencing and the genetic tools provided by the Mouse Genome Project, which increases the throughput for disease gene identification. We also use this IPCR method to clone and analyse more than 400 proviral integration sites from AKXD and BXH2 leukaemias and, in the process, identify more than 90 candidate disease genes.

We found that PML acts as a ligand-dependent coactivator of RXRalpha/RARalpha. PML interacts with Tif1alpha and CBP. In Pml-/- cells, the RA-dependent induction of genes such as RARB2 and the ability of Tif1alpha and CBP to act as transcriptional coactivators on RA are impaired. We show that both PML and Tif1alpha are growth suppressors required for the growth-inhibitory activity of RA. T18, similar to PML-RARalpha, disrupts the RA-dependent activity of this complex in a dominant-negative manner resulting in a growth advantage.

Class I HLA molecules on target cells are the ligands for the KIR receptors. The number of KIR genes has been reported to vary between individuals, resulting in different KIR haplotypes. There is little published data on the frequency of each KIR gene and the linkage disequilibrium between the genes. Because there is evidence that NK cells may be involved in bone marrow transplant rejection, we have determined the KIR gene frequencies and possible haplotypic arrangements by linkage disequilibrium analysis in an Australian population. METHODS: Controls, patients with leukemia, and unrelated bone marrow donor-recipient pairs were typed for the presence of 11 KIR genes by polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific priming. RESULTS: Ninety percent of the population was found to have a sufficient number and variety of KIR genes to detect any mismatch of HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles on NK target cells. The 11 KIR genes could be divided into two groups based on linkage disequilibrium between pairs of genes. Evidence for a recombination within the KIR gene complex is presented. CONCLUSION: Typing for the presence of particular KIR genes may be indicated for bone marrow donor-recipient pairs for whom a class I HLA mismatch is unavoidable.",,,,,,,,['Transplantation. 1999 Dec 15;68(11):1626-8.

Such leukemias are typically acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly myelomonocytic subtype, and cases of acute promyelocytic leuke (APL) are rarely reported. Controversy exists as to whether myeloma and AML originate from a single haematopoietic progenitor or arise from different cell lineages. We report a case of a 58 year old female who developed APL 10 months following diagnosis of nonsecretory light chain (kappa) myeloma which had been treated with local spinal irradiation and low dose oral melphalan and prednisone. Clonality had originally been demonstrated by light chain restriction (kappa) of her bone marrow plasma cells whilst immunoglobulin heavy chain and T cell receptor genes were germ line. At development of APL cytogenetics revealed t(15;17) and PML-RAR fusion gene was detected by RT-PCR. The patient was treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and received 2 cycles of consolidation chemotherapy with Idarubicin. Following this therapy the t(15;17) and PML-RAR were both undetectable whilst the clonal population of kappa staining plasma cells persisted. This particular patient represents a rare case of APL complicating multiple myeloma with persistence of the myeloma clone but disappearance of PML-RAR alpha RNA following therapy. This case study appears to support the argument that the APL and myeloma originated from distinct cell lineages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On relapse, patients (pts) are reconsidered for this however some are unsuitable and in this situation the therapeutic options are limited. Between June 1995 and May 1997, 14 pts with previously treated relapsed or refractory MM were recruited. Using a prospective database, the tolerability and efficacy of chronic low dose oral idarubicin was evaluated. The median age of pts was 63 years. All had received previous anthracycline in the form of infusional cVAMP chemotherapy. 11/14 had received previous HDC. Median time from diagnosis to commencing idarubicin was 77 months. 10 mg idarubicin was administered 3 times/week for 3 weeks of a 5 week cycle. The maximum number of courses was 6. Three pts completed 6 courses, 5 pts 3 courses, 2 pts 2 courses and 4 pts 1 course. The reasons for stopping treatment were death due to progressive disease (PD) in 7 pts, persistent thrombocytopenia in 2 pts, PD in 1 pt and 1 pt suffered a cerebral infarction not considered to be related to the idarubicin therapy. Two pts showed evidence of response, neither amounting to a partial response. One had stabilisation of paraprotein with a reduction in bone marrow infiltration (47% to 7% plasma cells), the other had a reduction in bone marrow infiltration after 3 course but an increase after 6 courses. In total forty-one courses of treatment were administered. Grade 3/4 haematological toxicities were noted in a minor fraction of cases and were as follows: anaemia 6/41, neutropenia 10/41 and thrombocytopenia 11/41. Our data therefore shows a minor response in 2/14 (14%) of heavily pretreated patients with MM, without evidence of severe toxicity. It provides the rationale for using oral idarubicin as either single agent or in combination therapy for patients earlier on in their disease course especially if they are unsuitable for standard therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Careful clinical survey, sequential bone marrow biopsies (BMB) with DBA44 immunostaining for assessment of response and detection of residual disease and serially evaluation of lymphocyte subsets counts were performed. Results of bone marrow biopsies study show 1) a progressive reduction in hairy cell infiltration during the first six months after therapy and not after that indicating that the best moment for the evaluation of response may be the sixth month, 2) the persistence of a very small number of DBA44+ cells (80% of BMB).

The structurally related IRF-2 represses the effects of IRF-1 by competitive binding to the same DNA sequence elements. Changes in the relative balance between IRF-1 and IRF-2 lead to dysregulation of cell growth and may play a role in the development of neoplasias. The loss of functional IRF-1 has been observed in a number of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and leukemia, suggesting a potentially critical role of IRF-1 in leukemogenesis. We studied the expression of both transcription factors in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) cells of children with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) using RT-PCR and Southern blot hybridization. No significant difference between the expression levels of IRF-1 and IRF-2 could be detected in PB and BM of patients with JMML and normal donors.

The aim of this study combining IFN-alpha, low-dose cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) and ATRA was to increase the proportion of patients achieving a major cytogenetic response, in comparison with a group of 140 patients previously treated with IFN-alpha plus low-dose ara-C. Forty three patients with Ph-positive CML in early chronic phase were treated with IFN-alpha 5 MU/m2 s.c. daily, low-dose ara-C 10 mg s.c. daily and ATRA 45 mg/m2 orally daily, for 7 consecutive days every other week. Overall, 76% of patients achieved a complete hematologic response (CHR). A cytogenetic response was in observed 59% (major in 38% and complete in 17%). Compared with patients treated with IFN-alpha and low-dose ara-C, those receiving additional ATRA had a lower CHR rate (p. 014), but other response rates were similar. Severe toxicities were common with the triple regimen (64%), mostly related to ATRA therapy. Two patients experienced pseudotumor cerebri; two patients had leukocytosis during the week on ATRA treatment, decreasing during the week off (one suffered a severe asthma-like reaction followed by pulmonary edema, resembling ATRA syndrome). Six patients had other unusual side-effects: aseptic necrosis of the hip (1 patient), ataxic syndrome (1 patient), paranoid syndrome (2 patients), syncopal episodes (1 patient), pure red cell aplasia (1 patient). In conclusion the results of IFN-alpha and low-dose ara-C combined with ATRA in patients with early CML-chronic phase were disappointing, due to excessive toxicity. Whether different ATRA dose schedules may result in fewer side-effects and improve hematologic and cytogenetic response remains to be determined.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have also correlated the increased adhesion found after in vitro treatment with the expression of adhesion molecules on leukemic progenitors. Incubation of the BV173 cell line with escalating doses of IFN-alpha (100-10000 U/ml) showed a colony growth inhibition between 10 and 30%. IFN-alpha and junction-specific As ODN in combination showed a greater antiproliferative effect compared to that observed with the two agents used alone. In particular, As ODN at a concentration of 40 microg/ml in combination with IFN-alpha at 100 and 1000 U/ml showed a greater inhibitory effect compared to that obtained with IFN-alpha only. Addition of As ODN to IFN-alpha at 10000 U/ml did not result in a greater BV173 inhibition. In a further set of experiments, primary cells from 16 CML patients at diagnosis were incubated with 40 microg/ml of J-spec As ODN, several control ODNs and IFN-alpha at 1000 U/ml alone and in combination. A significantly greater elimination of CML progenitors was found after treatment with the combination of IFN-alpha and J-spec As ODN, compared to any other treatment group, confirmed also by a more marked effect on p210 expression. The deficient adhesion of CML progenitors on human preformed stroma was restored at levels similar to that of normal bone marrow cells after treatment with IFN-alpha and/or J-spec As ODN, while the phenotypic analysis showed that the combined treatment increased significantly the expression of CD49b and CD62L on CML CD34+ cells. However, when the expression of adhesion molecules was blocked with specific monoclonal antibodies, only CD49d (expressed on more than 90% of CML CD34+ cells) appeared to influence the functional activity of adhesion molecules. In conclusion, IFN-alpha and bcr-abl As ODN in combination exert a marked in vitro antileukemic activity and could be a useful approach for in vitro purging of CML cells prior to autologous transplantation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was recently shown that the promoter of the p15INK4b but not the p16INK4a gene is frequently and selectively hypermethylated in MDS. The p15INK4b gene is a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor gene, which is actively transcribed after TGFbeta exposure. Methylation of the p15INK4b gene is significantly correlated with blastic bone marrow involvement, and sequential analyses have shown that methylation increases with disease evolution toward AML. These data strongly suggest that p15INK4b gene methylation is a mechanism allowing leukemic cells to escape to inhibitory signals from the bone marrow environment, however the exact role of p15INK4b gene methylation in disruption of the signal mediated by TGFbeta remains to be investigated.",,,,68,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is possible, however, that leukemia cells escape the immune surveillance by lacking expression of ""costimulatory"" molecules required for activating the immune response. Human erythroleukemia line (HEL) has been the subject of previous detailed studies demonstrating surface expression of bona fide HLA molecules but inability to stimulate allogeneic response of proliferative or cytolytic T cells. We found that an HLA-DR+ subclone (HEL-DR+) expresses LFA-1, LFA-3, ICAM-1, ICAM-3, but neither CD80 nor CD86 on the surface. Transfection of CD80 cDNA into HEL-DR+ cells induced the allogeneic response of purified T cells from both cord blood and peripheral blood of adult donors, demonstrating that CD80 expression could lead to accessory cell-independent activation of naive T cells. Priming allogeneic peripheral blood T cells by HEL-DR+/CD80+ also lead to generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes that lysed both HEL-DR+/CD80+ and wild type HEL-DR+ equally well, confirming CD80 expression is required only in the CTL induction phase but not in the CTL effector phase. We established and maintained alloproliferative T cell clones from adult blood by stimulation with the HEL-DR+/CD80+ line. The clones could respond not only to HEL-DR+/CD80+ line but also to the HEL-DR+ line; however, the proliferative response to HEL-DR+/CD80+ was amplified and sustained compared to the short-lived response to wild type HEL-DR+ cells.

DESIGN: All long term post-pubertal female survivors of total body irradiation who had been treated in paediatric centres in Scotland were identified. Their ovarian and uterine characteristics were studied. SETTING: Recruitment was from follow up oncology clinics. SAMPLE: Nine women were identified, eight of whom were assessed and five progressed to detailed investigation. A control population of 12 women treated for acute leukaemia, but not treated with total body irradiation, and five healthy women with no history of childhood malignancy were recruited as controls. METHODS: Ovarian function was determined by measurement of serum gonadotrophins and sex steroids. Uterine response to physiological sex steroid replacement was investigated in women with ovarian failure, and to endogenous sex steroid production in women with ovarian function by ultrasound scan. The physiological sex steroid replacement was achieved with transdermal oestradiol patches and self administered vaginal progesterone pessaries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Determination of ovarian function and uterine response to physiological sex steroid serum concentrations. RESULTS: Six of eight women treated with total body irradiation had ovarian failure; preservation of function was seen in two girls treated pre-pubertally who had biochemical evidence of incipient ovarian failure. Four women with ovarian failure had reduced uterine volume, undetectable blood supply and absent endometrium at baseline assessment; after three months of physiological sex steroid replacement treatment uterine blood supply and endometrial response were not significantly different from controls; uterine volume improved but remained significantly smaller than controls and correlated with age at total body irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: Ovarian failure after total body irradiation is common and risk relates to age at treatment. Physiological sex steroid replacement improved uterine measures and these women may benefit from assisted reproductive technology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reported previously [6] that MDR leukemic cells displayed nuclear texture changes, as assessed by image cytometry. The nature of these changes remained uncertain but they could be associated with alterations of the nuclear matrix which could serve an important role in DNA organization and chromatin structure. Therefore, we have compared the textural features observed in G0/G1 nuclei from human leukemic CEM cells and their MDR variant CEM-VLB, after staining of either DNA by Feulgen method or nuclear matrix by immunodetection of NuMA antigen on DNase treated samples. Chromatin or NuMA distributions within the nucleus were evaluated by image cytometry. Changes in textural parameters indicate that modifications of NuMA distribution observed in MDR cells are parallel to those observed at the whole chromatin level (i.e., a more decondensed and coarse texture with increase of Energy and Long-run sections and decrease of Contrast and Short-run sections). Moreover, Optical Densities measurements indicate that MDR cells seem to contain less NuMA, a datum confirmed by immunoblotting of nuclear proteins. In conclusion, chromatin changes observed by image cytometry in drug-resistant human leukemic CEM cells appear associated with modifications of the nuclear matrix structure.",,PMC4617998,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The intracellular metabolism of 3'-dA was examined with HPLC, and the mechanism of its anti-TdT+ leukemic activity was analyzed. In the presence of dCF (2.5 microM), TdT+ leukemic cells (N = 5) were sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of 3'-dA, whereas TdT (N = 6) cells were not. A high level of 3'-dA-5'-triphosphate (3'-dATP) formation was detected in TdT+ NALM-6 cells (67 pmol/10(6) cells) and TdT- K562 cells (49 pmol/10(6) cells) when cultured with 1 microM [3'-3H]-labeled 3'-dA. A substantial level of 3'-dATP was detected in TdT HUT-102 cells (27 pmol/10(6) cells), whereas the level of 3'-dATP in TdT+ MOLT-4 cells was low (0.3 pmol/10(6) cells). The mean IC50 values of 3'-dA against phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated and resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) (N = 5) were 8 and 32 microM, respectively. There was a modest level of 3'-dATP (7 pmol/10(6) cells) in PHA-PBM, whereas a lower level of 3'-dATP was detected in resting PBM (2.5 pmol/10(6) cells). These data suggest that the presence of 3'-dATP is not sufficient for the antileukemic effect of 3'-dA, but that TdT positivity is essential, and that PBM are significantly less sensitive to the cytotoxicity of 3'-dA in vitro. Further development of 3'-dA as a potential antileukemic agent to treat patients with TdT+ leukemia is warranted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One patient developed the sepsis in spite of 4 days of coverage with amikacin. In the other two patients, amikacin was commenced at the earliest phase of the infection, but failed to influence the outcome. This form of B. cereus sepsis in neutropenic patients seems to be caused by strains capable of causing bacteraemia and meningitis and has the ability to produce a substance that causes leptomeningeal and neuronal necrosis. Lack of early clinical and laboratory markers inevitably leads to death.

The involvement of the MAPK pathway in mediating v-ras-induced micronuclei in NIH 3T3 cells was examined by inhibiting MAPK activation. Conversely, the MAPK pathway was constitutively activated by infecting cells with a v-mos retrovirus. Micronucleus formation was inhibited by the MAPK kinase inhibitors PD98059 and U0126, but not by wortmannin, an inhibitor of the Ras/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. Transduction of cells with v-mos resulted in an increase in micronucleus formation, also consistent with the involvement of the MAPK pathway. Staining with the anti-centromeric CREST antibody revealed that instability induced by constitutive activation of MAPK is due predominantly to aberrant mitotic segregation, since most of the micronuclei were CREST-positive, reflective of lost chromosomes. A significant fraction of the micronuclei were CREST-negative, reflective of lost acentric chromosome fragments. Some of the instability observed was due to mitotic events, consistent with the increased formation of bi-nucleated cells, which result from perturbations of the mitotic spindle and failure to undergo cytokinesis. This chromosome instability, therefore, is a consequence of mitotic aberrations, mediated by the MAPK pathway, including centrosome amplification and formation of mitotic chromosome bridges.",,,,,,,"['CA65769/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES07250/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Crkl binds to BCR/ABL through its N-terminal SH3 domain and is known to interact with several signaling proteins that have been implicated in integrin signaling, including Cbl, Cas, Hef-1, and paxillin. We have previously shown that overexpression of Crkl enhances adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins through beta(1) integrins. In this study, the effects of Crkl on spontaneous and chemokine-directed migration of the hematopoietic cell line Ba/F3 were examined. Full-length, SH2-, and SH3(N)-domain deletion mutants of Crkl were expressed transiently as fusion proteins with green fluorescent protein. Successfully transfected cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The ability of these cells to migrate across a fibronectin-coated membrane, either spontaneously or in response to the chemokine stromal-derived factor-1alpha, was determined. Cells expressing green fluorescent protein alone were not distinguishable from untransfected or mock transfected Ba/F3 cells. However, Ba/F3 cells overexpressing full-length Crkl were found to have an increase in spontaneous migration of 2.8 +/- 0.6-fold in seven independent assays. The enhancement of migration required both the SH2 domain and the N-terminal SH3 domain. Migration in response to stromal-derived factor-1alpha was not significantly enhanced by overexpression of Crkl. Overexpression of Crkii also augmented spontaneous migration but to a lesser degree than did Crkl. Because the SH2 domain was required for enhanced migration, we looked for changes in phosphotyrosine containing proteins coprecipitating with Crkl, but not Crkl DeltaSH2, after integrin cross-linking. Full-length Crkl, but not CrklDeltaSH2, coprecipitated with a single major tyrosine phosphoprotein with an M(r) of approximately 120 kDa, identified as Cbl. The major Crkl SH3-binding protein in these cells was found to be the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, C3G. Interestingly, overexpression of C3G also enhanced migration, suggesting that a Cbl-Crkl-C3G complex may be involved in migration signaling in Ba/F3 cells. These data suggest that Crkl is involved in signaling pathways that regulate migration, possibly through a complex with Cbl and C3G.",,,,,,,"['CA36167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK560654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Controversy persists regarding the diseases underlying divergence paresis and the existence of a divergence ""center."" MATERIALS AND METHODS: The charts of 15 patients with divergence paresis examined between 1983 and 1998 were reviewed. All patients underwent neuroimaging and detailed ocular motility testing, with measurement of esotropia in prism diopters in 14 patients. RESULTS: Divergence paresis in 15 patients was idiopathic in three patients, was associated with central nervous system microangiopathy or infarct in seven patients, and clivus lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia with sinusitis, Wernicke ophthalmoplegia, Parkinson disease, myasthenia gravis, cryptic cerebellar vascular malformation, and childhood esotropia in one patient each (two patients had two diagnoses). The mean maximum esotropia was 10.4 prism diopters, and there was no significant correlation (Fisher exact test) between the magnitude of esotropia and vasculopathic etiology or posterior fossa lesion site. Although six patients had posterior fossa disease, neuroimaging showed no common circumscribed lesion site or evidence of increased intracranial pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Divergence paresis is an uncommon cause of acquired diplopia. Divergence paresis is associated with diverse central nervous system diseases and can be mimicked by myasthenia. The absence of a single consistent lesion in our study, which is the largest reported series, suggests that divergence paresis is a nonlocalizing cause of horizontal diplopia and that multiple or diffusely distributed neural structures may govern divergence. Alternatively, elusive divergence ""centers"" may not exist, and divergence paresis may arise from impaired inhibition or from defective passive antagonism of orbital structures to convergence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present work, a Fer gene transcription initiation point was determined, and the Fer promoter was cloned. A DNA genomic fragment, extending 3698bp upstream of the fer RNA start site, was isolated, sequenced and functionally characterized. A transient transfection assay, carried out in fibroblastic cell lines, revealed the presence of the Fer promoter within the cloned genomic fragment. The Fer promoter contains neither an obvious 'TATA' element nor a putative initiator sequence, but is composed of positive and negative, cis-acting elements. Negative regulation was found to be the main cause for dysfunctioning of the Fer promoter in a T-cell leukemia cell line (Jurkat). The minimal Fer promoter that is still active in fibroblasts consists of an AP1 binding site located 14bp upstream of the fer transcription initiation point. This minimal promoter was not active in the Jurkat T-cell leukemia cells and did not bind AP1 in these cells. Three additional AP1 sites were identified in functional sequences of the Fer promoter. Thus, the availability of AP1 activity may contribute as well to the modulation of the Fer promoter activity. The presumed regulatory role of AP1 in modulating the Fer promoter activity implies a link between cell growth and the Fer gene expression level. Indeed, exposure of fibroblasts to low serum growth conditions reduced the cellular level of the fer RNA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To quantify changes in TCR repertoire over time, we established an 8-point scoring system for each Vbeta subfamily. The mean complexity score for patient samples before transplant (130.8) was significantly lower than that for normal donors (183; P = 0. 0007). TCR repertoire complexity was abnormal in all patients at 3 months after BMT (mean score = 87). Normalization of repertoire began in 4 patients at 6 months after BMT, but the majority of patients continued to display abnormal repertoires for up to 3 years after BMT. To determine whether the reconstituted T-cell repertoire was derived from the donor or recipient, unique microsatellite loci were examined to establish chimeric status. At 3 months after BMT, 7 patients demonstrated mixed chimerism; 4 had complete donor hematopoiesis (CDH). CDH strongly correlated with likelihood of restoration of T-cell repertoire complexity (P = 0.003). In contrast, patients who demonstrated persistence of recipient hematopoiesis failed to reconstitute a diverse TCR repertoire. These findings suggest that the reconstitution of a normal T-cell repertoire from T-cell progenitors in adults is influenced by interactions between recipient and donor hematopoietic cells.

The purpose of this work was to study angiogenesis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We stained bone marrow samples from 20 adult patients with untreated AML and 20 normal controls using endothelial cell markers (ULEX-E and von Willebrand factor [vWF]). The number of vessels per millimeter length of bone marrow core biopsy specimen was scored by light microscopy. Using ULEX-E staining, AML marrows had (average +/- SEM) 8.3 +/- 3.6 vessels/mm (range, 3.7-19.3), whereas normal marrows had 4.3 +/- 1.8 vessels/mm (range, 1.6-7.9). A similar difference was noted using vWF staining (8.6 +/- 3.0 vessels/mm vs 4. 9 +/- 2.2 vessels/mm in AML vs normal bone marrows, respectively). The differences between the numbers of vessels/mm in AML and normal marrows were highly significant (P <.0001 for both ULEX-E and vWF staining). When analyzed by FAB category, there was no difference in the average number of vessels/mm among the different subgroups of AML. Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, we observed that the HL-60 and U937 human AML cell lines and 4 of 4 freshly isolated AML cells from untreated patients expressed mRNA for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Both cell lines as well as all fresh AML isolates tested expressed VEGF protein. Basic fibroblast growth factor was expressed only in HL-60 cells and in only 3 of 4 fresh AML samples. These observations suggest that angiogenesis may play a role in the pathogenesis of AML. Inhibition of angiogenesis could constitute a novel strategy for the treatment of AML.

In this article we show that both anti-CD3-triggering (AICD) and doxorubicin treatment led to the production of a functionally active CD95L in the CD3+/T-cell receptor-positive (TCR+) T leukemia cell line H9. CD95L-expressing H9 cells killed CD95-sensitive J16 or CEM target cells, but not CD95-resistant CEM or J16 cells overexpressing dominant negative FADD (J16/FADD-DN). By immunoprecipitation, CD95L was physically bound to CD95, suggesting that AICD and doxorubicin-induced apoptosis involve CD95L-mediated CD95 aggregation, thereby triggering the CD95 death pathway. CD95 aggregation was associated with the recruitment of FADD and caspase-8 to the CD95 receptor to form the CD95 death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), resulting in caspase-8 activation and cleavage of the effector caspase-3 and PARP. Blocking of the CD95L/receptor interaction by antagonistic antibodies to CD95 or to CD95L also blocked AICD and inhibited the early phase of doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, though cell death induced by doxorubicin eventually proceeded in a CD95-independent manner. These findings may explain some conflicting data on the role of death receptor systems in drug-induced apoptosis. Thus, in cells with an inducible CD95 receptor/ligand system, drug-induced apoptosis may be mediated by CD95L-initiated DISC formation and activation of downstream effector programs similar to AICD in T cells.

This finding suggests strongly that WT1 protein is a potential target of immunotherapy for human leukemia. In this study, we established a CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clone directed against a WT1-derived peptide and examined its immunologic actions on leukemia cells. A CD8(+) CTL clone, designated TAK-1, which lysed autologous cells loaded with a WT1-derived 9-mer peptide consisting of the HLA-A24 (HLA-A*2402)-binding motifs was established by stimulating CD8(+) T lymphocytes from a healthy individual repeatedly with WT1 peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells. TAK-1 was cytotoxic to HLA-A24-positive leukemia cells expressing WT1, but not to HLA-A24-positive lymphoma cells that did not express WT1, HLA-A24-negative leukemia cells, or HLA-A24-positive normal cells. Treating leukemia cells with an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to the WT1 gene resulted in reduced TAK-1-mediated cytotoxicity, suggesting that target antigen of TAK-1 on leukemia cells is the naturally processed WT1 peptide in the context of HLA-A24. TAK-1 did not inhibit colony formation by normal bone marrow cells of HLA-A24-positive individuals. Because WT1 is overexpressed ubiquitously in various types of leukemia cells, but not in normal cells, immunotherapy using WT1 peptide-specific CTL clones should be an efficacious treatment for human leukemia.

In quiescent cells, NF-kappaB principally resides within the cytoplasm in association with inhibitory kappa (IkappaB) proteins. The status of IkappaB and NF-kappaB proteins was evaluated for promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells treated at different intensities of photodynamic therapy (PDT). The action of the potent photosensitizer, benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid ring A (verteporfin), and visible light irradiation were assessed. At a verteporfin concentration that produced the death of a high proportion of cells after light irradiation, evidence of caspase-3 and caspase-9 processing and of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage was present within whole cell lysates. The general caspase inhibitor Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (ZVAD.fmk) effectively blocked these apoptosis-related changes. Recent studies indicate that IkappaB proteins may be caspase substrates during apoptosis. However, the level of IkappaBbeta was unchanged for HL-60 cells undergoing PDT-induced apoptosis. IkappaBalpha levels decreased during PDT-induced apoptosis, though ZVAD.fmk did not affect this change. At a less intensive level of photosensitization, cellular IkappaBalpha levels were transiently depressed after PDT. At these times, p50 and RelA NF-kappaB species were increased within nuclear extracts, as revealed by electrophoretic mobility supershift assays. HL-60 cells transiently transfected with a kappaB-luciferase reporter construct exhibited elevated luciferase activity after PDT or treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a well-characterized NF-kappaB activator. Productive NF-kappaB activation and associated gene transcription may influence the phenotype and behavior of cells exposed to less intensive PDT regimens. However, IkappaBalpha is not subject to caspase-mediated degradation as a component of PDT-induced apoptosis. (Blood. 2000;95:256-262)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They also examined subsequent survival time and disease-free survival time after accounting for cytogenetic status, age, and treatment. The data set consisted of 1101 patients with these diagnoses treated at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1980 and 1996 for whom outcomes were established after first-course therapy. Of the 1101 patients, 740 (67%) were in CR after this time; 508 of these 740 (69%) have died (80% had disease recurrence before death). The authors used the parametric model of Shen and Thall to estimate, in particular, T(C) (time to CR), T(C,D) (time from CR to death = residual survival after CR), and T(C,R) (residual disease-free survival [DFS] after CR) as functions of the covariates noted above and to estimate the dependence of T(C,D) and T(C,R) on T(C). There was a strong inverse association between T(C) and both T(C,D) and T(C,R) (P <.001 for both) that was independent of cytogenetic status, age, or treatment. The residual survival time of patients who required >50 days to enter CR was closer to the residual survival time of resistant patients than to that of patients known to be in CR within approximately 30 days of the start of treatment. Time to CR is an independent predictor of residual survival and disease-free survival in patients with newly diagnosed AML who achieve CR after 1 course of chemotherapy.

It has since been suggested that the use of an escalating dose regimen (EDR) may be equally effective against leukemia while it induces less graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We therefore compared the efficacy and incidence of complications in a nonrandomized sequential study of the 2 regimens in 48 consecutive patients who had relapses with cytogenetic or hematologic evidence of chronic myeloid leukemia after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Twenty-eight patients were treated on a BDR (August 1990 to November 1995) and 20 were treated on an EDR (December 1995 to January 1998). Although the probability of achieving cytogenetic remission within 2 years of starting DLI did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (EDR, 91% [CI, 63%-98%] vs. BDR, 67% [CI,49%-83%], P =.70), the incidence of GVHD was much lower using EDR (10% vs. 44%, P =.011). When we considered only subsets of patients treated by BDR or EDR who had received comparable total lymphoid cell doses, the incidence and severity of acute and chronic GVHD were both significantly lower for recipients treated by EDR than for recipients treated by BDR (P =.005 and P =.031, respectively). These findings suggest that the incidence of GVHD associated with the EDR is low, not because the final cell dose is small, but because lymphocytes are administered over a considerable number of months.

Currently it is unclear how long IFN treatment should be continued for such patients. We used a competitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to quantify levels of BCR-ABL transcripts in 297 peripheral blood specimens collected from 54 patients who had achieved CR with IFN. The median duration of observation was 1.9 years (range, 0.3-11.0 years). Total ABL transcripts were quantified as internal control and results were expressed as the ratio BCR-ABL/ABL. All 54 patients had molecular evidence of residual disease, although 3 patients were intermittently PCR negative. The median BCR-ABL/ABL ratio at the time of maximal response for each patient was 0.045% (range, 0%-3. 6%). During the period of observation 14 patients relapsed, 11 cytogenetically to chronic phase disease and 3 directly to blastic phase. The median ratio of BCR-ABL/ABL at maximal response was significantly higher in patients who relapsed than in those who remained in CR (0.49% versus 0.021%, P < 0.0001). Our findings show that the level of residual disease falls with time in complete responders to IFN, but molecular evidence of disease is rarely if ever eliminated. The actual level of minimal residual disease correlates with the probability of relapse. We suggest that for patients who reach CR, IFN should be continued at least until relatively low levels of residual leukemia are achieved. (Blood. 2000;95:62-66)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukocyte migration from the circulation into tissues depends on integrin-mediated adhesion to the endothelium, and integrins are tightly regulated by several factors, such as chemokines. In this study, we focused on the interaction between chemokines and chemokine receptors on ATL cells to understand factors involved in ATL cell infiltration of lymphoid organs. We compared freshly isolated ATL cells from patients with and without lymphoid organ involvement for the expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7/EBI1, the functional receptor for secondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine (SLC), which is expressed at high levels by high endothelial venules of lymph nodes and Peyer's patches. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometric analysis, using anti-CCR7 monoclonal antibody (CCR7.6B3), revealed that ATL cells from patients with lymphoid organ involvement expressed significantly more CCR7/EBI1 than control CD4(+)CD45RO(+) T cells and ATL cells from patients without lymphoid organ involvement. Consequently, significantly more ATL cells from patients with lymphoid organ involvement than control CD4(+)CD45RO(+) T cells and ATL cells from patients without lymphoid organ involvement adhered to surfaces coated with ICAM-1 and SLC or EBI1-ligand chemokine (ELC), another ligand for CCR7/EBI1, under static and flow conditions and migrated toward SLC or ELC at a low concentration (30 ng/ml). These findings suggest that increased CCR7/EBI1 expression plays a role in lymphoid organ infiltration of ATL cells. (Blood. 2000; 30-38)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We showed that the full phosphorothioate GTn oligonucleotide was neither able to specifically recognize those nuclear proteins, nor cytotoxic. In contrast, the 3'-phosphorothioate-protected GTn oligonucleotides can maintain the specific protein-binding activity. The end-modified phosphorothioate oligonucleotides were also able to elicit the dose-dependent cell growth inhibition effect, but a loss in the cytotoxic ability was observed increasing the extent of sulphur modification of the sequences.

Platelets from patients with HCV infection have been identified as carriers of HCV RNA in our previous studies. The present study was designed to further investigate the possibility of HCV replication in megakaryoblasts from which platelets are eventually released. A megakaryoblastic cell line (MEG-01), established from a chronic myelogenous leukaemia patient 13 years ago, was used for this study. The MEG-01 cells were inoculated with fresh serum from a patient with HCV infection and renamed MEG-01-I cells. Surprisingly, both MEG-01 and MEG-01-I were positive by HCV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the existence of HCV RNA and minus-strand HCV RNA, regardless of inoculation. This was further confirmed by in situ RT-PCR. The HCV antigens, such as core, envelope, and non-structural (NS)3 and NS4, were also present in both cell lines, as identified by Western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence staining. In addition, virus-like particles were observed by electron microscopy in the MEG-01 cell line as well as in the MEG-01-I cell line. These findings indicate that the megakaryoblasts are vulnerable to HCV infection and that replication of HCV can occur in these cells. This may help us to better understand the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia in patients with HCV infection. The MEG-01 cell line, which may have been continuously shedding HCV for years, should be a useful model for experimental research into HCV.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A major side-effect of this purine analogue is immunosuppression which may favour opportunistic infections. Additionally, impairment of immunosurveillance might promote Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation and possibly favour transformation to high-grade malignancy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunosuppression-related effects of the fludarabine-based combination Flucyd in advanced low-grade NHL or CLL by serially monitoring T-lymphocyte subsets, opportunistic infections, EBV-reactivation, and histologic transformation. 24 patients with advanced NHL (n = 21) or CLL (n = 3) received fludarabine 25 mg/m2/d + cyclophosphamide 350 mg/m2/d + dexamethasone 20 mg/d in 3 d courses for a maximum of six courses. The overall response rate was 79% (eight CR, 11 PR, five failures); 11 patients relapsed or progressed between 3 and 19 months from response, and eight are in CR or PR at 3-27 months. The CD4+ lymphocyte counts decreased significantly during therapy from a median of 484/microliter pre-treatment (range 142-1865) to a median of 198/microliter (71-367). In 19 responders monitored off therapy every 3 months until relapse/progression, CD4+ counts were persistently low with minimal recovery over time. During treatment, 16 infections occurred in 11/24 patients. No delayed opportunistic infections occurred in responders while off therapy. The circulating EBV DNA load serially measured in 19 patients by a quantitative PCR assay showed an increase in four patients during treatment. A lymph node biopsy performed in two of these was PCR positive for EBV DNA, whereas LMP1 and EBERs were negative. Six NHL patients evolved into high-grade B-cell NHL. In conclusion, fludarabine combined with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone is an effective therapy for recurrent indolent lymphoma. This combination produces prolonged T-lymphocytopenia and has the potential to reactivate a latent EBV infection. T-cell dysfunction, however, is not associated with higher incidence of clinical opportunistic infections and does not adversely influence clinical outcome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After depletion of T lymphocytes, monocytes and NK cells, incubation with IC was no longer able to delay B-CLL cells apoptosis, suggesting that prevention of apoptosis depends on IC interaction with accessory leucocytes. The release of IFNgamma by non-malignant cells upon activation with IC was responsible, to some extent, for IC effects as shown by the fact that neutralizing anti-IFNgamma MoAb partially prevented their ability to inhibit B-CLL cells apoptosis. The observation that treatment with IC resulted in increased expression of HLA-DR on B-CLL cells suggests that inhibition of apoptosis is associated with cellular activation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, increased glycolysis in solid tumour cells expressing the multidrug resistance protein MDR-1 has been associated with increased malignancy in tumours. We have previously shown that cells of the MDR-1-positive CEM/VLB100 leukaemic cell line have increased mitochondrial electron transport chain (mtETC) activity compared with parental CEM cells. In the present study we used infrared (IR) spectroscopy to demonstrate that the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content in the CEM/VLB100 cell line was significantly increased compared to that in the parental CEM cells. The increase in mtDNA was not accompanied by an increase in mitochondrial protein as both lipid and protein levels were decreased in CEM/VLB100 mitochondria. The ATP content was similar in these two cell lines. However, the ATP-dependent membrane efflux pump function in CEM/VLB100 cells was significantly reduced when mitochondrial ATP synthesis was inhibited by oligomycin, a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial F0F1-ATPase. Proliferation of CEM/VLB100 cells was significantly decreased compared to parental CEM cells, and was independent of p53 expression. Thus, we conclude that: (1) IR spectroscopy is a potential powerful technique for detecting mtDNA, protein and lipid contents simultaneously; (2) leukaemic cells mainly rely on mtDNA for energy; (3) increased expression of an ATP-dependent membrane efflux pump such as Pgp may up-regulate ATP generation and mtDNA content. These metabolic perturbations may exist merely to serve the efflux pump and do not result in an increase in leukaemic cell proliferation. In addition, the associated reduction in mitochondrial lipid and protein may contribute to sensitize the cells to cytochrome c release.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The membrane isoform (mFas) is a 45 kD cell surface protein containing a single transmembrane region, and induces apoptosis in normal or tumour cells, whereas the soluble isoform (sFas) lacks the transmembrane domain due to alternative splicing of the transcript and is thought to block Fas-mediated apoptosis. To clarify the clinical roles of expression of these two Fas isoforms in adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL), we investigated the levels of the Fas isoforms in 81 patients with ATL. The expression patterns of the Fas isoforms were heterogenous, and there was no significant correlation between mFas and sFas levels: 10/81 cases were negative for mFas and had high serum sFas levels, whereas the remaining 71 cases were positive for mFas and had various levels of expression of the two Fas isoforms. Irrespective of the status of mFas expression in leukaemic cells, the mRNAs encoding these isoforms were always detectable, indicating the potential for protein translation. Although mFas expressed on freshly isolated ATL cells could iduce apoptosis in vitro, positive versus negative mFas status was not associated with any clinical aspects of ATL, whereas the sFas level was strongly correlated with clinical parameters such as serum LDH activity, tumour burden, serum soluble IL-2R level, hypercalcaemia and prognosis. These results suggest that the ratio of Fas isoforms varies, and high expression of the sFas protein and message reflects the malignant behaviour of ATL and is an independent risk factor for the prognosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In monocytes, LIF facilitates differentiation, which may stimulate the biosynthesis of tissue factor (TF) that initiates the coagulation cascade. We tested the hypothesis that LIF would enhance TF expression in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells separated from whole blood by density centrifugation were allowed to differentiate into MDMs in primary culture, and were then exposed to LIF, IL-6 and oncostatin M (OSM) for 24 h. LIF and IL-6 receptors, and gp130 were demonstrated in MDMs by immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR. TF procoagulant activity (TF-PCA) was measured by recalcification clotting time and TF protein by Western blotting. The results show that both TF procoagulant activity and TF protein increased significantly in response to LIF over the concentration range of 1-100 nM (P < 0.03). Although OSM and IL-6 tended to enhance TF expression by MDMs, the increase did not reach statistical significance. Anti-LIF receptor and anti-gp130 antibodies attenuated the effect of LIF on TF expression as assayed by both bioassay and flow-cytometry. In conclusion, LIF increases TF-PCA and TF protein in MDMs, and specific anti-LIF receptor antibodies attenuate this effect. Thus, LIF may regulate by a gp130-dependent pathway macrophage-mediated procoagulant function in diverse pathological states involving inflammation and thrombosis and seems to serve as an important mediator at the interface between these processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1960 and 1999, 2617 consecutive patients with Hodgkin's disease have been seen, treated, and rigorously followed at Stanford. This population includes patients of all ages and stages of disease. The database summarizing this experience serves as the source of survival and mortality data over 4 decades. Two thousand two hundred thirty-two of the population comprise the group evaluated for secondary cardiac disease. Two thousand one hundred sixty-two patients have been evaluated for risk of secondary leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and solid tumors. Eight hundred eighty-five women were evaluated for secondary breast cancer, prompting a subsequent analysis of risk of secondary cancer among 694 pediatric patients. RESULTS: The probability of cure of Hodgkin's disease has dramatically improved over the past 40 years. Today, 94% of patients are expected to survive. Among those who do not survive, approximately half die of Hodgkin's disease, 20% of new cancers, and 14% of cardiovascular complications. Modifications in patient management and treatment have greatly reduced the serious late effects observed from prior therapy. With current combined-modality therapy using moderate doses of involved field of radiation and limited cycles of multiagent, risk adapted chemotherapy, serious cardiac complications and development of secondary cancers are expected to be greatly reduced. The Stanford 25-year pediatric Hodgkin's disease experience reveals that survival in favorable early-stage disease exceeds 95%. Newer protocols for children with advanced-stage disease continue to show these excellent survival rates and promise less late morbidity. Adult protocols using the risk-adapted Stanford V combined-modality program now parallel the pediatric experience, with greater than 90% survival in these patients. DISCUSSION: Thus today the likelihood of cure of Hodgkin's disease greatly exceeds the risk of late effects, a goal both Dr. Henry Janeway and Madame Marie Curie emphasized and taught from first-hand experience.",,,,24,,,"['CA-34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-56060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The study population included 31 HAM patients (12 had associated SS), 15 HTLV-I seropositive/HAM negative patients with SS, and 41 HTLV-I seronegative patients with SS. Twenty HAM negative patients with sicca syndrome only were also studied. Diagnostic imaging (sialography, magnetic resonance imaging, and sonography) of the salivary glands, labial gland biopsy, Schirmer test, Saxon test, and serological tests were performed on these patients. RESULTS: The parotid and submandibular glands in 11 (92%) of the 12 HAM patients with SS completely lacked the abnormal imaging features characteristic of the disease, while they displayed decreased salivary flow rates at levels similar to those in the HAM negative patients with SS. The labial glands from the HAM patients with SS exhibited significantly lower magnitudes of mononuclear cell aggregation compared with those in the HAM negative patients with SS. In contrast, all HAM negative patients with SS showed abnormal imaging features characteristic of the disease, and the severity in salivary dysfunction correlated well with the imaging findings. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SS in patients with HAM may occur in part via a mechanism distinctive from classical SS in HAM negative patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the Crm1-dependent pathway used by complex retroviruses to export incompletely spliced viral transcripts is now fairly well understood, less is known about how simple retroviruses accomplish this task. However, the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) has been shown to encode a structured RNA sequence, termed the constitutive transport element (CTE), that recruits a cellular RNA export factor termed Tap. Here we demonstrate that a CTE previously proposed to be present in the avian sarcoma/leukemia (ASV/ALV) family of retroviruses indeed functions as a potent RNA export signal. We have mapped single- and double-stranded regions present in the ASV/ALV CTE in vitro and report that this CTE is predicted to fold into a structure bearing three distinct RNA stem-loops. However, only the central stem-loop is critical for CTE function and this 69-nt structure is, in fact, sufficient when present as a dimer. While the ASV/ALV CTE is shown to function independently of Crm1, as also previously reported for the MPMV CTE, it lacks any evident sequence homology to the highly conserved MPMV CTE sequence. Together, these data define the secondary structure and biological activity of an avian CTE sequence that may access a novel nuclear RNA export pathway.",,PMC1369885,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested that CLL cells may be regulated by inhibitory and growth-promoting signals exerted by autologous T cells. We have recently described a model for human B-CLL in which peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are transplanted into the peritoneal cavity of lethally irradiated mice radioprotected with bone marrow from mice with severe combined immunodeficiency. In this model, adoptive transfer of low-stage PBMCs leads to marked engraftment of T cells or combined T and CLL cell engraftment, whereas infusion of high-stage PBMCs leads to dominance of CLL cells with a miniscule level of T-cell engraftment. This mutual exclusive pattern of engraftment indicated that T cells might control the expansion of tumor cells in the peritoneum of recipient BALB/c mice. In the present study, we further investigated this question and we demonstrate that in vivo T-cell depletion, using OKT3 antibody, markedly enhances the engraftment of B-CLL cells from patients with early-stage disease. In mice receiving PBMCs from 11 donors with advanced-stage disease, the results were more heterogeneous. In five patients the results were similar to those observed in early stage, whereas in two cases no CLL cell engraftment was found in the absence of T cells. The addition of purified T cells to PBMCs led to a substantial decrease of CLL engraftment in three advanced-stage cases. These results strengthen the working hypothesis that autologous T cells can actively suppress the expansion of the pathological cells in human-->mouse radiation chimera. This effect is prominent in early-stage disease, whereas in advanced stage suppressive and/or stimulatory effects may occur in different patients. The interaction of T cells with tumor cells and the potential of autologous T cell/immune-therapy in CLL can be further explored in this model.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lack of clinical resistance between CdA and Fara-A has been demonstrated in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (G. Juliusson et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 327: 1056-1061, 1992). To clarify the differences in mechanism of resistance to CdA and Fara-A in vitro, we developed two stable, resistant cell lines, HL60/CdA and HL60/ Fara-A, by exposure to increasing concentrations of analogues over a period of 8 months. Resistant cells tolerated >8,000 and 5-fold higher concentrations of CdA and Fara-A, respectively. The specific activity of the nucleoside phosphorylating enzyme (using deoxycytidine as substrate) in cell extracts from HL60/CdA and HL60/Fara-A mutants was about 10 and 60%, respectively, compared with the parental cell line. Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody showed no detectable deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) protein in CdA-resistant cells, whereas in Fara-A-resistant cells, it was at the same level as in the parental cells. The mitochondrial enzyme deoxyguanosine kinase was not altered in resistant cell lines. The HL60/CdA cells showed cross-resistance to 2-chloro-2'-arabino-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine, Fara-A, arabinofuranosyl cytosine, difluorodeoxyguanosine, and difluorodeoxycytidine toxicity, most likely because of the decreased phosphorylation of these analogues by dCK. Using real-time quantitative PCR, the mRNA levels of dCK and cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT), a major nucleoside dephosphorylating enzyme, were measured. It was shown that the dCK mRNA levels in both CdA- and Fara-A resistant cells were decreased in parallel with the activity. The expression of 5'-NT mRNA was not significantly elevated in CdA- and Fara-A resistant cells, as compared with the parental cells. Ribonucleotide reductase maintains a balanced supply of deoxynucleotide triphosphate pools in the cell and may also be a major cellular target for CdA and Fara-A nucleotides. Except for the deoxycytidine triphosphate level, the intracellular deoxynucleotide triphosphate pools were significantly higher in Fara-A-resistant cells compared with the parental cell line. This might be a consequence of mutation or altered regulation of ribonucleotide reductase activity and may explain the 2-5-fold cross-resistance to several nucleoside analogues observed with HL60/Fara-A cells. It is likely that the resistance for CdA was mainly attributable to a dCK deficiency, and Fara-A-resistant cells might have another contributing factor to the resistance beyond the dCK deficiency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mitotic or reproductive cell death has been recognized after G2 arrest when cells are treated with antitumor agents. The precise mechanism of mode of action of 6MP still remains unclear. We found delayed cytotoxic effect of 6MP in P388 murine leukemic cells. Morphological study showed that 6MP induced delayed death was characterized by an enlargement of cell size and multinucleated nuclei. Agarose gel electrophoresis of fragmented DNA from cells treated with 6MP showed the typical ladder pattern. These findings were compatible with mitotic death. Our results make us hypothesize that the delayed cytotoxicity of 6MP is one of the drug induced mitotic deaths caused by DNA damage due to incorporation of 6-thioguanine (6TG) into DNA as thioguanine nucleotide (TGN). Mitotic death may be a mechanism for killing the cycling cells from residual leukemic cells in G0 or long G1 phases in the treatment of childhood ALL.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is disagreement on the in vivo consequences of the double infection. We investigated the interactions between HIV-1 and HTLV-I in monocyte-derived macrophages cultured in vitro. For study, the T cell-tropic strain IIIB and the macrophagetropic strain Ada-M of HIV-1 were used. The HTLV-I was prepared from the supernatants of the virus-producing MT-2 cell line. We found that coinfection of macrophages with T cell-tropic HIV-1 and HTLV-I significantly enhanced HIV-1 replication, whereas double infection of the cells with macrophage-tropic HIV-1 and HTLV-I resulted in marked upregulation of HTLV-I production. Stimulatory interactions between HIV-1 and HTLV-I were mediated by their trans-acting proteins. Results of study on nuclear translocation of proviral DNA showed that the tax gene product of HTLV-I was able to facilitate the nuclear import of the reverse-transcribed HIV-1(IIIB) DNA. In contrast, the HIV-1 Tat protein did not increase the intranuclear trafficking of HTLV-I DNA, which suggests another mechanism for HTLV-I enhancement by the tat gene product. In conclusion, this study provides possible mechanisms whereby coinfection of an individual with HIV-1 and HTLV-I may influence the clinical outcome of double infection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Skin lesions usually appear months to years after the diagnosis of leukemia and are unrelated to laboratory findings, disease course, or therapy. OBSERVATIONS: We describe 8 patients with various hematologic disorders (chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute monocytic leukemia, mantle-cell lymphoma, large-cell lymphoma, and myelofibrosis) who developed insect bite-like reaction. Although the clinical picture and the histological characteristics of the lesions were typical for insect bites, none of the patients actually had a history, course, or response to treatment suggestive of arthropod assaults. In 2 patients, the eruption preceded the diagnosis of the malignant neoplasm. The rash persisted for months to years and was resistant to therapies other than systemic corticosteroids. The 3 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia seemed to have a worse prognosis than expected for their disease. In 1, the polymerase chain reaction detected leukemic cells in the infiltrate. CONCLUSIONS: Insect bite-like reaction is an infrequent, disturbing, and difficult-to-treat nonspecific phenomenon in patients with hematologic malignant neoplasms. Since it may precede the hematologic disorder, oriented evaluation is warranted. We speculate that immunodeficiency plays a role in its pathogenesis; however, the exact pathogenesis and its prognostic implications await further studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The non-progression to AIDS of some HIV+ patients has been related to a strong type 1 cytokine response (IL-2, IL-12, and IFNgamma). For this reason, we investigated the ability of combination therapeutics to modulate cytokines in vivo towards a type 1 cytokine response in a murine retroviral infection using Friend leukemia virus (FLV). BALB/c mice were infected with FLV and treated with either 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), the immunomodulator methionine enkephalin (MENK), or a combination of both AZT and MENK starting 3 d post infection. Splenocytes were harvested on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 post treatment initiation and cultured with 1 microg/ml concanavalin A (ConA) for 24 h. Supernatants were examined for IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, and IFNgamma cytokine production using cytokine specific ELISAs. The levels of type 2 cytokines were not significantly changed by any treatment group over the course of the disease. However, although decreased in all infected animals, type 1 cytokines were partially maintained by the combination treatment through day 21. RT-PCR for cytokine specific mRNA confirmed these results, with expression of the type 1 cytokines, especially IFNgamma, being maintained through day 21.

Cross-linking of FcgammaRIIIB induces cell activation, but the mechanism is still uncertain. We have used mAbs to cross-link selectively each of the two receptors and to assess their signaling phenotypes and functional relation. Cross-linking of FcgammaRIIIB induces intracellular Ca2+ release and receptor capping. The Ca2+ response is blocked by wortmannin and by N,N-dimethylsphingosine, inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and sphingosine kinase, respectively. Identical dose-response curves are obtained for the Ca2+ release stimulated by cross-linking FcgammaRIIA, implicating these two enzymes in a common signaling pathway. Wortmannin also inhibits capping of both receptors, but not receptor endocytosis. Fluorescence microscopy in double-labeled PMNs demonstrates that FcgammaRIIA colocalizes with cross-linked FcgammaRIIIB. The signaling phenotypes of the two receptors diverge only under frustrated phagocytosis conditions, where FcgammaRIIIB bound to substrate-immobilized Ab does not elicit cell spreading. We propose that FcgammaRIIIB signaling is conducted by molecules of FcgammaRIIA that are recruited to protein/lipid domains induced by clustered FcgammaRIIIB and, thus, are brought into juxtaposition for immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif phosphorylation and activation of PMNs.",,,,,,,"['1S10RR09145-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'AI24322/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

However, less is known about the generation of new vessels in haematological malignancies and, in particular, in preleukaemic-myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In this study, bone marrow microvessel density (MVD) was assessed by immunohistochemistry and compared in trephine biopsies from 14 controls, five infectious disease (ID), 82 MDS, 15 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 14 myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) patients. Statistical analysis (P < 0.001) demonstrated that MDS MVD was higher than in controls and ID (21 +/- 9 vs 6 +/- 2 and 10 +/- 8 respectively) but lower than AML (30 +/- 12) and MPD (40 +/- 12). Among MDS-FAB subtypes, MVD was significantly higher in RAEB-t, CMML and fibrosis subsets compared to RA, RARS and RAEB subsets (P= 0.008). To further investigate angiogenesis machinery, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was evaluated by means of immunohistochemistry in control, MDS, AML and MPD biopsies. Even though VEGF mRNA expression was reported in the past in AML cell cultures and cell lines, in our samples VEGF expression was found to be particularly strong in most of the megakaryocytes but significantly less prominent in other cell populations including blasts. Since our findings suggest a correlation between angiogenesis and progression to leukaemia, additional work is now warranted to determine what regulates the generation of new vessels in MDS and leukaemia.",,PMC2362976,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These synthesized analogs were tested using a sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay for the drug-screening program at NCI on a variety of human cancer cell lines. As expected, most analogs exhibited potent and selective growth inhibition against leukemia. Analog 18 was specifically active against HL-60 and K-562 cell lines (GI50s: 0.05 microM and 0.07 microM, respectively) while analogs 14 and 17 were selectively potent against prostate and breast cancer cell lines (GI50s at micromolar levels). However, all analogs were less potent than 2 as growth inhibitors of some breast and colon cancer cell lines (e.g. MDA-MB-435 and HT-29).

However, taxane-based chemotherapy regimens recently have demonstrated more promising results. Several groups have reported significant efficacy and minimal toxicity in patients with hormone-refractory disease receiving estramustine plus docetaxel (Taxotere; Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Collegeville, PA). Others have demonstrated single-agent activity of platinum compounds in HRPC. Therefore, the combination of estramustine, docetaxel, and carboplatin is currently being tested in two separate trials of HRPC. The first is a Dana-Farber/Partners Cancer Care phase I study of estramustine, carboplatin, and escalating doses of weekly docetaxel. The second study is a Cancer and Leukemia Group B multicenter phase II study evaluating the combination of estramustine, docetaxel, carboplatin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. The promise of taxane-based regimens in the treatment of hormone-refractory disease has led to consideration of treating patients at high risk for developing metastatic disease earlier in their clinical course. At Dana-Farber/ Partners Cancer Care, we are evaluating neoadjuvant weekly docetaxel alone followed by surgery in patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer using pathologic response as the primary end point.

Somatic-cell therapy involves the administration to cancer patients of living cells that have been genetically manipulated or processed to change their biological characteristics. Gene therapy of cancer, although much hyped, is still in its very early infancy. Current approaches to delivering genes into cells include physico-chemical methods, viral vectors and direct DNA injection. None of these strategies is in any way perfect and their efficacy leaves much to be desired. Based on the somatic mutation theory of carcinogenesis, it would be attractive to repair genetic alterations responsible for neoplastic transformation and clonal evolution of cancer cells. Attempts have been made to replace inactivated tumour suppressor genes in cancer cells through intact wild type gene copies, or to suppress the leukaemogenic effects of chromosomal fusion genes in leukaemia through antisense oligonucleotides. One of the snags of these concepts is that cancer cells harbour several if not myriads of mutated genes, and clonal tumour heterogeneity seems to be the rule rather than the exception. It is at present impossible to repair all gene mutations in cancer lesions of a given patient if such were to be the aim of therapy. Nevertheless, some interesting clinical data have been reported. These include the local injection via bronchoscopy of p53 wild type gene copies into p53-deficient lung cancer lesions and other tumours. Somatic-cell therapy includes a considerable spectrum of interventions. Tumour cells may be transduced with genes which upon their expression will render the tumour cells more immunogenic. Tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes may be harvested, transduced with a gene of interest and re-injected. Since they recognise tumours specifically, they will serve as vehicles to carry therapeutic genes into cancer lesions where the gene product can exert an anti-cancer effect. Such attempts might increase the immunogenicity of tumours considerably. Examples are the transduction of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes with a gene for tumour necrosis factor alpha or the transduction of tumour cells with the gene for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Protocols on gene therapy and somatic-cell therapy seem to be a worthy goal of cancer research. However, it seems unlikely that gene therapy will provide magic anti-cancer bullets in the near future or the definitive cancer cure, although this is often promised in the media. Careful clinical and laboratory research will pave the way towards stepwise improvement of cancer patient care.",Molekulare Therapie bei malignen Tumoren.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only 10 residues were invariant across the entire sample set, but secondary structure predictions for the enzymes from E. coli, yeast, human liver and diverse retroviruses (HIV, Rous sarcoma virus, foamy viruses) supported, in every case, the five beta-strands (1 to 5) and four or five alpha-helices (A, B/C, D, E) that have been identified by crystallography in the RNase H domain of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and in E. coli RNase H. In the case of MLV, analysis of the RNase H domain sequences inferred from 10 different strains (including the amphotropic 4070A) predicted all five alpha-helices (A-E), as well as beta-strands 4 and 5.

Many regimens administered to patients are derived from artificial model systems involving permanent leukemic cell lines. The differences in pharmacokinetics between the in vivo situation and such cell lines are largely neglected. However, cytidine deaminase activity in particular has a major impact on AraC pharmacokinetics by degrading AraC to its inactive metabolite AraU, and it has been shown to be of prognostic relevance in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. This study therefore investigated cytidine deaminase activities and AraC deamination in a variety of the most commonly used leukemic cell lines and fresh blasts and their impact on the results of an in vitro model system. It was found that cells from different cell lines (BLIN, CEM, HL60, K562, RAJI, REH, U937) vary greatly in cytidine deaminase activity (e.g., 1.89 nmol per min/mg in K562 versus 0.01 in BLIN cells) and degrade between 18.5 (BLIN) and 96.5% (REH) of AraC to AraU in the incubation medium. This degradation results in highly different AraC exposures for different cells (e.g., AUC of 960 ng per h/ml in REH versus 4048 ng per h/ml in BLIN cells) in spite of identical starting concentrations of the drug. Formation of AraCTP as the main cytotoxic metabolite of AraC is significantly influenced by the differences in cell type-dependent cytidine deaminase activity (e.g., 35.6 ng/10(7) cells in REH versus 180.2 ng/10(7) cells in BLIN cells). In contrast to permanent cell lines, fresh leukemic blasts and normal bone marrow mononuclear cells featured low AraC degradation in the model system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixty patients were in chronic phase, 18 in accelerated phase, and ten in blast crisis. Marrow donors were HLA-identical siblings for 64 patients (BM 58, PBSC 6), 2-antigen-mismatched related donors (RD) for two, HLA-identical unrelated donors (URD) for 17, and 1-antigen-mismatched URD for five. The median time from diagnosis to BMT was 22 months (range 2-91), and 63 patients had received prior interferon (IFN)-alpha therapy, 46 (73%) for more than 6 months. Conditioning therapy consisted of cyclophosphamide (CY) and total body irradiation (TBI) in 71 patients and CY and busulfan (BU) in 16. One patient received etoposide and TBI. For graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis methotrexate (MTX) was given to 12 patients, MTX and cyclosporin A (CSA) to 67, CSA alone to four, and CSA and methylprednisolone to five. Durable engraftment was documented in 80 of 82 patients (98%).

Probability of overall survival is 59%, for patients undergoing transplantation in chronic phase and 44% for patients undergoing transplantation in advanced stage CML. Probability of disease-free survival (DFS) after sibling and URD BMT is 55% and 59%, respectively. Ten patients (12%) experienced relapse of CML. Transplant-related mortality was 32% both after RD and after URD transplantation. Acute GVHD occurred in 53 of 80 evaluable patients (66%), consisting of grade III or IV in 14 patients (18%). Chronic GVHD developed in 40 of 63 eligible patients (63%), including extensive disease in 26 patients (41%).

In comparison to control specimens, a significant decrease in erythroid precursors is determinable in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), while this cell lineage is most prominent in polycythemia vera (PV) and moderately to markedly reduced in idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF). On the other hand, neutrophilic granulopoiesis shows a predominance in CML and a relevant increase in PV, but no conspicuous changes are detectable in essential thrombocythemia (ET). CML is characterized by a prevalent growth of dwarflike micromegakaryocytes, occurring in particular in the so-called megakaryocyte-rich subtypes (about 30%). This finding differs significantly from the pleomorphous aspect, i.e. , clusters of small to giant-sized megakaryocytes in PV and the grossly abnormal (dysplastic) appearance of this cell lineage in patients with IMF. Similar cytological abnormalities of megakaryopoiesis consistent with maturation defects are never encountered in ET. The incidence of mature (resident) macrophages (phagocytic reticular cells) is significantly enhanced in IMF in comparison to the other MPDs and controls. Moreover, there is a striking difference in the density of reticulin-collagen fibers, ranging from normal (ET) to extreme values (IMF). In IMF more than 80% of the patients present with some degree of myelofibrosis-osteosclerosis at diagnosis, while the rest show an initial prefibrotic, hypercellular stage. This feature deserves special attention since, when accompanied by thrombocythemia, it may simulate ET. Sequential bone marrow biopsies in patients with IMF disclose that evolution of myelofibrosis is progressive, but occurs at a variable and unpredictable speed. A synoptical approach regarding clinical diagnosis and histological subtyping of MPDs is explicitly recommended and demonstrated by sets of diagnostic criteria. This rationale requires equal consideration of laboratory data and morphology by clinicians to include well-defined subtypes of MPDs into prospective management studies. Furthermore, it may even warrant follow-up studies and repeated bone marrow examinations in initially unclassifiable cases.",,,,54,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, antisense oligonucleotides developed to date manifest two serious limitations-nuclease susceptibility and nonspecific hybridization. Circular oligonucleotides may be superior to conventional linear oligonucleotides in both respects. First, circular agents, having no ends, are exonuclease-resistant. Second, they bind to complementary strands of RNA and DNA with a higher affinity than corresponding linear agents. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the activity of circular phosphodiester deoxynucleotides using chronic myeloid cell lines by targeting polypurine sequences. To represent cells having a bcr3/abl2-type junction, we used K562 cells. A circle targeting a bcr polypurine sequence 385 nucleotides 5' to the junction decreased the cell number by day 5 with an IC(50) of 9 microM. To represent cells having a bcr2/abl2-type junction, we used BV173 cells. A circle targeting the bcr-abl junction itself decreased the cell number by day 7 with an IC(50) of 8 microM. Control oligonucleotides, whether the same sequence uncircularized or circles with the same nucleotide composition but in scrambled sequence, had little effect. Unlike linear agents, circles were stable when incubated in 10% serum. The amount of bcr-abl protein detected by Western blotting using a specific anti-bcr-abl antibody at 24 hr in antisense-treated BV173 cells was only 10% of that of cells treated with control circles, which demonstrates an antisense mechanism of action. CONCLUSIONS: Circular oligodeoxyribonucleotides (1) inhibit the accumulation of CML cells, (2) decrease the amount of bcr-abl protein per cell, (3) have sequence-selective activity, and (4) are more active than linear oligonucleotides containing only the base-pairing region.",,PMC2230474,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These hybrids 22-25 contain from one to four pyrrole units, respectively. To investigate sequence selectivity and stability of drug/DNA complexes, DNase I footprinting and arrested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed on human c-myc oncogene, estrogen receptor gene, and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat (HIV-1 LTR) gene sequences. The antiproliferative activity of the hybrids has been tested in vitro on human myeloid leukemia K562 and T-lymphoid Jurkat cell lines and compared to antiproliferative effects of the natural product distamycin A 1, its tetrapyrrole homologue 17, DC 81 (4), and the PBD methyl ester 12. The results obtained demonstrate that the hybrids 22-25 exhibit different DNA-binding activity with respect to both distamycin A 1 and PBD 12. In addition, a direct relationship was found between number of pyrrole rings present in the hybrids 22-25 and stability of drug/DNA complexes. With respect to antiproliferative effects, it was found that the increase in the length of the polypyrrole backbone leads to an increase of in vitro antiproliferative effects, i.e., the hybrid 25 containing the four pyrroles is more active than 22, 23, and 24 both against K562 and Jurkat cell lines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prototypic v-Myc gene of MC29 virus differs from avian c-Myc by a series of mutations, including a change at a regulatory phosphorylation site within the mutational hotspot (thr-61) which is known to potentiate transformation in vitro. We now show that the mutation at thr-61 stabilizes the v-Myc protein (turnover difference) and that this single mutation is both necessary and sufficient for the phenotype. A major involvement of the proteasome in Myc degradation was confirmed, but surprisingly, a dilysine motif adjacent to thr-61 proved not to be the ubiquitin target. Two other v-Myc genes which carry a mutation at thr-61 (avian MH2) or a large deletion encompassing this domain (feline T17) were found to be stabilized to a similar extent as MC29, showing that stabilization is a common feature of independently derived Myc oncogenes. These results suggest a common selective process in the genesis of these three viral oncoproteins and a mechanistic link with Jun, Fos and Myb oncoproteins which are also stabilized relative to their cellular counterparts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report we show that stable-transfected HIV-Tat cells are primed to undergo apoptosis upon serum withdrawal. This effect was observed in both the Jhan T cell line and the K562 cells, the latter expressing the bcr-abl chimeric gene, which confers resistance to apoptosis induced by different stimuli. Using a cytofluorimetric approach we have determined that serum withdrawal induces a disruption of the transmembrane mitochondrial potential (Deltapsim) followed by an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the subsequent DNA nuclear loss in K562-Tat cells but not in the K562-pcDNA cell line. These pre-apoptotic events were associated with the cleavage of the caspase-3, while the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Bax proteins was not affected by the presence of Tat. Regardless of the steady state of the Bax protein, we found that in both K562 and K562-Tat cells, this protein is located in the nucleus, but after serum withdrawal its localization was mainly in the cytoplasm. The activity of caspase-3 detected in K562-Tat cells after serum withdrawal paralleled with the mitochondria permeability transition. Nevertheless, in Jhan-Tat cells the inhibition of this caspase with the specific inhibitor, z-DEVD-cmk, did not affect the disruption of the mitochondria potential induced by serum withdrawal. Interestingly, we found that HIV-Tat protein accumulates at the mitochondria in the K562-Tat cells cultured under low serum conditions, and this mitochondrial localization correlated with the Deltapsim disruption detected in these cells. In addition, HIV-1 Tat protein synergies with protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), a ligand of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor, in the induction of apoptosis in both Jhan and K562 cells. Thus, HIV-1 Tat protein may induce apoptosis by a mechanism that involves mitochondrial PT and may contribute to the lymphocyte depletion seen in AIDS patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These observations led us to analyse the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome arm 11q in 113 primary childhood ALL samples using 14 microsatellite markers. LOH was found in 18 (16%) patients. Detailed examination identified three distinct regions of deletion. The first region is flanked by D11S901 and D11S1391 at 11q22-23 containing the ATM gene. Mutational analysis suggested that the altered gene in this region is not the ATM gene. The second region is flanked by D11S614 and D11S924 at 11q23 containing the MLL gene. The third region is flanked by D11S1356 and D11S614 at 11q23 containing the MLL gene. All the cases with LOH at MLL locus lacked detectable MLL gene rearrangements. In addition, 20 children have been studied both at initial diagnosis and relapse; none of the individuals who relapsed acquired LOH of 11q, suggesting that 11q deletions were infrequently involved in the progression of childhood ALL. Children with 11q LOH had a good response to induction chemotherapy (P=0.015). These data suggest that alterations of putative tumor suppressor genes on 11q are important events in development of childhood ALL. Our map provides important information toward cloning putative tumor suppressor genes associated with childhood ALL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously observed that cAMP analogs prevented the late down-regulation of c-myb during hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA)-induced differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells and blocked differentiation; this correlated with the induction of NF-kappaB (p50/RelB) complexes which were shown to bind to NF-kappaB recognition sites flanking the transcriptional pause site of c-myb. We now selected stably-transfected MEL cells which overexpressed p50, RelB or both at levels similar to those induced by cAMP to determine whether these NF-kappaB proteins regulate c-myb expression in intact cells. We demonstrate that transcriptionally active NF-kappaB (p50/RelB) complexes, but not p50 or RelB alone, prevented the early and late down-regulation of c-myb mRNA and increased c-myb transcriptional elongation in HMBA-induced MEL cells. The increase in c-myb expression was sufficient to block erythroid differentiation and allow continuous proliferation of cells in the presence of HMBA.

A third, FIDelta, contains a 37 amino acid duplication in the extracellular domain. We have shown previously that when expressed in primary murine haemopoietic cells, the extracellular mutants confer factor-independence on cells of the neutrophil and monocyte lineages only, whereas V449E does so on all cell types of the myeloid and erythroid compartments. To study the in vivo effects and leukaemic potential of these mutants, we have expressed all three in mice by bone marrow reconstitution using retrovirally infected donor cells. Expression of the extracellular mutants leads to an early onset, chronic myeloproliferative disorder marked by elevations in the neutrophil, monocyte, erythrocyte and platelet lineages. In contrast, expression of V449E leads to an acute leukaemia-like syndrome of anaemia, thrombocytopaenia and blast cell expansion.

In contrast to its transitory activation during normal growth-signal transduction, NF-kappaB is constitutively deployed in T-cells transformed by the type 1 human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1). This viral/host interaction is mediated by the HTLV-1-encoded Tax protein, which has potent oncogenic properties. As reviewed here, Tax activates NF-kappaB primarily via a pathway leading to the chronic phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha, a cytoplasmic inhibitor of NF-kappaB. To access this pathway, Tax associates stably with a cytokine-inducible IkappaB kinase (IKK), which contains both catalytic (IKKalpha and IKKbeta) and noncatalytic (IKKgamma) subunits. Unlike their transiently induced counterparts in cytokine-treated cells, Tax-associated forms of IKKalpha and IKKbeta are persistently activated in HTLV-1-infected T cells. Acquisition of the deregulated IKK phenotype is contingent on the presence of IKKgamma, which functions as a molecular adaptor in the assembly of pathologic Tax/IkappaB kinase complexes. These findings highlight a key mechanistic role for IKK in the Tax/NF-kappaB signaling axis and define new intracellular targets for the therapeutic control of HTLV-1-associated disease.",,,,185,,,"['CA68471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA82556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The translocation results in the formation of a fusion gene on the derivative 11 chromosome consisting of the 5' part of the MLL gene and the 3' part of another gene; already more than 30 different partner chromosome regions have been described. MLL gene rearrangements are generally correlated with a poor prognosis. Therefore the presence of an 11q23 aberration has direct implications for treatment stratification, making early and rapid detection of utmost importance. In this study, we developed a FISH probe set for detection of MLL gene rearrangements according to strict design criteria. The cosmid probes are derived from the flanking regions of the MLL breakpoint region on chromosome 11 and when used in dual colored FISH experiments give rise to a split of the normally colocalizing (fused) signals in case of a translocation. This split signal was observed in seven out of 10 cases with an 11q23 translocation with various partner chromosomes. In the three other cases, a deletion of the 3' part of the MLL gene, downstream of the breakpoint region was also found. A low false positive value of only 1.7% was obtained for interphase cells in contrast to conventional dual colored FISH where the creation of a fusion signal has cut off values of at least 5-10%. A major advantage of our type of probe set is the application of a single FISH experiment to detect all types of MLL translocations. Moreover, since this cosmid probe set can be used for either interphase or metaphase studies, metaphases are no longer a prerequisite for detecting the presence of an 11q23 translocation. Nevertheless, metaphase FISH with the new probe set is helpful in determining the partner chromosome and therefore may lead to the identification of new partner genes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate in T-PLL the role of other genes with comparable function, a fluorescence-based semi-automated assay was developed for BAT-25 and BAT-26.

After being mapped to the chromosomal region 1p35-1p36, it has been postulated to act as a tumor suppressor gene, too, as this region is altered in several human malignancies. Deletions of the short arm of chromosome 1 have frequently been described in multiple myeloma (MM) whereas structural abnormalities of the 17p13 region including p53 are rare events in this disease. Since it has been proposed that especially neoplasias lacking p53 alterations might show a loss of heterozygosity at 1p35-1p36, we studied the frequency of p53 and p73 deletions in bone marrow mononuclear cells of 68 patients with MM, two patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and four patients with plasma cell leukemia. Dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for p53 and p73 was performed using commercially available DNA probes for 17p13.3 and the microsatellite marker D1Z2, respectively. Centromeric DNA probes served to distinguish gene deletions from whole chromosome losses. In contrast to recently published FISH results, we only detected heterozygous p53 deletions in eight out of the 74 patients, three of them showing a monosomy 17. Heterozygous deletions of the D1Z2 region at 1p36 were found in six cases with one patient having a monosomy 1. Neither homozygous deletions of either chromosomal region nor nullisomies 1 or 17 could be detected. These results argue against a major role of p73 deletions in MM. As MM patients with 1p structural abnormalities have a significantly poorer survival rate than those with normal karyotypes, the role of other putative tumor suppressor genes located at the chromosomal region 1p36 in the pathogenesis of MM has to be determined.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lymphomas were reclassified according to the REAL and updated Kiel classification. The clinical presentation, survival and prognostic factors were investigated. Sixty patients had sufficient clinical information and adequate follow-up to be included in the study. All 33 PLB that could be immunophenotyped were of B cell origin. According to the REAL classification, most PLB were large (B) cell lymphomas (92%) and according to the Kiel classification 45% of the tumours were centroblastic multilobated. PLB presented most often in the long bones (48%), with Ann Arbor stage I (46%), II (16%), IV (16%) and unknown (20%). Stage IV disease was exclusively caused by the presence of multiple bone lesions. Notwithstanding the heterogeneous treatment, the 5-year overall survival was 61%; 46% of patients were progression free at 5 years.

We have recently shown in a study of 55 patients with acute leukemias (ALL 21, AML 20 and MDS 14), that patients who demonstrate increase amounts of autologous marrow repopulation (increasing mixed chimerism) have a significantly enhanced risk of relapse (P < 0. 0001). Based on these findings, we asked whether post-transplant relapse can be prevented by withdrawal of immunosuppression and/or by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). We describe the results of a pilot study where adoptive immunotherapy was used to treat 12 patients (five ALL, three AML, four MDS) who showed increasing mixed chimerism (MC) post-transplant. A response to immunotherapy, defined as the re-establishment of complete chimerism (CC) and continuous complete remission (CCR), was achieved in four patients (two ALL, two AML) following withdrawal of CsA and in a further six patients (three ALL, three MDS) after additional DLI. One ALL patient, who initially responded to DLI, developed severe GVHD that required further immunosuppression. GVHD was controlled but this patient subsequently relapsed. Another patient with ALL became a CC but developed an isolated relapse in the bone marrow 260 days later. One patient with MDS developed severe GVHD after DLI and died. Two children (one AML and one MDS) did not show any response to interventional treatment and died due to relapse. Of the 12 patients treated, seven remain in CCR at a median follow-up of 747 days (range 351-1109 days). In summary, these results provide evidence that increasing MC can be used to guide adoptive immunotherapy strategies and that these treatment modalities can be used to prevent relapse in children with acute leukemias or MDS after allo-SCT.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, a temporal correlation between molecular and hematologic assessment of engraftment has not been clearly established. To address this issue, and to determine the potential clinical implications of early kinetics of mixed chimerism, we have investigated 66 allogeneic stem cell transplantations (SCTs) in 58 pediatric patients suffering from different types of leukemia (n = 44) or non-malignant hematologic disorders (n = 14) by close molecular monitoring during the first days and weeks after transplantation. Patient- and donor-derived hematopoiesis were assessed at 1- to 3-day intervals in peripheral blood samples by PCR analysis of highly polymorphic microsatellite loci (STR-PCR). Detection of an increasing, and ultimately dominant donor-specific allelic pattern, which we defined as molecular engraftment, preceded hematologic engraftment by a median of 7 days (range 1-17 days) in all patients investigated. PCR analyses during the first days after transplantation facilitated detection of molecular engraftment according to the above definition by day +14 (range day +2 to day +14), thus permitting prediction of successful engraftment (upper limit of the two-sided confidence interval po = 6%) while the peripheral leukocyte counts were mostly below 200/microl. In three cases, however, the criteria for molecular engraftment were not fulfilled by day +14. These patients also failed to show hematologic engraftment, and required a second transplantation. Close monitoring by STR-PCR showed that graft rejection and autologous recovery can occur early and with very rapid dynamics. Molecular analysis of specific leukocyte subsets isolated by flow-sorting enabled sensitive assessment of changes in the pattern of chimerism which had escaped detection in assays using whole white blood cell (WBC) samples. This approach facilitated the identification of expanding or decreasing recipient cells, and permitted early detection of impending rejection or relapse. Moreover, monitoring of the dynamics of chimerism allowed rapid assessment of the response to therapy. Our observations provide support for the concept of initiating genotype analyses early after SCT and monitoring at rather short intervals to permit timely evaluation of clinically relevant processes, and to provide a basis for early implementation of treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

H-IL-6, which acts on both IL-6Ralpha-positive and IL-6Ralpha-negative cells, effectively synergized with FL and TPO with or without SCF for the propagation of primitive progenitors. However, IL-6 showed a greater synergistic effect with FL and TPO than H-IL-6 for long-term progenitor propagation. During the first 6 weeks of culture under stroma-free serum-containing conditions, IL-6 induced a 1.96 +/- 0.64-fold higher expansion of nucleated cells, a 2.28 +/- 0.33-fold higher expansion of CD34+ cells and a 2.74 +/- 0. 28-fold higher expansion of CD34+ AC133+ cells than H-IL-6 in combination with FL and TPO. The propagation of week 6 CAFC was up to four-fold higher in the presence of IL-6 than with H-IL-6. While the expansion of CD34+ and CD34+ AC133+ cells dropped after 5-7 weeks in the stroma-free cultures with FL, TPO and H-IL-6, a sustained expansion for 12 weeks was obtained in the presence of FL, TPO and IL-6. Stroma-contact greatly enhanced the progenitor expansion induced by FL and TPO or FL, TPO and H-IL-6 although the highest proliferation was again obtained in the presence of IL-6. In contrast, the presence of SCF resulted in increased differentiation. Since the majority of primitive progenitors are proposed to be IL-6Ralpha-negative, the results suggest that the synergistic effect of IL-6 is mediated by accessory cells, which have been more effectively stimulated by IL-6 than by the fusion peptide, H-IL-6, in this culture system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the current dogma that drug resistance is always an obstacle for treatment, here I show that it provides opportunities for selective protection of non-resistant cells with killing of drug-resistant cancer cells. According to the proposed 'two-drug' strategy, the first drug should be ineffective against a target drug-resistant cell (ie the drug is a substrate of MRP or Pgp pumps). In addition, it must be cytostatic but not cytotoxic. The second drug, which is applied in sequence, must be a cycle-dependent apoptotic drug to which the target cell is not cross-resistant. Thus, low doses of adriamycin, etoposide and actinomycin D, used as the first drugs, were cytostatic to parental HL60 cells. Therefore, these drugs precluded Bcl-2/Raf-1 phosphorylation, PARP cleavage and cell death which are otherwise induced by paclitaxel, a mitosis-selective apoptotic drug for HL60 cells. In contrast, HL60/ADR cells which express MRP, a transporter which pumps out the first drugs from a cell, were insensitive to the first drugs and therefore readily underwent apoptosis following the second drug. This strategy also allowed a selective killing of HL60/TX cells which express MDR-1, with the only difference being that the second drug, paclitaxel, was substituted for epothilones, non-Pgp substrates. Lack of protection by the first drug, a Pgp substrate, resulted in HL60/TX killing by the second drug, whereas parental HL-60 cells were fully protected. Therefore, drug resistant cells can be selectively killed by a combination of drugs not killing sensitive cells. Lack of toxicity against normal cells will be clinically translated in reduction of adverse side-effects of chemotherapy against drug-resistant malignancies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The accumulated and retained DNR content was not related to the degree of DNR resistance, nor did the content differ between 53 initial and 20 relapse ALL samples (P >0. 05), although the latter were median two-fold more resistant to DNR (P = 0.004). Leukemic cell volume correlated with resistance to the anthracyclines DNR (Rs 0.32, P = 0.012) and idarubicin (Rs 0.46, P = 0.011) but not to other classes of drugs such as prednisolone, vincristine, L-asparaginase and etoposide. Relapsed patients had 1. 5-fold larger cells than patients at initial diagnosis of ALL (P = 0. 001). After cell volume correction, the intracellular DNR concentration was lower in relapsed compared with initial ALL cells (eg 60 min accumulation, P = 0.003). Moreover, the intracellular DNR concentration inversely correlated with DNR resistance, both in the accumulation (Rs -0.44, P < 0.001) and retention (Rs -0.33, P = 0. 016) test condition. The accumulated DNR concentration inversely correlated with expression of LRP (Rs -0.36, P = 0.012) but not with P-gp and MRP. Expression of LRP, but not of P-gp and MRP, significantly correlated with DNR resistance in childhood ALL (Rs 0. 33, P = 0.03). In conclusion, the intracellular DNR concentration and the expression level of LRP may contribute to DNR resistance in childhood ALL. The strength of the correlations also indicates that resistance to anthracyclines can not be explained by one single mechanism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a 24-h Ara-C protection assay we showed that MIP-1alpha confers protection to normal CFC but also sensitizes CML CFC to Ara-C. The differential MIP-1alpha responsiveness was not due to a down-regulation of MIP-1alpha receptors on CML CD34+ cells as flow cytometric analysis showed similar binding of a biotinylated MIP-1alpha molecule to normal and CML CD34+ cells. Flow cytometric analysis of the MIP-1alpha receptor subtype CCR-5 revealed comparable CCR-5 expression levels on normal and CML CD34+ cells. Furthermore, culture of CD34+ cells for 10 h in the presence of TNF-alpha resulted in an increased MIP-1alpha receptor expression on both normal and CML CD34+ cells. Our data suggest that the unresponsiveness of CML CFC to the growth inhibitory effect of MIP-1alpha is not caused by a lack of MIP-1alpha receptor or total uncoupling of the MIP-1alpha responsiveness but may be due to an intracellular signalling defect downstream of the receptors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is unclear whether co-activation of HOXA9 and MEIS genes is a common occurrence in human leukemias. We surveyed expression of HOXA9 and MEIS1 in 24 leukemic cell lines and 80 patient samples, using RNase protection analyses and immunohistochemistry. We demonstrate that the expression of HOXA9 and MEIS1 in leukemia cells is uniquely myeloid, and that these genes are commonly co-expressed in myeloid cell lines and in samples of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) of all subtypes except in promyelocytic leukemia. While HOXA9 is expressed in most cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia, MEIS1 is weakly expressed or not at all. Immunohistochemical staining of selected AML samples showed moderate to high levels of HOXA9 protein, primarily cytoplasmic, in leukemic myeloblasts, with weaker and primarily nuclear staining for MEIS1. These data support the concept that co-activation of HOXA9 and MEIS1 is a common event in AML, and may represent a common pathway of many different oncogenic mutations.",,,,,,,"['CA80029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK48642/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The gene product, a 45 kDa basic nuclear factor containing a leucine repeat, was transiently expressed in HeLa or COS-7 cells and immunocharacterized within the nuclei in fine punctuated structures which increase in size after cell transfection. Jem-1 was not expressed in the nucleoli. Experimental deletion of peptide domains of Jem-1 (JemDelta331-400 and Jem DeltaL179-206) showed that its C-terminal sequence (Thr331 --> Leu400) is required for nuclear translocation, while the leucine repeat domain (Arg179 --> Glu206) has no influence on subcellular localization. The Jem-1 protein was not detected in the PML-containing nuclear bodies or in speckled structures containing the splicing factor SC-35. In contrast it was localized in the nucleus in structures containing activator protein-1 (AP-1). DNA mobility shift assays showed that the in vitro translated Jem protein interacts neither with the DNA binding site of AP-1, nor directly with in vitro co-translated c-Fos or/and c-Jun proteins bound to this specific sequence. Interestingly, Jem-1-1 increased substantially the transcriptional activity of c-Jun (three-fold) and more strongly that of ectopically co-expressed c-Fos and c-Jun (five- to six-fold), as measured by a CAT reporter gene driven by a heterologous promoter containing the AP-1 binding site of the human collagenase gene. These synergistic effects were strongly Jem-1 dose-dependent. However, Jem-1 alone showed no activity on the collagenase promoter. A deletion of the leucine repeat of Jem-1 (Arg179 --> Glu206) did not diminish the enhancer capacity of Jem-1 on AP-1 activity. In contrast, the enhanced AP-1 activity was abrogated when Jem-1 was deleted of its C-terminus (Thr331 --> Leu400). We conclude that the 45 kDa nuclear product of the JEM-1 gene has features of a novel transcription cofactor, which is enhancing AP-1 activity without directly interacting with c-Jun or c-Fos proteins. Possible implications of these findings for APL cell maturation are discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we analyzed expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 in B-CLL, and investigated the functional effect of SDF-1 on the malignant cells. By flow cytometry, CXCR4 was consistently expressed on circulating CLL cells at a fluorescence intensity four-fold greater than that of normal B cells, and three-fold greater than that of CD19+/CD5+ cells from the normal bone marrow. CXCR4 was functionally active as demonstrated by a rapid flux of intracellular free calcium in response to SDF-1, which was significantly reduced by the partially blocking CXCR4 antibody 12G5. Moreover, transendothelial migration of B-CLL cells in vitro was stimulated by conditioned medium from bone marrow stromal cells due to its content of SDF-1, as suggested by reduced migration after addition of the CXCR4 antibody 12G5. In accordance with the CXCR4 overexpression, migration of CLL cells was more efficiently stimulated by recombinant SDF-1 compared to migration of normal B cells. We conclude that CXCR4 is overexpressed and functionally active in B-CLL, and may therefore contribute to the tropism of B-CLL cells for the bone marrow stroma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study apoptosis-regulating factors in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we investigated cell samples of adults with de novo AML by flow cytometry for constitutive expression levels of the apoptosis-related molecules CD95 (n = 135), Bcl-2 (n = 131), and Bax (n = 66), as well as spontaneous apoptosis in vitro (n = 104) and susceptibility to anti-CD95-induced apoptosis (CD95 sensitivity) (n = 93). We correlated these findings with P-gp function as detected by the rhodamine123-efflux test (n = 121), immunophenotype, FAB morphology, cytogenetics, and clinical data of the examined patients. Immature FAB M0/1 AML cells expressed significantly more Bcl-2 (P < 0.0002) and less CD95 (P < 0.0003) compared with AML cells of the more mature FAB M2-5 subtypes. No maturation-dependent difference in Bax expression was observed. FAB M2-5 AML cells were more susceptible to anti-CD95-induced apoptosis (P < 0.008) and showed a lower P-gp function (P < 0.002) than FAB M0/1 AML cells. Leukemic cells of AML patients who achieved a complete remission (CR) after induction chemotherapy expressed less Bcl-2 than non-responder (NR) (69 CR, 23 NR; P = 0.05). CR was associated with a higher extent of spontaneous apoptosis in vitro (58 CR, 17 NR; P=0.05) and a tendency towards a higher CD95 expression (73 CR, 23 NR; P = 0.08) compared to NR. CR also correlated with a low P-gp function (70 CR, 21 NR; P = 0.008) and a tendency towards CD34 negativity (73 CR, 23 NR; P = 0.08). No correlation between Bax expression and response to induction chemotherapy (49 CR, 12 NR) was observed. In stepwise logistic regression analyses, P-gp function and the extent of spontaneous apoptosis in vitro as well as CD95 sensitivity but not Bcl-2, CD95, Bax, and CD34 expression levels emerged as significant markers for response to induction chemotherapy. We conclude that the constitutive expression of CD95 and Bcl-2, as well as CD95 sensitivity and P-gp function but not constitutive Bax expression depend on the maturation stage of leukemic cells in adult de novo AML. P-gp function, the extent of spontaneous apoptosis in vitro and CD95 sensitivity are more predictive for response to induction chemotherapy in adult de novoAML than the constitutive expression levels of the apoptosis-related molecules CD95, Bcl-2 and Bax.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, multicenter international treatment protocols with MRD-based stratification of treatment need careful standardization and quality control of the MRD techniques. This was the aim of the European BIOMED-1 Concerted Action 'Investigation of minimal residual disease in acute leukemia: international standardization and clinical evaluation' with participants of 14 laboratories in eight European countries (ES, NL, PT, IT, DE, FR, SE and AT). Standardization and quality control was performed for the three main types of MRD techniques, ie flow cytometric immunophenotyping, PCR analysis of antigen receptor genes, and RT-PCR analysis of well-defined chromosomal aberrations. This study focussed on the latter MRD technique. A total of nine well-defined chromosome aberrations with fusion gene transcripts were selected: t(1;19) with E2A-PBX1, t(4;11) with MLL-AF4, t(8;21) with AML1-ETO, t(9;22) with BCR-ABL p190 and BCR-ABL p210, t(12;21) with TEL-AML1, t(15;17) with PML-RARA, inv (16) with CBFB-MYH11, and microdeletion 1p32 with SIL-TAL1. PCR primers were designed according to predefined criteria for single PCR (external primers A <--> B) and nested PCR (internal primers C <--> D) as well as for 'shifted' PCR with a primer upstream (E5' primer) or downstream (E3' primer) of the external A <--> B primers. The 'shifted' E primers were designed for performing an independent PCR together with one of the internal primers for confirmation (or exclusion) of positive results. Various local RT and PCR protocols were compared and subsequently a common protocol was designed, tested and adapted, resulting in a standardized RT-PCR protocol. After initial testing (with adaptations whenever necessary) and approval by two or three laboratories, the primers were tested by all participating laboratories, using 17 cell lines and patient samples as positive controls. This testing included comparison with local protocols and primers as well as sensitivity testing via dilution experiments. The collaborative efforts resulted in standardized primer sets with a minimal target sensitivity of 10-2 for virtually all single PCR analyses, whereas the nested PCR analyses generally reached the minimal target sensitivity of 10-4. The standardized RT-PCR protocol and primer sets can now be used for molecular classification of acute leukemia at diagnosis and for MRD detection during follow-up to evaluate treatment effectiveness.",,,,194,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we compared the gene transfer efficiency of two retroviral vectors: amphotropic MuLV and a MuLV vector pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G) envelope. Target vascular tissues included human endothelial cells (EC), smooth muscle cells (SMC) and saphenous veins (SV). Transduction efficiency of human EC and SMC was significantly higher for VSV-G pseudotyped MuLV vector (90%) than for Amphotropic MuLV (20%). Luminal surface en face analysis of transduced cultured SV showed a six- to 10-fold greater transduction efficiency with VSV-G pseudotyped MuLV. The tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) gene was transduced into EC using each vector. Four days following transduction, a 12-fold higher tPA antigen concentration and a 38-fold higher tPA enzymatic activity was measured from cells transduced with the VSV-G pseudotyped vectors as compared with the amphotropic MuLV. There was no detectable pseudotransduction (protein transfer) associated with the VSV-G MuLV vector. Both AZT inhibition of reverse transcriptase and cell division arrest by gamma irradiation inhibited transduction, indicating that viral transduction correlated with RNA reverse transcription and cell proliferation. MuLV pseudotyped with the VSV-G envelope glycoprotein is an effective retroviral vector for vascular gene therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expected numbers of cancer cases were calculated from age-, sex-, county-, and period-specific cancer incidence rates. In the MGUS cohort 64 new cancers with a known association with M-components were diagnosed versus 5.0 expected giving a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 12.9 (95% confidence interval, 9.9-16.5). The relative risks of developing multiple myeloma (SIR 34.3), Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (SIR 63.8), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (SIR 5.9) were significantly increased and independent of time passed from detection of the M-component. The relative risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia was not significantly increased, SIR 2.7 (0.5-7. 7). Among cancer sites without known association with M-components 141 cases were observed versus 94.6 expected giving a SIR of 1.5 (1. 3-1.8).

Both types of statistical errors are large in these analyses. The results of the analyses should indicate whether or not at least some of the cases are clustered, and if they are, whether or not the cluster is related to an exposure. The temporal changes in the incidence rate of the disease may alleviate the difficulties associated with the large statistical errors. Because of the sparse data, estimates of the incidence rates over time are not reliable. In this study we present the q interval statistic that has the uniform (0,1) distribution. It can be viewed as a standardized time interval between consecutive diagnoses of the disease. As such, it reflects the reciprocal of the incidence rates. Since it is measured for each diagnosis, it is sensitive to gradual change in the incidence rate, and in general to a true clustering that is due to exposure, even when the test result is not significant. When clustering is detected, it may indicate which of the possible reasons leading to a cluster has a sound basis. As a result, the epidemiological search for exposure is limited to situations indicated by the q intervals. In addition, the q interval presents a useful survival statistic in a follow-up study when no control group is available.

In the current study, we demonstrate that IL-6, a survival factor for the human myeloma cell line MDN, rapidly up-regulates Mcl-1 whereas it has no effect on Bcl-2 protein level. In MDN cells, IL-6 induces both extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)1,2 and STAT3 activation whereas STAT1 and STAT5 activation remains undetectable. Furthermore, while investigating the IL-6 signaling pathway leading to Mcl-1 up-regulation, we show that a janus kinase (JAK)-2 inhibitor is able to inhibit both STAT3 activation and Mcl-1 up-regulation whereas an MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor has no effect. In conclusion, our data suggest the involvement of the JAK / STAT pathway but not of the Ras / mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway in IL-6-induced Mcl-1 up-regulation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro cytotoxic screening pattern of 2F-ara-A differed from those of other anticancer agents. Intraperitoneal inoculation with JOK-1 cells in SCID mice allowed the cells to infiltrate into a variety of organs including the liver and thymus, and resulted in the death of the mice with a median survival time of 29.5 days, associated with hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and enlarged lymph nodes. The ascitic cells expressing the human B-lymphocytic cell surface antigen CD19 actually grew after a latent period of 15 days. In this model, twice daily administration of fludarabine phosphate at a dose of 135 mg/kg for 5 days prolonged the survival time of the mice for considerably longer period than once-a-day treatment. Fludarabine phosphate in the doubled course of twice daily increased life span of 32.9%, which was in a similar range to that of doxorubicin.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of consecutively treated patients with (a) BMT from alternative donors (n=39), (b) treated with matched sibling BMT for standard risk leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, or aplastic anaemia (n=53), and (c) treated with matched sibling BMT for high risk leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, or aplastic anaemia (n=49). RESULTS: A total of 72 neurological complications were found. Most of these occurred within the first 6 months after transplant. Thirty six patients developed a severe neurological complication: 17 Alternative donor patients (44%) by contrast with six standard risk patients (11%) and 13 high risk patients (27%; p<0.005). The most frequent complication was a metabolic encephalopathy occurring in 18% of patients. Most of the encephalopathies were caused by either the transplant procedure, cyclosporin, systemic infections, microangiopathic thrombopathy, or by complications induced by graft versus host disease. Infections of the CNS developed in 9% of patients, cerebrovascular lesions in 3%. CONCLUSIONS: Severe neurological complications are more frequent after BMT from alternative donors. This is mainly due to increased treatment related morbidity and to more profound immunosuppression after BMT from alternative donors.",,PMC1760639,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report the assembly of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) gag gene product into virus-like particles (VLPs) using the baculovirus expression system. Expression of BLV Pr44(Gag) resulted in the assembly and release of VLPs, thereby confirming the ability of retroviral Gag polyprotein to assemble and bud from insect cells. Efficient particle formation required a myristoylation signal at the N-terminus of BLV Pr44(Gag). Recombinant baculoviruses expressing matrix (MA) or capsid-nucleocapsid (CA-NC) proteins of BLV were generated but neither of these domains was capable of assembling into particulate structures. To assess the compatibility of Gag domains between leukemia and lentivirus groups three different recombinant chimeras each expressing MA of one virus (e.g., simian immunodeficiency or BLV) and CA-NC of another (e.g., BLV or human T-cell leukemia virus type-I) were constructed. Each of the chimeric proteins assembled efficiently and budded as VLPs, suggesting that the MA and CA domains of these two evolutionary divergent retrovirus groups can be functionally exchanged without perturbation of Gag VLP formation. The lenti-leukemia chimeric Gag approach has potential for studying protein-protein interactions in other retroviruses.",,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We believe that the structure of the RNA-DNA duplexes in the context of RT determines the specificity of RNase H cleavage. To test this idea, we treated three related groups of synthetic RNA-DNA hybrids with either Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) RT or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RT. All of the hybrids were prepared using the same 81-base RNA template. The first series of RNase H substrates was prepared with complementary DNA oligonucleotides of different lengths, ranging from 6 to 20 nucleotides, all of which shared a common 5' end and were successively shorter at their 3' ends. The second series of oligonucleotides had a common 3' end but shorter 5' ends. The DNA oligonucleotides in the third series were all 20 bases long but had non-complementary stretches at either the 5' end, 3' end, or both ends. Several themes have emerged from the experiments with these RNA-DNA duplexes. (1) Both HIV-1 RT and MLV RT cleave fairly efficiently if the duplex region is at least eight bases long, but not if it is shorter. (2) Although, under the conditions we have used, both enzymes require the substrate to have a region of RNA-DNA duplex, both MLV RT and HIV-1 RT can cleave RNA outside the region that is part of the RNA-DNA duplex. (3) The polymerase domain of HIV-1 RT uses certain mismatched segments of RNA-DNA to position the enzyme for RNase H cleavage, whereas the polymerase domain of MLV RT does not use the same mismatched segments to define the position for RNase H cleavage. (4) For HIV-1 RT, a mismatched region near the RNase H domain can interfere with RNase H cleavage; cleavage is usually (but not always) more efficient if the mismatched segment is deleted. These results are discussed in regard to the structure of HIV-1 RT and the differences between HIV-1 RT and MLV RT.",,,,,,,"['AI09578/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI27690/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported that polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids (n-3 FA) including eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6) prevent the activation of monocytic tissue factor (TF) induced by bacterial endotoxin [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] in cell cultures and animals. HYPOTHESIS: We herein explore the mode of inhibitory action of n-3 FA to determine if LPS transmembrane signaling is blocked, exerting such antagonism. RESULTS: Exposure of human leukemia monocytic THP-1 cells to bacterial endotoxin (Escherichia coli 0111:B04, 1.5 microg/ml) for 6 h significantly activated TF activity and the production of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin (IL)-1beta in conditioned medium. Pretreatment with n-3 FA, 20:5 and 22:6 at 10 microM, resulted in time-dependent suppression of not only TF activation but also the elicitation of NO, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta. These LPS responses were substantially depressed by more than 50% after a 72-h pretreatment. FACScan analysis showed that n-3 FA readily prevented fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated LPS from binding to THP-1 cells by approximately 70%. The observation that anti-CD14 mAb diminished FITC-LPS binding in a dose-dependent fashion has revealed CD14 dependency in LPS recognition. LPS upregulated CD14 expression, which was significantly arrested by n-3 FA. Similarly, the upregulation of the expression of CD11b, another proposed LPS receptor, was also minimally but significantly depressed by n-3 FA. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that n-3 FA are able to block LPS transmembrane signaling via suppression of the receptor upregulation, mediating a variety of significant antagonisms against LPS action.",,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the in vitro biological properties of a panel of anti-human Fas MAbs. We found that five anti-Fas MAbs of IgG1 subclass (B.E28, B.G30, B.L25, DX2, and B.G34) induced marked apoptotic cell death in Fas-expressing leukemia cells, although this killing was delayed when compared to the cytolytic effect mediated by the prototypic anti-Fas MAb of IgM subclass (clone CH-11). On the other hand, four clones (ZB4, B.G27, B.D29, and B.K14) efficiently blocked apoptotic cell death induced by the CH-11 MAb or Fas ligand. The ability of these MAbs to inhibit cell death appeared to correlate with their relative affinity for the Fas molecule. Furthermore, different clones recognized the same epitope and elicited different effects (induction or inhibition of cell killing); conversely, different clones elicited the same effect but recognized different epitopes. These results suggest that the different biological effects of anti-Fas MAbs would not be mediated in an epitope-restricted manner. The relative binding affinity might correlate to some extent with the biological properties of the MAb.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both patients were elderly men with a 36-month and a 40-month history of CML, respectively. They presented with disseminated, reddish to violaceous papules and plaques (case 1), and with localized reddish nodules on the left temporal area (case 2). Concurrent features of blastic transformation in the bone marrow were observed in one patient (case 1). Histopathologic examination of skin lesions revealed similar features in both cases. There was a moderate to dense dermal infiltrate composed mainly of medium-sized atypical mononuclear myeloid precursor cells with only few relatively well-differentiated cells of the granulocytic series. Histochemical staining for naphthol-ASD-chloroacetate esterase revealed strong positivity (>50% of neoplastic cells) in case 2 and only scattered positivity (< 10% of neoplastic cells) in case 1. Immunohistologic analysis performed on paraffin-embedded sections showed in both cases variable reactivity of neoplastic cells for leucocyte common antigen (CD45), lysozyme, myeloperoxidase, CD11c, CD15, CD43, CD66, CD68, HLA-DR, and the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) CD56. A negative reaction was observed for CD3, CD34, and TdT. The immunohistologic findings were remarkably similar to those reported for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with monocytic differentiation (French-American-British [FAB] classification, subtype M4). Examination of blasts from the bone marrow performed in one patient (case 1) revealed a similar phenotype also with CD56 expression. In conclusion, our observations show that specific cutaneous infiltrates in CML may show morphologic and immunohistochemical characteristics similar to those observed in AML with monocytic differentiation. Moreover, specific cutaneous manifestations of CML may express CD56.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BMI values at diagnosis, at cessation of therapy, yearly thereafter for up to 10 yr, and at follow-up were compared with French reference values. Whole body percent fat was measured at follow-up by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and compared with data from 463 local controls. Adjusted for sex and age, the mean BMI increased significantly during therapy and remained largely unchanged thereafter. At follow-up, BMI did not differ significantly between patients and local controls. On the other hand, the whole body percent fat was significantly increased (mean observed/predicted value, 21.8/19.0%; P < 0.0002). Twenty-five patients (26%) had a percent fat above the 90th percentile of the reference values, which indicates excessive fatness.

We studied nine cases of CD8+ and/or CD56+ ATLL, all of which exhibited monoclonal integration of human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) proviral DNA. Four cases exhibited a CD8+/CD56- phenotype, four others had a CD8-/CD56+ phenotype, and one was CD8+/CD56+. All but one case also expressed the surface antigens CD3, TCR alpha beta, and CD4.

Based on this observation a maximum lymph node size of 2 cm was considered an appropriate limit to distinguish malignant disease from benign causes except when there is other evidence of an underlying malignant disease.

We have studied phagocytosis and membrane receptors by flow cytometry (FCM), and secretory activities in blast cells from 24 AML patients prior to treatment. Blast cells from 11/16 patients attached N. meningitidis, and internalization occurred in 7/14. The phagocytosis of zymosan particles and N. meningitidis correlated linearly (r = 0.9, p<0.01, n = 11). Surface membrane expression of CD32 and CD11b was sufficient to account for opsonin-dependent attachment in all except one patient. A significant fraction of the blast cells attached, but did not internalize meningococci. CD32 and CD11b were non-functional in all the blasts from five patients, and in a subpopulation from seven additional patients. Significantly more large than small blasts expressed CD32, CD35 and CD11b (p<0.001). Phagocytosis was unrelated to the secretion of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, and TNFalpha. In conclusion, AML blast cell function is related to receptor expression, cell size and granularity, and to FAB-type.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluates the types of infections and the methods used to diagnose infection in patients enrolled in current Children's Cancer Group (CCG) protocols. Data were collected on patients enrolled in CCG protocols from January 1, 1992, through December 31, 1995. Of the 155 protocol patients, 102 were completely evaluated and had data collected through August 1, 1996. Patients were divided into two diagnosis groups: leukemia/lymphoma (N = 51) and solid tumor (N = 51). Eighty-five (83%) patients had documented infections and 17 (17%) did not. Overall, 96 (94%) patients had in-dwelling central venous catheters. Twelve categories of infection were identified. Data were analyzed for age, gender, diagnosis, neutropenia, organism, and disease state (primary active, recurrent active, primary remission, and secondary remission). Statistical comparisons were made only on rates, whereas descriptive comparisons were given for numbers of infections and organisms. The infection rates for patients with active disease were 1.01 and 1.15 per 100 patient days (primary versus recurrent) and 0.59 and 0.38 per 100 patient days for patients with disease in remission (primary versus secondary). Diagnosis-group infection rates were 0.66 and 0.68 per 100 patient days for patients with solid tumors and leukemia/lymphoma, respectively. Three hundred thirty infections, including 19 polymicrobial infections, were recorded. The three most common types of infection were otitis media, septicemia, and urinary tract infection. More infections were associated with an age at diagnosis of less than 3 years, a leukemia/lymphoma diagnosis in remission, and an absolute neutrophil count >500 cells/microL. One hundred ninety-four organisms were isolated from 330 infections. Gram-positive organisms (n = 74) such as coagulase-negative Staphylococci (n = 38) predominated over gram-negative organisms (n = 63) for all infectious categories. Specifically, gram-positive organisms (n = 39) were isolated more often from blood cultures than were gram-negative organisms (n = 27). The overall mortality for patients was 36%. Seven of the 37 (19%) patient deaths were attributed to infection. These patients predominantly were girls with neutropenia and leukemia/ lymphoma in active disease who died of gram-negative sepsis. Infections with gram-positive organisms continue to be major causes of morbidity in pediatric oncology patients receiving contemporary CCG protocols. However, infection-related mortality, especially with gram-negative organisms, occurs less frequently than does malignancy-related mortality. Common childhood infections (such as otitis media) seem equally as prevalent as bacteremia in pediatric oncology patients. Thus, a comprehensive physical examination is as imperative as the microbiologic evaluation in diagnosing infection in this patient population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Donors were unrelated for nine patients and partially matched related for three. Conditioning included total body irradiation for all but one patient.

In the present studies, we have investigated the mechanistic basis for resistance to MTA in several human tumor cell lines. The cell lines were developed for resistance by the gradual exposure to stepwise (fivefold) increases in the concentration of MTA over a 5-month period. The degree of resistance was 140-fold for GC3 colon carcinoma, 117-fold for HCT-8 ileocecal carcinoma, and 729-fold for CCRF-CEM leukemia cells adapted to 2 micromol/L MTA. The lines had strong cross-resistance (>3,200-fold) to raltitrexed. Only modest resistance was noted for methotrexate and the GARFT inhibitor, LY309887. The cytotoxicity of MTA in wild-type cells was only partially alleviated by thymidine addition (5 micromol/L) and complete protection required the addition of both hypoxanthine (100 micromol/L) and thymidine. In contrast, thymidine alone totally lacked protective activity in the MTA-resistant lines. The cells either demonstrated a GARFT-like reversal pattern (complete protection by hypoxanthine) for GC3MTA or a dihydrofolate reductase-like reversal pattern (complete protection by the combination of hypoxanthine and thymidine) for HCT-8MTA and CCRF-CEM(MTA) cells. Cellular resistance was multifactorial and stable on removal of selective pressure. Only GC3MTA cells showed increased TS activity (approximately 40-fold). Accumulations of 3H-MTA at 24 hours in CCRF-CEM(MTA), HCT-8MTA, and GC3MTA cells were 2%, 6%, and 46% of wild-type values, respectively. We also evaluated the cytotoxic activity of MTA in MCF-7 breast carcinoma and H630 colon carcinoma cells selected for resistance to raltitrexed and 5-fluorouracil, respectively, via TS amplification (provided by Dr P.G. Johnston, Belfast, Ireland). These cells demonstrated more than 200-fold less resistance to MTA compared with raltitrexed and MTA-induced cytotoxicity was prevented by hypoxanthine. These studies suggest that in addition to TS modulation, secondary targets emerge during the development of MTA resistance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Paraffin-sections of bone marrow biopsies from 30 cases of MDS (6 cases of RAEB and RAEB-T) 22 AML (4 cases occurring in the setting of MDS), 16 chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD), and 10 cases without alterations were investigated by immunohistochemistry for p53, waf1/p21, mdm2 and Ki67 proteins. P53 was detected in immature myeloid cells in 6/30 MDS (20%) and in 6/22 AML (27%) while it was not expressed in CMPD. Of the 6 p53 positive AML, 3 occurred as evolution of MDS and 3 were de novo acute leukaemias. Waf1/p21 was detected in 5/22 (23%) AML in immature myeloid cells. Waf1/p21 was also expressed in 18/30 (60%) MDS and 10/16 (63%) CMPD in variable proportion (5-25%) of the mature myeloid cells and megakaryocytes. Waf1/p21 was not detected in immature myeloid cells in MDS and CMPD. Mdm2 protein was expressed in 3/30 (10%) MDS in the immature myeloid cells and in 1/22 AML in blastic cells. The combined immunophenotypes of immature myeloid cells of MDS were: p53+/mdm2+/waf1-: 3, p53+/mdm2-/waf1-: 3, while the immunohistochemical patterns of AML were: p53+/mdm2-/waf1-: 4, p53+/mdm2+/waf1+: 1, p53+/mdm2-/waf1+: 1, p53-/mdm2-/waf1+: 3. Ki67/MIB1 staining was found in at least 30% of immature myeloid cells in MDS and AML and in at least 20% of these cells in CMPD. In conclusion, our results indicate that p53 protein is overexpressed in the myeloid lineage in a proportion of AML and MDS, while is not detected in CMPD and normal bone marrow, p53 expression was much more frequent in AML occurring as an evolution of MDS than in de novo AML. The combined immunophenotypes of p53 positive AML and MDS suggest that p53 overexpression may be due to mutation, in some AML and MDS cases with the p53+/mdm2-/waf1- phenotype. However, it would be also possible that p53 protein accumulation is not related to p53 mutation but to inhibition of p53/mdm2 binding due to mdm2 defects and/or other events related to cell stress signals. On the other hand, waf1/p21 protein overexpression without p53 expression in some AML could be p53-independent and may represent an attempt to control the high proliferation rate which was evidenced by Ki67/MIB1 immunostaining. However, the possibility of p21 to arrest cell-cycle, in these cases of AML, seems to be overridden, suggesting that cell-cycle deregulation may be involved in a proportion of AML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results were compared with those of control subjects (n = 72), including: age-matched controls; elder controls (minimum age 60 years); and healthy first-degree relatives (FDR) of pediatric cancer patients. Pediatric cancer patients showed the highest mean CA/cell value, which was statistically significant as compared to their age-matched counterparts, elder controls, and the FDRs. As compared to 7% of all the three control groups collectively, 32.4% of pediatric cancer patients showed > 0.1 mean CA/cell value.

The results suggest that spontaneous levels of chromosomal aberrations may be used as one of the biomarkers for cancer predisposition study.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although rare in children, when MDS does occur, it is frequently part of a congenital disorder such as Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS). Monosomy 7 and/or deletion of part or all of 7q are poor prognostic signs in MDS and AML, although the pathophysiologic relationship between this finding and MDS or AML is unclear. Shwachman-Diamond syndrome is an inherited illness characterized by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and by congenital neutropenia. Patients with SDS are at increased risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Because monosomy 7 is a poor prognostic sign in MDS and AML, establishing its presence is important. However, different methods of detection of monosomy 7 may lead to different results in some patients. We present the case of a 10-year-old girl known to have SDS, who had a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy done to rule out MDS and AML. By light microscopy, the patient's bone marrow was unremarkable. GTG-banding showed the following karyotype: 45,XX,-C[3]/47,XX,+C[1]/46,XX[45]. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed with a chromosome 7-specific alpha-satellite probe (D7Z1). Almost all (373 of 376) cells exhibited only one chromosome 7 signal. A second marrow aspiration done 6 months later showed an essentially normal karyotype by GTG-banding. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with the same chromosome 7 probe showed 230 of 250 cells to be monosomic for chromosome 7. A whole chromosome 7 painting probe demonstrated disomy for chromosome 7 in 90 of 90 cells; however, subtle heteromorphism in the centromeric regions of the 2 copies of chromosome 7 was noted in some cells. This case demonstrates that FISH and GTG-banding can give discordant results, that the two should be viewed as complementary technologies, and that both have a place in a full karyotypic analysis. Furthermore, this case demonstrates for the first time that heteromorphism and/or subtle structural abnormalities of chromosome 7, previously associated with MDS and AML, can exist without clinical or morphologic signs of these illnesses. It will be of interest to further study the relationship, if any, between SDS and various structural abnormalities of chromosome 7 in MDS and AML, and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis, physiology, and treatment of these disorders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Effects of the drugs on mediator release (beta-hexosaminidase, arachidonic acid metabolites) after Fc(epsilon)RI activation in RBL-2H3 cell were quantified. Furthermore, effects of the drugs on cellular signalling (Ca2+ influx, intracellular Ca2+ concentration, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) concentration) were assayed. Effects of the drugs on bilayer and cell membranes have been recorded. RESULTS: It is shown that eclazolast down-regulates IP3 levels. In contrast to lipophilic drugs, eclazolast does not affect artificial bilayers and erythrocyte membranes, and there is no effect on thapsigargin induced Ca2+ influx. The effect of eclazolast was highly dependent on the antigen concentration with which the cells were triggered. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism of action of eclazolast is deviant from lipophilic antiallergic agents. It inhibits exocytosis by intracellularly affecting only direct Fc(epsilon)RI linked processes and not through inhibition of Ca2+ influx channels, as found for membrane disturbing lipophilic drugs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result of a chromosomal translocation in these patients, the promyelocytic leukemia protein PML is disrupted as are the nuclear bodies it forms. Disruption of PML and PML nuclear bodies in APL is linked to a loss of growth control and subsequent leukemogenesis. PML contains a zinc-binding domain known as the RING which is required for formation of these bodies. Using yeast 2-hybrid techniques, we found that PML and a related RING protein, Z, bind the proline rich homeodomain protein (PRH) through their RING domains. Previous reports indicate that PRH functions in hematopoiesis and may act as a transcriptional repressor. Our data indicate that PML and Z both bind the repressor domain of PRH and are the first protein partners reported for PRH. We observe that PRH has a punctate pattern in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells and in the APL cell line, NB4. Immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies indicate that PML and PRH interact in both cell lines. The effect on cell growth by PML and the hematopoietic actions of PRH raises the possibility that the interaction between PML and PRH represents a link between growth control and hematopoiesis.",,,,,,,['R01 CA80728-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have demonstrated growth promoting activity of TEL-PDGF beta R and also indicated that the TEL moiety activates the tyrosine kinase of the PDGF beta R through the formation of TEL-PDGF beta R oligomers. We demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of the fusion protein can be attenuated through overexpression of the TEL part of TEL-PDGF beta R, suggesting a strategy for antagonizing the signaling of TEL-PDGF beta R, and other TEL-fusion proteins containing tyrosine kinase domains.

In contrast to hexamethylenbisacetamide (HMBA), SAHA-related maturation was limited and accompanied by marked cytoxicity. SAHA-mediated apoptosis occurred within the G0G1 and S phase populations, and was associated with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-3 activation, PARP degradation, hypophosphorylation/cleavage of pRB, and down-regulation of c-Myc, c-Myb, and B-Myb. Enforced expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL inhibited SAHA-induced apoptosis, but only modestly potentiated differentiation. While SAHA induced the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1, antisense ablation of this CDKI increased, rather than decreased, SAHA-related lethality. In contrast, conditional expression of wild-type p53 failed to modify SAHA actions, but markedly potentiated HMBA-induced apoptosis. Finally, SAHA modestly increased expression/activation of the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK/JNK); moreover, SAHA-related lethality was partially attenuated by a dominant-negative c-Jun mutant protein (TAM67). SAHA did not stimulate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nor was lethality diminished by the specific MEK/MAPK inhibitor PD98059.

Hex is a divergent homeobox gene that is transiently expressed in many hematopoietic lineages, suggesting an involvement in cellular differentiation. mEg5 is a member of the bim-C subfamily of kinesin related proteins that are necessary for spindle formation and stabilization during mitosis.

RA-sensitivity in APL is mediated by its oncogenic protein, which results from the recombination of the PML and the RA receptor alpha (RAR alpha) genes (PML/RAR alpha fusion protein). Ectopic expression of PML/RAR alpha into haemopoietic cell lines results in increased response to RA-induced differentiation. By structure-function analysis of PML/RAR alpha-mediated RA-differentiation, we demonstrated that fusion of PML and RAR alpha sequences and integrity of the PML dimerization domain and of the RAR alpha DNA binding region are required for the effect of PML/RAR alpha on RA-differentiation. Indeed, direct fusion of the PML dimerization domain to the N- or C-terminal extremities of RAR alpha retained full biological activity. All the biologically active PML/RAR alpha mutants formed high molecular weight complexes in vivo. Functional analysis of mutations within the PML dimerization domain revealed that the capacity to form PML/RAR alpha homodimers, but not PML/RAR alpha-PML heterodimers, correlated with the RA-response. These results suggest that targeting of RAR alpha sequences by the PML dimerization domain and formation of nuclear PML/RAR alpha homodimeric complexes are crucial for the ability of PML/RAR alpha to mediate RA-response.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapy-related solid tumors are associated mainly with the use of radiation therapy. The risk for developing a therapy-related solid tumor is approximately 2- to 3-fold increased compared with the general population. Therapy-related leukemias are associated predominantly with chemotherapy, particularly with the use of topoisomerase-II inhibitors and alkylating agents. In general, the cumulative incidence of therapy-related leukemia is low. It is approximately 0.5% and 2% at 5 years of median follow-up for patients receiving etoposide at cumulative doses < or = 2 g/m2 and > 2 g/m2, respectively. High cumulative doses of etoposide given over a short period of time appear to be less leukemogenic than a similar dose of etoposide given over a longer period of time. There might, additionally, be a synergistic effect of cisplatin and etoposide on the induction of therapy-related leukemia. For patients who receive high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell support, the risk of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia appears to be substantially lower compared with that reported in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy. The transplantation procedure itself does not appear to add to the therapy-related leukemia risk. The risk-benefit analysis in patients with testicular cancer clearly favors the use of current treatment regimens including high-dose chemotherapy. However, even the acceptably low number of therapy-related leukemias should encourage the search for equally effective but less toxic therapies.",,,,29,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using reporter gene assays, we have functionally characterized TEL, AML1 and TEL/AML1 fusion proteins in the regulation of the human CR1 gene. Analysis of transcription activities showed that AML1 increased the CR1 promoter activity and that TEL repressed the basal activity of the promoter. Increased activities of the CR1 promoter by AML1 protein were reduced by the TEL protein in a concentration-dependent manner. When TEL/AML1 and AML1 proteins are present in cells at the same time, the TEL/AML1 protein inhibits the transactivation activities of AML1 protein on the human CR1 promoter even though TEL/AML1 retains the transactivation domain of AML1. A mutation analysis of the human CR1 promoter revealed that the binding sites for TEL and AML1 are necessary for the action of TEL and TEL/AML1, respectively. Thus, production of the TEL/AML1 protein by translocation of human chromosome 12;21 may contribute to leukemogenesis by the specific inhibition of AML1-dependent activation of myeloid promoters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Field emission in lens scanning electron microscopy analysis of ultrathin cryosections revealed the presence of a regular three-dimensional network of fibers in dispersed chromatin. This spatial architecture was apparently constituted mainly of 10 nm filaments organized in loops of about 80-100 nm. Nodal points and the overlapping of such coils appeared as thicker structures of about 30 nm in diameter. Thin filaments of about 5 nm did not show a regular distribution. This three-dimensional fiber organization seemed quite constant in the dispersed chromatin of all the cell lines analyzed. The DNase treatment of the samples selectively removed the 10 nm class fibers, whereas the BrdU labeling confirmed the presence of newly synthesized DNA organized into chromatin units with a regular arrangement. These data suggest that the 10 nm chromatin fiber likely represents the DNA condensation order at which DNA duplication starts and the main weft of a three dimensional network within the interphase nucleus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Between May 1993 and February 1999 in a private-practice setting, we performed 29 autotransplants in 28 patients using non-cryopreserved and unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cells mobilized from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood by means of hematopoietic growth factors. The autografting procedure was performed entirely on an outpatient basis in 19 cases (65%). The median age of the patients was 30 years, with a range of 9-67. There were 15 patients with acute leukemia (9 with acute myelogenous leukemia), 3 with chronic myelogenous leukemia, 2 with multiple myeloma, 3 with Hodgkin's disease, 2 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 4 with metastatic breast carcinoma. RESULTS: The median time to achieve > 0.5 x 10(9)/L granulocytes was 14 days (range 7-42), whereas the median time to achieve > 20 x 10(9)/L platelets was 20 days (range 5-49). The 64-month post-transplant survival was 38%, whereas the median post-transplant survival was 18 months. The transplant-related mortality was 3.4%. The approximate cost of this simplified procedure was 10.8% for in-hospital procedures and for outpatient autografts, substantially lower than figures reported from the U.S. for autotransplants. CONCLUSIONS: This simplified method for autografting patients, avoiding in-hospital stays, purging procedures and cryopreservation of the cells is feasible and results in a substantial decrease of the cost of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Open cardiac procedures are known to have increased risk of postoperative infection and other morbidities in these immunodeficient patients. Outcome of open cardiac procedures in these patients was reviewed retrospectively. PATIENTS: Thirteen patients (aged 58-82 years, 11 men, 2 women) with these lymphocytopathologic diseases (8 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and 5 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma) underwent cardiac operations between January 1977 and June 1998. Mean age was 72 +/- 2.1 years. Isolated coronary artery bypass grafting was performed in 11 and combined procedures and double valve replacement were performed in 1 each. Preoperatively, 9 patients were in a low-risk clinical stage. Mean preoperative duration of lymphocytopathologic disease was 6.1 +/- 1.6 years. Mean preoperative New York Heart Association functional class was 2.8. RESULTS: There was no operative death. Average stay in the intensive care unit was 41.4 +/- 8.6 hours. Postoperative leg and superficial sternal wound infections were encountered in 3 patients. Average postoperative hospital stay was 10.0 +/- 1.7 days. During the follow-up up to 72 months, 1 patient underwent a second cardiac operation. There was 1 late death 4 years later. Coronary stenting was done in 1 patient and a cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted in another patient for recurrent angina. Three patients underwent chemotherapy. Cardiac and lymphocytopathologic status remained stable in others. CONCLUSIONS: Acceptable outcome may be anticipated after cardiac operations in patients with low-grade chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in early stages. However, the possibility of infection and progression of cardiac and lymphocytopathologic status in these patients should call for caution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This variant is expressed in alveolar macrophages. CD30v can activate the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) as CD30, and its overexpression in HL-60 induced a differentiated phenotype. To better understand the physiological and pathological functions of CD30v, expression of this variant was examined using a multiple approach to examine 238 samples of human malignant myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms. Screening by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed expression of CD30v transcripts in 52 of 72, 7 of 11, 63 of 90, and 7 of 30 samples of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myeloid blast crisis of myeloproliferative disorders (MBC), and lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) of B- and T-cell origin, respectively. CD30v expression was high in monocyte-oriented AMLs (FAB M4 and M5), B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), and multiple myeloma (MM). Using the specific antibody HCD30C2, prepared using a peptide corresponding to the nine amino acids of the amino-terminal CD30v, expression of CD30v protein was detected in 10 of 25 and 2 of 10 AML and ALL samples, respectively. In AMLs, immunocytochemical detection of CD30v revealed the presence of loose clusters of CD30v-expressing cells dispersed amid a population of CD30v-negative blasts. Finally, the parallel expression of CD30v mRNA and protein, as evidenced by Northern and Western blotting, was confirmed in selected cases of AMLs and LPDs. A significant correlation was found between expressions of CD30v and CD30 ligand transcripts in AML and LPD (P = 0.02, odds ratio = 3.2). The association of CD30v with signal-transducing proteins, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 2, and TRAF5 was demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation analysis, as was demonstrated for authentic CD30 protein. Expression of transcripts for TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF5, as demonstrated by RT-PCR, was noted in leukemic blasts that express CD30v. Collectively, frequent expression of CD30v along with TRAF proteins in human neoplastic cells of myeloid and lymphoid origin provide supportive evidence for biological and possible pathological functions of this protein in the growth and differentiation of a variety of myeloid and lymphoid cells.",,PMC1866953,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, recent advances demonstrate that normal progenitors can be selected from CML marrows by a variety of techniques, including isolation by their small size. Furthermore, we found that myeloid growth factors have a potent antileukemic effect against CML progenitors in vitro by inducing their terminal differentiation. Based on these data, we initiated a trial of autologous BMT in patients with high-risk CML. Autografts were processed in an attempt to enrich for normal progenitors, first by isolating small cells by counterflow centrifugal elutriation and then incubating them in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for 72 hours. After a conditioning regimen of busulfan and cyclophosphamide, all patients received GM-CSF daily for 2 months. The median age of the 13 patients in the trial was 45 years (range 17-56 years). The median duration of disease before BMT was 24 months (range 13-72 months). Eight patients were in chronic phase (CP), and five were in accelerated phase (AP). All patients failed to achieve a cytogenetic response to interferon-alpha and were 100% Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)+ before BMT. There were three transplant-related deaths, all AP patients. All of the remaining 10 patients engrafted with some degree of Ph- hematopoiesis; despite high-risk features, nine patients engrafted 100% Ph-. All patients relapsed cytogenetically at a median of 6 months (range 4-22 months). These results demonstrate that autologous BMT can consistently induce complete Ph- engraftment in CP patients. GM-CSF appears to produce a clinical antileukemic effect against CML after autologous BMT.",,,,,,,['P01 CA 15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Moveover, the complexity and expense of current therapies makes them unavailable to most individuals worldwide, while their toxicity makes them universally undesirable. Our challenge for the next century is to build on our increasing understanding of the molecular basis of leukemia to devise safe, cheap, and effective approaches to prevent or treat this group of diseases.",,,,68,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three of these, erythropoletin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are in extensive clinical use to stimulate hematopoiesis. Similar advances have characterized the processes by which T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and dendritic cells are formed and interact to mediate immune responses. In the last decade most research on blood cell formation has involved the generation of animals with inactivation of specific genes involved in hematopolesis.

In this preliminary clinical study, a patient with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) was vaccinated with autologous leukemic DCs following autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). In an in vitro study, leukemic DCs were generated using granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-4 from granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized PBSC fraction of this patient, and were found to be Ph1+, and to possess the morphologic and phenotypic characteristics of mature DCs. These cells could also elicit antigen specific immune responses, including a vigorous cytotoxicity specific to CML cells. In the clinical experiment, we obtained evidence that infused leukemic DCs could induce T cell clones expressing the same T cell receptor usage as a cytotoxic T cell line, suggesting that the immune repertoire includes tumor-reactive T cells. These cytotoxic T lymphocytes are activated in vivo. The vaccination of leukemic DC caused a decrease in the number of Ph1+ cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. These results indicate that the activity is an immunologically mediated phenomenon and vaccination therapy with leukemic DC following autologous PBSCT may be effective in treating CML.",,PMC5925998,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown previously that SHP1 associates with the activated erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) and negatively regulates mitogenic signaling. To further elucidate the role of SHP1 in erythropoietin (EPO)-induced cellular responses we employed J2E erythroleukemic cells as a model for erythroid maturation and cytokine-triggered suppression of apoptosis. Our data indicate that overexpressed SHP1 inhibits both EPO-induced differentiation as well as prevention of apoptosis. The specific signaling pathways responsible are not unraveled so far. Therefore, we analyzed the involvement of SHP1 in two established EPO-stimulated pathways, the JAK/STAT and the MAP kinase cascades, by transient coexpression of reporter constructs containing binding sites for transcription factors targeted by these pathways and a SHP1 cDNA. Both pathways are inhibited by SHP1 as indicated by the lower induction of reporter gene activity. In conclusion, SHP1 regulates the transcriptional activity stimulated by the EPO-induced JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways and is involved in the signaling machinery responsible for erythroid differentiation and suppression of apoptosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we have isolated the cDNA encoding mouse angiogenin-3 and used it to produce the protein in E. coli. We demonstrate that mouse angiogenin-3 is a ribonuclease whose activity and specificity towards tRNA and dinucleotide substrates differ from those of mouse angiogenin or of mouse angiogenin-related protein, a non-angiogenic factor. Mouse angiogenin-3 induced angiogenesis in both the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay and the rat cremaster muscle. Electron microscopy revealed that endothelial cells within vessels induced by both mouse angiogenin-3 and mouse angiogenin contain fenestrations similar to those observed in endothelial cells from neovasculature induced by vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor.

METHODS: This report uses National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) data, which reflect a hospital-based patient population from a broad spectrum of hospitals in the United States. Age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, treatment, overall survival, and relative survival were evaluated according to time period (1985-1990 and 1991-1995). Comparisons were made with U. S. population figures for 1990 and with series published over the last 70 years. RESULTS: CLL comprised 22.6% of the 108,396 cases of leukemia in the data base. The risk of developing CLL increased progressively with age and did not plateau; the average age was 69.6 years. At the time of initial diagnosis, 60.5% of patients received no treatment (this proportion increased from 58.1% to 62.7% between the 2 time periods). Overall survival was 48.2% at 5 years and 22.5% at 10 years. The 5-year relative survival was 69.5%, 72.2%, 63.1%, and 41.7% for age groups <40, 40-59, 60-79, and 80+ years, respectively; these rates indicated that CLL, and not comorbid disease, caused the greatest percentage of deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of developing CLL increases progressively with age without plateauing and is 2.8 times higher for older men than for older women. There is an increasing trend toward no treatment at the time of initial diagnosis. Long term overall survival of CLL patients is poor. CLL is a more fatal disease among older individuals because of the disease itself, not because of comorbid conditions.",,,['Copyright 1999 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of patients with nonlymphoid CML-BP is associated with very low response rates, a median survival of 2-3 months, and significant toxicities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of therapy in CML-BP with different treatments in relation to response rate, survival, and toxicity. METHODS: A total of 162 adults patients with a diagnosis of nonlymphoid CML-BP referred from 1986 to 1997 were included in this analysis. Only first salvage therapy was considered for the purpose of this analysis. The blastic phase of CML was defined by the presence of 30% or more blasts in the blood or bone marrow, or extramedullary disease. Ninety patients were treated with intensive chemotherapy, 31 with decitabine, and 41 with other single agents. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (22%) had an objective response. Response rates were similar among patients treated with intensive chemotherapy (28%) or with decitabine (26%). In aggregate, other single agents showed objective response rates of 7%. The median duration of remission for all patients was 29 weeks and the median overall survival 22 weeks. Patients treated with decitabine showed a trend toward better survival, despite a higher percentage of older patients (P < 0.004). The median survival times were 29 weeks with decitabine, 21 weeks with intensive chemotherapy, and 22 weeks with other agents. When only older patients were considered, survival was significantly better with decitabine versus other treatments (P < 0.01). A multivariate analysis of prognostic factors for survival confirmed the independent, significant favorable effect of decitabine therapy (P = 0.047). In all groups complications of myelosuppression were the most significant side effects. Severe nonhematologic toxicities were not observed in patients treated with decitabine; they occurred in 20% and 17% of patients treated with intensive chemotherapy or other single agents, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with intensive chemotherapy, decitabine showed favorable results, with similar objective response rates, a better nonhematologic toxicity profile, and a trend for better survival, particularly among older patients. Studies will now attempt to combine decitabine with other promising approaches, such as homoharringtonine, low dose cytarabine, and interferon-alpha, in all CML phases.",,,['Copyright 1999 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND: Collapsing glomerulopathy (CG) is a pattern of renal injury that is seen in association with HIV infection and that is increasingly recognized in non-HIV patients. METHODS: A review of native kidney biopsies with CG that were diagnosed between 1979 and 1997 in 18 HIV and 42 non-HIV patients is provided. RESULTS: HIV and non-HIV patients with CG were similar in terms of age, sex ratio, serum creatinine, proteinuria, the extent of collapsing and sclerosing glomerular lesions, and interstitial damage. A slight female predominance was found in both groups. In contrast to non-HIV patients, the HIV group was characterized by a high prevalence of blacks (94 vs. 57%), frequent tubuloreticular inclusions (76 vs. 29%), and microcystic tubular changes (72 vs. 40%). In 13 non-HIV patients, CG was associated with a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like disease (5), hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (3), HTLV-I infection, MCTD, acute monoblastic leukemia, multiple myeloma, and cerebral arteritis. Overall, the renal survival of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and non-HIV patients with CG was not significantly different. Cox regression revealed that HIV infection had an adverse effect on short-term renal survival, with other significant risk factors being extensive interstitial fibrosis, high serum creatinine, proteinuria, and a low percentage of glomeruli with collapse. The slope of reciprocal creatinine was best predicted by the degree of proteinuria. Serum creatinine correlated with the extent of interstitial fibrosis, the male gender, and the percentage of glomeruli with collapse. Proteinuria was best predicted by the extent of effacement of podocyte foot processes. CONCLUSIONS: CG shares many clinicopathological similarities in HIV and non-HIV patients. In some non-HIV patients, CG was associated with autoimmune diseases, lymphoproliferative disorders, and viral infections.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, however, we have demonstrated that by selecting only those patients with impaired QOL the efficacy of GH replacement on QOL can be greatly improved. The improvement in QOL was observed to correlate significantly with that recorded before commencing GH therapy. This study aims to assess if demographic variables affect QOL in untreated GHD adults or the improvement in QOL following GH therapy. DESIGN: An open study of GH replacement, initiating treatment with a dose of 0.8 IU/day and titrating the dose by 0.4 IU increments to normalize the IGF-I SDS between - 2.0 and + 2.0 SD of the age related normal range. PATIENTS: 65 severely GHD patients (peak GH < 9 mU/l to provocative testing), mean age 38.7 (range 17-72) years. Inclusion criterion was that of subjectively poor quality of life on clinical interview. MEASUREMENTS: Blood was taken for insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I). The Psychological General Well-Being Schedule (PGWB) and Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency Assessment (AGHDA) self-rating questionnaires were used to assess quality of life at baseline, three and eight months after commencing GH. RESULTS: The patients were subgrouped on the basis of gender, age of onset of GHD, pathology and presence of additional pituitary hormone deficits. The cohort consisted of 40 females and 25 males, 45 of adult-onset (AO) and 20 of childhood-onset (CO). GH deficiency resulted from a hypothalamo-pituitary pathology, or treatment thereof, in 36 patients and as a result of cranial irradiation for a primary brain tumour or prophylaxis in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in 29 patients. Isolated GH deficiency (IGHD) was present in 25 patients, and 32 patients were demonstrated to have at least two additional pituitary hormone deficits (MPHD). No significant difference was detected between baseline PGWB scores of the subgroups. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed the age of onset of GHD to be a significant determinant of both the baseline PGWB (P = 0.05) and AGHDA (P = 0.025) scores, AO patients perceiving the greater distress. A significant improvement, from baseline, in both QOL scores was observed in all subgroups at three months, and in all subgroups at eight months except IGHD, where a trend towards improvement in the AGHDA score was observed but failed to reach significance. The mean improvement in the PGWB following GH therapy was not significantly different between subgroups. Multiple linear regression analysis confirmed baseline PGWB and AGHDA scores to be the most important variable in prediction of the level of improvement in respective scores following GH therapy. Age of onset was also observed to be a significant determinant of the PGWB scores following GH therapy (P = 0.02), the CO cohort experiencing the greater improvement. A similar relationship between age of onset and AGHDA scores was not observed (P = 0.22). CONCLUSIONS: Baseline QOL as assessed by self-rating questionnaires is influenced by the age of onset of the GH deficiency, adult onset patients expressing the greater distress. Improvements in QOL scores are influenced by both baseline score and to a lesser extent the age of onset of GHD, the greater improvement being observed in childhood onset patients. The degree of improvement was observed to be independent of gender, pathology and number of pituitary hormone deficits. In a cohort selected by subjectively impaired QOL, we have demonstrated childhood onset GHD patients perceive themselves to have less impairment of QOL pretreatment. In contrast to previous data in unselected cohorts, however, we have shown that those childhood onset GHD patients in whom QOL is significantly reduced, show a capacity for improvement that is equal to, if not greater, than that seen in adult onset-GHD patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A null mutation in either AML1 or its dimerizing partner, CBFbeta, results in embryonic lethality secondary to a complete block in fetal liver hematopoiesis, indicating an essential role of this transcription complex in the development of definitive hematopoiesis. The hematopoietic phenotype that results from the loss of AML1 can be replicated in vitro with a two-step culture system of murine embryonic stem (ES) cells. Using this experimental system, we now demonstrate that this hematopoietic defect can be rescued by expressing the PEBP2alphaB1 (AML1b) isoform under the endogenous AML1-regulatory sequences through a knock-in (targeted insertion) approach. Moreover, we demonstrate that the rescued AML1(-/-) ES cell clones contribute to lymphohematopoiesis within the context of chimeric animals. Rescue requires the transcription activation domain of AML1 but does not require the C-terminal VWRPY motif, which is conserved in all AML1 family members and has been shown to interact with the transcriptional corepressor, Groucho/transducin-like Enhancer of split. Taken together, these data provide compelling evidence that the phenotype seen in AML1-deficient mice is due solely to the loss of transcriptionally active AML1.",,PMC85087,,,,,"['P01 CA071907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA71907-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The effect appears to be specific for LPS, because the P2 purinergic receptor antagonists do not affect P388D(1) cell stimulation by other stimuli such as platelet-activating factor or the Ca(2+) ionophore A23187. Moreover, extracellular nucleotides are found to stimulate macrophage AA mobilization with a pharmacological profile that implicates the participation of the P2X(7) receptor and that is inhibited by periodate-oxidized ATP.

In vitro binding of HIV-1 NCp7 to viral 5' RNA and primer tRNA(3)(Lys) catalyzes formation of nucleoprotein complexes resembling the virion nucleocapsid. Nucleocapsid complex formation functions in viral RNA dimerization and tRNA annealing to the primer binding site (PBS). RT is recruited in these nucleoprotein complexes and synthesizes minus-strand cDNA initiated at the PBS. Recent results on yeast Ty3 have shown that the homologous NCp9 promotes annealing of primer tRNA(i)(Met) to a 5'-3' bipartite PBS, allowing RNA:tRNA dimer formation and initiation of cDNA synthesis at the 5' PBS (). To compare specific cDNA synthesis in a retrotransposon and HIV-1, we have established a Ty3 model system comprising Ty3 RNA with the 5'-3' PBS, primer tRNA(i)(Met), NCp9, and for the first time, highly purified Ty3 RT. Here we report that Ty3 RT is as active as retroviral HIV-1 or murine leukemia virus RT using a synthetic template-primer system. Moreover, and in contrast to what was found with retroviral RTs, retrotransposon Ty3 RT was unable to direct cDNA synthesis by self-priming.

The virus is most efficiently transmitted between individuals by infected cells, where it is presumed that intracellular particles and viral RNA are transferred to target cells following fusion. Although the mandatory first step for HTLV-1 fusion is the binding of envelope SU (gp46) to the receptor, the events which follow this interaction and lead to fusion and infection have not been well characterized. To investigate these events, we studied two HTLV-1 chronically infected cell lines with different abilities to fuse with K562 target cells. Although not inherently fusion incompetent, the HTLV-1 envelope protein on MT2 cells was poorly able to undergo a change in membrane hydrophobicity required for fusion with the target cell membrane after binding to the receptor. High level expression of a fusion-competent HTLV-1 envelope protein on MT2 cells had little effect on improving this suggesting that the defect was encoded by the parent cell. Visible syncytia were seen after incubation of these cells with K562 target cells but complete fusion as measured by transfer of cellular contents into the recipient cell was not observed. In C91-PL cells, binding of SU to the receptor resulted in a sustained hydrophobic change of envelope accompanied by a cytopathic effect in mixed cell cultures and complete fusion. However, in C91-PL cells, overexpression of envelope protein blocked the transfer of cell contents after receptor engagement and initiation of cytopathic membrane changes, indicating that post binding fusion events were blocked. These data suggest that HTLV-1 fusion is a multistep process which is susceptible to inhibition at two seperate stages of the fusion pathway post receptor binding. This, and the inefficient infection by cell-free virions, may explain the poor infectivity of HTLV-1 in vivo and suggests strategies for preventative therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retroviruses account for approximately 8%-10% of the total. For human T-cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-I), the viral regulatory tax gene product is responsible for enhanced transcription of viral and cellular genes that promote cell growth by stimulating various growth factors and through dysregulation of cellular regulatory suppressor genes, such as p53. After a long latent period, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) occurs in 1 per 1000 carriers per year, resulting in 2500-3000 cases per year worldwide and over half of the adult lymphoid malignancies in endemic areas. Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) accounts for a significant cancer burden, and its transactivating regulatory protein Tat enhances direct and indirect cytokine and immunological dysregulation to cause diverse cancers. Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a very rare tumor except after HIV-1 infection, when its incidence is greatly amplified reaching seventy thousand-fold in HIV-infected homosexual men. Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), which is also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated virus (KSHV), is a necessary but not sufficient etiological factor in KS. The dramatic decline of KS since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) could be due to suppression of HIV-1 tat. B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma occurs as their first acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining diagnosis in 3%-4% of HIV-infected patients. Hodgkin's lymphoma is also associated with HIV infection but at a lower risk. Human papillomaviruses are linked to invasive cervical cancer and anogenital cancers among HIV-infected patients.

Alternative to this SBH, we examined the clinical usefulness of monoclonal analysis by the polymerase chain reaction technique which amplifies rearranged-CDR III region of IgH gene (IgH-PCR). The detective sensitivity of the IgH-PCR was different dependently upon each analysis for amplified products, namely 10(-2) per mononuclear cells in agarose gel analysis and 10(-3) in polyacrylamide gel and single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (PAGE and SSCP). Then, using the IgH-PCR and PAGE/SSCP analysis, 75 Japanese patients with B-neoplasm and 23 with T-cell neoplasms were examined for clonal IgH rearrangements. The diagnostic sensitivity in each group of B-ALL, B-CLL, B-lymphoma, HCL, AML with B-cell antigens, and non-T cell neoplasms was 88%, 92.3%, 71.4%, 100%, 57.1%, and 0%, respectively, with an overall sensitivity and specificity of 88% and 100%.

The method is so specific, sensitive, and rapid (non-culture) that leads not only to the diagnosis of viral infection, but also to prediction of the chemotherapy, monitoring during the therapy, and judging the efficacy of the treatment. Moreover, it contributes to understanding the disease pathophysiology. The qualitative results are sufficient for diagnosis, but quantitative analysis is sometimes necessary for the prediction of the efficacy and monitoring during treatment. It occasionally requires the numbers of genomic expression, the number of DNA/RNA copies, and the detection of point mutations for drug resistance. Many emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as AIDS and viral hepatitis, are induced by viral infection via blood. The main causative agents of blood-borne viral infection are hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV1), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and human parvovirus B19. They play main roles in viral hospital infection. The risk of them being transmitted by transfusion of screened blood is very low, but it is always possible that infection may occur in a window period even after extensive blood screening tests. Therefore, to shorten a window period, genetic examinations will be accepted for screening tests in the near future. Prioritization of genetic examinations is needed to select the adequate method and sampling. After examinations, false positive and false negative results have to be extensively read out whether due to contamination or inhibition by agent such as heparin and hemoglobin. The causative virus should be decided by carefully eliminating passenger viruses or latent viruses. Because genetic examinations are so useful but occasionally yield false positive and negative results, genetic diagnosis should be judged totally by combination with other examinations, clinical signs, and clinical symptoms.",,,,23,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, there is considerable room for improvement in the treatment of patients with relapsed leukemia in terms of both the reinduction rate and the duration of response. Fludarabine has been shown to augment responses to cytarabine, possibly by increasing the intracellular concentrations of the active metabolite cytarabine triphosphate. Higher-than-standard doses of mitoxantrone have been shown to augment responses to cytarabine, possibly by increasing the DNA strand breaks induced by topoisomerase II; these strand breaks cannot be effectively repaired in the presence of cytarabine triphosphate. This preliminary study was designed to determine whether moderately high doses of mitoxantrone could be added to the combination of fludarabine and cytarabine in an attempt to improve the combination's antileukemic efficacy. METHODS: Fifty-five adults with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia or the blastic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) received salvage therapy with the FLAM regimen, which consisted of fludarabine, cytarabine, and increasing doses of mitoxantrone. RESULTS: Even with doses of mitoxantrone escalated to as much as 60 mg/m(2) over 4 days, dose-limiting toxicity was not observed. Overall, the complete response rate was 27.3% (15 of 55 patients, including 4 of 17 with acute myelogenous leukemia [AML], 4 of 12 with acute lymphocytic leukemia [ALL], and 7 of 26 with the blastic phase of CML). The median time to complete response was 42 days. Toxicity other than myelosuppression was manifested primarily as hyperbilirubinemia, which was reversible in all cases. Poor performance status and undifferentiated blastic phase of CML were poor prognostic factors for response to FLAM. CONCLUSIONS: The FLAM regimen is an active salvage regimen and should be formally evaluated in Phase II studies of patients with AML, ALL, and the myeloid and lymphoid blastic phases of CML.",,,['Copyright 1999 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about the effects of OSM on normal vascular cells. We thus exposed human aortic smooth muscle cells (hASMCs) to OSM, examined cell proliferation and morphology, and determined interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. OSM had a weak antiproliferative effect. After a 4-day incubation with 100 ng/mL OSM, cell count decreased to 69+/-3% of control. However, OSM induced striking changes in hASMC morphology, characterized by a polyclonal shape, in contrast to the spindle morphological feature of control hASMCs. OSM stimulated the release of IL-6 by hASMCs in a dose-dependent way; after a 48-hour exposure, values were 8.5+/-0.7, 29.7+/-3.5, 50.9+/-4.4, and 73.8+/-7.6x10(3) U/mL (n=6) at OSM concentrations of 0, 1, 10, and 100 ng/mL, respectively. OSM induced marked expression of COX-2 protein and mRNA. Leukemia inhibitory factor had no effect on hASMCs, indicating that OSM effects on hASMCs were mediated by the OSM type II receptor and not by the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor. OSM used the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, as demonstrated by rapid phosphorylation of JAK1 and specific activation of STAT1. Interestingly, OSM acted in synergy with IL-1beta on IL-6 production and COX-2 expression. In conclusion, OSM is a novel regulator of human smooth muscle cell functions, acting in concert with IL-1beta, and OSM may play a role in major vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the role of CNTF/LIF signaling in regenerative responses of motoneurons, we studied the expression of the three receptor components, CNTF receptor alpha (CNTFRalpha), LIF receptor beta (LIFRbeta), and gp130, and the activation of the STAT3 signal transduction pathway in the rat facial nucleus following peripheral nerve transection. As shown by in situ hybridization and immunoblotting, axotomy resulted in a rapid down-regulation of CNTFRalpha mRNA expression within 24 h and a concomitant massive up-regulation of LIFRbeta mRNA and protein in the lesioned motoneurons. The altered mRNA levels were maintained for 3 weeks but had returned back to control levels by 6 weeks postlesion after successful regeneration. In contrast, mRNA levels remained in the lesioned state during the 6-week period studied, when regeneration was prevented by nerve resection. Significant lesion-induced changes in gp130 mRNA levels were not detectable. Rapid (within 24 h) and sustained (for at least 5 days) activation of STAT3 in axotomized facial motoneurons was revealed by demonstrating the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the protein using immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting. In agreement with previous studies showing a complementary regulation of CNTF and LIF in the lesioned facial nerve, our observations on the postlesional regulation of CNTF/LIF receptor components in the facial nucleus indicate a direct and sequential action of the two neurotrophic proteins on axotomized facial motoneurons.",,,"['Copyright 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The virus was constructed by the introduction of pol-env sequences from the wild mouse virus CasBrE into the genome of a neuroinvasive but nonneurovirulent strain of Friend murine leukemia virus (FMuLV), FB29. Although the brain infection by FrCas(E) as well as that by other neurovirulent murine retroviruses has been described in detail, little attention has been paid to the neuroinvasive but nonneurovirulent viruses. The purpose of the present study was to compare brain infection by FrCas(E) with that by FB29 and another nonneurovirulent virus, F43, which contains pol-env sequences from FMuLV 57. Both FB29 and F43 infected the same spectrum of cell types in the brain as that infected by FrCas(E), including endothelial cells, microglia, and populations of neurons which divide postnatally. Viral burdens achieved by the two nonneurovirulent viruses in the brain were actually higher than that of FrCas(E). The widespread infection of microglia by the two nonneurovirulent viruses is notable because it is infection of these cells by FrCas(E) which is thought to be a critical determinant of its neuropathogenicity. These results indicate that although the sequence of the envelope gene determines neurovirulence, this effect appears to operate through a mechanism which does not influence either viral tropism or viral burden in the brain. Although all three viruses exhibited similar tropism for granule neurons in the cerebellar cortex, there was a striking difference in the distribution of envelope proteins in those cells in vivo. The FrCas(E) envelope protein accumulated in terminal axons, whereas those of FB29 and F43 remained predominantly in the cell bodies. These observations suggest that differences in the intracellular sorting of these proteins may exist and that these differences appear to correlate with neurovirulence.",,PMC111558,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the full-length 632-amino-acid residue Env was expressed, fusion did not occur at all for 3T3 cells as target and only somewhat for XC6 cells. Expression of Env 616*-a construct of Env with the last 16 amino acid residues (617 to 632; the R peptide) deleted from its C terminus to match the proteolytically cleaved Env produced during viral budding-resulted in high levels of fusion. Env 601*, lacking the entire cytoplasmic tail (CT) (identified by hydrophobicity), also led to fusion. Truncation of an additional six residues (Env 595*) abolished fusion. The kinetics of forming fusion pores did not depend on whether cells were first prebound at 4 degrees C and the time until fusion measured after the temperature was raised to 37 degrees C or whether cells were first brought into contact at 37 degrees C and the time until fusion immediately measured. This similarity in kinetics indicates that binding is accomplished quickly compared to subsequent steps in fusion. The fusion pores formed by Env 601* and Env 616* had the same initial size and enlarged in similar manners. Thus, once the R peptide is removed, the CT is not needed for fusion and does not affect formed pores. However, residues 595 to 601 are required for fusion. It is suggested here that the ectodomain and membrane-spanning domain of Env are directly responsible for fusion and that the R peptide affects their configurations at some point during the fusion process, thereby indirectly controlling fusion.",,PMC111556,,,,,"['GM54787/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM027367/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 GM054787/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM27367/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM054787/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Splenic T cells from MAb-treated rats indicated impairment of proliferative and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses against TARS-1 in vitro compared to untreated rats.

To identify structural elements of murine leukemia virus (MLV) RT important for fidelity in vivo, we developed a D17-based encapsidating cell line (ANGIE P) which is designed to express the amphotropic MLV envelope. ANGIE P also contains an MLV-based retroviral vector (GA-1) which encodes a wild-type bacterial beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ) and a neomycin phosphotransferase gene. Transfection of ANGIE P cells with wild-type or mutated MLV gag-pol expression constructs generated GA-1 virus that was able to undergo only one cycle of viral replication upon infection of D17 cells. The infected D17 cell clones were characterized by staining with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal), and the frequencies of inactivating mutations in lacZ were quantified. Three mutations in the YVDD motif (V223M, V223S, and V223A) and two mutations in the RNase H domain (S526A and R657S) exhibited frequencies of lacZ inactivation 1.2- to 2.3-fold higher than that for the wild-type MLV RT (P < 0.005). Two mutations (V223I and Y598V) did not affect the frequency of lacZ inactivation. These results establish a sensitive in vivo assay for identification of structural determinants important for accuracy of DNA synthesis and indicate that several structural determinants may have an effect on the in vivo fidelity of MLV RT.",,PMC111541,,,,,['CA58875/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Yet, the interrelations between these different regions of the envelope complex during the cell entry process are still elusive. Deletion of the histidine residue of the conserved PHQV motif at the amino terminus of the amphotropic or the ecotropic MLV SU resulted in the AdelH or the MOdelH fusion-defective mutant envelope, respectively. These delH mutant envelopes are incorporated on retroviral particles at normal densities and normally mediate virion binding to cells expressing the retroviral receptors. However, both their cell-cell and virus-cell fusogenicities were fully prevented at an early postbinding stage. We show here that the fusion defect of AdelH or MOdelH envelopes was also almost completely reverted by providing either soluble SU or a polypeptide encompassing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the target cells, provided that the integrity of the amino-terminal end of either polypeptide was preserved. Restoration of delH envelope fusogenicity was caused by activation of the target cells via specific interaction of the latter polypeptides with the retrovirus receptor rather than by their association with the delH envelope complexes. Moreover crossactivation of the target cells, leading to fusion activation of AdelH or MOdelH envelopes, was achieved by polypeptides containing various type C mammalian retrovirus RBDs, irrespective of the type of entry-defective glycoprotein that was used for infection. Our results indicate that although they recognize different receptors for binding to the cell surface, type C mammalian retroviruses use a common entry pathway which is activated by a conserved feature of their envelope glycoproteins.",,PMC111539,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we developed a gain-of-function approach to overcome this problem. Our strategy relies on the fact that feline leukemia virus subgroup B (FeLV-B) and amphotropic murine leukemia virus (A-MLV) have closely related gp70 surface envelope glycoproteins and use related Na(+)-dependent phosphate symporters, Pit1 and Pit2, respectively, as their receptors. We previously observed that FeLV-B/A-MLV envelope glycoprotein chimeras spliced between the variable regions VRA and VRB were unable to use Pit1 or Pit2 as a receptor but could efficiently use specific Pit1/Pit2 chimeras. The latter study suggested that the VRA of A-MLV and FeLV-B functionally interact with the presumptive extracellular loops 4 and 5 (ECL4 and -5) of their respective receptors, whereas VRB interacts with ECL2. We also found that FeLV-B gp70 residues F60 and P61 and A-MLV residues Y60 and V61 in the first disulfide-bonded loop of VRA were important for functional interaction with the receptor's ECL4 or -5. We have now extended this approach to identify additional VRA and VRB residues that are involved in receptor recognition. Our studies imply that FeLV-B VRA residues F60 and P61 interact with the Pit1 ECL5 region, whereas VRA residues 66 to 78 interact with Pit1 ECL4. Correspondingly, A-MLV VRA residues Y60 and V61 interact with the Pit2 ECL5 region, whereas residues 66 to 78 interact with Pit2 ECL4. Similar studies that focused on the gp70 VRB implicated residues 129 to 139 as contributing to specific interactions with the receptor ECL2. These results identify three regions of gp70 that interact in a specific manner with distinct portions of their receptors, thereby providing a map of the functionally interacting surfaces.",,PMC111533,,,,,"['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'CA25810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Additional functions for MA have been proposed based on the existence of MA mutants in Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), murine leukemia virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 that lack infectivity even though they release particles of normal composition. Here we describe an RSV MA mutant with a surprising and previously unreported phenotype. In the mutant known as Myr1E, the small membrane-binding domain of the Src oncoprotein has been added as an N-terminal extension of Gag. While Myr1E is not infectious, full infectivity can be reestablished by a single amino acid substitution in the Src sequence (G2E), which eliminates the addition of myristic acid and the membrane-binding capacity of this foreign sequence. The presence of myristic acid at the N terminus of the Myr1E Gag protein does not explain its replication defect, because other myristylated derivatives of RSV Gag are fully infectious (e.g., Myr2 [C. R. Erdie and J. W. Wills, J. Virol. 64:5204-5208, 1990]). Biochemical analyses of Myr1E particles reveal that they contain wild-type levels of the Gag cleavage products, Env glycoproteins, and reverse transcriptase activity when measured on an exogenous template. Genomic RNA incorporation appears to be mildly reduced compared to the wild-type level. Unexpectedly, RNA isolated from Myr1E particles is monomeric when analyzed on nondenaturing Northern blots. Importantly, the insertional mutation does not lie within previously identified dimer linkage sites. In spite of the dimerization defect, the genomic RNA from Myr1E particles serves efficiently as a template for reverse transcription as measured by an endogenous reverse transcriptase assay. In marked contrast, after infection of avian cells, the products of reverse transcription are nearly undetectable. These findings might be explained either by the loss of a normal function of MA needed in the formation or stabilization of RNA dimers or by the interference in such events by the mutant MA molecules. It is possible that Myr1E viruses package a single copy of viral RNA.",,PMC111525,,,,,"['R01 CA47482/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K11 AI01148/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA047482/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA76534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

This was noted particularly in recipients of a T-cell-depleted (TCD) graft and, to a lesser extent, also in recipients of unmanipulated grafts. At 1 year after allo-BMT, normalization was observed of TCR CDR3 size complexity in almost all recipients. Analysis of the antigen-specific T-cell repertoire at 1 year after BMT showed that the T cells responding to tetanus toxoid (TT) differed in TCR gene segment usage and in amino acid composition of the CDR3 region when comparing the recipient with the donor. Moreover, the TT-specific TCR repertoire was found to be stable within a given allo-BMT recipient, because TT-specific T cells with completely identical TCRs were found at 3 consecutive years after transplantation.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated that recombinant murine IL-12 (rmIL-12) promotes specific antitumor immunity mediated by T cells in several types of tumors. However, the in vivo antitumor properties of IL-12 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have not been previously reported. We show here in a murine AML model that systemic administration of rmIL-12 significantly delays tumor growth but is incapable of rescuing mice from lethal leukemia. In contrast, AML cells genetically modified to express IL-12 (IL12-AML) using murine stem cell virus (MSCV) p40 + p35 elicit very potent antileukemic activity. Vaccines with lethally irradiated IL12-AML cells protect naive mice against challenge with wild-type AML cells and, more importantly, can cure mice bearing a considerable leukemic burden. Immunized mice show no signs of systemic IL-12 toxicity and their spleen histology is comparable with naive mice spleen. In vivo depletion of IL-12, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), or CD8(+) T cells after injections with live IL12-AML cells abrogates completely the antileukemia immune responses. Studies on the in vitro effects of IFN-gamma on AML cells demonstrate enhanced expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and accessory molecules and induction of the costimulatory molecules B7.1 and B7.2, but no significant direct antiproliferative effect. (51)Cr release assays show that rejection of live IL12-AML cells supports the development of long-lasting leukemia-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity.

Besides its expression during spermatogenesis, cyclin A1 is also expressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells and in acute myeloid leukemia. We investigated mechanisms that might contribute to cyclin A1 expression in hematopoietic cells. Comparison of cyclin A1 and cyclin A promoter activity in adherent and myeloid leukemia cell lines showed that the cyclin A1 promoter is preferentially active in myeloid cell lines. This preferential activity was present in a small, 335-bp cyclin A1 promoter fragment that contained several potential c-myb binding sites. Coexpression of a c-myb expression vector with the cyclin A1 promoter constructs significantly increased the reporter activity in adherent CV-1 as well as in myeloid U937 cells. Gel-shift assays demonstrated that c-myb could bind to the cyclin A1 promoter at a binding site located near the transcription start site. Site-directed mutagenesis of this site decreased promoter transactivation by 50% in both KCL22 cells that express high levels of c-myb and in CV-1 cells that were transfected with c-myb. In addition, transfection of primary human embryonic fibroblasts with a c-myb expression vector led to induction of the endogenous cyclin A1 gene.

The receptor for SDF-1alpha, CXCR-4, is a 7 transmembrane domain receptor, which is also a coreceptor for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Here we show that transformation of hematopoietic cell lines by BCR/ABL significantly impairs their response to SDF-1alpha. Three different hematopoietic cell lines, Ba/F3, 32Dcl3, and Mo7e, were found to express CXCR-4 and to respond to SDF-1alpha with increased migration in a transwell assay. In contrast, after transformation by the BCR/ABL oncogene, the chemotactic response to SDF-1alpha was reduced in all 3 lines. This effect was directly due to BCR/ABL, because Ba/F3 cells, in which the expression of BCR/ABL could be regulated by a tetracycline-inducible promoter, also had reduced chemotaxis to SDF-1alpha when BCR/ABL was induced. The reduced response to SDF-1alpha was not due to an inability of BCR/ABL-transformed cell lines to migrate in general, as spontaneous motility of BCR/ABL-transformed cells was increased. In mice, injection of SDF-1alpha into the spleen resulted in a transient accumulation of untransformed Ba/F3 cells, but not Ba/F3. p210(BCR/ABL) cells administered simultaneously. The mechanism may involve inhibition of CXCR-4 receptor function, because in BCR/ABL-transformed cells, CXCR-4 receptors were expressed on the cell surface, but SDF-1alpha calcium flux was inhibited. Because SDF-1alpha and CXCR-4 are felt to be involved in progenitor cell homing to marrow, the abnormality decribed here could contribute to the homing and retention defects typical of immature myeloid cells in chronic myelogenous leukemia.",,,,,,,"['CA 75348/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 560654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

This analysis can never be absolute because (1) most partial D phenotypes involve multiple amino acid changes in the Rh D protein and (2) deficiency for 1 or more epitopes may be due to gross structural alteration in the variant Rh D protein structure. We report here the amino acid requirements for the majority of D epitopes. They have been defined by generating a series of novel Rh mutant constructs by mutagenesis using an Rh cE cDNA as template and mutagenic oligonucleotide primers. When transfected into K562 cells, the D epitope expression of the derived mutant clones was then assessed by flow cytometry. The introduction of 9 externally predicted Rh D-specific amino acids on the Rh cE protein was sufficient to express 80% of all tested D epitopes, whereas other clones expressed none.

GCV affects not only the cells expressing HSV-tk but also neighboring cells that do not express the gene; this phenomenon commonly is called ""bystander effect."" GCV metabolites transfer via gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) accounts for the bystander effect in different cell lines, but other mechanisms have also been described. In this study, we analyzed the mechanisms of the bystander effect in two cell lines exhibiting different capacities of communication (DHD/K12 and 9L). The 9L cells exhibited a very good bystander effect, which was completely blocked by a long-term inhibitor of GJIC, 18 alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid. DHD/K12 cells exhibited a moderate bystander effect that was not abolished by 18 alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid or 1-octanol, another strong inhibitor of GJIC. Interestingly, we also observed a bystander effect in cultures where HSV-tk-expressing DHD/K12 cells were physically separated from their untransfected counterparts but grown in the same medium. Moreover, the transfer of filtered conditioned medium from GCV-treated HSV-tk-expressing DHD/K12 cells to DHD/K12 parental cells induced a decrease of survival in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that the bystander effect in this cell line was mediated by a soluble factor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In long-term cultures, the number of non-adherent cell population and total clonogenic progenitor cell content decreased gradually in both groups.

The initial CD34 positive cell content of the bone marrow samples was similar in both groups. Although CD34 positive cell number in the adherent stromal layer was well preserved in the control group at the end of 4 weeks, this figure decreased significantly in the CML group.

There were 51 (72.8%) males and 19 (27.2%) females with a median age of 60 years (range, 38-77). The median follow-up time was 24 months (range, 1-76), and median survival was 44 months.

The difference between the median survivals of patients in different stages was statistically significant (P < 0.0001). The BMBP and staging systems that are thought to be significant predictors of prognosis were used to build a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. BMBP was not found to add additional information to the prognostic value of the staging systems. Our results underline two points: first, the significance of BMBP must be investigated in multivariate analysis including the stage, and second, BMBP is not a dynamic prognostic parameter, it is an index of tumor burden and does not add any prognostic information beyond that provided by clinical stage.",,,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study aimed at illuminating the probable pathogenetic mechanisms responsible for these disturbances in patients with acute leukemia admitted to our hospital.

Patients with diabetes mellitus, acute or chronic renal failure, hepatic failure, patients receiving drugs that influence acid-base status and electrolyte parameters during the last month, such as corticosteroids, cisplatin, diuretics, antacids, aminoglycosides, amphotericin, penicillin, and K(+), PO(4)(3-), or Mg(2+) supplements were excluded. Forty-one patients had at least one acid-base or electrolyte disturbance. There were no significant differences in the incidence of acid-base balance and electrolyte abnormalities between patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The most frequent electrolyte abnormality was hypokalemia, observed in 41 patients (63%), namely in 34 patients with AML, and 7 with ALL; the main underlying pathophysiologic mechanism was inappropriate kaliuresis. Furthermore, hypokalemic patients more frequently experienced concurrent electrolyte disturbances (i.e., hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia), as well as various acid-base abnormalities compared to normokalemic patients. Hypokalemia in patients with acute leukemia may serve as an indicator of multiple concurrent, interrelated electrolyte disturbances, especially in patients with AML.",,,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human platelets, arachidonic acid is mainly metabolized by the two enzyme systems; cyclo-oxygenase and 12-lipoxygenase. Cyclo-oxygenase produces prostaglandin H(2) which is further converted to thromboxane B(2). 12-Lipoxygenase synthesizes 12(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid which is reduced to 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HETE). 2. An anti-platelet compound, OPC-29030, dose-dependently inhibited 12(S)-HETE production with an IC(50) of 0.06+/-0.01 microM, but not synthesis of thromboxane B(2) in human platelets. Although the compound suppressed 12(S)-HETE production in human platelets, cytosolic 12-lipoxygenase activity was not inhibited up to 10 microM. Essentially identical data were obtained with a 12-lipoxygenase of human erythroleukaemia cells which had megakaryocyte/platelet-like properties. 3. OPC-29030 also suppressed production of 5(S)-HETE, a 5-lipoxygenase product, in rat basophilic leukaemia cells without inhibiting enzyme activity. It has been shown that 5-lipoxygenase binds to membrane 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) to produce 5(S)-HETE, and thus FLAP inhibitor suppresses cellular 5(S)-HETE production. 4. A FLAP inhibitor, L-655,238, suppressed platelet 12(S)-HETE production, but had no effect on the 12-lipoxygenase activity. 5. Western blot analysis showed that platelet 12-lipoxygenase translocated from cytosol to membranes upon thrombin stimulation, and OPC-29030 suppressed this process in a dose-dependent manner. 6. These results suggest that the 12-lipoxygenase of human platelets binds to FLAP or a similar protein, and OPC-29030 suppresses 12(S)-HETE production by inhibiting a certain step of the 12-lipoxygenase translocation.",,PMC1571812,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As examples, stem cell physiology and the structure of the membrane cytoskeleton were first described in hematopoietic cells. Much of the reason for these successes resides in the ease with which blood cells can be isolated and manipulated in vitro. The cell biology of hematopoiesis can also be illuminated by the study of human disease states such as anemia, immunodeficiency, and leukemia. The sequential development of the blood system in vertebrates is characterized by ventral mesoderm induction, hematopoietic stem cell specification, and subsequent cell lineage differentiation. Some of the key regulatory steps in this process have been uncovered by studies in mouse, chicken, and Xenopus. More recently, the genetics of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) have been employed to define novel points of regulation of the hematopoietic program. In this review, we describe the advantages of the zebrafish system for the study of blood cell development and the initial success of the system in this pursuit. The striking similarity of zebrafish mutant phenotypes and human diseases emphasizes the utility of this model system for elucidating pathophysiologic mechanisms. New screens for lineage-specific mutations are beginning, and the availability of transgenics promises a better understanding of lineage-specific gene expression. The infrastructure of the zebrafish system is growing with an NIH-directed genome initiative, providing a detailed map of the zebrafish genome and an increasing number of candidate genes for the mutations. The zebrafish is poised to contribute greatly to our understanding of normal and disease-related hematopoiesis.",,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],151,,,['HL07623-13/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Long-term side effects consist mainly of nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and neurotoxicity as well as gonadal damage. Following standard-dose chemotherapy approximately 20% to 30% of patients will be affected by long-term side effects, although not all these side effects will cause an impaired quality of life. Several strategies have been or currently are being evaluated to reduce acute and long-term complications including the introduction of equally effective, but less toxic regimens, or the use of cytoprotective agents such as amifostine. Secondary acute myeloid leukemia and secondary myelodysplastic syndrome probably represent the worst possible long-term complications of cancer therapy in those patients who originally were cured of their primary testicular cancer. Therapy-related solid tumors are mainly associated with the use of radiation therapy and the risk for developing a therapy-related solid tumor is increased approximately two to three times compared to the general population. In contrast, therapy-related leukemias are predominantly associated with chemotherapy, particularly with the use of topoisomerase-II inhibitors and alkylating agents. In general, the cumulative incidence of therapy-related leukemia following treatment of germ cell cancer is low. It is approximately 0.5% and 2% at 5 years of median follow-up for patients receiving etoposide at cumulative doses< or = 2 g/m(2) and >2 g/m(2), respectively. The risk-benefit analysis in patients with testicular cancer clearly favors the use of current treatment regimens including high-dose chemotherapy. However, even the acceptably low number of therapy-related long-term complications should encourage the search for equally effective but less toxic therapies. This review will highlight important available data about therapy-related toxicity and particularly, therapy-related malignancies following cisplatin-etoposide-based chemotherapy.",,,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",60,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed an infant early preB ALL with ins(5;11)(q31;q13q23) and identified the AF5q31 gene on chromosome 5q31 as a fusion partner of the MLL gene. The AF5q31 gene, which encoded a protein of 1,163 aa, was located in the vicinity of the cytokine cluster region of chromosome 5q31 and contained at least 16 exons. The AF5q31 gene was expressed in fetal heart, lung, and brain at relatively high levels and fetal liver at a low level, but the expression in these tissues decreased in adults. The AF5q31 protein was homologous to AF4-related proteins, including AF4, LAF4, and FMR2. The AF5q31 and AF4 proteins had three homologous regions, including the transactivation domain of AF4, and the breakpoint of AF5q31 was located within the region homologous to the transactivation domain of AF4. Furthermore, the clinical features of this patient with the MLL-AF5q31 fusion transcript, characterized by the early pre-B phenotype (CD10(-)/CD19(+)) and poor outcome, were similar to those of patients having MLL-AF4 chimeric transcripts. These findings suggest that AF5q31 and AF4 might define a new family particularly involved in the pathogenesis of 11q23-associated-ALL.",,PMC24471,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AF197927'],,,,,,,

Embryonic fibroblasts from Mll-deficient compared with Bmi-1-deficient mice demonstrate reciprocal regulation of Hox genes as well as an integrated Hoxc8-lacZ reporter construct. Reexpression of MLL was able to overcome repression, rescuing expression of Hoxc8-lacZ in Mll-deficient cells. Consistent with this, MLL and BMI-I display discrete subnuclear colocalization.

The application of this assay to clinical samples allowed us to distinguish asymptomatic reactivation both in healthy individuals and in immunocompromised patients from reactivation associated with HC, in almost all cases.

These data suggest that lower doses of ABLC may be equally effective but less toxic than higher doses. However, a controlled study is required to confirm these observations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current available data from the literature demonstrate that the evaluation of the quantity of interphase AgNORs is an independent prognostic factor in several types of human tumors. Results of our investigations indicate that AgNORs are the most powerful variable predicting survival in patients with pharyngeal carcinoma, multiple myeloma, male breast and prostate carcinoma. The combination of AgNOR counts and histologic pattern allows the stratification of patients with multiple myeloma, pharyngeal and prostate carcinoma into low- and high-risk groups, which could benefit from different therapy. Moreover, AgNOR analysis predicts response to treatment in adult patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, and appears as an independent prognostic factor in a prospective study on renal cell carcinoma. Therefore, AgNOR analysis is a really important prognostic factor for several human neoplasias. The experimental and theoretical justifications for AgNORs as a prognostic factor are also reviewed, in particular the strict correlation between AgNOR quantity and tumor cell doubling time. Lastly, the lack of prognostic significance of AgNOR analysis in some circumstances is critically discussed.",,,,70,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median survival is 5 years for untreated patients who develop a series of infectious complications. For many years, interferon alpha was the standard therapy but the therapeutic strategy has changed with the arrival of purine analogs, deoxycoformicine and 2-CdA. THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS: We searched Medline, Pascal, and Current Contents for literature on the treatment of hairy cell leukemia over the last 10 years and discuss here available data on response rate, mechanism of action and adverse effects of different therapeutic options. BY TREATMENT: Interferon generally induces partial response and most patients relapse after treatment withdrawal. The purine analogs, desoxycoformycine and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, are more active than interferon inducing response in approximately 90% of the cases, even after interferon failure, complete response is achieved in 50% to 70% of patients. Relapse rate at 5 years appears to be limited to 10% n 15%. Besides infections, the main adverse effect is the constant deep and persistent decline in CD4 counts but with no special risk of opportunistic infection.

The blasts were typically medium sized, with folded nuclei, distinct but not prominent nucleoli, and moderate amounts of somewhat vacuolated basophilic cytoplasm; they were terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase--negative and surface immunoglobulin--positive. All 4 cases demonstrated c-myc rearrangement, but none had t(14;18), t(11;14), or cyclin D1 overexpression or rearrangement.

We analyzed selected immunophenotypic features of APL by flow cytometry and showed that 7 (41%) of 17 cases contained significant subsets of CD34+ leukemic cells: CD34+ myeloid cells predominated in 2 APL cases.

This marker was detected by a quantitative immunohistochemical analysis, using an ODC antibody and a FITC-linked second antibody. The in vitro chemosensitivity of lymphocytes from four normal individuals was tested by the immunohistochemical method. Lymphocytes from 25 cancer patients were also examined. In drug-sensitive cells, the intensity of the marker declined in the presence of the drug, whereas resistance to the drug was demonstrated by the presence of the marker. A good correlation was found between the predicted chemosensitivity and the outcome of the therapy.

Diffusible factors expressed from signalling centres promote the outgrowth of limbs and specify their dorsoventral and anteroposterior axes. However, the molecular mechanism by which limb cells acquire their proximodistal (P-D) identity is unknown. Here we describe the role of the homeobox genes Meis1/2 and Pbx1 in the development of mouse, chicken and Drosophila limbs. We find that Meis1/2 expression is restricted to a proximal domain, coincident with the previously reported domain in which Pbx1 is localized to the nucleus, and resembling the distribution of the Drosophila homologues homothorax (hth) and extradenticle (exd); that Meis1 regulates Pbx1 activity by promoting nuclear import of the Pbx1 protein; and that ectopic expression of Meis1 in chicken and hth in Drosophila disrupts distal limb development and induces distal-to-proximal transformations. We suggest that restriction of Meis1/Hth to proximal regions of the vertebrate and insect limb is essential to specify cell fates and differentiation patterns along the P-D axis of the limb.",,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AF202933', 'GENBANK/AF202934']",,,,,,,

The immunoconjugate was administered intravenously as a 1-hour continuous infusion at a dose level of either 0.1 mg/kg (N = 12) or 0.18 mg/kg (N = 5), and the plasma concentration-time data were modeled by using the WinNonlin program to estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters. Pharmacokinetic analyses revealed a plasma half-life of 19 +/- 4 hours, mean residence time of 22 +/- 4 hours, and a systemic clearance of 18 +/- 2 mL/h/kg. The average (mean +/- SEM) values for the maximum plasma concentration Cmax, volume of distribution at steady state (Vss), and area under curve (AUC) were 1092 +/- 225 ng/ml, 291 +/- 37 mL/kg, and 9987 +/- 2021 micrograms x h/L, respectively. The AUC values were higher at the 0.18 mg/kg dose level than at the 0.1 mg/kg dose level (16,848 +/- 5118 micrograms x h/L vs. 7128 +/- 1156 micrograms x h/L, p = 0.009). Patients with ALL had a significantly larger volume of distribution at steady state (332 +/- 47 mL/kg vs. 191 +/- 12 mL/kg, p = 0.04), faster clearance (21 +/- 3 mL/h/kg vs. 11 +/- 2 mL/h/kg, p = 0.03), and lower dose-corrected AUC than patients with NHL (6010 +/- 836 micrograms x h/L vs. 12,044 +/- 2707 micrograms x h/L, p = 0.006). There was a trend toward faster clearance rates (23 +/- 4 mL/h/kg vs. 16 +/- 3 mL/h/kg, p = 0.1), shorter elimination half-lives (5.7 +/- 3.6 hours vs. 13 +/- 8.8 hours, p = 0.1), and shorter mean residence times (11 +/- 3 hours vs. 25 +/- 5 hours, p = 0.08) for non-Caucasian patients as compared to Caucasian patients. When compared to adult patients, pediatric patients showed a significantly larger volume of distribution at steady state (418 +/- 82 mL/kg vs. 252 +/- 34 mL/kg, p = 0.02) and a longer elimination half-lives (18.4 +/- 13.6 hours vs. 8.7 +/- 6.7 hours, p = 0.04). The pharmacokinetics of B43-Genistein was not affected by the gender of the patients or by bone marrow transplantation in past medical history. Overall, B43-Genistein showed favorable pharmacokinetics in this heavily pretreated leukemia/lymphoma patient population, which is reminiscent of its recently reported favorable pharmacokinetics in cynomolgus monkeys. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical pharmacokinetics study of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor containing immunoconjugate.",,,,,,,['CA-72157/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Expression of Fas (APO-1, CD95) Receptor (FasR) and programmed or active cell (PCD) death was studied in childhood astrocytomas (ASTRs) with varying stages of malignancy, including pilocytic ASTR, low grade ASTR, anaplastic ASTR, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The great majority of childhood glial tumors, particularly ASTRs express FasR whereas normal cells in the central nervous system (CNS) do not. FasR represents a transmembrane glycoprotein which belongs to the nerve growth factor/tumor necrosis factor (NGF/TNF) receptor superfamily. Apoptosis within ASTRs is triggered by the binding of FasR to its natural ligand (FasL) or by cross-linking with antibodies developed against FasR. Presence of FasL was also detected in childhood glial tumors. The expression of both FasR and FasL was also observed within the same ASTRs. Therefore, spontaneous, IP regulatory, intratumoral apoptotic cell death (autocrine suicide) is possible in childhood glial tumors. During a systematic, immunocytochemical screening of 42 childhood ASTRs tissues divided according to WHO classification: 6 WHO grade I or pilocytic ASTRs; 14 WHO grade II or low grade ASTRs; 16 WHO grade III or anaplastic ASTRs and 6 WHO grade IV or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), we detected strong expression (intensity of staining: ""A""--the highest possible; number of stained cells: +2 to +4, between 20% to 90%) of FasR, employing 4 microns thick, formalin fixed, paraffin-wax embedded tissue slides. FasR was present on 70% to 90% of tumor cells in pilocytic ASTRs, in 50% to 60% of the tumor cells in low grade ASTRs, in between 30% and 40% of the tumor cells in anaplastic ASTRs, and in between 20% to 35% of GBM cells. The panel of normal tissues employed as positive and negative tissue controls demonstrated presence of FasR in the prenatal thymus, mature tonsils and colonic epithelium. The use of a sensitive, indirect, six step immunoperoxidase or alkaline phosphatase conjugated streptavidin-biotin antigen detection technique provided excellent immunocytochemical results. A broad spectrum of neoplastic cells have been identified to express FasR: 1) carcinomas of epithelial origin, such as breast (ductal invasive, lobular invasive, mucinous), renal cell, gastric, colorectal, endometrial, prostate, pancreas, hepatocellular and large cell and squamous cell lung carcinomas: 2) non-epithelial neoplasms such as B cell mediastinal B cell and nodal non-Hodgkin's lymphomas large granular lymphocytic leukemia of T or NK cell origin malignant fibrous histiocytoma, malignant mesothelioma, leiomyosarcoma, epitheloid sarcoma and alveolar soft part sarcoma, as well as melanomas. Flow cytometry studies have also detected FasR expression on cells of adult T cell, and hairy cell leukemias, as well as in chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia (BCLL). The coexpression of both FasR and FasL on several malignant cell types may represent an effective mechanism of tumor escape from the cellular immunological response of the host. It has been well established that brain tumors and melanomas produce their autocrine FasL, and even become capable of switching the signal transduction associated with FasL-FasR coupling from the PCD pathway to a tumor growth, proliferative pathway. It seems that the therapeutical use of FasR-FasL (main apoptotic pathway) may represent a new and exciting type of immunotherapy in the treatment of primary childhood glial tumors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There have been major advances in this field in the last few years. This has prompted the Working Group on Hematopoietic Cells to examine the current utilization of this therapy in clinical hematology. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCES: The method employed for preparing this review was that of informal consensus development. Members of the Working Group met three times, and the participants at these meetings examined a list of problems previously prepared by the chairman. They discussed the single points in order to reach an agreement on different opinions and eventually approved the final manuscript. Some of the authors of the present review have been working in the field of cell therapy and have contributed original papers in peer-reviewed journals. In addition, the material examined in the present review includes articles and abstracts published in journals covered by the Science Citation Index and Medline. STATE OF THE ART: Lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) have been used since the '70s mainly in end-stage patients with solid tumors, but the clinical benefits of these treatments has not been clearly documented. TIL are more specific and potent cytotoxic effectors than LAK, but only in few patients (mainly in those with solid tumors such as melanoma and glioblastoma) can their clinical use be considered potentially useful. Adoptive immunotherapy with donor lymphocyte infusions has proved to be effective, particularly in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, in restoring a state of hematologic remission after leukemia relapse occurring following an allograft. The infusion of donor T-cells can also have a role in the treatment of patients with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders. However, in this regard, generation and infusion of donor-derived, virus specific T-cell lines or clones represents a more sophisticated and safer approach for treatment of viral complications occurring in immunocompromised patients. Whereas too few clinical trials have been performed so far to draw any firm conclusion, based on animal studies dendritic cell-based immunotherapy holds promises of exerting an effective anti-tumor activity. Despite leukemic cells not being immunogenic, induction on their surface of co-stimulatory molecules or generation of leukemic dendritic cells may induce antileukemic cytotoxic T-cell responses. Tumor cells express a variety of antigens and can be genetically manipulated to become immunogenic. The main in vitro and in vivo functional characteristics of marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with particular emphasis on their hematopoietic regulatory role are reviewed. In addition, prerequisites for clinical applications using culture-expanded mesenchymal cells are discussed PERSPECTIVES: The opportuneness of using LAK cells or activated natural killer (NK) cells in hematologic patients with low tumor burden (e.g. after stem cell transplantation) should be further explored. Moreover the role of new cytokines in enhancing the antineoplastic activity of NK cells and the infusion of selected NK in alternative to CTL for graft versus leukemia (GVL) disease (avoiding graft versus host disease (GvHD) seems very promising. Separation of GVL from GvHD through generation and infusion of leukemia-specific T-cell clones or lines is one of the most intriguing and promising fields of investigations for the future. Likewise, strategies devised to improve immune-reconstitution and restore specific anti-infectious functions through either induction of unresponsiveness to recipient alloantigens or removal of alloreactive donor T-cells might increase the applicability and success of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Is not clear whether these same criteria apply to patients followed-up in the setting of clinical practice. With the aim of addressing this issue we investigated the clinical outcome of a series of patients with Binet stage A CLL. DESIGN AND METHODS: Two hundred and four Binet stage A CLL patients observed at a single institution over an 18-year period form the basis of this study. Different proposals for subclassifying Binet stage A were validated by using our patients as test-set cases. RESULTS: The survival of patients with early CLL (i.e., Binet stage A and Rai stage 0) was significantly different from that of an age- and sex-matched population. Three of 4 different criteria for subclassifying stage A (Rai substaging, Montserrat criteria, French Group proposal), when applied to our patients, gave similar results in terms of sample size, death rate and disease progression (DP) risk. The French Group proposal, based exclusively on blood counts and hemoglobin levels, was not effective in predicting the risk of DP. Forty-nine (23.5%) patients progressed to a more advanced clinical stage (30 to stage B and 19 to stage C); the risk of DP was 32.8% at 5 years and 49.6% at 10 years. When analyzed as a time-dependent variable (Mantel-Byar method), DP had a clear cut-impact on overall survival (p < 0.0001). Finally, outlook for survival of patients who experienced a change of clinical stage was similar to that of patients in that stage at the time of diagnosis. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: As many patients are now being diagnosed while asymptomatic and at a younger age than previously, an accurate evaluation of prognosis is mandatory in early CLL. How prognostic information translates into a policy of early or delayed therapy is still unclear. Our results further support a conservative approach for CLL in early stage; patients who progress into a more advanced stage have similar survival to those in that stage at diagnosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aiming to minimize this percentage of resistant disease, fractionated cyclophosphamide (f-CY) was then added to the IVAP regimen. DESIGN AND METHODS: Study 08-96 was a prospective, collaborative phase II trial carried out at eight general hospital centers specialized in the care of hematologic malignancies. Historical IVAP-treated patients served as a retrospective control group. All consecutive, untreated patients (>15 years) with a diagnosis of ALL or advanced-stage lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) were eligible. RES-ALL was defined as the persistence of >5% ALL cells in the bone marrow 28-40 days after the start of the IVAP regimen (idarubicin 10 mg/m(2)/d on days 1 and 2; vincristine 2 mg on days 1, 8 and 15; L-asparaginase 6,000 U/m(2) on alternate days 3 6 from day 8; prednisone 60 mg/m(2)/d on days 1-21). In the new study, two f-CY schedules were sequentially adopted: CY 150 or 75 mg/m(2)/bd, given for 4 consecutive days before IVAP (f-CY 1200 or 600, expressing total CY dose in mg/m(2)). RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients were evaluable (age range 15-74 years, blast count 0-240x10(9)/L, 14 T-lineage, 74 B-lineage, 13 Ph/BCR-ABL+). The first 39 patients received the f-CY 1200 schedule, 22 patients received f-CY 600, and the last 27 patients were not given any f-CY. These changes were dictated by the results of interim analyses of the f-CY groups (RES-ALL rate not reduced, myelotoxicity increased). Altogether, compared with the historical IVAP and no f-CY groups, the incidence of RES-ALL was not decreased by the addition of f-CY 1200/600 in B-lineage ALL, regardless of Ph/BCR-ABL expression and blast count. However, none of 14 T-ALL cases in the new study had RES-ALL (8 in f-CY groups, 5 of whom with >25x10(9)/L blast cells), compared to 5/39 (13%, overall) or 4/21 (19%, with >25x10(9)/L blast cells) among the control cases. Owing to small sample size, this difference was not statistically significant. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary experience suggests that T-ALL may be more sensitive than B-lineage ALL to an early therapy including f-CY. The hypothesis could be tested in a larger clinical trial.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this report is to review results following allogeneic marrow transplantation for treatment of secondary leukemia or myelodysplasia at a single tertiary referral center to determine the patient characteristics which lead to better survival and lower relapse. DESIGN AND METHODS: The medical records of 99 patients with secondary leukemia or myelodysplasia transplanted consecutively at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center between 1971 and 1997 were reviewed. Prior to development of secondary leukemia or myelodysplasia, the patients' original diagnoses were hematopoietic malignancies, solid tumors, aplastic anemia, or miscellaneous individual disorders previously treated by chemotherapy alone, radiation alone, chemoradiotherapy, or immunosuppressive therapy. At the time of transplantation, at each stage of myelodysplasia the numbers of patients were 52 with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 15 with refractory anemia with excess blasts in transition (RAEB-T), 18 with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), 11 with refractory anemia (RA), 1 with refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), and 2 with hypoplastic unclassifiable hematologic disorders. Sixty-five patients received marrow from an HLA identical or partially identical family member, and 34 received marrow from an HLA identical unrelated donor after conditioning with chemotherapy and total body irradiation or chemotherapy alone. RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier probability of survival after transplantation for all patients was 13%, and by stage of disease was 33% for RA/RARS, 20% for RAEB, and 8% for RAEB-T/AML. The probability of relapse for all patients was 47%, was 34% for RAEB, and 58% for RAEB-T/AML. None of the patients with RA/RARS has relapsed. The overall probability of non-relapse mortality was 78%, divided equally among infection or organ failure-related causes of death. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The main impediments to long-term survival after transplantation for secondary leukemia or myelodysplasia are relapse and mortality from infections or organ failure. The survival is better when transplantation is done during the early stages of myelodysplasia because it is then associated with a lower relapse rate. These data suggest that patients at risk of secondary myelodysplasia should be followed prospectively to detect the early stages of myelodysplasia, and be considered for transplantation at that time.",,,,,,,"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP51027/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We report here 3 new cases of p190 CMPD that had unusual features. In 2 of the cases the m-BCR rearrangement appeared to be a secondary event. DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients were studied by cytogenetic, FISH, and molecular biology analyses and followed-up clinically. RESULTS: The first patient initially had typical 5q- syndrome, without m-BCR rearrangement. Five years later, she developed hematologic features of CMML, with t(9;22) translocation, m-BCR rearrangement and high levels of p190 BCR-ABL transcript. The second patient initially had hematologic characteristics of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with t(9;22) translocation and m-BCR rearrangement but also other complex cytogenetic findings including 17p rearrangement. Monocytosis developed during the course of the disease. The third patient initially had agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM). Five years later, while the hematologic characteristics were still those of AMM, a first karyotype showed a t(9;22) translocation and molecular analysis showed a very low level of p190 BCR-ABL transcript. Four years later, the patient developed hematologic features of atypical CML with blood monocytosis, t(9;22) and much greater (100 fold) p190 BCR-ABL transcript levels. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our 3 cases and review of the previously published cases show the variability of clinical features of p190 positive CMPD. Our results also suggest that, at least in some cases, p190 BCR-ABL rearrangement could be a secondary event in the course of a myeloid disorder.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The IL-3- and IL-1-mediated proliferation were both inhibited by the specific p38 and MEK1 inhibitors SB203580 and PD98059, respectively. Specificity of these inhibitors was demonstrated by in vitro kinase assays. Furthermore, we examined whether STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) activity is modulated by the p38 and ERK signal transduction pathways, since STAT5 activation has been linked to proliferation. We provide evidence that the p38 kinase pathway, but not the ERK pathway, is to a certain degree involved in the modulation of STAT5 transactivation since SB203580 and overexpression of an inactive MKK3 mutant inhibited the IL-3-induced STAT5 reporter transactivation. In addition, the p38 and ERK pathways are also involved in cytokine production. The IL-1-enhanced IL-6 protein secretion was strongly reduced by SB203580 and PD98059. Despite the fact that IL-3 did induce p38 and ERK kinase activity, it was not able to enhance IL-6 protein secretion, which coincided with the inability of IL-3 to induce NFkappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) activation and IkappaB (inhibitory protein kappaB) degradation. This study demonstrates that the p38 and ERK pathways play a functional role in cell proliferation and IL-6 secretion of AML cells which are dependent on the activated cytokine receptors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Theses treatment-related leukemias raise both theoretical and practical concerns. On a theoretical basis, cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities described constitute useful models to study leukemogenesis. On a practical basis, prognosis of treatment related-leukemia is somehow unfavorable and implies to take in account this risk in the development of combination therapy for solid tumors or hematological malignancies. There are two distinctive types of treatment-induced leukemia: those secondary after alkylating agents and those secondary after topoisomerase-II- inhibitors. These two types of leukemia after regarding their clinical and their hematological characteristics, but also regarding their prognosis and their associated molecular abnormalities. Leukemias induced by alkylating agents occur generally 5 or 6 years after the beginning of the chemotherapy and are preceded by a more or less long phase of pancytopenia or myelodysplasia and according to their cytologic aspects are difficult to be classified within FAB classification. Their prognosis is pejorative. The most commonly found cytogenetic abnormalities associated with these types of induced leukemia are losses or deletions of chromosomes 5 and 7. Leukemias induced by topoisomerase-II-inhibitors occur shortly after the treatment (12 to 30 months), they begin generally suddenly without preleukemia prodom and their more frequent cytological aspects are M4 and M5 type. The prognosis is less severe than alkylating agent related forms with higher response rates and is dependant of discovered cytogenetic abnormalities. The more frequent molecular abnormalities are not chromosome deletions but balanced translocations. They affect particularly the MLL gene located at band 11q23. Other translocations have been described in this type of leukemia and are comparable to the one found in the de novo leukemia (t8;21, t15;17) for example. The evaluation of the risk of treatment-related leukemia for a given chemotherapeutic agent is difficult as for as current treatment use the combination of several agents potentially leukemogenic (chemotherapy and radiotherapy, combination chemotherapy). It is necessary to set up an up-dated data register in order to centralize all therapy-related myelodysplasia and leukemia within the treatment of a given type of cancer.",Les leucemies induites par les chimiotherapies anticancereuses.,,,119,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thereby intracellular signaling via Janus kinases (Jaks) and STAT transcription factors is initiated. We investigated the contributions of LIFR and OSMR to signal transduction in the context of heterodimers with gp130. Chimeric receptors based on the extracellular parts of the IL-5R alpha- and beta-chains were generated, allowing the induced heterodimerization of two different cytoplasmic tails. Our studies demonstrate that upon heterodimerization with the gp130 cytoplasmic region, the cytoplasmic parts of both LIFR and OSMR were critical for activation of an acute phase protein promoter in HepG2 hepatoma cells. The membrane-proximal region of LIFR or OSMR was crucial for the ability of such receptor complexes to induce DNA binding of STAT1 and STAT3 in COS-7 cells. Membrane-distal regions of LIFR and OSMR contributed to STAT activation even in the absence of gp130 STAT recruitment sites. We further show that the Janus kinases Jak1 and Jak2 constitutively associated with receptor constructs containing the cytoplasmic part of LIFR, OSMR, or gp130, respectively.

MHC class I molecules on target cells regulate NK cytotoxicity. However, little is known about the regulation of IFN-gamma production by NK cells. We examined the production of IFN-gamma in individual murine NK cells stimulated with tumor cell lines by flow cytometric analysis of intracellular IFN-gamma. Among several tumor lines tested, the rat basophilic leukemia line RBL-1 induced particularly high level of IFN-gamma production in IL-2-activated NK cells, whereas other lines, including the prototypic NK target YAC-1, induced very low or no IFN-gamma production. Transfection of murine classical MHC class I molecules into RBL-1 cells substantially inhibited IFN-gamma production. This inhibition of IFN-gamma production by MHC class I was independent of Ly-49 or CD94/NKG2A expression on NK cells. These results indicate that some target cells directly stimulate IL-2-activated NK cells and induce IFN-gamma production, but the requirements for the induction of IFN-gamma production seem different from those for NK cytotoxicity. Furthermore, similar to NK cytotoxicity, induction of IFN-gamma production is inhibited by MHC class I on stimulating cells. However, the MHC class I-specific receptors inhibiting IFN-gamma production are different from those for NK cytotoxicity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike both E. coli RNase HI and HIV RT, the RNase H activity of MMLV RT shows greater activity in Mn(2+) than Mg(2+). We investigated the effect of mutations in five conserved active-site residues of the isolated MMLV RNase H domain. Mutations in two carboxylates eliminate metal binding while mutations in other active-site residues allow retention of metal ion affinity. Mutations that inactivate E.coli RNase HI in Mg(2+) have similar effects on the Mn(2+)-dependent activity of MMLV RNase H.

We now examine functional interactions between growth hormone (GH) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in 3T3-F442A fibroblasts. Although EGF enhanced ErbB-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, GH, while causing retardation of its migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, decreased ErbB-2's tyrosine phosphorylation. GH-induced retardation was reversed by treatment of anti-ErbB-2 precipitates with both alkaline phosphatase and protein phosphatase 2A, suggesting that GH induced serine/threonine phosphorylation of ErbB-2. Both GH-induced shift in ErbB-2 migration and GH-induced MAP kinase activation were unaffected by a protein kinase C inhibitor but were blocked by the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) inhibitor, PD98059. Notably, leukemia inhibitory factor, but not interferon-gamma, also promoted ErbB-2 shift and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Cotreatment with EGF and GH versus EGF alone resulted in a 35% decline in acute ErbB-2 tyrosine 1248 autophosphorylation, a marked decline (approximately 50%) in DNA synthesis, and substantially decreased cyclin D1 expression. We conclude that in 3T3-F442A cells, 1) the GH-induced decrease in ErbB-2 tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with MEK1/mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and 2) GH antagonizes EGF-induced DNA synthesis and cyclin D1 expression in a pattern consistent with its alteration in ErbB-2 phosphorylation status.",,,,,,,"['CA65686/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK46395/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM53271/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

However, cardiac troponin I (cTnI) expression has been described only in heart muscle. The goal of this study was to determine whether mRNA for cTnT, slow skeletal troponin T (sTnT), or cTnI was expressed in skeletal muscle biopsies obtained from patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). METHODS: Total mRNA was extracted from healthy human heart (n = 4), healthy human skeletal muscle (n = 5), and skeletal muscle from patients with ESRD (n = 7) and DMD (n = 5). Total RNA (1 microg) was reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The reverse-transcribed cDNAs were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers specific for cTnT, sTnT, and cTnI sequences (GenBank accession numbers X74819, m19308, and X54163, respectively). RESULTS: In all heart specimens, a 150-bp cTnT amplicon was detected. Skeletal muscle from four of seven patients with ESRD and two of five patients with DMD showed expression of a 150-bp amplicon. Using DNA sequencing and a comparison program, the 150-bp amplicons found in heart and diseased skeletal muscle specimens were 100% identical and specific to the cTnT mRNA sequence. No cTnT mRNA expression was found in healthy skeletal muscle. No evidence of sTnT mRNA was found in heart muscle. A 200-bp sTnT amplicon specific to a human sTnT sequence was detected in all skeletal muscle specimens. A 250-bp cTnI amplicon specific to the cTnI sequence was detected in all heart specimens. However, no cTnI mRNA expression was found in healthy or diseased skeletal muscle specimens. cTnT mRNA expression in both heart and diseased skeletal muscles corresponded with cTnT isoform expression, respectively, as determined by Western blot analysis. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate cTnT mRNA expression, but no cTnI mRNA expression, by reverse transcription-PCR in diseased human skeletal muscle that expresses cTnT isoforms.",,,,,,['Clin Chem 2000 Mar;46(3):437'],,,,,,,,,,

These two agents inhibited the Pgp function (rhodamine-123 excretion) as well as cell-mediated cytotoxicity, confirming that Pgp is critical for NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. As revealed by video-rate ultraviolet laser-scanning confocal microscopy, AHC-93 did not inhibit the increase in the intracellular calcium concentration upon binding to target cells, whereas nicardipine did, as reported previously.

DNAzymes are smaller and more efficient enzymatically than ribozymes (RZs), which are catalytic nucleic acids synthesized from ribonucleotides. We have designed three DNAzymes that specifically target the two variants of the p210 bcr-abl gene (splice 1, b3a2; splice 2, b2a2) and the p190 variant (ela2). The cleavage sites for these DNAzymes are located 5 nucleotides (nt) 5' from the fusion site for b3a2, and only 1 nt 5' from the fusion sites for b2a2 and e1a2. We have shown in cell-free in vitro cleavage assays that these DNAzymes efficiently cleave their respective substrates. Mutated DNAzymes, in which only one critical base has been altered, do not cleave these targets. We have used a serum-resistant cytofectin (GS 2888; Gilead) to transfect the DNAzymes into target K562 cells, which express p210bcr-abl. In short-term transfection assays, the DNAzymes specifically inhibited p210bcr-abl protein expression by K562 cells by about 40%, and inhibited cell growth by more than 50% in a 6-day liquid culture assay. We have also transfected freshly isolated CD34+ bone marrow cells from patients with CML with the DNAzymes, which specifically inhibited the growth of bcr-abl-positive CFU-Mix colonies by 53-80%. The potential advantages of anti-bcr-abl DNAzymes over RZs include the following: DNAzymes are much less expensive to synthesize; they are more resistant to serum; and the anti-b2a2 DNAzyme cleaves at a site only 1 nt away from the fusion site, whereas its hammerhead RZ counterpart cleaves this target at a site 8 nt 3' to the fusion site, well within abl exon 2. DNAzymes are novel RNA-cleaving molecules that may significantly improve our ability to inhibit bcr-abl oncogene expression in Ph-positive target cells.",,,,,,,"['CA33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P0 1 CA30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The high-curability of testicular cancer, along with young age of afflicted patients, can result in patients living for many years after the initial treatment. The development of second cancer represents one of the most severe long-term complications in these patients. Patients who have achieved a long-term disease-free status have an increased risk of developing germ-cell tumor in the contralateral testis. Late relapse (occurring more than 2 years after initial treatment) of germ-cell tumor at any site has also been found in approximately 3% of all patients. Patients receiving radiotherapy or chemotherapy for testicular cancer a have small, but clearly identifiable, risk of developing second malignancies. Radiotherapy is associated with a two- to threefold increased risk for second solid cancer. Chemotherapy, especially high-dose etoposide regimens, is associated with increased risk for second leukemia. Although the incidence of second malignancies is rather low, it is important to monitor the carcinogenic potential of therapy, and to develop a preventive approach for second cancer.",,,,18,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, mechanisms by which the former type of SL is caused remain to be elucidated. Since alkylating agents often induce profound marrow dysplasia, long-lived lesions induced on hematopoietic stem cells are of potential relevance to the development of SL. This process may be partially demonstrated by the variety of mitotic modifications found in MDS. Recently, the association has been investigated between certain enzyme polymorphisms related to activation or detoxification of anticancer agents and SL. These studies have potential importance, since individuals with a certain genotype may be at increased risk for SL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I describe the molecular basis of chromosomal translocations inherent in therapy-related secondary leukemias, and present a hypothesis for the molecular mechanism underlying the occurrence of the disease; namely, that poison-type topoisomerase II inhibitors stabilize the reaction intermediate covalent enzyme-DNA cleavage complexes, called ""cleavable complexes,"" which in turn trigger the mobilization of various DNA damage repair and recombination systems to cope with the damage.

NO has been found to play roles as pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic effector molecules. In this study, we investigate effects of NO on taxol-induced apoptosis in human myeloid leukemia cell, HL-60. Incubation of the cells with taxol for 24 hr induced marked DNA fragmentation of HL-60 cells. Treatment of the cells with S-nitrosogluthathione (GSNO), a NO-generating agent, protected the cells against taxol-induced apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis showed that treatment of the cells with 100 nM taxol for 12 hr rendered the cells to be accumulated in G2/M phase, but the cotreatment of the cells with taxol and 0.1 mM GSNO decreased the accumulation of the cell in G2/M phases, suggesting that NO might interfere entering of taxol-treated cells into G2/M phases. Deferoxamine or mimosine, which can arrest cells mainly at G1/S phases, also decreased taxol-induced apoptosis and reduced the number of the taxol-treated cells arresting in G2/M phases. Thus, we conclude that a protective effect of NO on taxol-treated cells from apoptosis may be partially caused by interfering entering of the taxol-treated cells into G2/M phases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, EBV infection can transform B-lymphocytes and induce phenotypic alterations. This study presents the clinicopathological features of four cases with malignant lymphoma, which showed phenotypic and/or genotypic alterations during the course of the disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: To determine the type of EBV genotype, we performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for lymphocyte-defined membrane antigen (LYDMA) of EBV, subtype A/B and latent membrane protein (LMP)-1 deletion. In addition, we analysed the terminal repeat (TR) band of EBV and receptor genes (T-cell receptor gene, TCR; immunoglobulin gene heavy chain, IgH) for EBV-infected cell clonality. Double staining of cell markers (B, T-lymphocytes; histiocytes), and in-situ hybridization (ISH) for EBV were performed using tissues obtained during the course of the disease. The first case showed genotypic and phenotypic alterations of T-cell type to B-cell type. The first TCR rearrangement and T-cell markers (CD3+, CD4+, CD8-) were lost and IgH rearrangement and B-cell markers (CD19+, CD20+) were identified. During the course of the disease, EBV-TR bands changed in size; however, the EBV genotype type B, LMP1 deletion type, and single LYDMA band remained the same. The initial T-cell lymphoma clone was considered to be different from the latter B-cell lymphoma clone. The second case showed phenotypic alterations. The first B-cell marker (CD19+, CD20+, CD68-) changed to histiocytic markers (CD19-, CD20-, CD68+). However, IgH rearrangement and EBV-TR bands remained the same throughout the course of the disease and EBV genotype type A, LMP1 deletion type, and single LYDMA band remained unchanged. The third case showed phenotypic alterations. The B-cell marker (CD20+) was lost; however, IgH rearrangement of PCR and EBV genotype remained the same. In the second and third cases, the initial lymphoma clones were considered to be same as the latter clones. The last case showed lineage alterations from Hodgkin's disease to natural killer (NK) cell leukaemia. However, EBV genotype did not change. The second case and Hodgkin's disease showed LMP expression, but the first and third cases showed no LMP, and EBNA2 was not detected in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: We report the genotypic and/or phenotypic alterations in four patients with EBV-associated lymphoma/leukaemia. However, EBV genotype did not change in all four. These findings suggest that EBV might induce the cell marker and lineage alteration in vivo, as in vitro.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other studies such as electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry and surface marker analysis are needed. The role of cytochemistry has been limited to the negative staining of blasts for Sudan Black B and myeloperoxidase. An abnormal morphology and cytochemistry of bone marrow maturing cells may indicate the myeloid nature of acute leukaemia. In this case of AML-M0, increased numbers of maturing and mature bone marrow granulocytic cells staining simultaneously for both specific and non-specific esterase (double esterase) are described. In acute leukaemia, this abnormal cytochemical finding seems to be specific for myeloid leukaemia and may be used as supplementary evidence of myeloid differentiation of morphologically undifferentiated blasts in cases of AML-M0.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For CR patients, age <median 51 years, absence of Bence-Jones proteinuria (BJP), male sex and white blood cells (WBC) <7 x 109/l predicted for a longer OS. Longer length of first CR was predicted by absence of BJP at presentation (P = 0.03) and fewer than five courses of IC (P = 0.02) to attain CR.

Previous studies have shown non-random utilization of immunoglobulin genes in CLL, some germline in sequence and others containing numerous somatic mutations. To investigate whether familial cases of CLL exhibit similarities in the composition of the B-cell receptor repertoire to the pattern expressed by CLL patients as a whole, we have studied 25 CLL patients belonging to 12 different families (four French and eight Italian), each of which contained at least two affected members. Among familial cases, VH gene segment utilization proved non-random and diverged from the frequencies previously reported among unrelated patients with CLL. Specifically, although the 4-34 and 5-51 gene segments were found repeatedly, the 1-69 and 4-39 gene segments were used sparingly and the 3-23 gene segment presented with increased frequency. Following the pattern detected in studies of unrelated patients, the single 1-69 expressing CLL contained an unmutated H chain sequence and included a long HCDR3 interval. In contrast, 3-23 containing H chains all used JH4, retained at most 93% homology with germline sequence, and included only short HCDR3 intervals. The vast majority of the CLL variable domains contained a high degree of somatic mutation and exhibited an excess of replacement mutations in the CDR intervals.

Defective programmed cell death mechanisms rather than dysregulation of cell cycle appears to predominate in B-CLL and it is likely that a failure to initiate apoptosis contributes to chemoresistance. Most B-CLL cells contain high levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and high Bcl-2/Bax ratios have been associated with in vitro resistance to cytotoxic agents. In this study we evaluated the cellular responses to a Bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide in terms of Bcl-2 mRNA and protein expression and the induction of apoptosis. The antisense molecule induced a specific reduction in Bcl-2 mRNA and protein expression over the 48 h culture period and was associated with increased apoptosis. The study indicates that Bcl-2 protein is central to the mediation of resistance to apoptosis in B-CLL. Therefore Bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotides might be useful in the treatment of B-CLL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All 68 B-cell CLL patients and 31 control subjects analysed had detectable serum levels of VEGF, with no statistically significant difference between two proups. An aberrant increase of circulating levels of VEGF was found in only 17.6% of cases. B-cell CLL patients whose serum VEGF levels were higher than the median (i.e. 194.8 pg/ml) or 75th percentile (i.e. 288.5 pg/ml) values were more frequently at an advanced clinical stage. In contrast, no correlation with other clinico-biological features representative of either tumour mass [bone marrow (BM) histology, peripheral blood (PB) lymphocytosis, beta-2 microglobulin (beta-2m), LDH, interleukin-6 (IL-6)] or disease-progression (DP) [lymphocyte doubling time (LDT)] was found. Serum levels of VEGF predicted the risk of DP in early CLL. Among 41 patients in Binet stage A, progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly shorter in those patients whose VEGF serum concentrations were above the median value. Interestingly, characteristics of stage A patients stratified according to the median value of VEGF were similar with respect to many clinico-biological features, thus suggesting a possible independent prognostic role for such a marker. Finally, when added to the Rai subclassification, VEGF serum levels identified two groups with different PFS within stages I-II. We conclude that increased serum levels of VEGF can be considered useful for predicting the risk of DP and add prognostic information to the Rai subclassification of stage A CLL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This translocation in AML involves both the nucleoporin gene NUP98 on 11p15 and the homeobox gene HOXA9 on 7p15. The invariant chimaeric NUP98/HOXA9 transcripts are a result of the fact that each breakpoint of the NUP98 and the corresponding breakpoint of the HOXA9 gene cluster occur within the same intron. Only one patient with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) carrying this chromosome aberration has been reported, but this study did not involve molecular analysis. We describe two patients with MDS associated with t(7;11): patient 1 was a Japanese man diagnosed with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia; patient 2 was a Japanese woman with refractory anaemia with excess of blasts in transformation. Within a year both patients developed AML and showed multidrug resistance to chemotherapy. Southern blot analysis showed rearrangements of the NUP98 gene of the two patients and the HOXA9 gene of patient 2. Patient 1 had two types of the novel NUP98/HOXA9 fusion transcripts. Each of them lacked the common 141 bp NUP98 exon which was contained in the NUP98/HOXA9 fusion transcripts detected in patient 2 and the reported AML cases.

The technique was used to monitor minimal residual disease for the early detection of relapse and as an assessment of treatment response. Normal BCR mRNA was quantitated to control for RNA degradation and the results reported as a percentage of BCR-ABL/BCR. Every patient measured at diagnosis (n = 21) had increased expression of BCR-ABL of up to 5-fold above the normal BCR levels. With effective treatment the BCR-ABL levels decreased. The molecular data was correlated with Philadelphia chromosome levels in bone marrow and a good correlation was found when treatment induced a cytogenetic response (Spearman correlation = 0.94, P < 0.0001, n = 67 samples). In patients receiving interferon-alpha therapy we found a significant difference in the BCR-ABL levels between cytogenetic response groups. The method was sensitive, reproducible, and readily detected a change in BCR-ABL transcript levels in serial blood samples. Sample throughput was high because post PCR processing was unnecessary.

Results of Western blot analysis for 1384 patients referred with a diagnosis of CML to our institution from 1989 to 1997 were reviewed. Clinical characteristics, results of cytogenetic analysis and RT-PCR for BCR rearrangement were analysed. Five patients with Ph-positive CML expressing the p185BCR/ABL hybrid protein were identified. By RT-PCR, bone marrow specimens of these patients were confirmed to have an e1a2 junction. The median age at diagnosis of these patients was 55 years (range 43-76). All had elevated white cell counts at diagnosis (median 50 x 109/l, range 11.7-163 x 109/l). Four patients had monocytosis (range 10-16%) with a low neutrophil/monocyte ratio in the peripheral blood (range 3.4-5.7). Patients presented with various stages of the disease (two in chronic-phase CP, two in accelerated-phase AP, and one in blastic-phase BP). The clinical course and therapy of the patients varied, with one patient receiving hydroxyurea only, three patients receiving hydroxyurea followed by interferon-alpha based regimens and bone marrow transplantation. The patient presenting in BP was treated with combination chemotherapy. The clinical outcome of the patients was also varied with one patient alive and in complete remission (with complete cytogenetic remission after transplant) and four patients dead after progression to more advanced stages. We conclude that patients with Ph-positive p185BCR/ABL CML frequently present with monocytosis and a low neutrophil/monocyte ratio in the peripheral blood, aiding the speculation that the presence of the p185BCR/ABL hybrid protein may contribute to a phenotype intermediate between CML and CMML.

We studied the CD82 expression in 33 normal donor samples and 98 leukaemias by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We demonstrated that CD82 was moderately expressed in the vast majority of normal granulocytes and monocytes. In contrast, only about one third of the peripheral blood lymphocytes were weakly CD82 positive (CD82+). Interestingly, judgement of the CD82 transcription and expression in various leukaemias revealed that CD82 was overexpressed in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients in accelerated or blastic phase (CML-AP/BP) as well as in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) patients. Analysis of AML patients with CD34+/CD82+ blasts prompted us to expand our studies on haemopoietic CD34+ progenitor cells. Intriguingly, 84-95% of the CD34+ cells isolated from healthy bone marrow, cord blood or peripheral blood were highly CD82+. CD82 was abundantly expressed on primitive as well as on committed haemopoietic progenitor cells.

The median overall survival for the group was 4.8 months, with an estimated 5-year survival of 18%. 28% of patients died of transplant-related toxicities within the first 100 d. Progressive disease was responsible for 48% of deaths. Multi-factor analysis demonstrated that AML (v ALL), disease status (second complete remission [CR2] v others), age (< 40 years) and duration of prior first complete remission (CR1) (> 6 months) were pre-transplant variables significantly associated with improved survival. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of any grade reduced the rate of relapse in both AML and ALL, but only grades I-II were associated with improved survival. Both limited and extensive chronic GVHD were associated with increased survival. Only patients with AML in untreated first relapse or CR2, with a duration of CR1 > 6 months, or patients with T ALL, had a 5-year survival > 20%. Transplants for AML in induction failure or pre-B ALL in untreated first relapse or CR2 had an intermediate outcome, with 5-year survival of 10-20%. A 5-year survival of < 10% was observed for patients transplanted for ALL in induction failure or for pre-B ALL or AML in refractory first relapse or beyond CR2.

In this study the retroviral transduction of CD34+ progenitor cells isolated from the bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) of patients with CML was compared to that of CD34+ cells isolated from the BM and PB of normal individuals and patients with non-haematological malignancies. A highly significant increase in transduction of all cell types was achieved in the presence of the recombinant fibronectin fragment, CH-296 (P < 0.05). In the absence of fibronectin, centrifugation produced a marginal improvement in the transduction of all cell types, which was significant only for CMLBM progenitor cells (P < 0.05). There was no significant additive effect when centrifugation was included in the fibronectin infection protocol. In the presence of CH-296, combinations of three or more cytokines improved transduction for all cell types. The same degree of transduction was observed for both normal and CML cells, irrespective of the variations employed in the infection protocol, suggesting that both leukaemic and non-leukaemic progenitors are equally susceptible to retroviral infection. These results demonstrate that CH-296 has a universal beneficial effect on the transduction of haemopoietic progenitor cells, with clear potential for future clinical trials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A significant correlation was found between Rai and Binet stages and total tumour mass (TTM) score on one hand, and the absolute CD14+ cell cut-off, on the other. This relationship was more evident in Rai 0-II and Binet A-B stages, where a CD14+ cell count >5 x 10(9)/l was preferentially distributed among patients with a higher tumoral mass. In univariate analysis the survival probability at 5 and 10 years showed a significant correlation with Rai and Binet stages, TTM score, CD14+ absolute cell count and median age.

In the multivariate Cox regression model, Rai stage, age and CD14+ cell count were independent significant factors for the prediction of OS. Finally, when the same analysis was restricted to Rai stages 0-II, CD14+ cell count was the only significant independent parameter influencing OS, with a relative death risk of 3.8.

STUDY DESIGN: Research study using normal cats. ANIMALS OR SAMPLE POPULATION: Fourteen adult, feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus (FELV/FIV) negative, neutered male and spayed female cats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen cats underwent heterotopic renal isograft transplantation with nephrectomy of the contralateral kidney. Renal arterial end-to-end anastomosis to the external iliac artery was performed in eight cats and renal arterial end-to-side anastomosis to the aorta was performed in six cats. Cats were monitored for 14 days after surgery. Renal function was evaluated by daily measurement of plasma creatinine concentrations. The cats' health was assessed by the daily recording of body weight, rectal temperature, postoperative complications, urine production, appetite, packed red blood cell volume, and total serum protein. Ultrasonographic assessment of the isograft was performed every third day. Animals were euthanatized or adopted 14 days after surgery and histopathologic analysis of biopsies or whole isograft tissues was performed. RESULTS: Nine of fourteen cats survived the 14-day study period. Although not statistically significant, mean total surgical time and graft warm ischemia time was shorter for the arterial end-to-side anastomosis. Mean daily plasma creatinine concentrations were not significantly different between the two groups. Five of eight cats (62%) undergoing the arterial end-to-end technique developed neuropraxia and lameness of the ipsilateral pelvic limb. Five cats died or were euthanatized because of other complications. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The arterial end-to-side technique appears to be the better method for renal transplantation in cats. Shorter graft warm ischemia and total surgical times, absence of pelvic limb complications, and an adequate return to normal renal function were associated with this technique.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this process is deregulated in mice infected with the Friend spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV). Unlike normal erythroid cells, erythroid cells from SFFV-infected mice are able to proliferate and differentiate in the absence of Epo, resulting in erythroid hyperplasia and leukemia. Over the past 20 years, studies have been carried out to identify the viral genes responsible for the pathogenicity of SFFV and to understand how expression of these genes leads to the deregulation of erythropoiesis in infected animals. The studies have revealed that SFFV encodes a unique envelope glycoprotein which interacts specifically with the EpoR at the cell surface, resulting in activation of the receptor and subsequent activation of erythroid signal transduction pathways. This leads to the proliferation and differentiation of erythroid precursor cells in the absence of Epo. Although the precise mechanism by which the viral protein activates the EpoR is not yet known, it has been proposed that it causes dimerization of the receptor, resulting in constitutive activation of Epo signal transduction pathways. While interaction of the SFFV envelope glycoprotein with the EpoR leads to Epo-independent erythroid hyperplasia, this is not sufficient to transform these cells. Transformation requires the viral activation of the cellular gene Sfpi-1, whose product is thought to block erythroid cell differentiation. By understanding how SFFV can deregulate erythropoiesis, we may gain insights into the causes and treatment of related diseases in man.",,,,162,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through the application of gene targeting technology, the production of mice lacking TPO or its receptor c-Mpl has provided valuable insights into the physiological roles of TPO signalling. The near identical phenotype of c-mpl-/- and TPO-/- mice provides strong biological evidence that TPO is the sole c-Mpl ligand and uses no other additional receptor itself. TPO-/- and mpl-/- mice are severely thrombocytopenic indicating that TPO is the primary physiological regulator of platelet production in vivo. The physiological basis for this platelet deficiency has been further defined by analysis of megakaryocytes and committed progenitor cells, the numbers of which are also reduced in these mutants. The platelets that are produced in the absence of TPO signalling are morphologically and functionally normal and residual production is sufficient to prevent bleeding and allow a normal lifespan. Thus, TPO-/- and mpl-/- mice also reveal that important TPO-independent mechanisms exist that control platelet production in vivo, and these mice are ideal models to explore the nature of these alternative regulators. The mechanisms regulating the circulating levels of TPO have also been elucidated in these mice, highlighting the central role of c-Mpl mediated internalisation and degradation. The unexpected observation that progenitor cells of all hemopoietic lineages are produced in reduced numbers in TPO-/- and mpl-/- mice has also led to studies that uncovered a central role for TPO signalling in hemopoietic stem cell regulation.",,,,64,,,['HL62275/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Reassessment of 1060 job titles in the measurement database generated 20 subcategories in addition to 28 occupational categories used in the original cohort mortality study. Furthermore, previously misclassified jobs were corrected. The complete work history of each sub-cohort member was re-examined. Original and refined average annual exposures were 0.086 and 0.088 microT, respectively. The average career cumulative exposures were 1.40 and 1.44 microT-years, respectively. Spearman correlation coefficients between the original and refined methods across the companies were 0.81 for annual exposure and 0.93 for career cumulative exposure. 23% of the workers were assigned to another exposure ranking after refinement, but 85% of these moved to an adjacent group, suggesting that the differences in exposure ranking are small. The results of this study indicate that refinements have modest influence on the average annual and career exposures. However, the refinements may only change a very rough exposure assessment into one that is slightly less crude. The proportion of workers assigned to another exposure ranking indicated that nondifferential exposure misclassification in the original cohort mortality study may have occurred. Implications of these changes for the risk estimates of brain cancer and leukemia cases will to be examined.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After 50 Gy irradiation, cells were found to die early, primarily by apoptosis, while cells irradiated with 10 Gy died predominantly by necrosis. Disassembly of the nuclear lamina and degradation of the nuclear matrix protein lamin B occurred in cells undergoing radiation-induced apoptosis or necrosis. However, using Western blotting and a recently developed flow cytometry assay to detect changes in nuclear matrix protein content, we found that the kinetics and mechanisms of disassembly of the nuclear lamina are different for each mode of cell death. During radiation-induced apoptosis, cleavage and degradation of lamin B to a approximately 28-kDa fragment was detected in most cells within 4-12 h after irradiation. Measurements of dual-labeled apoptotic cells revealed that nonrandom DNA fragmentation was evident prior to or concomitant with breakdown of the nuclear lamina. Disassembly of the nuclear lamina during radiation-induced necrosis occurred much later (between 30-60 h after irradiation), and a different cleavage pattern of lamin B was observed. Degradation of the nuclear lamina was also inhibited in apoptosis-resistant BCL2-overexpressing HL60 cells exposed to 50 Gy until approximately 48 h after irradiation. These data indicate that breakdown of the nuclear matrix may be a common element in radiation-induced apoptosis and necrosis, but that the mechanisms and temporal patterns of breakdown of the nuclear lamina during apoptosis are distinct from those of necrosis.",,,,,,,"['CA62209/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA64674/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Even after IFN treatment a drastic decrease in STAT-1alpha (signal transducers and activators of transcription-1alpha), STAT-2 and p48 (ISGF-3gamma: IFN-stimulated gene factor-3gamma), which are closely correlated with the IFN-signaling pathway, was found in these persistently infected cells (Akata-MP1 and K-MTP). Therefore, the IFN-signaling pathway is thought to be defective in these persistently infected cells. In other words, most of the IFN-inducible genes in these cells persistently infected with mumps virus may not be able to respond to IFN treatment. Indeed, poor induction of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5AS), dsRNA activated protein kinase (PKR), and MxA protein mRNAs were demonstrated in these cell lines after IFN treatment. Expression of MHC class-I antigen was also significantly reduced in the persistently infected cell lines as compared with that of uninfected control cells. HLA antigen was augmented by IFN-alpha in Akata and K562 cells, but not in persistently infected cells. Furthermore, suppression of IFN-induced 2-5AS induction and MHC class-I expression was restored by treatment of persistently infected cells with ribavirin through inhibition of virus replication. The result of restoration was also confirmed by IFN-induced STAT-1 induction in persistently infected cells treated with ribavirin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is assumed that this is due to decreased tumor responsiveness that results from decreased drug accumulation. We observed that treatment of animals bearing MDR1-transfected leukemic cells with P-gp substrates (i.e., drugs that are transported by P-gp) significantly worsened host survival compared to treatment with vehicle or non-P-gp substrates. This effect was seen with cancer chemotherapeutic agents (paclitaxel and vincristine) and with the MDR modulator, trans-flupenthixol. To determine the mechanism(s) underlying this observation, we studied alterations in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and metastasis. We found that the drug-induced acceleration of disease was associated with increased metastases. P-gp(+) cells treated with P-gp substrates demonstrated several pro-metastatic features, including membrane ruffling and invasion through a hepatocyte monolayer. These results suggest that the treatment of MDR tumors with P-gp substrates may produce changes in malignant behavior that could adversely affect therapeutic outcomes.",,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,"['CA 66077/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20CA57140-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

This down-regulation has been shown to reduce drug resistance of the Reh cells to anti-tubulin polymerization agents. In the present study we investigated the effect of bryostatin 1 alone and in combination with novel anti-tubulin agents (dolastatin 10 and auristatin PE) and the chemotherapeutic vincristine on the inhibitor of apoptosis protein cIAP-1. Cells were cultured with bryostatin 1 (1 nM), dolastatin 10 (0.1 ng/ml), auristatin PE (0.1 ng/ml), or vincristine (0.5 ng/ml) alone or the combination of these anti-tubulins with bryostatin 1. Western blots were conducted to assess the effects of the above agents on cIAP-1 protein level. Flow-cytometric analysis [7-amino-actinomycin D (7AAD)] was conducted to assess apoptosis as well as staining for morphology using tetrachrome stain. Our results show that cIAP-1 is induced in a time-dependent fashion after bryostatin 1 exposure up to 72 h. However, upon treatment of cells with a combination of bryostatin 1 and dolastatin 10 or auristatin PE, the induction of cIAP-1 was abolished, leading to a significant increase in apoptosis. The initial 24- and 48-h reduction in cIAP-1 protein level recorded in the bryostatin 1 and vincristine combination recovered to control levels by 72 h. We believe that this phenomenon is responsible for the reduced apoptosis recorded in this combination. Results of this study should prove useful in guiding the clinical application of these novel agents in the treatment of ALL.",,,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,"['CA79837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA22453-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Perturbation of the humoral environment of DC was investigated in a number of ways, for example with continuous infusion of rhG-CSF from a subcutaneous implanted minipump to DC host mice, with DC host mice carrying a transplantable leukaemia, secreting interleukin 3 (IL-3), and with injections of various cytokines. None of these interventions sustained the expansion of the G/M-CFC population. In conclusion, for ectopic haematopoiesis to take place, several requirements must be met. Relevant stromal cells apparently affect haematopoiesis both via direct cell-cell interactions and via humoral mediators (viz. cytokines) which they secrete.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies of loss of heterozygosity identified a small genetic interval on chromosome 12p12.3 that is frequently deleted in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Two genes, ETV6/TEL and p27/KIP1, are located in this interval. Evidence has accumulated that an as-yet unidentified tumor suppressor gene is closely linked to these. To facilitate the identification of candidate genes, a long-range high-resolution restriction map of the ALL locus was constructed using a contig of YAC clones. Several marker loci, including 11 STS, three newly developed YAC end-based STS, six EST, and seven genes were unambiguously positioned in the new map. The map covers 1.8Mb and extends from the distal salivary proline-rich protein gene cluster to the proximal p27/KIP1 gene. The data confirmed the order tel-D12S358-p27/KIP1-cen and excluded p27/KIP1 as a candidate tumor suppressor gene. The critical region delimited by D12S89 and D12S358 is a 750kb CpG-island rich region that includes the 240kb TEL/ETV6 gene as well as CLAPS3 (clathrin-adaptor small chain 3). The new map provides a molecular framework for the identification of novel genes and transcriptional units in the ALL interval.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the metabolism, dose requirements, and tolerance of 6-mercaptopurine among patients with different TPMT phenotypes. METHODS: We compared, by use of statistical modeling, 6-mercaptopurine pharmacology and tolerance in 180 patients who achieved remission on St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Protocol Total XII composed of weekly methotrexate (40 mg/m(2)) and daily oral 6-mercaptopurine (75 mg/m(2)) given for 2.5 years, interrupted every 6 weeks during the first year for treatment with either high-dose methotrexate or teniposide plus cytarabine. Statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Erythrocyte concentrations of thioguanine nucleotides (pmol/8 x 10(8) erythrocytes) were inversely related to TPMT enzyme activity (P<.01), with averages (+/- standard deviations) of 417 (+/-179), 963 (+/-752), and 3565 (+/-1282) in TPMT homozygous wild-type (n = 161), heterozygous (n = 17), and homozygous-deficient (n = 2) patients, respectively. There was complete concordance between TPMT genotype and phenotype in a subset of 28 patients for whom TPMT genotype was determined. There were no sex differences in thioguanine nucleotide concentrations (P =.24), TPMT enzyme activity (P =.22), or average weekly prescribed dose of 6-mercaptopurine (P=.49). The cumulative incidence of 6-mercaptopurine dose reductions due to toxicity was highest among patients homozygous for mutant TPMT (100%), intermediate among heterozygous patients (35%), and lowest among wild-type patients (7%) (P<.001), with average (+/- standard deviation) final weekly 6-mercaptopurine doses of 72 (+/-60), 449 (+/-160), and 528 (+/-90) mg/m(2), respectively. Lowering doses of 6-mercaptopurine in TPMT heterozygotes and in deficient patients allowed administration of full protocol doses of other chemotherapy while maintaining high thioguanine nucleotide concentrations. CONCLUSION: We conclude that genetic polymorphism in TPMT is an important determinant of mercaptopurine toxicity, even among patients who are heterozygous for this trait.",,,,,,,"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1999 Dec 1;91(23):1983-5.

The specificity of the produced antisera was demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting, and by immunohistochemistry on sections of mouse embryos of 13.5 days post coitum. Specificity for the IGFBP-2 through -6 antisera also was confirmed immunohistochemically in liver and lung of corresponding gene deletion (knock-out) mutant mice and wild-type litter mates. Immunohistochemistry and messenger RNA (mRNA) in situ hybridization on sections of mouse embryos of 13.5 days post coitum revealed tissue-specific expression patterns for the six IGFBPs. The only site of IGFBP-1 protein and mRNA production was the liver. IGFBP-2, -4, and -5 protein and mRNA were detected in various organs and tissues. IGFBP-3 and -6 protein and mRNA levels were low. In several tissues, such as lung, liver, kidney, and tongue, more than one IGFBP (protein and mRNA) could be detected. Differences between mRNA and protein localization were extensive for IGFBP-3, -5, and -6, suggesting that these IGFBPs are secreted and transported. These results confirm the different spatial localization of the IGFBPs, on the mRNA and protein level. The overlapping mRNA and protein localization for IGFBP-2 and -4, on the other hand, may indicate that these IGFBPs also function in an auto- or paracrine manner.",,,,,,,['NS-21970/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Bcl-2-related proteins act as regulators of apoptosis via the formation of dimers with proteins inside and outside the Bcl-2 family. Previous studies have identified BAD as a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member expressed in the ovary. It is known that BAD phosphorylation induced by survival factors leads to its preferential binding to 14-3-3 and suppression of the death-inducing function of BAD. To identify ovarian binding partners for hypophosphorylated BAD, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening of a rat ovary complementary DNA library using as bait a mutant BAD incapable of binding to 14-3-3. Screening of yeast transformants yielded positive clones encoding the rat ortholog of Mcl-1 (myeloid cell leukemia-1), an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that rat and human Mcl-1 showed a complete conservation of the Bcl-2 homology domains BH1, BH2, and BH3. In the yeast two-hybrid system, Mcl-1 binds to the hypophosphorylated mutant of BAD and interacts preferentially with different proapoptotic (Bax, Bak, Bok, Bik, and BOD) compared with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Bfl-1, CED-9, and BHRF-1). Northern blot hybridization demonstrated expression of Mcl-1 transcripts of 2.3 and 3.7 kb in the ovary and diverse other rat tissues. In immature rats, PMSG treatment led to a transient increase in the 2.3-kb Mcl-1 transcript, peaking at 6 h after injection and returning to baseline levels after 24 h. Moreover, the same transcript was induced in the PMSG-primed preovulatory rat ovary 6 h after the administration of ovulatory doses of either hCG or FSH. In situ hybridization studies revealed that the gonadotropin stimulation of ovarian Mcl-1 message occurs in both granulosa and thecal cells. In conclusion, rat Mcl-1 was identified as an ovarian BAD-interacting protein and the message for the antiapoptotic Mcl-1 protein was induced after treatment with gonadotropins in granulosa and thecal cells of growing follicles.",,,,,,,['HD-31566/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],['Endocrinology. 1999 Dec;140(12):5465-8.

An often misdiagnosed entity, it is often confused with other inflammatory or neoplastic conditions, including large cell lymphoma. CASE: A 67-year-old female presented with acute myelogenous leukemia and a normal karyotype. After eight years in complete remission, abdominal pain and an ulcerated mass in the uterine cervix developed, with a normal peripheral blood smear. Vaginal cytology examination revealed myeloid blasts, which, on subsequent cervical biopsy, stained positive for leukocyte common antigen, Kp-1 (CD68), antimyeloperoxidase, lysozyme and chloroacetate esterase, confirming the cytologic diagnosis. K-ras was not mutated at codon 12 or 13. Chemotherapy induced a complete remission, followed nine months later by central nervous system and then systemic relapse. The patient died 13 months after being diagnosed with granulocytic sarcoma of the cervix. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the value of vaginal cytology and histologic biopsy evaluation in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, including those without evidence of systemic disease. The characteristic cytologic features of granulocytic sarcoma led to the correct diagnosis. Histologic biopsy evaluation, including immunohistochemistry for myeloid markers, proved of value in confirming the diagnosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report two ALL patients with repeated episodes of extramedullary relapse after BMT in whom both mechanisms might be operating. In the first patient, the marrow was in morphologic and molecular remission before isolated leukaemic relapse in the central nervous system (CNS) occurred. Subsequent secondary infiltration of leukaemic cells into the marrow was only evident molecularly but not morphologically, implying that the relapse had arisen in a sanctuary CNS site. In the second patient, a first relapse in the marrow, which was induced into morphologic and molecular remission by chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion, was followed by extramedullary relapses without any subsequent involvement of the marrow.

The growth of poor-risk neuroblastoma (NBL) survivors treated with myeloablative preparative regimens and ABMT at the Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University of Helsinki, since 1982 is reported. Two separate groups were analyzed: (1) The TBI- patients (n = 15) were conditioned with high-dose chemotherapy only. They had been treated at the age of 1.0-6.3 (mean 3.0) years and the post-ABMT follow-up time was 1.5-14.5 (mean 7.7) years. (2) The TBI+ patients (n = 16) had received TBI in addition to high-dose chemotherapy. They had been treated at the age of 1.3-4. 8 (mean 3.0) years, and the post-ABMT follow-up time was 1.5-8.0 (mean 4.7) years. The height standard deviation score (SDS) was similar for the two groups at the time of diagnosis, -0.3 +/- 1.2 (mean +/- s.d.), and at the time of ABMT, -0.7 +/- 1.1. After transplantation, the height SDS continued to decrease in the TBI+ group, the mean being -2.0 SDS at 5 years after ABMT. In the TBI-group, the mean height SDS remained within -0.7 to -0.9 to the 10 years of follow-up. Five patients received growth hormone (GH) therapy starting 2-6 years after ABMT. They all had low GH secretion in provocative tests. All showed some response to GH therapy. The mean height SDS increased 0.4 SDS during the 3 years following the start of GH therapy, while in the untreated patients a decrease of 0. 8 SDS during the corresponding time (P = 0.009) was observed. We conclude that NBL patients grow poorly following ABMT when TBI is included in the conditioning regimen, but close to normally when treated without TBI. The need for GH therapy should be evaluated early to avoid an unnecessary decrease in final height.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunotherapy has a role in the myeloid leukemias, and there is increasing evidence that of all hematopoietic neoplasms, CML may be the most susceptible to immune regulation. Roquinimex is known to enhance T cell, NK cell and macrophage activity. A phase II study was initiated in March 1992 to evaluate the role of roquinimex in Ph chromosome-positive CML post ABMT. Patients were conditioned with busulfan/ cyclophosphamide followed by reinfusion of unmanipulated Ph-positive bone marrow stem cells (>1 x 108 NBC/kg). When engraftment of neutrophils (ANC) reached 100/microl, patients received oral roquinimex twice weekly, escalating to a maximal dose of 0.2 mg/kg in 2 weeks. Seventeen patients have entered the study; 11 in first chronic phase (CP1); two in second chronic phase (CP2) and four in accelerated phase (AP). All required significant myelosuppressive therapy prior to ABMT to maintain stable blood counts and most had also received prior interferon therapy. All patients survived the transplant. Subsequent toxicity consisted mainly of musculoskeletal aches and peripheral edema. Additionally, specific skin changes were observed including graft-versus-host-like disease and eccrine sweat gland necrosis. Eight out of 17 patients are alive 28-60 months post ABMT. Of the nine patients who died, two were in CP2 and three in AP. All patients in CP1 went into a complete hematological remission post ABMT and seven of the 11 patients had at least a major cytogenetic response (greater than 65% Ph-negative metaphases) at 1 year or beyond and four of the 11 patients had a complete cytogenetic response at 2 years or beyond.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied Ikaros gene expression in normal human bone marrow, normal thymocytes, normal fetal liver-derived immature lymphocyte precursor cell lines, eight different ALL cell lines, and leukemic cells from 69 children with ALL (T-lineage ALL, n = 18; B-lineage ALL, n = 51). Expression of Ikaros protein and its subcellular localization were examined by immunoblotting and confocal laser-scanning microscopy, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleotide sequencing were used to identify the specific Ikaros isoforms expressed in these cells. Genomic sequencing of splice junction regions of the Ikaros gene was performed in search for mutations. RESULTS: In each of the ALL cases, we found high-level expression of a non-DNA-binding or aberrant DNA-binding isoform of Ikaros with abnormal subcellular compartmentalization patterns. In contrast, only wild-type Ik-1 and Ik-2 isoforms with normal subcellular localization were found in normal bone marrow cells and thymus-derived or fetal liver-derived normal lymphocyte precursors. In leukemic cells expressing the aberrant Ikaros coding sequences with the 30-base-pair deletion, genomic sequence analysis of the intron-exon junctions between exons 6 and 7 yielded the wild-type sequence. We identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) affecting the third base of the triplet codon for a proline (CCC or CCA) in the highly conserved bipartite activation region (viz, A or C at position 1002 numbering from the translation start site of Ik-1) within our Ikaros clones. Bi-allelic expression of truncated and/or non-DNA-binding isoforms along with wild-type isoforms was observed in leukemic cells, which implicates trans-acting factor(s) affecting splice site recognition. CONCLUSION: Our findings link specific molecular defects involving the Ikaros gene to childhood ALL. Posttranscriptional regulation of alternative splicing of Ikaros RNA seems to be defective in leukemic lymphocyte precursors from most children with ALL. Consequently, leukemic cells from ALL patients, in contrast to normal lymphocyte precursors, express high levels of non-DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms that are reminiscent of the non-DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms that lead to lymphoblastic leukemia in mice.",,,,,,,['CA-13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['J Clin Oncol. 2000 Mar;18(6):1395-7.

The purpose of this study was to prevent marrow relapse by administering intensive therapy before delayed craniospinal radiation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-three patients with ALL in first bone marrow remission with an isolated CNS relapse were treated with systemic chemotherapy known to enter into the CSF and intrathecal chemotherapy for 6 months. Craniospinal irradiation (24 Gy cranial/15 Gy spinal) was then administered, followed by 1.5 years of maintenance chemotherapy. RESULTS: All 83 patients achieved a second remission. The 4-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 71.1% +/- 5.3%. There was a fourfold increased risk of relapse for children whose initial remission was less than 18 months. The 4-year EFS rate for patients with a first complete remission >/= 18 months was 83.3% +/- 5.3%, and for those with a first complete remission less than 18 months, it was 46.2% +/- 10.2% (P =.0002.) There was a low incidence of neurologic toxicity and an unexpectedly high rate of allergic reactions to L-asparaginase. Five patients developed secondary malignancies: two with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia during therapy, one with myelodysplasia after therapy, and two with brain tumors 1.5 to 2 years after cessation of therapy. CONCLUSION: For children with ALL and an isolated CNS relapse, treatment that delays definitive craniospinal irradiation by 6 months to allow for more intensive systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy results in better EFS than has been previously reported. Using this approach, the long-term prognosis for children with first complete remission >/= 18 months is comparable to that at the time of original diagnosis of ALL.",,,,,,['J Clin Oncol 2000 Feb;18(3):703'],"['CA-03161/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-05587/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-07431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-three children (30 males and 23 females; age range, 1.5 to 18 years) were enrolled onto the study. The median time from first CR to ABMT was 3.5 months (range, 1.4 to 13 months), with 45 patients (85%) undergoing transplantation within 6 months from the diagnosis. Forty-five patients received in vitro marrow purging with standard-dose mafosfamide (100 microg/mL), seven patients were treated with interleukin-2 before marrow collection, and in the remaining child, the marrow was unmanipulated. The median infused cell dose was 1.8 x 10(8)/kg (range, 0.4 to 5.8 x 10(8)/kg). RESULTS: All patients but one achieved hematopoietic engraftment, with a median time to neutrophil recovery of 24 days (range,11 to 66 days). Treatment-related toxicity was moderate and consisted mainly of mucositis. One patient died from cytomegalovirus interstitial pneumonia, and one died from pulmonary hemorrhage. Fourteen patients (26%) relapsed at a median time of 6 months after ABMT (range, 2 to 17 months), with a cumulative relapse probability of 29% (95% confidence interval, 16% to 42%). The 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival for all 53 patients was 78% (range, 65% to 90%), whereas the overall 5-year disease-free survival was 68% (range, 55% to 81%), with a median follow-up duration of 40 months (range, 7 to 130 months). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that, in our cohort of patients, the combination of total-body irradiation and melphalan is safe and associated with good antileukemia activity, making ABMT an appealing alternative for postremission therapy in children with acute myeloid leukemia in first CR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The occurrence of and risk factors for malignant neoplasm in long-term survivors must be assessed. OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk and define potential risk factors for new malignant conditions in long-term survivors after marrow transplantation. DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter study. SETTING: Study of the Late Effects Working Party with 45 transplantation centers cooperating in the European Cooperative Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. PATIENTS: 1036 consecutive patients who underwent transplantation for leukemia, lymphoma, inborn diseases of the hematopoietic and immune systems, or severe aplastic anemia. Transplantation was done before December 1985, and patients had survived more than 5 years. MEASUREMENTS: Reports on malignant neoplasms were evaluated, and the incidence was compared to that in the general population. Patient age and sex, primary disease and status at transplantation, histocompatibility of the donor, conditioning regimen, type of prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease, development of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, and treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease were evaluated as variables. RESULTS: Median follow-up since transplantation was 10.7 years (range, 5 to 22.1 years). Malignant neoplasms were seen in 53 patients; the actuarial incidence (+/- SE) was 3.5% +/- 0.6% at 10 years and 12.8% +/- 2.6% at 15 years. The rate of new malignant disease was 3.8-fold higher than that in an age-matched control population (P < 0.001). The most frequent malignant diseases were neoplasms of the skin (14 patients), oral cavity (7 patients), uterus (including cervix) (5 patients), thyroid gland (5 patients), breast (4 patients), and glial tissue (3 patients). Median age of patients and their donors was 21 years. Malignant neoplasms were more frequent in older patients and in patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease. Older patient age and treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease with cyclosporine were significant risk factors for new malignant neoplasms after bone marrow transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: The spectrum of neoplasms and immunosuppressive treatment with cyclosporine for chronic graft-versus-host disease as dominant risk factors indicate that immunosuppression is the major cause of malignant neoplasms in patients receiving marrow transplants.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, the nuclear suppressor proteins PML and p53 are also known to play critical roles in cancer development and in suppressing cell growth. Here we report that, in glioblastoma cells with defective EGFR function, the expressions of both promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) and p53 were altered. Cells that were transfected with the antisense-cDNA of EGFR were found to have more cells in G1 and fewer cells in S phase. In addition, the transfected cells were found to be non-responsive to EGF-induced cell growth. Interestingly, the expression of the suppressors p53 and PML were found to be significantly increased by immunohistochemical assay in the antisense-EGFR cells. Moreover, the PML expression in many of the cells was converted from the nuclear dot pattern into fine-granulated staining pattern. In contrast, the expressions of other cell cycle regulated genes and proto-oncogene, including the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4), retinoblastoma, p16INK4a and p21H-ras, were not altered. These data indicate that there are specific inductions of PML and p53 proteins which may account for the increase in G1 and growth arrest in antisense-EGFR treated cells. It also indicates that the EGF, p53 and PML transduction pathways were linked and they may constitute an integral part of an altered growth regulatory programme. The interactions and cross-talks of these critical molecules may be very important in regulating cell growth, differentiation and cellular response to treatment in glioblastomas.",,PMC2362944,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also assessed their effects on cytokine production (IL-3, IL-10 and IFN-gamma) in PBMC, T-cell lymphoma, HUT78 (IL-2), and murine Th1 (IL-2) and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-5) clones. These compounds were synthesize as analog of known inhibitors of purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) 8-amino-9-benzylguanine. These compounds suppressed proliferation of human leukemia MOLT-4 cells, human cutaneous lymphoma HUT78 cells and normal PMBC. Compound II was a significantly more potent inhibitor than compound I. Exogenous recombinant human IL-2 reversed the anti-proliferative effects of both compounds on HUT78 cells. These compounds had low toxicity to human EBV-transformed B-lymphocytes. Both compounds suppressed the production of IL-2 by activated human HUT78 cells, IFN-gamma by PBMC and did not affect IL-3 and IL-10 production in PBMC. Compound I inhibited anti-CD3-activated IL-2 secretion from the murine Th1 clone. The murine Th2 clone was less sensitive to both compounds as compared with Thl.

The apoptosis of U937 cells was observed at as early as 1-1.5 h following UV irradiation, with most cells being in apoptotic state at 3 h. Pretreatment with PMA for as short as 5 min was sufficient to inhibit apoptosis induced by UV irradiation, whereas apparent changes in cell cycle distributions and expression of differentiation markers by PMA were not observed until 12 h and 48 h, respectively. The inhibition of apoptosis by PMA was completely abolished by the pretreatment with calphostin C, a PKC inhibitor, and 4 alpha-phorbor 12,13-didecanoate, which is unable to activate PKC, did not protect U937 cells against apoptosis induced by UV irradiation.

Yet the water soluble analogue, topotecan, which was inhibitory at > 1 microM in vitro, had no clinical activity in vivo. In the present study, we evaluated the in vitro cytotoxicities of SN-38, the active form of irinotecan, and two newer water soluble camptothecin derivatives 10,11-methylenedioxy-20(S)-camptothecin glycinate (MDCG) and 7-chloromethyl-10,11-methylenedioxy-20(S)-camptothecin glycinate (CMMDCG).

Effects on cellular metabolism, induction of apoptosis, and overall cell survival were used to evaluate chemosensitivity. We report that the relative cytotoxic potency for these compounds is MDC > or = CMMDC > or = SN-38 >> TPT > CPT-11, where MDC, CMMDC, and SN-38 were over an order of magnitude more cytotoxic than TPT and CPT-11. We also investigated potential mechanisms underlying the unexpected cytotoxicity of these camptothecin derivatives in B-CLL cells that are known to be arrested in G0/G1 of the cell cycle, and found that this class of compounds inhibited [3H]uridine incorporation. We therefore postulate that the inhibition of RNA rather than DNA synthesis may be responsible for the observed cytotoxicity in non-cycling B-CLL cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, most treated patients become resistant to treatment and this represents a major problem in the successful management of the condition. Experimental evidence points to the fact that most chemotherapeutic drugs ultimately exert their cell killing effect through the process of apoptosis. In this study we compared the apoptotic responses of B-CLL cells in vitro following exposure to several chemotherapeutic drugs. We found that there was a correlation between ID50 values for all the drugs under investigation; particularly between Chlorambucil and Fludarabine (P = 0.0002). In addition, we analysed the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax, two proteins pivotal to the regulation of apoptosis, both immediately ex vivo and in viable and apoptotic sub-populations following exposure to drug. Our data suggest that high Bcl-2/Bax ratios may be predictive of a drug resistant phenotype in B-CLL cells and that modulation of these proteins is essential for the induction of cell death. Furthermore, it seems likely that the superior potency that has been ascribed to Fludarabine is due to it being administered in a more optimised dose. A recently reported clinical trial of Fludarabine against high-dose Chlorambucil supports this view since it showed that both treatment modalities were comparable in terms of response rate and survival times.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The occurrence of receptors for G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3 and SCF on marrow cells was assessed using immunofluorescent ligand binding assays. Additionally, patients responses to first phase induction chemotherapy was recorded to examine whether in vitro kinetic data might correlate with clinical outcome. All kinetic and receptor assays were performed in normal marrow cells to ascertain their response to priming. Incubation of AML cells in serum free medium (SFM) +/- G + GM-CSF, IL-3, SCF, G + GM-CSF + SCF or IL-3 + SCF prior to S phase assessment revealed that priming permutations inclusive of SCF were most effective but also that the baseline level of S phase activity with SFM alone influenced the subsequent response to priming. Regardless of AML group, samples with low baseline S phase activity (< 10%) were significantly more responsive than those with high (> 10%) SFM S phase levels. However there was no corresponding difference in the percentages of cells bearing receptors. In both AML groups, low baseline S phase activity was observed more frequently in samples from patients who achieved CR. Normal samples possessed receptors for all HGFs and were responsive to all priming permutations except SCF alone. This study raises four points: (a) it may be prudent to reserve the use of priming HGFs for those patients with low baseline S phase activity whose cells respond in vitro and to use SCF in these priming cocktails; (b) the presence of receptors capable of ligand binding in AML samples did not guarantee kinetic response; (c) normal progenitors were responsive to priming which may have implications for haemopoietic reconstitution post therapy; and (d) the kinetic characteristics of AML progenitors may influence clinical outcome regardless of whether treatment includes HGFs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In individuals with the GSTT1 null genotype, the odds ratios for disease risk were elevated to 2.65 (95%CI; 1.27-5.52) in de novo MDS, 4.62 (1.48-14.4) in therapy-related AML, and 2.94 (1.07-8.07) in AML with triliniage dysplasia. Other representative polymorphisms of GSTs had a similar incidence among patients with myelodysplasia, and those of the controls and other hematological disorders. To further investigate the genetic pathway of myelodysplasia, the association between GST genotype and karyotype or configurations of TP53 and NRAS was evaluated, but no relationship was noted. These results suggest that the GSTT1 null genotype may play a role in an increased risk of myelodysplasia unrelated to other mechanisms of myelodysplasia, such as chromosomal alterations or mutation of TP53 or NRAS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about gastroduodenal perforation in cancer patients. METHODOLOGY: Data of 11 cancer patients with gastroduodenal perforation were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: There were 2 females and 9 males with a mean (+/- s.e.) age of 56.7+/-4.7 years and a median of 55. The primary malignancies included lung cancers (3 cases), hepatocellular carcinomas (2 cases), squamous cell carcinomas of the tongue (2 cases), malignant lymphoma of the small bowel (1 case), adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (1 case), adenocarcinoma of the stomach (1 case), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (1 case). The average duration of symptoms was 36.5+/-10.1 hours (median: 24 hours). Methods of surgical treatment included simple closure of the perforation (6 cases), truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty (3 cases), pyloroplasty (1 case), and subtotal gastrectomy (1 case). Four patients (36.4%) had post-operative complications. The post-operative hospital mortality rate was 18.2%. One patient died of sepsis with gastrointestinal hemorrhage and 1 died of hepatic failure and respiratory failure. Pre-operative shock is the only significant factor in predicting operative mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Gastroduodenal perforation occurring in cancer patients without chemotherapy had favorable short-term operative results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Marrow failure was noted on day 77 post-transplantation, however, after an episode of herpes zoster infection. Interstitial pneumonia, diagnosed on the basis of chest x-ray and computed tomography findings, occurred on day 120. Histologic examination of an open-lung biopsy specimen showed caseating granulomas and a few acid-fast bacilli.
