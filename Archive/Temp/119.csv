In an effort to prevent this cardiotoxicity, different anthracycline derivates have been studied. OBJECTIVES: To determine the occurrence of cardiotoxicity with the use of different anthracycline derivates in cancer patients. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to 29 May 2009) and EMBASE (1980 to 2 June 2009). In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings and ongoing-trials-databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which different anthracycline derivates were compared in cancer patients (children and adults). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently performed study selection, assessment of risk of bias and data-extraction including adverse effects. MAIN RESULTS: We identified five RCTs of varying quality addressing epirubicin versus doxorubicin (1036 patients) with the same dose. The meta-analysis showed no evidence for a significant difference in the occurrence of clinical heart failure between the treatment groups (RR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.11). However, there is some suggestion of a lower rate of clinical heart failure in patients treated with epirubicin.We identified two RCTs with varying quality addressing liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin versus conventional doxorubicin (521 patients). The meta-analysis showed a significantly lower rate of both clinical heart failure and clinical and subclinical heart failure combined in patients treated with liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin (RR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.75 and RR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.59 respectively). It should be noted that in one of the studies patients in the liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin group received a higher cumulative anthracycline dose than patients in the doxorubicin group.For the other possible combinations of different anthracycline derivates only one RCT (epirubicin versus liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin) or no RCT was identified. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are not able to favour either epirubicin or doxorubicin when given with the same dose. Based on the currently available evidence on heart failure, we conclude that in adults with a solid tumour liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin should be favoured over doxorubicin. For both epirubicin versus doxorubicin and liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin versus conventional doxorubicin no conclusions can be made about the effects of treatment in children treated with anthracyclines and also not in patients diagnosed with leukaemia. More research is needed. For other combinations of anthracycline derivates not enough evidence was available to make definitive conclusions about the occurrence of cardiotoxicity in patients treated with anthracyclines.","[""Paediatric Oncology, Emma Children's Hospital / Academic Medical Center, PO Box 22660 (room F8-257), Amsterdam, Netherlands, 1100 DD.""]",20100317,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2010;(5):CD005006.

We and others have previously shown that application of exogenous gp130 ligands promotes photoreceptor survival in light-induced and inherited retinal degeneration in animal models. While there is strong evidence that gp130 plays an essential role in photoreceptor protection, it is not clear whether protection is cell-autonomous in photoreceptors or an effect of Muller cell activation. To investigate the role of Muller cells in gp130-mediated photoreceptor protection, we have generated conditional gp130 knockout (KO) mice in retinal Muller cells using the Cre/lox system. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses show that in our conditional gp130 KO mice, approximately 50% Muller cells no longer respond to LIF with activation of known downstream signaling proteins, STAT3 and ERK1/2. Despite the loss of gp130 activity in many Muller cells, intravitreal injection of LIF still induced significant degree of photoreceptor protection that was comparable to normal littermates. These data suggest that Muller cell activation of gp130 is not essential for photoreceptor protection, and support the hypothesis that the protection is mediated by cell-autonomous mechanisms in photoreceptors.","['Oklahoma Center for Neuroscience, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104, USA.']",,,,,"['R01 EY016459/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR017703/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 EY012190/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

CNTF/LIF inhibits rod photoreceptor, and promotes bipolar cells and Muller glia differentiation. In addition, CNTF/LIF has been shown to have proliferative and apoptotic effects. Moreover, LIF also inhibits retinal vascular development. CNTF/LIF signaling components CNTFRalpha, LIFRbeta, gp130, and a number of STAT proteins are expressed in the retina. CNTF/LIF activates Jak-STAT, ERK, and Notch pathways during retinal development. Perturbation of CNTF induced signal transduction reveals that different combinations of CNTF/LIF signaling pathways regulate differentiation of retinal neurons and glia. Gene expression studies show that CNTF/LIF affects retinogenesis by regulating various genes involved in transcription, signal transduction, protein modification, apoptosis, protein localization, and cell ion homeostasis. Most past studies have deployed ectopic expression or addition of exogenous CNTF/LIF, thus further ana-lysis of mice with conditional mutations in CNTF/LIF signaling components will allow better understanding of in-vivo functions of CNTF/LIF associated signaling events in retinogenesis.","['University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA. kdrhee@ucla.edu']",,,,,"['R01 EY012270/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY012270-08/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY019052/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS201371'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we test the hypothesis that PKC activation promotes development of rod photoreceptors by inhibiting STAT3. Explant cultures of mouse retina were used to study the effects of PKC activation on rod development. The expression of opsin, a rod specific marker, is induced at an early stage in retina explants cultured in the presence of PMA and this effect is prevented by the PKC inhibitor Go7874. Histological experiments show that there is expression of PKC beta1, but not PKC-alpha in the outer nuclear layer between E17.5 and PN5. In vitro data derived from cell lines shows that activation of PKC results in reduction of STAT3 phosphorylation. In addition, inhibition of PKC results in increase STAT3 phosphorylation. We suggest that cross talk of signals between STAT3 and PKC may determine the differentiation of rods from retinal progeitors.","['Department of Neural and Behavioral Sciences, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.']",,,,,['R01 EY013865/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we conducted a prospective study to assess whether tap water from the domestic environment of neutropenic patients poses a risk for infections from the waterborne pathogens nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), Legionella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tap water samples were taken in the homes of 65 hemato-oncologic patients who were discharged from the hospital whilst neutropenic and had a suspected period of neutropenia of a minimum of 10 days. Selective culture for Legionella, P. aeruginosa, and NTM was performed. Patients who required hospital readmission were monitored for infection with the aforementioned pathogens over the following 3 months. RESULTS: NTM were cultured in 62 (95.4%) households in concentrations from 1 to 1,000 CFU/500 ml. The facultative pathogenic species Mycobacterium chelonae (58.5% of taps) and M. mucogenicum (38.5% of taps) were most frequently detected. Legionella spp. was cultured from six households (9.2%), including five households with L. pneumophila in concentrations from 25 to 2,500 CFU/500 ml. P. aeruginosa was found in seven households (10.8%) in concentrations from 5 to 2,500 CFU/500 ml. While clinical infection with Legionella spp. was not detected in any patients, infection with M. chelonae and P. aeruginosa occurred in one and seven patients, respectively. However, transmission from household water could not be confirmed. CONCLUSION: Although the risk of infection from household water-borne pathogens appears low, preventive measures may be considered on an individual basis in patients with long-term immunosuppression as well as in patients with long-term central-vascular catheterization.","['Section Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology, Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, University Hospital of Ulm, Steinhoevelstr. 9, 89075, Ulm, Germany. heike.von-baum@uniklinik-ulm.de']",20100318,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KCNRG protein may interfere with the normal assembly of the K+ channel proteins causing the suppression of Kv currents. We aimed to examine possible role of KCNRG haploinsufficiency in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and MM cells. We performed detailed genomic analysis of the KCNRG locus; studied effects of the stable overexpression of KCNRG isoforms in RPMI-8226, HL-60, and LnCaP cells; and evaluated relative expression of its transcripts in various human lymphomas. Three MM cell lines and 35 CLL PBL samples were screened for KCNRG mutations. KCNRG exerts growth suppressive and pro-apoptotic effects in HL-60, LnCaP, and RPMI-8226 cells. Direct sequencing of KCNRG exons revealed point mutation delT in RPMI-8226 cell line. Levels of major isoform of KCNRG mRNA are lower in DLBL lymphomas compared to normal PBL samples, while levels of its minor mRNA are decreased across the broad range of the lymphoma types. The haploinsufficiency of KCNRG might be relevant to the progression of CLL and MM at least in a subset of patients.","['Molecular Biology and Microbiology Department, College of Science, George Mason University, David King Hall, MSN 3E1, Fairfax, VA 22030, USA.']",20091218,,,,['R15 CA113331/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clonal erythrocytosis, which is the diagnostic feature of polycythemia vera (PV), is almost always associated with a JAK2 mutation (JAK2V617F or exon 12). Therefore, in a patient with acquired erythrocytosis, it is reasonable to begin the diagnostic work-up with JAK2 mutation analysis to distinguish PV from secondary erythrocytosis. The clinical course of PV is marked by a high incidence of thrombotic complications that represent the main cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Blood hyperviscosity as well as platelet and leukocyte quantitative, and qualitative abnormalities play a major role in the pathogenesis of thrombophilia. Prevention of vascular events and minimizing the risk of disease transition into acute leukaemia are the main targets of the whole PV treatment strategy.

Karyotyping of cytogenetic abnormalities in such cases continues to provide critical prognostic information which allows the delivery of an appropriate intensity of treatment. Unfortunately, karyotyping of childhood leukaemia is difficult, laborious and often unsuccessful. Banding resolution tends to be poor unlike routine antenatal cytogenetics. The aim of the study is to highlight the benefit of dedicated cytogenetics in improving karyotyping results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed the impact of setting up a team of cytogeneticists in the National University Hospital (NUH) on the success of karyotyping, evaluating cytogenetic data collected from 1989 to 2006. From 1989 to 2006, 4789 cases have been processed. Among them, 369 newly diagnosed and relapsed childhood acute leukaemia cases [281 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 88 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)] have been diagnosed at NUH. A dedicated cytogenetics laboratory with clearly defined standard operating procedures and quality control was set up in 2002. It used the established recommendation of a complete analysis of at least 20 metaphases per analysis. RESULTS: Overall, the frequency of successful karyotyping was significantly higher (P = 0.002) at 90.7% (185/204) from 2002-2006 compared to 79.4% (131/165) from 1989-2001. For ALL cases, the success rate improved from 77.6% (97/125) in 1989 to 2001 to 89.1% (139/156) in the 2002 to 2006 cohort. For AML, the success rate also was significantly improved (P = 0.04) from 85% (34/40) to 95.8% (46/48).

The integration profiles of vectors based on MLV, ASLV, SIV and HIV have all been shown to be non-random, and novel vectors with a safer integration pattern have been sought. Recently, we developed a producer cell line called CatPac that packages standard MoMLV vectors with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) gag, pol and env gene products. We now report the integration profile of this vector, asking if the FeLV integrase and capsid proteins could modify the MoMLV integration profile, potentially resulting in a less genotoxic pattern. We transduced rhesus macaque CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells with CatPac or standard MoMLV vectors, and determined their integration profile by LAM-PCR. We obtained 184 and 175 unique integration sites (ISs) respectively for CatPac and standard MoMLV vectors, and these were compared with 10 000 in silico-generated random IS. The integration profile for CatPac vector was similar to MoMLV and equally non-random, with a propensity for integration near transcription start sites and in highly dense gene regions. We found an IS for CatPac vector localized 715 nucleotides upstream of LMO-2, the gene involved in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia developed by X-SCID patients treated by gene therapy using MoMLV vectors. In conclusion, we found that replacement of MoMLV env, gag and pol gene products with FeLV did not alter the basic integration profile. Thus, there appears to be no safety advantage for this packaging system. However, considering the stability and efficacy of CatPac vectors, further development is warranted, using potentially safer vector backbones, for instance those with a SIN configuration.","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",20100318,,,,"['R01 HL031823/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 HL002339-16/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z99 HL999999/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS173022'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In adult hematopoiesis, only a small portion of early progenitor cells express WT1, whereas most leukemias show persistently high levels, suggesting an oncogenic role. We have previously characterized oncogenic BCR/ABL1 tyrosine kinase signaling pathways for increased WT1 expression. In this study, we show that overexpression of BCR/ABL1 in CD34+ progenitor cells leads to reduced expression of interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), in addition to increased WT1 expression. Interestingly, IRF8 is known as a tumor suppressor in some leukemias and we investigated whether WT1 might repress IRF8 expression. When analyzed in four leukemia mRNA expression data sets, WT1 and IRF8 were anticorrelated. Upon overexpression in CD34+ progenitors, as well as in U937 cells, WT1 strongly downregulated IRF8 expression. All four major WT1 splice variants induced repression, but not the zinc-finger-deleted WT1 mutant, indicating dependence on DNA binding. A reporter construct with the IRF8 promoter was repressed by WT1, dependent on a putative WT1-response element. Binding of WT1 to the IRF8 promoter was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Our results identify IRF8 as a direct target gene for WT1 and provide a possible mechanism for oncogenic effects of WT1 in leukemia.","['Department of Hematology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",20100318,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In multivariate analysis, low global DNA methylation was associated with higher complete remission rate (hazard ratio (HR) 5.9, P=0.005) and p15 methylation was associated with better overall (HR 0.4, P=0.001) and disease-free survival (HR 0.4, P=0.016).

Unlike the drugs used in conventional chemotherapy, these agents are designed to specifically interfere with key molecular events that are responsible for the malignant phenotype. They hold great promise for widening the therapeutic window, which would provide more effective treatment options as compared with cytotoxic therapies. In addition, the targeted approach that is characteristic of these drugs provides unique opportunities for combination therapies with other anticancer agents that have non-overlapping toxicities. Targeted agents are therefore primed to become invaluable therapeutic tools in the multimodal treatment of cancer. The challenges associated with these novel targeted therapies are distinct from those faced in conventional chemotherapy. These unique challenges include the need to select appropriate pharmacodynamic markers to guide dose and schedule and to identify biomarkers that enable selection of patient populations that are most likely to benefit from the treatment. In addition, although the emergence of resistance to targeted therapies is a problem frequently faced in the clinic, the molecular characterization of resistance mechanisms provides the opportunity to design second-generation therapies or combination therapies aimed at preventing resistance or restoring response. The development of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib has revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In this article, we discuss the lessons learned from the application of imatinib and other targeted agents in clinical practice and discuss how these insights may guide the development of novel targeted therapies.","['Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.']",20100317,,,56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now report that it exists in 2 forms with different N-glycosylation patterns in the mu-constant region. One glycoform is similar to normal B cells in bearing mature complex glycans common to most cell-surface glycoproteins. The other is an immature mannosylated form more characteristic of mu chains in the endoplasmic reticulum. Unmutated CLL (U-CLL) expresses a higher proportion of mannosylated surface mu chains than mutated CLL. Normal B cells express only the mature glycoform but can express the immature form after persistent engagement of sIgM, suggesting that glycan modification is a consequence of antigen exposure. CLL cells express variable proportions of the mannosylated form and can revert to the mature form after incubation in vitro. Both glycoforms are able to signal after sIgM engagement in vitro, leading to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation. These findings support the concept that CLL cells are continuously exposed to antigen in vivo, driving the N-glycosylation pattern of expressed sIgM toward a mannosylated form, especially in U-CLL. Strikingly, this is reminiscent of follicular lymphoma, where mannosylated Ig is expressed constitutively via N-glycosylation sites in the variable region, suggesting a functional asset for this glycoform.","['Molecular Immunology Group, Cancer Sciences Division, University of Southampton School of Medicine, Southampton, United Kingdom.']",20100317,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of Meis1 is rate-limiting in MLL-associated leukemias and potently interacts with Hox and NUP98-HOX genes in leukemic transformation to promote self-renewal and proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors. The oncogenicity of MEIS1 has been linked to its transcriptional activation properties. To further reveal the pathways triggered by Meis1, we assessed the function of a novel engineered fusion form of Meis1, M33-MEIS1, designed to confer transcriptional repression to Meis1 target genes that are otherwise up-regulated in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Retroviral overexpression of M33-Meis1 resulted in the rapid and complete eradication of M33-Meis1-transduced normal and leukemic cells in vivo. Cell-cycle analysis showed that M33-Meis1 impeded the progression of cells from G(1)-to-S phase, which correlated with significant reduction of cyclin D3 levels and the inhibition of retinoblastoma (pRb) hyperphosphorylation. We identified cyclin D3 as a direct downstream target of MEIS1 and M33-MEIS1 and showed that the G(1)-phase accumulation and growth suppression induced by M33-Meis1 was partially relieved by overexpression of cyclin D3. This study provides strong evidence linking the growth-promoting activities of Meis1 to the cyclin D-pRb cell-cycle control pathway.","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",20100317,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

G-CSF has also been applied in priming strategies designed to enhance the sensitivity of leukemia stem cells to cytotoxic agents, in protocols aimed to induce their differentiation and accompanying growth arrest and cell death, and in severe aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to alleviate anemia. The potential adverse effects of G-CSF administration, particularly the risk of malignant transformation, have fueled ongoing debates, some of which can only be settled in follow-up studies extending over several decades. This specifically applies to children with severe congenital neutropenia who receive lifelong treatment with G-CSF and in which the high susceptibility to develop MDS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has now become a major clinical concern. Here, we will highlight some of the controversies and challenges regarding the clinical application of G-CSF and discuss a possible role of G-CSF in malignant transformation, particularly in patients with neutropenia harboring mutations in the gene encoding the G-CSF receptor.","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",20100317,,,78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These translocations generate chimeric fusion proteins, all of which have in common the N-terminal half of Nup98, which contains the nucleoporin FG/GLFG repeat motifs. The homeodomain group of Nup98 fusion proteins retain the C-terminus of a homeodomain transcription factor, including the homeobox responsible for DNA binding. Current models for Nup98 leukemogenesis invoke aberrant transcription resulting from recruitment of coregulators by the Nup98 repeat domain. Here we have investigated the behavior of Nup98-homeodomain fusion proteins throughout the cell cycle. At all stages, the fusion proteins exhibit a novel localization distinct from the component proteins or fragments. During interphase, there are dynamic interactions between the Nup98 fusions and endogenous Nup98 that lead to mislocalization of the intranuclear fraction of Nup98, but do not alter the level of Nup98 at the nuclear pore complex. During mitosis, no interaction between the fusion proteins and endogenous Nup98 is observed. However, the fusions are entirely concentrated at kinetochores and on chromosome arms, sites where the APC/C, a target of Nup98 regulation, is also found. Our observations suggest new possibilities for misregulation by which Nup98 translocations may contribute to cellular transformation and leukemogenesis.","['Department of Cell Biology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",20100317,,,,"['R01 GM059975/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-59975/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elevated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in ATL patients is associated with leukemic cell invasion and infiltration in different organs. The regulatory protein Tax 1 encoded by HTLV-1 plays a pivotal role in T-cell transformation by deregulating the function and expression of several cellular factors. In the present study, we examined the effect of Tax 1 on VEGF expression at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels in order to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms involved. Using functional assays, we demonstrate that Tax 1 downregulates the VEGF promoter through a cluster of Sp1 sites located close to the transcriptional start site. Using gel mobility shift assays, we show that Tax 1 reduced Sp1:DNA complex formation. We demonstrate that the level of secreted VEGF was significantly lower in Tax 1-transfected 293T cells compared to nontransfected cells, which is consistent with the observed downregulatory effect of Tax 1 at the transcription level. We showed that VEGF was secreted by HTLV-1-transformed and nontransformed cells, irrespective of Tax 1 expression. Overall our data indicate that, contrary to a previous report, Tax 1 downregulates VEGF expression and suggest there are Tax 1-independent mechanisms of VEGF activation in ATL.","['Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland.']",20100317,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study attempted to evaluate the economics of voriconazole versus posaconazole for prophylaxis in AML. METHODS: A 6 year (2003-09) retrospective chart review of AML patients was performed at a major Australian tertiary hospital. Patients were followed through the induction stage of chemotherapy, estimating outcome probabilities and prescribing patterns of antifungal prophylaxis. Cost inputs were obtained from the latest Australian sources. A decision analytical model was developed to depict options and consequences involved in the prophylaxis, including success, survival, possible and proven IFIs, and discontinuations due to intolerance. A cost-benefit analysis and an uncertainty study through sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Fifty-six and 38 patients were evaluated in the voriconazole and posaconazole groups, respectively. Baseline demographic characteristics were not significantly different between the study cohorts. Posaconazole was associated with an overall cost saving of AU$17,458 (29%) per patient over voriconazole. The posaconazole group was associated with lower rate of death, as well as lower probability of discontinuation because of possible infections and intolerance to oral administration. The voriconazole group was associated with fewer proven infections. As per sensitivity analyses, results were highly robust over variations in all costs and probabilities in the model. Monte Carlo simulation suggested a 91.6% chance for posaconazole to cost less than voriconazole.

Nanotubes are suspended in biological solutions (DMEM, RPMI) with three different concentrations (10, 50, and 100 microg/ml) and toxicological investigations are carried on human T-cell leukemia (Jurkat) and human pancreatic carcinoma (PANC1) cell lines. According to light and transmission electron microscopy results, mwCNTs form well-defined and regular bundles in the presence of 1% T80 surfactant; whereas more irregular structures are present in absence of T80. Dispersion quality is represented in terms of the size distribution from dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments and its second moment. Dispersion quality of the mwCNTs decreases with decreasing T80 concentration, while the constituents of RPMI and DMEM increase the dispersion quality. No significant differences between the dispersive effects of RPMI and DMEM suspensions are observed. Zeta potential of the mwCNTs is measured using electrophoretic light scattering. Variations in the nanotube and T80 concentrations do not change the zeta potential significantly.

Although MLLs are recognized as major regulators of gene activation, their mechanism of action, target genes and the distinct functions of different MLLs remain elusive. Recent studies demonstrate that besides H3K4 methylation and HOX gene regulation, MLLs have much wider roles in gene activation and regulate diverse other genes.

The agreement between the automated method and the manual reference showed high correlation, with Pearson correlation coefficients greater than 0.9 for all types of body fluids. We also demonstrate that the automated body fluid analysis on the XE-5000 is an acceptable alternative to the microscopic reference method as far as ascitic fluid, peritoneal dialysis fluid, SF or PF are concerned. Conversely, results for body fluid samples from oncology patients with leukaemia or tumours showed significant differences between both methods, as XE-5000 counted blast cells and neoplastic cells in mononuclear cell count. XE-5000 could represent an attractive method for the automated analysis of WBC, RBC, mononuclear cell count (MNC) and polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells of most body fluids. However, CSFs from patients with leukaemia or lymphoma should be processed with the microscopic reference method in order to detect abnormal leukaemic cells.","[""Laboratoire d' Hematologie, CHU Caen Cote de Nacre, Caen, France.""]",20100303,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Septins can bind and hydrolyze GTP, which is intrinsically related to their formation of septin hexamers and functional protein interactions. The human septin family is composed of 14 loci, SEPT1-SEPT14, which encode dozens of different septin proteins. Their central GTPase and polybasic domain regions are highly conserved but they diverge in their N-terminus and/or C-terminus. The mechanism by which the different isoforms are generated is not yet well understood, but one can hypothesize that the use of different promoters and/or alternative splicing could give rise to these variants. Septins perform diverse cellular functions according to tissue expression and their interacting partners. Functions identified to date include cell division, chromosome segregation, protein scaffolding, cellular polarity, motility, membrane dynamics, vesicle trafficking, exocytosis, apoptosis, and DNA damage response. Their expression is tightly regulated to maintain proper filament assembly and normal cellular functions. Alterations of these proteins, by mutation or expression changes, have been associated with a variety of cancers and neurological diseases. The association of septins with cancer results from alterations of expression in solid tumors or translocations in leukemias [mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)]. Expression changes in septins have also been associated with neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as well as retinopathies, hepatitis C, spermatogenesis and Listeria infection. Pathogenic mutations of SEPT9 were identified in the autosomal dominant neurological disorder hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy (HNA). Human septin research over the past decade has established their importance in cell biology and human disease. Further functional characterization of septins is crucial to our understanding of their possible diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic applications.","['Department of Human Genetics, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.']",20100211,,,114,"['R01 CA072877-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 CA123639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5F31CA12363902/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007544/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 CA123639-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA072877/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA072877/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS209346'],,,,['The authors declare that no conflict of interest exists.'],,,,,,,,

The cancer incidence rate in a cohort of 92,957 children diagnosed using X-rays in the years 1976 - 2003 in the radiology department of a large university clinic was studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Individual radiation doses per examination were reconstructed using an algorithm taking into account the dose area product and other exposure parameters together with conversion factors computed specifically for the equipment and protocols used in the radiology department. Incident cancer cases in the period 1980 - 2006 were identified via record linkage to the German Childhood Cancer Registry using pseudonymized data. RESULTS: A total of 87 cancers occurred in the cohort between 1980 and 2006: 33 leukemia, 13 lymphoma, 10 brain tumors, and 31 other tumors. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for all cancers was 0.99 (95 % CI: 0.79 1.22). A dose-response relationship was not observed for all cancers, leukemia and lymphoma or solid tumors. The cancer risks for boys and girls did not differ. CONCLUSION: No increase in the cancer incidence risk in relation to very low doses of diagnostic ionizing radiation was observed in this study. However, the results are compatible with a broad range of risk estimates.","['Institut fur Medizinische Biometrie, Epidemiologie und Informatik (IMBEI), Universitatsmedizin der Johannes-Gutenberg-Universitat, Mainz. hammer@imbei.uni-mainz.de']",20100316,,,,,,"['Rofo. 2011 Mar;183(3):291-2, 294; author reply 292-4.

So far, iPSCs have been generated from primary cells, but it is unclear whether human cancer cell lines can be reprogrammed. Here we describe the generation and characterization of iPSCs derived from human chronic myeloid leukemia cells. We show that, despite the presence of oncogenic mutations, these cells acquired pluripotency by the expression of 4 transcription factors and underwent differentiation into cell types derived of all 3 germ layers during teratoma formation. Interestingly, although the parental cell line was strictly dependent on continuous signaling of the BCR-ABL oncogene, also termed oncogene addiction, reprogrammed cells lost this dependency and became resistant to the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib. This finding indicates that the therapeutic agent imatinib targets cells in a specific epigenetic differentiated cell state, and this may contribute to its inability to fully eradicate disease in chronic myeloid leukemia patients.","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.']",20100316,,,,"['R01-HD045022/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R37-CA084198/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 HD045022/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA084198/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD045022/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA084198/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous work has shown expression in peripheral blood (PB) of CLL B cells of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) among CLL patients with an unmutated (UM) profile of immunoglobulin genes and with ongoing class switch recombination (CSR) process. Because AID expression results from interaction with activated tissue microenvironment, we speculated whether the small subset with ongoing CSR is responsible for high levels of AID expression and could be derived from this particular microenvironment. In this work, we quantified AID expression and ongoing CSR in PB of 50 CLL patients and characterized the expression of different molecules related to microenvironment interaction. Our results show that among UM patients (1) high AID expression is restricted to the subpopulation of tumoral cells ongoing CSR; (2) this small subset expresses high levels of proliferation, antiapoptotic and progression markers (Ki-67, c-myc, Bcl-2, CD49d, and CCL3/4 chemokines). Overall, this work outlines the importance of a cellular subset in PB of UM CLL patients with a poor clinical outcome, high AID levels, and ongoing CSR, whose presence might be a hallmark of a recent contact with the microenvironment.","['Unit of Recombinant Protein, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.']",20100316,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 2.5-Mb commonly deleted segment (CDS) of chromosome band 7q22 is implicated as harboring a myeloid tumor suppressor gene (TSG); however, molecular analysis of candidate TSGs has not uncovered loss of function. To determine whether haploinsufficiency for the 7q22 CDS contributes to myeloid leukemogenesis, we performed sequential gene targeting to flank a region of orthologous synteny on mouse chromosome band 5A3 with loxP sites. We then generated Mx1-Cre, 5A3(fl) mutant mice and deleted the targeted interval in vivo. Although excision was inefficient, we confirmed somatic deletion of the 5A3 CDS in the hematopoietic stem cell compartment. Mx1-Cre, 5A3(fl) mice show normal hematologic parameters and do not spontaneously develop myeloid malignancies. The 5A3(fl) deletion does not cooperate with oncogenic Kras(G12D) expression, Nf1 inactivation, or retroviral mutagenesis to accelerate leukemia development and did not modulate responsiveness to antileukemia drugs. These studies demonstrate that it is feasible to somatically delete a large chromosomal segment implicated in tumor suppression in hematopoietic cell populations in vivo; however, our data do not support the hypothesis that the 7q22/5A3 CDS interval contains a myeloid TSG.","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.']",20100316,,,,"['P01 CA040046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA084221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01CA84221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37CA72614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA072614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The challenges in utilizing synthetic ECMs is the effective control of temporal and spatial complexity of multiple signal presentation, as compared to natural ECMs that possess the inherent properties of biological recognition, including presentation of receptor-binding ligands, susceptibility to cell-triggered proteolytic degradation, and remodeling. We have developed a murine preadipocyte differentiation system for generating a natural basement membrane extract (Adipogel) comprising ECM proteins (collagen IV, laminin, hyaluronan, and fibronectin) and including relevant growth factors (hepatocyte growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and leukemia inhibitory factor). We have shown the effective utilization of the growth factor-enriched extracellular matrix for enhanced albumin synthesis rate of primary hepatocyte cultures for a period of 10 d as compared to collagen sandwich cultures and comparable or higher function as compared to Matrigel cultures. We have also demonstrated comparable cytochrome P450 1A1 activity for the collagen-Adipogel condition to the collagen double-gel and Matrigel culture conditions. A metabolic analysis revealed that utilization of Adipogel in primary hepatocyte cultures increased serine, glycine, threonine, alanine, tyrosine, valine, methionine, lysine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, taurine, cysteine, and glucose uptake rates to enhance hepatocyte protein synthesis as compared to collagen double-gel cultures. The demonstrated synthesis, isolation, characterization, and application of Adipogel provide immense potential for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.","['Center for Engineering in Medicine/Surgical Services, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",20100316,,,,"['P30 DK040561/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK040561-15/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK059766/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P41 EB-002503/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI063795/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P41 EB002503/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study investigates the in vitro and in vivo effect of the phospholipid ether edelfosine (1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine) in MCL and CLL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Several cell lines, patient-derived tumor cells, and xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient mice were used to examine the anti-MCL and anti-CLL activity of edelfosine. Furthermore, we analyzed the mechanism of action and drug biodistribution of edelfosine in MCL and CLL tumor-bearing severe combined immunodeficient mice. RESULTS: Here, we have found that the phospholipid ether edelfosine was the most potent alkyl-lysophospholipid analogue in killing MCL and CLL cells, including patient-derived primary cells, while sparing normal resting lymphocytes. Alkyl-lysophospholipid analogues ranked edelfosine > perifosine >> erucylphosphocholine > or = miltefosine in their capacity to elicit apoptosis in MCL and CLL cells. Edelfosine induced coclustering of Fas/CD95 death receptor and rafts in MCL and CLL cells. Edelfosine was taken up by malignant cells, whereas normal resting lymphocytes hardly incorporated the drug. Raft disruption by cholesterol depletion inhibited drug uptake, Fas/CD95 clustering, and edelfosine-induced apoptosis. Edelfosine oral administration showed a potent in vivo anticancer activity in MCL and CLL xenograft mouse models, and the drug accumulated dramatically and preferentially in the tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that edelfosine accumulates and kills MCL and CLL cells in a rather selective way, and set coclustering of Fas/CD95 and lipid rafts as a new framework in MCL and CLL therapy. Our data support a selective antitumor action of edelfosine.","['Instituto de Biologia Molecular, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-Universidad de Salamanca, Spain. fmollin@usal.es']",20100316,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2010 AACR.'],,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Two dose-escalation studies evaluated voreloxin administered i.v. every 3 weeks (SPO-0001) or weekly for 3 weeks every 28 days (SPO-0002). In SPO-0001, patients were classified as heavily pretreated (HP) or minimally pretreated (MP) based on therapeutic history. RESULTS: In the SPO-0001 study, 41 patients (24 HP/17 MP) were treated in eight dose cohorts (3-75 mg/m(2)). At 60 mg/m(2), four HP patients experienced DLTs: grade 4 neutropenia (n = 3, one with fever) and grade 3 febrile neutropenia/pneumonia (n = 1). At 75 mg/m(2), two MP patients experienced DLTs: grade 4 neutropenia/thrombocytopenia (n = 1) or grade 2 oral thrush for >29 days (n = 1). Therefore, the MTD was 48 mg/m(2) (HP patients) and 60 mg/m(2) (MP patients). In the SPO-0002 study, 21 patients were treated in six dose cohorts (3-24 mg/m(2)). At 18 mg/m(2), two patients experienced DLTs: grade 3 neutropenia, one with pleural effusion (>14 days each). The MTD was 15 mg/m(2). Voreloxin exhibited low clearance (2 L/h/m(2)), a long terminal half-life (22 hours), and dose-proportional exposure. Overall, 31 of 62 patients had stable disease and 1 patient (ovarian cancer) had a partial response per Rustin criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Voreloxin showed an acceptable safety profile with clinical activity in patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumors. The MTD was schedule-dependent.

We previously identified N4BP1 as a substrate for monoubiquitylation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4. Here, we describe Nedd4-mediated polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of N4BP1. In addition, we show that N4BP1 can be conjugated with SUMO1 and that this abrogates N4BP1 ubiquitylation. Consistent with this, endogenous N4BP1 is stabilized in primary embryonic fibroblasts from mutants of the desumoylating enzyme SENP1, which show increased steady-state sumoylation levels. We have localized endogenous N4BP1 predominantly to the nucleolus in primary cells. However, a small fraction is found at promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs). In cells deficient for SENP1 or in wild-type cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, there is considerable accumulation of N4BP1 at PML NBs. These findings suggest a dynamic interaction between subnuclear compartments, and a role for post-translational modification by ubiquitin and SUMO in the regulation of nucleolar protein turnover.","['Laboratory of Protein Dynamics and Signaling, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NCI-Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.']",20100316,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oxidative stress-related parameters and the expressions of specific genes were monitored in 102 cases of AML during a pretreatment period from a primary status to a relapse status. In addition, age-matched healthy subjects were classified as controls. The activities of adenosine deaminase and xanthine oxidase were higher in the relapse condition, whereas those of glutathione peroxidase, monoamine oxidase, and superoxide dismutase, and the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) were lower in the primary condition and in controls. Of particular note, levels of advanced oxidation protein products, malondialdehyde, and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine were also significantly higher in relapse patients. Furthermore, real-time PCR with SYBR Green revealed that the expression levels of human thioredoxin (TRX) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase were increased in relapse patients. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the T-AOC was positively correlated with GSH but negatively correlated with 8-OHdG, TRX, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. Linear regression showed that a low T-AOC and up-regulated TRX expression were the independent factors correlated with relapse. A strong association between oxidative stress and the incidence of disease relapse was observed, which has potential prognosis implications.

Rearrangements of the NUP98 gene in human leukemia result in the expression of numerous fusion oncoproteins whose effect on nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is poorly understood. The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of leukemogenic NUP98 fusion proteins on CRM1-mediated nuclear export. NUP98-HOXA9, a prototypic NUP98 fusion, inhibited the nuclear export of two known CRM1 substrates: mutated cytoplasmic nucleophosmin and HIV-1 Rev. In vitro binding assays revealed that NUP98-HOXA9 binds CRM1 through the FG repeat motif in a Ran-GTP-dependent manner similar to but stronger than the interaction between CRM1 and its export substrates. Two NUP98 fusions, NUP98-HOXA9 and NUP98-DDX10, whose fusion partners are structurally and functionally unrelated, interacted with endogenous CRM1 in myeloid cells as shown by co-immunoprecipitation. These leukemogenic NUP98 fusion proteins interacted with CRM1, Ran, and the nucleoporin NUP214 in a manner fundamentally different from that of wild-type NUP98. NUP98-HOXA9 and NUP98-DDX10 formed characteristic aggregates within the nuclei of a myeloid cell line and primary human CD34+ cells and caused aberrant localization of CRM1 to these aggregates. These NUP98 fusions caused nuclear accumulation of two transcription factors, NFAT and NFkappaB, that are regulated by CRM1-mediated export. The nuclear entrapment of NFAT and NFkappaB correlated with enhanced transcription from promoters responsive to these transcription factors. Taken together, the results suggest a new mechanism by which NUP98 fusions dysregulate transcription and cause leukemia, namely, inhibition of CRM1-mediated nuclear export with aberrant nuclear retention of transcriptional regulators.","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.']",20100316,,,,"['K02 HL084179/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL082549/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009547/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In adult AML, MLL-PTD is only detected in patients with trisomy 11 or internal tandem duplications of FLT3 (FLT3-ITD). To date, studies in paediatric AML are scarce, and reported large differences in the frequency of MLL-PTD, frequently utilising mRNA RT-PCR only to detect MLL-PTDs. We studied the frequency of MLL-PTD in a large cohort of paediatric AML (n=276) and the results from two different methods, i.e. mRNA RT-PCR, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), a method designed to detect copy number differences of specific DNA sequences. In some patients with an MLL-rearrangement, MLL-PTD transcripts were detected, but were not confirmed by DNA-MLPA, indicating that DNA-MLPA can more accurately detect MLL-PTD compared to mRNA RT-PCR. In paediatric AML, MLL-PTD was detected in 7/276 patients (2.5%). One case had a trisomy 11, while the others had normal cytogenetics. Furthermore 4 of the 7 patients revealed a FLT3-ITD, which was significantly higher compared with the other AML cases (p=0.016). In conclusion, using DNA-MLPA as a novel screenings technique in combination with mRNA RT-PCR a low frequency of MLL-PTD in paediatric AML was found. Larger prospective studies are needed to further define the prognostic relevance of MLL-PTD in paediatric AML.","[""Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",20100316,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Around 5-10% of these patients show complex translocations involving other chromosomes in addition to and/or besides chromosomes 9 and 22. As nowadays most CML cases are treated with Imatinib, variant rearrangements have in general no specific prognostic significance, though events of therapy resistance remain to be studied. RESULTS: Here we report a Ph chromosome positive patient with hematological typical chronic phase CML. Untypically, an unbalanced complex rearrangement involving chromosomes 16 and 17 leading to a deletion of 16pter and partial trisomy of 17q21 to 17qter, was identified besides a trisomy 8 and an additional Ph chromosome in a part of malignant cells. CONCLUSION: Here a novel and cytogenetically unique case of a Ph chromosome positive CML clinically in chronic phase is reported, having complex secondary chromosomal aberrations.

However, the exact role of RhoA/ROCK signaling in the pathogenesis of diabetes-related ED has not been fully delineated. AIM: To determine whether the RhoA/ROCK pathway is involved in the regulation of corporal apoptosis and whether administration of insulin or fasudil, a specific ROCK inhibitor, could ameliorate ED in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At 16 weeks after diabetes induction, erectile function was assessed by cavernous nerve stimulation. Penile tissue was assessed for apoptosis with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate (dUTP) nick end labeling assay. Expression of myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1), protein kinase B (Akt), and phospho-endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were evaluated by Western blot. Immunohistochemical study was carried out for smooth muscle alpha-actin, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and Bcl-2-associated X Protein (Bax). Activity of caspase-3 and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) was also determined. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks old) were randomly divided into four groups: age-matched controls, diabetic controls, and diabetic rats treated with insulin (10 U/day, subcutaneous injection) or fasudil (30 mg/kg/day, oral) for the last 4 weeks of the 16 weeks after diabetes induction. RESULTS: Diabetic rats showed impairment of erectile function, increased MYPT1 phosphorylation, and corporal apoptosis. Expression of phospho-Akt, phospho-eNOS, and Bcl-2 were decreased, whereas activity of PTEN and caspase-3 and expression of Bax were increased. Treatment with fasudil normalized these molecular and histologic alterations, and restored erectile function. Insulin treatment showed similar effects to those of fasudil, however, the effects were smaller than fasudil. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that up-regulation of the penile RhoA/ROCK pathway in diabetic rats enhances corporal apoptosis via the PTEN/Akt pathway resulting in ED, which could be prevented by chronic treatment with fasudil.","['Department of Urology, College of Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.']",,,,,,,,,['(c) 2010 International Society for Sexual Medicine.'],,,,,,,,,

In this study, we explored its mechanisms and potential in AML. NB4, HL-60, and U937 cells and primary AML cells were used to examine its effects and the NOD/SCID animal model was used to evaluate its in vivo activity. Meisoindigo inhibited the growth of leukemic cells by inducing marked apoptosis and moderate cell-cycle arrest at the G(0)/G(1) phase. It down-regulated anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, and up-regulated pro-apoptotic Bak and Bax and cell-cycle related proteins, p21and p27. Furthermore, it induced myeloid differentiation, as demonstrated by morphologic changes, up-regulation of CD11b, and increased nitroblue tetrazolium reduction activity in all cell lines tested. In addition, meisoindigo down-regulated the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase and enhanced the cytotoxicity of conventional chemotherapeutic agents, cytarabine and idarubicin. As with the results from cell lines, meisoindigo also induced apoptosis, up-regulated p21 and p27, and down-regulated Bcl-2 in primary AML cells. The in vivo anti-leukemic activity of meisoindigo was also demonstrated by decreased spleen size in a dose-dependent manner. Taking these results together, meisoindigo is a potential agent for AML.","['Department of Pathology, Shin Kong Wu Ho Su Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As far as cellular kinetics is concerned HSCs are relatively quiescent in adults, have the ability to replicate symmetrically and asymmetrically and predictably exhibit multi-lineage hematopoietic reconstitution potential. HSC drive hematopoiesis and homeostasis by contracting and expanding the pool of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. In mouse they can be identified immunophenotypically as Sca1+ c-kit cells. In aplastic anemia a drastic decline in the marrow efficacy to produce mature blood cells leads to bone marrow failure. In contrast, in leukemia hyper stimulated marrow leads to deregulated differentiation of immature hematopoietic stem cells with increased self-proliferation potential. In our experimental set up, we induced aplastic anemia by injecting busulfan and cyclophosphamide and leukemia by N-N' ethylnitrosourea intraperitoneally in inbred swiss albino mice. Indeed, HSCs and haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) are vulnerable target for such disease oriented dysregulation which bears close correlation with the bone marrow microenvironmental damage. The present study aims at evaluating the possible mechanism(s) of deregulation in the bone marrow physiology with special reference to HSC surface receptor expression, cellular granularity, cell cycle status and overall marrow architecture. The investigations made so far revealed an interesting correlation between disease initiation and specific cytokinetic involvement of HSC in the BM microenvironment with particular reference to leukemia and aplastic anemia.","['Stem Cell Research and Application Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Medical Biotechnology, School of Tropical Medicine, C R Avenue, Kolkata-700073, India.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML patients with inv(16) (n = 18) and abn(11q23) (n = 31) also highly expressed HLA-DR and CD34. Eight cases of t(8;21) and 1 case of abn(11q23) did not express either antigen. The highest correlation between CD34 and HLA-DR expression values was observed in cases with t(8;21) (r = 0.72) with the lowest correlation in inv(16) (r = 0.035). The PPV and NPV of HLA-DR-negativity plus CD34-negativity to predict t(15;17) was 85% and 100%, respectively, with 100% sensitivity and 92.74% specificity. The PPV and NPV of other myeloid markers such as CD117, MPO and CD11c to diagnose t(15;17) were much lower than those of HLA-DR and CD34. It was concluded that the absence of double negativity of HLA-DR and CD34 strongly predicts against t(15;17). Rare HLA-DR-positive/CD34-negative cases exist in patients with t(15;17) and 8% of t(8;21) cases expressed neither antigen. Further studies should determine whether HLA-DR-positive t(15;17) and HLA-DR-negative/CD34-negative t(8;21) represent a special entity associated with significant prognostic relevance.","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, constitutional trisomy 21 represents an excellent model to study the origin and progression of leukemia. However, trisomy 21 can also occur as a somatic chromosome aberration leading to sporadic leukemia. During the 50 years, since the discovery of constitutional trisomy 21 in DS, we have also learned that this small chromosome 21, harboring about 300 genes, may be involved in numerous structural aberrations, e.g., translocations, deletions, and amplifications, in leukemias, lymphomas, and solid tumors. Moreover, genes located on chromosome 21 have been identified that play an important role in tumorigenesis. Somatic mutations of several of these genes have been shown to be associated with different solid tumors, but also constitutional mutations of a specific gene on chromosome 21 leading to myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia have been described. In this review, the specific forms of myeloid leukemia as well as of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children with DS will be presented and possible explanations for the paucity of solid tumors in DS will be given. Somatic numerical as well as structural chromosome 21 aberrations in association with leukemias will be described. Finally, the nature and function of specific genes, like RUNX1, TMPRSS2, and TFF, located in 21q, and their role in tumorigenesis will be exemplified.","['Institute of Human Genetics, Medical University of Vienna, Wahringer Strasse 10, Vienna, Austria. christa.fonatsch@meduniwien.ac.at']",,,,87,,,,,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,

The objective of the present study was to assess the expression profile of key apoptosis-related genes in terms of clinical and biological variables and of the survival of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PROCEDURE: The levels of mRNA expression of the apoptosis-related genes CASP3, CASP8, CASP9, FAS, and BCL2 were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR in consecutive samples from 139 consecutive children with ALL at diagnosis treated by the Brazilian protocol (GBTLI-ALL 99). Gene expression levels and clinical and biological features were compared by the Mann-Whitney test. Event-free survival (EFS) was calculated by Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank test. RESULTS: A significant correlation was detected between CASP3, CASP8, CASP9, and FAS expression levels (P < 0.01) in ALL samples. Higher levels of BCL2 were significantly associated with white blood cell (WBC) count <50,000/mm(3) at diagnosis (P = 0.01) and low risk group classification (P = 0.008). Lower expression levels of CASP3, CASP8 and FAS gene were associated with a poor response at day 7 according the GBTLI-ALL 99 protocol (P = 0.03, P = 0.02 and P = 0.008, respectively). There was a relationship between FAS gene expression lower than the 75th percentile and lower 5-year EFS (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest an association between lower expression levels of the pro-apoptotic genes and a poor response to induction therapy at day 7 and prognosis in childhood ALL.","['Department Pediatrics, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto-University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.']",,,,,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Jul 15;55(1):5-6.

Here, we show the effects of the naturally occurring sesquiterpene lactone asteriscunolide A (AS) on viability of human melanoma, leukemia and cells that overexpress antiapoptotic proteins, namely Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L). All cell lines were sensitive to this compound, with IC(50) values of approximately 5 microM. The cytotoxic effects of AS were accompanied by a G(2)-M phase arrest of the cell cycle and a concentration- and time-dependent appearance of apoptosis as determined by DNA fragmentation, translocation of phosphatidylserine to the cell surface and sub-G(1) ratio. Apoptosis was associated with caspase-3 activity and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and was prevented by the nonspecific caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, indicating that caspases are essential components in this pathway. The apoptotic effect of AS was also associated with (i) the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria which was accompanied by dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi(m)) and (ii) the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway. AS-induced cell death was potentiated by inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 signaling with U0126 and PD98059. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) seem to play a pivotal role in this process since high levels of ROS were produced early (1 h) and apoptosis was completely blocked by the free radical scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). The present study demonstrates that AS-induced cell death is mediated by an intrinsic-dependent apoptotic event involving mitochondria and MAPKs, and through a mechanism dependent on ROS generation.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Instituto Canario de Investigacion del Cancer (ICIC), University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Plaza Dr. Pasteur s/n, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,

With the recent findings that cancers containing elevated PKR activity are highly sensitive to PKR inhibition, we explore the role of PKR in hematologic malignancies, signal transduction pathways affected by PKR, and how PKR may contribute to leukemic transformation.","['Department of Human Anatomical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,

Two forms of the gp51 were synthesised: one comprised the gp51 N-terminal 174 amino acids and a single 6xHis tag (Delta(175-268)gp51-His) and the second form contained the same amino acid sequence and a C-terminal Strep-tag II in addition to the 6xHis tag (Delta(175-268)gp51-STH). The two proteins were expressed and purified by immobilized metal-affinity chromatography (IMAC) or by Strep-Tactin column. The Strep-Tactin technology was more efficient than IMAC method and achieved a high pure recombinant deleted gp51. In addition the Delta(175-268)gp51-STH protein was further concentrated by IMAC. This purified antigen could be used for the isolation of immunoreactive molecules and to develop a competitive ELISA test.,"[""Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Umbria e delle Marche, G.

Using a procedure that incrementally increased exposure of cells to PABA/NO, an acquired drug resistant human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cell line (HL60(PABA)) that exhibited 1.9-fold resistance to the drug (IC(50) 15 muM vs ~8 muM for wild-type) was created. HL60(PABA) cells had a decreased growth rate attributable to altered cellular differentiation, as measured by increased expression of CD11b; decreased expression of CD14; decreased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios and a condensation of nuclear chromatin. This was accompanied by alterations in both plasma and mitochondrial membrane potentials. Both GSTP expression and nitric oxide release were reduced two-fold, while increased expression levels of genes involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) were evident in HL60(PABA) cells. Wild type cells treated with PABA/NO had increased levels of protein S-glutathionylation and JNK activation, while JNK was constitutively active in HL60(PABA) cells and these cells had reduced levels of S-glutathionylation. By removing PABA/NO from the growth medium, HL60(PABA) cells reverted to sensitivity within 21 days suggesting that resistance was not genetically stable. Mechanistically, PABA/NO resistance is mediated through reduced levels of GSTP resulting in reduced NO release and its subsequent alterations in cellular response to nitrosative stress.","['Department of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.']",20100316,,,,"['CA08660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA085660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R41 CA117259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA117259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA085660-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS195814'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the marginal mean and variance of these models are assumed to be the same for different gene clusters and for different tissue types. Moreover, it is not easy to determine which of the many competing Bayesian hierarchical models provides the best fit for a specific microarray data set. To address these two issues, we propose a marginal mixture model that directly models the marginal distribution of transformed gene profiles. Specifically, we approximate the marginal distributions of transformed gene profiles via a mixture of three-component multivariate Normal distributions, each component of which has the same structures of marginal mean vector and covariance matrix as those for Bayesian hierarchical models, but the values can differ. Based on the proposed model, a method is derived to select genes differentially expressed across two types of tissue samples. The derived gene selection method performs well on a real microarray data set and consistently has the best performance (based on class agreement indices) compared with several other gene selection methods on simulated microarray data sets generated from three different mixture models.","[""Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.""]",20081009,,,,"['R01 HG003646/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', '1 R01HG003646-01A1/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) transduction of CD34+ cells is reasonably efficacious, we assessed the efficacy of GALV transduction of CD34+ derived DCs as a possible approach to creating genetically modified DCs for immunotherapy. METHODS: Peripheral blood CD34+ cells were transduced with retroviruses obtained from the PG13/LN C8 cell line, with the neomycin gene as a marker gene. After prestimulation of hematopoietic cells for 24 hours with 10 ng/mL interleukin (IL)-3, 10 ng/mL IL-6, 100 ng/mL stem cell factor, 100 ng/mL granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor and 8 Amicrog/mL protamine sulfate, the cells were cultured in a transforming media prior to differentiating into DCs by GM-CSF, TNF-a and IL-4. Immunophenotyping analyses for confirmation of the generated DCs, colony formation assay and PCR were done for the expression of neomycin gene in the transduced cells. RESULTS: Titration of viral vectors indicated a transduction efficiency of 1x10(5) CFU/mL. Transduction efficiency for the CD34+ cells transformed to DCs was 45% and 38% before and after DC differentiation, respectively. Additionally, a mean (SEM) of 26.9% (11.4%) and 41.4% (11.8%) of the genetically modified DCs were positive for CD86+ HLA-DR and CD1a+CD14, respectively CONCLUSION: This study showed that the majority of transduced CD34+ cells were successfully differentiated into cells identical to DCs according to morphology and immunophenotyping features, which could be a potential application in immunotherapy.","['Faculty of Paramedical Sciences, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

M-phase phosphoprotein 11 protein (MPP11) is extensively overexpressed in leukemic cells and therefore is considered an attractive target for leukemia T cell therapy. We sought to identify potential CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes that specifically recognised peptides derived from the MPP11 antigen. METHODS: A computer-based epitope prediction program SYFPEITHI, was used to predict peptides from the MPP11 protein that bind to the most common HLA- A*0201 molecule. Peptide binding capacity to the HLA-A*0201 molecule was measured using the T2 TAP-deficient, HLA-A*0201-positive cell line. Dendritic cells were pulsed with peptides and then used to generate CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). The CML leukemic cell line K562-A2.1 naturally expressing the MPP11 antigen and engineered to express the HLA-A*0201 molecule was used as the target cell. RESULTS: We have identified a potential HLA-A*0201 binding epitope (STLCQVEPV) named MPP-4 derived from the MPP11 protein which was used to generate a CTL line. Interestingly, this CTL line specifically recognized peptide-loaded target cells in both ELISPOT and cytotoxic assays. Importantly, this CTL line exerted a cytotoxic effect towards the CML leukemic cell line K562-A2.1. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to describe a novel epitope derived from the MPP11 antigen that has been recognized by human CD8+ CTL.","['Tumor Immunology Section, King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A diagnostic classification (DC) model developed for leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome classification was used to classify the specimens and identify prognostically relevant categories. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the prognostic value of the classification and the genes identifying prognostic categories were further analyzed through R software. RESULTS The samples could be divided into two major groups: 20 specimens were classified as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) -like and 20 samples as nonAML-like. Four patients could not be assigned to a unique class. The 10-year probability of survival after diagnosis of AML-like and nonAML-like patients was significantly different (7% v 74%; P = .0005). Similarly, the 10-year event-free survival after HSCT was 6% for AML-like and 63% for nonAML-like patients (P = .0010). CONCLUSION Gene expression-based classification identifies two groups of patients with JMML with distinct prognosis outperforming all known clinical parameters in terms of prognostic relevance. Gene expression-based classification could thus be prospectively used to guide clinical/therapeutic decisions.","['Laboratory of Oncohematology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Padova, Pavia, Italy.']",20100315,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS Pediatric patients with cancer presenting with FN induced by nonmyeloablative chemotherapy were observed in a prospective multicenter study. A score predicting the risk of future AEs (ie, serious medical complication, microbiologically defined infection, radiologically confirmed pneumonia) was developed from a multivariate mixed logistic regression model. Its cross-validated predictive performance was compared with that of published risk prediction rules. Results An AE was reported in 122 (29%) of 423 FN episodes. In 57 episodes (13%), the first AE was known only after reassessment after 8 to 24 hours of inpatient management. Predicting AE at reassessment was better than prediction at presentation with FN. A differential leukocyte count did not increase the predictive performance. The score predicting future AE in 358 episodes without known AE at reassessment used the following four variables: preceding chemotherapy more intensive than acute lymphoblastic leukemia maintenance (weight = 4), hemoglobin > or = 90 g/L (weight = 5), leukocyte count less than 0.3 G/L (weight = 3), and platelet count less than 50 G/L (weight = 3). A score (sum of weights) > or = 9 predicted future AEs. The cross-validated performance of this score exceeded the performance of published risk prediction rules. At an overall sensitivity of 92%, 35% of the episodes were classified as low risk, with a specificity of 45% and a negative predictive value of 93%. CONCLUSION This score, based on four routinely accessible characteristics, accurately identifies pediatric patients with cancer with FN at risk for AEs after reassessment.","['Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Bern, Inselspital, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland. roland.ammann@insel.ch']",20100315,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2011 Mar 1;29(7):e182-4; author reply e185.

Across the genome, cumulative distribution of ROH was not significantly different between cases and controls. Four common ROH at 10p11.2-10q11.21, 1p31.1, 19p13.2-3, and 20q11.1-23 were, however, associated with ALL risk at P less than .01 (including 1 ROH to which the erythropoietin receptor [EPOR] gene maps, P = .005) but were nonsignificant after adjusting for multiple testing.

The report is based on the databases of population-based cancer registries which joined forces in cooperative projects such as Automated Childhood Cancer Information System (ACCIS) and EUROCARE. According to these data, which refer to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer, leukemias, at 34%, brain tumors, at 23%, and lymphomas, at 12%, represent the largest diagnostic groups among the under 15-year-olds. The most frequent single diagnoses are: acute lymphoblastic leukemia, astrocytoma, neuroblastoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and nephroblastoma. There is considerable variation between countries. Incidence rates range from 130 (British Isles) to 160 cases (Scandinavian countries) per million children. Incidence rates have shown an increase over time since the mid of the last century. In Europe, the yearly increase averages 1.1% for the 1978-1997 period and ranges from 0.6% for the leukemias to 1.8% for soft-tissue sarcomas. The probability of survival has risen considerably over the past decades, with the EUROCARE data showing an improvement of the relative risk of death by 8% when comparing the 2000-2002 time span to the 1995-1999 period. Regarding the years 1995-2002, the data show an overall 5-year survival probability of 81% for Europe and similar values for the USA. The data presented here describe the cancer situation with a specific, European focus. They are drawn from population-based cancer registries that ensure excellent data quality, and as a consequence represent the most valid European population-based data existing at present. It is also apparent that not all countries have data available from nationwide childhood cancer registries, a situation which warrants further improvement.","['Institute for Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University of Mainz, Germany. peter.kaatsch@unimedizin-mainz.de <peter.kaatsch@unimedizin-mainz.de>']",20100315,,,31,,,,,['2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Results showed a dramatic decrease of PARP-1 mRNA expression and a simultaneously obvious increase in the level of PARP-1 methylation in benzene-treated cells compared to the control. Further, the PARP-1 mRNA expression was restored and the level of PARP-1 methylation was also reduced following epigenetic inhibitors, 5-aza and TSA, alone or in combination treatments.

This dynamic partitioning might be involved in fine-tuning cellular signaling fidelity through coupling to the plasma membrane protein and lipid composition. In earlier work, giant plasma membrane vesicles, obtained by chemically induced blebbing from cultured cells, were observed to reversibly phase segregate at temperatures significantly below 37 degrees C. In this contribution, we compare the temperature dependence of fluid phase segregation in HeLa and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells. We find an essentially monotonic temperature dependence of the number of phase-separated vesicles in both cell types. We also observe a strikingly broad distribution of phase transition temperatures in both cell types. The binding of peripheral proteins, such as cholera toxin subunit B (CTB), as well as Annexin V, is observed to modulate phase transition temperatures, indicating that peripheral protein binding may be a regulator for lateral heterogeneity in vivo. The partitioning of numerous signal protein anchors and full length proteins is investigated. We find Lo phase partitioning for several proteins assumed in the literature to be membrane raft associated, but observe deviations from this expectation for other proteins, including caveolin-1.","['Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.']",20100315,,,,"['R21 AI073409/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI073409-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21AI073409/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS189176'],,,['Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V.

BCL6 is necessary to maintain the expression of Pitx2 in the left lateral plate mesoderm during the patterning of left-right asymmetry in Xenopus embryos. For this process, BCL6 forms a complex with BCL6 corepressor (BCoR) on the promoters of selected Notch target genes such as enhancer of split related 1. BCL6 also inhibits the transcription of these genes by competing for the Notch1 intracellular domain, preventing the coactivator Mastermind-like1 (MAM1) from binding.

Automated preliminary indicators of neoplastic cells in blood would expedite selection of appropriate tests. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the capacity of the Sysmex XT-2000iV hematology analyzer to identify neoplastic cells in canine blood samples. METHODS: Blood samples (n=160) were grouped into 5 categories: acute leukemia (n=30), chronic leukemia (n=15), neoplasia without blood involvement (n=41), non-neoplastic reactive conditions (n=31), and healthy dogs (n=43). WBC counts, WBC flags, scattergrams, percentages of cells with high fluorescence intensity, and percentages of cells in the lysis-resistant region were evaluated alone or in combination to establish a ""leukemic flag."" Sensitivity, specificity, negative (LR-) and positive (LR+) likelihood ratios, and the number of false-negative (FN) and false-positive (FP) results were calculated, and receiver operating characteristic curves were designed for numerical values. RESULTS: Among single measurements and parameters, only the evaluation of scattergrams minimized FN and FP results (sensitivity 100%, specificity 94.8%, LR+ 19.17, and LR- 0.00), although their interpretation was subjective. The more objective approach based on the generation of a ""leukemic flag"" had a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 87.0%, LR- of 0.00, and LR+ of 7.67. CONCLUSION: Using a novel gating strategy the Sysmex XT-2000iV may be used effectively to screen canine blood for hematopoietic neoplasia.","['Department of Veterinary Pathology, Hygiene and Public Health, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.']",20100310,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventy-five (93%) patients achieved complete remission. Most fatal events occurred during the first 6 weeks of treatment. Long-term cardiotoxicity was observed in one patient. Two patients suffered from secondary haematological malignancies.

After allogeneic SCT from a seronegative donor, prolonged and severe immune deficiency often leads to infectious complications. Vaccination with antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DC) has been shown to be a potent approach for the induction of antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses in vivo. For protection from subsequent HCMV reactivation, a sustained immune response is necessary, including antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells. METHODS: We report the case of an 18-year-old girl with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia that received an allogeneic SCT in CR2. After an HCMV infection, the graft was rejected and she received a second transplant from an HLA-mismatched, HCMV-seronegative family donor. She was treated with pp65-pulsed monocyte-derived DC at day 200 post-SCT, using a recombinant pp65 protein. Until day 200 post-SCT, HCMV reactivated six times with emerging viral resistance to antiviral chemotherapy. RESULTS: After vaccination with protein-pulsed DC, an induction and expansion of HCMV-specific T(helper) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes was observed, associated with a sustained clearance of the HCMV viremia. Antiviral treatment could be tapered without recurrence of viremia within the first year post-SCT. CONCLUSIONS: pp65-pulsed DC could induce antigen-specific T-cell responses even after a SCT from an HCMV-seronegative donor. After vaccination with pp65-pulsed DC, a sustained antigen-specific T-cell response prevented concurrent HCMV viremia. Emergence of antigen-specific T(helper) cells may be essential for a sustained, functional T-cell response post-SCT.","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Eberhard-Karls University, Tubingen, Germany. tobias.feuchtinger@med.uni-tuebingen.de""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested the toxicity of NK-92 and chemotherapy drugs against the stem cell capacity of the acute leukemia cell line, KG1. While the chromium-release assay is the most common method for assessing cytotoxicity of immune effectors, and flow cytometry is increasingly used, the relationship of either assay to clonogenic readouts remains unknown. METHODS: KG1 was assessed for stem cell frequency by serial dilution, single-cell sorting and colony growth in methylcellulose. KG1 was sorted into CD34(+) CD38(+) and CD34(+) CD38(-) populations and recultured in liquid medium or methylcellulose to determine the proliferative capacity of each fraction. Cytotoxicity of NK-92, daunorubicin and cytarabine against KG1 was measured using the chromium-release assay, flow cytometry and clonogenic assays. RESULTS: The culture-initiating cell frequency of whole KG1 was between 1 in 100 to 1000 by serial dilution and single-cell sorting. Although a rare (1-3%) CD34(+) CD38(-) population could be demonstrated in KG1, both fractions had equivalent proliferative capacity. The cumulative flow cytotoxicity assay was more sensitive than the chromium-release assay in detecting target cell killing. At a 10:1 ratio NK-92 eliminated the clonogenic capacity of KG1, which was not predicted by the chromium-release assay. CONCLUSIONS: Clonogenic assays provide a more sensitive means of assessing the effect of a cytotoxic agent against putative cancer stem cells within cell lines, provided that they grow well in liquid culture medium or methylcellulose.","['Cell Therapy Program, Princess Margaret Hospital, University of Toronto, Canada. brentw@uhnres.utoronto.ca']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, epigenetic insults are frequently observed in cancer. Several chromatin modifying enzymes have been implicated in leukemia, and are attractive candidates for the development of therapeutic agents. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: The histone methyltransferase DOT1L is responsible for methylation of histone H3 at lysine 79 and is involved in the pathobiology of several leukemias, the majority of which are characterized by chromosomal translocations involving the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene. Leukemic translocations yield fusion proteins involving MLL and other proteins that physically interact with DOT1L. These oncogenic fusion proteins recruit DOT1L to ectopic loci (including HOX gene clusters), whose mis-expression contributes to the transformed phenotype. Studies from stem cells and certain leukemias suggest a second mechanism of leukemogenesis, in which reduced or mistargeted DOT1L activity yields altered centromeric chromatin and consequent chromosomal instability. Targeting DOT1L enzymatic activity as well as interactions with leukemogenic fusion proteins is discussed as possible leads in therapeutic interventions. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: In this review, we discuss the normal functions of DOT1L, its mechanistic roles in leukemogenesis, and possible strategies for targeting DOT1L in leukemia. DOT1L is an atypical histone lysine methyltransferase in that it does not contain an enzymatic domain common to all other lysine methyltranferases. This attribute makes DOT1L a unique and specifically targetable enzyme. An emerging role for DOT1L under normal cellular conditions as well as transformed conditions is emerging and shedding light on the biology and mechanisms of some translocation-induced leukemias. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: DOT1L is critical in development, as shown in studies in mouse embryos and embryonic stem cells. DOT1L enzymatic activity is also required for the leukemic transformation capabilities of a number of oncogenic fusion proteins. In addition, interactions between DOT1L and oncogenic fusion proteins are necessary for the transformation process. Therefore, it may be possible to specifically target DOT1L enzymatic activity or DOT1L interactions with leukemogenic fusion proteins.","['University of Connecticut, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Unit 3092, 69 North Eagleville Road, Storrs, CT 06269, USA. theodore.rasmussen@uconn.edu']",,,,107,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BD is metabolically activated to epoxide intermediates that can react with nucleophilic sites of cellular biomolecules. Among these, 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB) is considered the ultimate carcinogenic species of BD due to its potent genotoxicity and mutagenicity attributed to the ability to form DNA-DNA cross-links and exocyclic nucleoside adducts. DEB mutagenesis studies suggest that adducts formed at adenine bases may be critically important, as DEB induces large numbers of A --> T transversion mutations. We have recently identified two regioisomeric exocyclic DEB-dA adducts, 1,N(6)-(2-hydroxy-3-hydroxymethylpropan-1,3-diyl)-2'-deoxyadenosine (1,N(6)-gamma-HMHP-dA) and 1,N(6)-(1-hydroxymethyl-2-hydroxypropan-1,3-diyl)-2'-deoxyadenosine (1,N(6)-alpha-HMHP-dA) ( Seneviratne et al.

In the present work, we describe a column switching HPLC-ESI(+)-MS/MS methodology for the quantitative analysis of 1,N(6)-HMHP-dA isomers in the DNA of laboratory mice exposed to BD by inhalation. On the basis of their exocyclic structure, which prevents normal Watson-Crick base pairing, these adducts could be responsible for mutations at the A:T base pairs observed following exposure to DEB.","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry and the Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",,,,,"['P30 ES010126/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100670/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100670-05A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100670/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100670-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES012689-05S2/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES012689/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100670-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES 12689/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES005948/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS187927'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were divided into two groups with regard to active HBV prophylaxis before diagnosis. Group I included 22 patients who were vaccinated before diagnosis. Group II included 44 patients who were not vaccinated before diagnosis. After diagnosis active, passive and/or active-passive prophylaxis were administered to the patients. RESULTS: In most patients, the anti-HBV titers were protective after ALL treatment completion. In the remaining children, with anti-HBV titers < 100 IU/ml, the HBV prophylaxis was also successful, because none of them experienced de novo HBV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Despite various models of HBV prophylaxis, the protection from new infection was effective in all children treated for ALL.","['Katedra i Klinika Pediatrii, Hematologii i Onkologii Dzieciecej SUM, Samodzielny Publiczny Szpital Kliniczny Nr 1 w Zabrzu.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its use as a cancer chemopreventive agent is rather limited, due to the fact that its principal component, glycyrrhizin, is known to induce hypertension. This study determined the effects of a hexane/ethanol extract of G. uralensis (HEGU), which contains undetectable amounts of glycyrrhizin, on the apoptosis of androgen-insensitive DU145 cells. HEGU induced apoptosis and increased the levels of cleaved caspase-9, caspase-7, caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). HEGU also induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization and cytochrome c release to the cytosol. HEGU increased the levels of Fas, death receptor 4 (DR4), cleaved caspase-8, Mcl-1S, and truncated Bid proteins. A caspase-8 inhibitor suppressed HEGU-induced apoptosis. An active fraction of HEGU was separated via column chromatography and the structure of the active compound isoangustone A was identified via 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were 128 leukemic children and their families recruited at the Haematology-Oncology Clinic of the Department of Pediatrics, University of Padova. The families were interviewed by a clinical psychologist during the first hospitalization of their children using the Ecocultural Family Interview-Cancer (EFI-C). This interview aimed at understanding the family daily routines as it relates to the child with cancer and the meaning and experience of the situation. Demographic data about children and their families also were collected. RESULTS: The EFI-C interviews were read for content and then coded; these items were grouped into 11 major dimensions, three dealing with the child in the hospital and eight concerning the family. An empirical model of path analysis was estimated to evaluate perceived child's HRQL at the second week from the diagnosis inside the psychosocial context. This model shows that perceived child's HRQL is predicted by parental trust in the medical staff, perceived child coping, and perceived child adaptability. These last two predictors are in turn moderated by the fixed factor child age and mediated by parenting. CONCLUSION: A better knowledge of parents' views and expectations regarding their children's HRQL during the first treatments for pediatric leukemia may facilitate the communication processes in the hospital and may help to provide improved psychosocial care for the child during the first treatments for leukemia.","['Department of Developmental and Social Psychology, University of Padova, Via Venezia 8, 35131 Padova, Italy. marta.tremolada@unipd.it']",20100313,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, blast-transformed leukemic cells display enhanced resistance to imatinib in the absence of BCR-ABL-resistance mutations. In this study, we show that when BCR-ABL-transformed cell lines were selected for imatinib resistance in vitro, the cells that grew out displayed a higher BCR-ABL expression comparable to the increase seen in accelerated forms of the disease. This enhanced expression of BCR-ABL was associated with an increased rate of glycolysis but with a decreased rate of proliferation. The higher level of BCR-ABL expression in the selected cells correlated with a nonhypoxic induction of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) that was required for cells to tolerate enhanced BCR-ABL signaling. HIF-1alpha induction resulted in an enhanced rate of glycolysis but with reduced glucose flux through both the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the oxidative arm of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The reduction in oxidative PPP-mediated ribose synthesis was compensated by the HIF-1alpha-dependent activation of the nonoxidative PPP enzyme, transketolase, in imatinib-resistant CML cells. In both primary cultures of cells from patients exhibiting blast transformation and in vivo xenograft tumors, use of oxythiamine, which can inhibit both the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and transketolase, resulted in enhanced imatinib sensitivity of tumor cells. Together, these results suggest that oxythiamine can enhance imatinib efficacy in patients who present an accelerated form of the disease.","['Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",20100315,,,,"['P01 CA104838-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 CA129151/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105463-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA104838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105463/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092660-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS177311'],,,,,,,,,,,,

To address this limitation, we developed the tumor cell-specific in vitro bioluminescence imaging (CS-BLI) assay. Tumor cells (for example, myeloma, leukemia and solid tumors) stably expressing luciferase are cultured with nonmalignant accessory cells (for example, stromal cells) for selective quantification of tumor cell viability, in presence versus absence of stromal cells or drug treatment. CS-BLI is high-throughput scalable and identifies stroma-induced chemoresistance in diverse malignancies, including imatinib resistance in leukemic cells. A stroma-induced signature in tumor cells correlates with adverse clinical prognosis and includes signatures for activated Akt, Ras, NF-kappaB, HIF-1alpha, myc, hTERT and IRF4; for biological aggressiveness; and for self-renewal. Unlike conventional screening, CS-BLI can also identify agents with increased activity against tumor cells interacting with stroma. One such compound, reversine, shows more potent activity in an orthotopic model of diffuse myeloma bone lesions than in conventional subcutaneous xenografts. Use of CS-BLI, therefore, enables refined screening of candidate anticancer agents to enrich preclinical pipelines with potential therapeutics that overcome stroma-mediated drug resistance and can act in a synthetic lethal manner in the context of tumor-stroma interactions.","[""[1] Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

The number of transduced cells infused into patients initially predicted the subsequent diversity of circulating cells. A capture-recapture analysis was used to estimate the size of the gene-corrected cell pool, revealing that less than 1/100th of the infused cells had long-term repopulating activity. Integration sites were clustered even at early time points, often near genes involved in growth control, and several patients harbored expanded cell clones with vectors integrated near the cancer-implicated genes CCND2 and HMGA2, but remain healthy. Integration site tracking also documented that chemotherapy for adverse events resulted in successful control. The longitudinal analysis emphasizes that key features of transduced cell populations--including diversity, integration site clustering, and expansion of some clones--were established early after transplantation.

To investigate its clinical relevance, CD11b protein expression in leukemic blasts has been prospectively measured at diagnosis (159 patients) and during therapy (53 patients). The initially heterogeneous expression of CD11b inversely correlated with cytoreduction rates measured at clinically significant time points of induction therapy in the ALL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster 2000 protocol. CD11b positivity conferred a 5-fold increased risk of minimal residual disease (MRD) after induction therapy (day 33) and of high-risk group assignment after consolidation therapy (day 78). In the multivariate analysis CD11b expression was an independent prognostic factor compared with other clinically relevant parameters at diagnosis. During therapy, CD11b expression increased early in most ALL cases and remained consistently increased during induction/consolidation therapy. In more than 30% of MRD-positive cases, the CD11b expression on blast cells exceeded that of mature memory B cells and improved the discrimination of residual leukemic cells from regenerating bone marrow. Taken together, CD11b expression has considerable implications for prognosis, treatment response monitoring, and MRD detection in childhood PBC-ALL.","['Experimental and Clinical Research Center, Charite Medical School, 13125 Berlin, Germany.']",20100312,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutational status of the immunoglobulin variable heavy chain region (IGHV) gene stratifies CLL patients into two prognostic groups. We performed microarray analysis of CLL cells using the Agilent platform to detect the most important gene expression differences regarding IGHV status in CLL cells. We analyzed a cohort of 118 CLL patients with different IGHV mutational status and completely characterized all described prognostic markers using expression microarrays and quantitative real-time RT-PCR (reverse transcription PCR). We detected lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3) as a novel prognostic marker: LAG3 high expression in CLL cells correlates with unmutated IGHV (P < 0.0001) and reduced treatment-free survival (P = 0.0087). Furthermore, quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis identified a gene-set (LAG3, LPL, ZAP70) whose overexpression is assigned to unmutated IGHV with 90% specificity (P < 0.0001). Moreover, high expression of tested gene-set and unmutated IGHV equally correlated with reduced treatment-free survival (P = 7.7 * 10(-11) vs. P = 1.8 * 10(-11)). Our results suggest that IGHV status can be precisely assessed using the expression analysis of LAG3, LPL, and ZAP70 genes. Expression data of tested markers provides a similar statistical concordance with treatment-free survival as that of the IGHV status itself. Our findings contribute to the elucidation of CLL pathogenesis and provide novel prognostic markers for possible application in routine diagnostics.","['Center of Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy, Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Czech Republic.']",20100312,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular mechanisms underlying SSc vasculopathy are largely unknown. Friend leukemia integration factor 1 (Fli1), an important regulator of immune function and collagen fibrillogenesis, is expressed at reduced levels in endothelial cells in affected skin of patients with SSc. To develop a disease model and to investigate the function of Fli1 in the vasculature, we generated mice with a conditional deletion of Fli1 in endothelial cells (Fli1 CKO). Fli1 CKO mice showed a disorganized dermal vascular network with greatly compromised vessel integrity and markedly increased vessel permeability. We show that Fli1 regulates expression of genes involved in maintaining vascular homeostasis including VE-cadherin, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, type IV collagen, matrix metalloproteinase 9, platelet-derived growth factor B, and S1P(1) receptor. Accordingly, Fli1 CKO mice are characterized by down-regulation of VE-cadherin and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, impaired development of basement membrane, and a decreased presence of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells in dermal microvessels. This phenotype is consistent with a role of Fli1 as a regulator of vessel maturation and stabilization. Importantly, vascular characteristics of Fli1 CKO mice are recapitulated by SSc microvasculature. Thus, persistently reduced levels of Fli1 in endothelial cells may play a critical role in the development of SSc vasculopathy.","['Arthritis Center, Boston University Medical Center, Boston, MA 02118, USA.']",20100312,,,,"['P01 CA078582/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR042334/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR042334/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA78582/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a case of cutaneous-mucosal and systemic pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) revealing myelodysplasic syndrome. CASE REPORT: A 56-year-old man was hospitalised for an inflammatory abdominal plaque with an ulcerated centre that appeared rapidly in a setting of fever of 40 degrees C, odynophagia, weight loss and arthritis of the ankle. Despite surgical abdominal repair and combined dual antibiotics, the patient remained febrile and the ulcer size continued to increase. The edges were raised, purple and necrotic. Examination revealed vegetative legions with a purple edge on the lower lip and tongue. Histological examination of the skin and mucosal biopsy samples was consistent with a diagnosis of PG. A chest-abdomen CT scan showed mesenteric panniculitis and interstitial lung disease. The bone marrow sample revealed an appearance of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia with myelofibrosis and excessively high blast levels. Systemic corticosteroids rapidly resulted in apyrexia with healing of the cutaneous, mucosal and visceral lesions. The patient presented secondary worsening of his acute myeloid leukaemia type-IV requiring bone marrow rescue. DISCUSSION: Extracutaneous involvement in neutrophilic dermatoses is rare but takes a number of different forms. We report a case of a patient presenting multifocal PG with cutaneous, mucosal, joint, mesenteric and pulmonary involvement. Oral lesions seen in PG generally affect the palate and they are commonly associated with inflammatory intestinal diseases. Our case is original in terms of the inaugural character of the mucosal lesions, their burgeoning appearance and their location on the lips and tongue.","['Clinique dermatologique, Hotel-Dieu, CHU de Nantes, 44000 Nantes, France.']",20100218,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We describe six patients with the disorder in association with CLL and other blood dyscrasias. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients with EDH seen between 2004 and 2009 in our department and re-examined histological slides. RESULTS: Mean age at dermatosis onset was 75.6 years and the sex ratio was 1. There were three CLL, two mantle-cell lymphomas and one MALT-type lymphoma. The dermatitis was quite polymorphic, with erythematous papules, wheals and plaques. The initial skin lesions appeared at the same time as or after the diagnosis of haematological neoplasm. Their reappearance heralded relapse of the blood disease in three cases. Histologically, all lesions had a dense dermal infiltrate of small, mostly CD4+ T-cells, with numerous eosinophils. In three patients, there was marked folliculotropism, resembling folliculotropic T-cell lymphoma. In most cases, EDH disappeared after appropriate chemotherapy for the blood disorder. DISCUSSION: Our cases show that the clinical expression of EDH is quite polymorphic. Its appearance may precede relapse of or may indicate prompt search screening for blood dyscrasia. The most efficient treatment of this dermatosis appears to be specific chemotherapy for the blood dyscrasia. There is reason to believe that a population of T-helper 2 (Th2) lymphocytes, reactive to malignant B-cells, induces tissue eosinophilia, mainly through production of interleukin (IL)-5, among other cytokines. Eosinophils appear to be the main effector cells.","['Service de dermatologie, hopital Sud, CHU Amiens, 80054 Amiens cedex 1, France.']",20100225,,,,,,['Ann Dermatol Venereol. 2010 Mar;137(3):179-80.

There are a large number of factors that are responsible for the biologic resistance of hematopoietic tumors following allogeneic HSCT. We have focused on 5 major areas including clonal evolution of cancer drug resistance, cancer radiation resistance, genomic basis of leukemia resistance, cancer epigenetics, and resistant leukemia stem cells.

Following the finding that kinase suppressors of ras (KSR) 1 and 2 are directly regulated by 1,25D and participate in the monocytic differentiation process, we investigated if the COT1 oncogene (Tpl2 in the rat), known to interact with human KSR2 (hKSR2), is also involved in 1,25D-induced differentiation in leukemia cells. Here we report that the exposure of HL60 and U937 myeloid leukemia cells to 1,25D increases COT1 expression in a concentration-dependent manner.

By our count, 65 cases are currently reported in the literature. This neoplasm affects patients of all ages, with a slight male predominance. Patients often present with peripheral blood eosinophilia without basophilia. Bone marrow examination commonly is hypercellular, with or without eosinophilia, which usually leads to the initial diagnosis of a myeloproliferative neoplasm. Many patients also present with or develop lymphadenopathy. Lymph node biopsy in these patients has commonly shown lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, most often reported as being of T-cell lineage, but bilineal myeloid/T-cell lymphomas and less often a myeloid sarcoma are also reported. The natural history of this neoplasm is to evolve into acute leukemia, usually of myeloid or mixed lineage, and less frequently of T- or B-lymphoid lineage. The prognosis is poor despite aggressive chemotherapy, with a few patients achieving long clinical remission after stem cell transplantation. At the molecular level, all cases carry a chromosomal abnormality involving the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene at chromosome 8p11, where 10 translocations and 1 insertion have been identified. These abnormalities disrupt the FGFR1 and various partner genes, and result in the creation of novel fusion genes and chimeric proteins. The latter include the N-terminal portion of the partner genes and the C-terminal portion of FGFR1. The most common partner is ZNF198 on chromosome 13q12. In the current World Health Organization classification, the 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome is designated as ""myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with FGFR1 abnormalities.""","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",,,,81,,,,,['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.'],,,,,,,,,

In neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, endothelin-1 (ET-1), a GPCR agonist, but not leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), an IL-6-related cytokine, induced RhoA activation and promotes alpha-SKA gene expression via RhoA. In contrast, LIF, but not ET-1, induced activation of SHP2 in cardiomyocytes, suggesting that SHP2 might negatively regulate alpha-SKA gene expression downstream of gp130. Therefore, we examined the effect of adenovirus-mediated overexpression of wild-type SHP2 (SHP2(WT)), dominant-negative SHP2 (SHP2(C/S)), or beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), on alpha-SKA gene expression. LIF did not upregulate alpha-SKA mRNA in cardiomyocytes overexpressing either beta-gal or SHP2(WT). In cardiomyocytes overexpressing SHP2(C/S), LIF induced upregulation of alpha-SKA mRNA, which was abrogated by concomitant overexpression of either C3-toxin or dominant-negative RhoA. RhoA was activated after LIF stimulation in the cardiomyocytes overexpressing SHP2(C/S), but not in myocytes overexpressing beta-gal. Furthermore, SHP2 mediates LIF-induced longitudinal elongation of cardiomyocytes via ERK5 activation. Collectively, these findings indicate that SHP2 negatively regulates alpha-SKA expression via RhoA inactivation and suggest that SHP2 implicates ERK5 in cardiomyocyte elongation downstream of gp130.","['Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Yamadaoka, Osaka, Japan. ynakaoka@imed3.med.osaka-u.ac.jp']",20100311,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ZAP directly binds to the viral mRNA through the zinc-finger motifs and recruits the RNA exosome to degrade the target RNA. RNA helicase p72 is required for the optimal function of ZAP. In an attempt to understand the structure-function relationship of ZAP, we performed alanine scanning analysis. RESULTS: A series of ZAP mutants was generated, in which three consecutive amino acids were replaced with three alanines. The mutants were analyzed for their antiviral activities against pseudotyped MLV vector. Out of the nineteen mutants analyzed, seven displayed significantly lower antiviral activities. Two mutations were in the very N-terminal domain, and five mutations were within or around the first and second zinc-finger motifs. These mutants were further analyzed for their abilities to bind to the target RNA, the exosome, and the RNA helicase p72. Mutants Nm3 and Nm63 lost the ability to bind to RNA. Mutants Nm 63 and Nm93 displayed compromised interaction with p72, while the binding of Nm133 to p72 was very modest. The interactions of all the mutants with the exosome were comparable to wild type ZAP. CONCLUSIONS: The integrity of the very N-terminal domain and the first and second zinc-finger motifs appear to be required for ZAP's antiviral activity. Analyses of the mutants for their abilities to interact with the target RNA and RNA helicase p72 confirmed our previous results. The mutants that bind normally to the target RNA, the exosome, and the RNA helicase p72 may be useful tools for further understanding the mechanism underlying ZAP's antiviral activity.","['Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.']",20100313,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the effects of GP7 on P-glycoprotein (P-gp) overexpression multidrug-resistant human leukemia K562/ADM cells with the comparison of VP-16 and K562 cells. GP7 inhibited the proliferation of K562/ADM cells in a concentration- or time-dependent manner, and the inhibitory effect of GP7 on K562/ADM cells was 1.50-fold higher than that of VP-16. GP7 caused G2/M phase accumulation but VP-16 caused S phase accumulation in K562/ADM and K562 cells. GP7 could induce apoptosis of both K562/ADM and K562 cell lines, but there was no significant difference between GP7- and VP-16-induced apoptotic ratios. GP7 could also induce typical apoptotic morphological changes and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation of K562/ADM and K562 cells, but DNA fragmentation induced by GP7 in K562/ADM cells was weaker than that in K562 cells. When treated with GP7 or VP-16 for 48 h, 128-256 microM GP7 induced more DNA fragmentation than VP-16 did, but 32-64 microM GP7 induced less DNA fragmentation than VP-16 did.

A previous study of intravenous (iv) bolus alemtuzumab plus rituximab in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) recurrence produced a response rate of 54% after a 4-week treatment period. METHODS: To optimize dose, schedule, and route of alemtuzumab, a study was designed exploring continuous intravenous infusion (civ) followed by subcutaneous (sc) alemtuzumab together with weekly iv rituximab in patients with previously treated CLL. RESULTS: Data from 40 patients with a median age of 59 years, and a median of 3 prior regimens (range, 1-8 regimens) were evaluable. Approximately 64% of patients were fludarabine-refractory. Seven patients (18%) achieved a complete response (CR), 4 (10%) a nodular partial response (nPR), and 10 (25%) a partial response for an overall response rate of 53%. Of 11 major responses (CR, nPR), 8 occurred after cycle 1. Response rates were highest in blood (94%), followed by liver/spleen (82%), bone marrow (68%), and lymph nodes (51%). The combination did not generate unexpected toxicities. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivations occurred in 6 patients (15%) and responded well to anti-CMV therapy. High titers of anti-idiotype antibodies after sc alemtuzumab were demonstrated in 1 patient, but remained without clinical sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of civ/sc alemtuzumab plus rituximab has activity in some patients with recurrent/refractory CLL and maximum response is achieved after 1 cycle (4 weeks) in 73% of patients. Further exploration in other settings of CLL together with accompanying pharmacokinetic studies is recommended.","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M. D.

While designed to inhibit Abl and Src kinases, dasatinib shows multitarget effects, including inhibition of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor c-fms. We have shown previously that dasatinib abrogates osteoclast formation and activity in vitro owing, in part, to its specificity for c-fms. In this study we examined whether dasatinib could significantly alter bone volume in a model of physiologic bone turnover. Sprague-Dawley rats were administered dasatinib (5 mg/kg/day) or vehicle by gavage or zoledronic acid (ZOL; 100 microg/kg/6 weeks) subcutaneously. Following 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment, serum biochemical, bone morphometric, and histologic analyses were performed. Whole-body bone mineral density and tibial cortical thickness where unchanged in the dasatinib- or ZOL-treated animals relative to controls. However, micro-computed tomographic (microCT) analysis of cancellous bone at the proximal tibias showed that trabecular volume (BV/TV) and thickness (Tb.Th) were increased in dasatinib-treated animals at levels comparable with those of the ZOL-treated group. These changes were associated with a decrease in osteoclast numbers (N.Oc/B.Pm) and surface (Oc.S/BS) and decreased serum levels of the osteoclast marker c-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX-1).

The possibility of engineering VLPs to incorporate heterologous polypeptides/proteins renders VLPs attractive candidates for vaccine strategies, as well as for protein delivery for basic science. Among the wide number of VLP types, our expertise focused on both retro- and lentivirus based VLPs as protein delivery tools. In particular, here we describe a system relying on the finding that some HIV-1 Nef mutants are incorporated at high levels into both Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and Moloney Leukemia Virus (MLV)-based VLPs. Most importantly, these Nef mutants can efficiently act as anchoring proteins upon fusion with heterologous proteins up to 630 amino acids in length. This chapter describes the preparation of prototypic HIV-1 based VLPs incorporating Nef mutant-GFP fusion molecules. Besides having potential utility in the field of basic virology, these VLPs represent a useful reference model for recovering alternative retro- or lentiviral based VLPs for the cell delivery of polypeptides/proteins of interest.","['Division of Pathogenesis of Retroviruses, National AIDS Center, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, a causal relationship among redox state, granulocytic differentiation induced by all-trans retinoic acid (RA) or dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP) and apoptosis have been studied in the human acute promyelocytic leukaemia HL-60 cells. The modulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species levels by D: , L: -buthionine-(S, R) sulfoximide (BSO), and N: -acetyl-L: -cysteine (NAC) caused inducer- and time-dependent or stage-specific effects on HL-60 cell growth inhibition, differentiation and subsequent apoptosis. The presence of BSO during the commitment stage suppressed RA-but not dbcAMP-mediated differentiation, while NAC inhibited both. BSO alone and in combination with RA or dbcAMP-induced apoptosis, which was prevented by NAC in dbcAMP-but not in RA-treated cells. Using protein kinase C inhibitor, calphostin C, cross-talk effects between the intracellular redox state and PKC signalling was identified by demonstrating inducer-dependent changes in cell differentiation or apoptosis, which were associated with the changes in DNA-NF-kappaB binding activity. These observations suggest a critical role of redox state in determining HL-60 cell behaviour and provide new insights into the complex effects of redox perturbations on the intracellular signalling network via the involvement of PKC and NF-kappaB.","['Department of Developmental Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Mokslininku st. 12, 08662, Vilnius, Lithuania.']",20100312,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients who were admitted to Samsung Medical Center between 1996 and 2008 with a chief complaint of hemoptysis. Patients with trauma or underlying bleeding tendency such as leukemia were excluded. Patients were divided into three groups according to age (0 to 5 yr, 6 to 10 yr, and 11 to 18 yr). The amount of hemoptysis was classified as mild (</=20 mL/day), moderate (20-100 mL/day), or massive (>100 mL/day). Causes and duration of hemoptysis, disease course, and mortality were also investigated. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients (18 males and 22 females) were identified. Their median age was 6.3 yr (range, 10 months to 18 yr). Twenty-five patients manifested mild hemoptysis; moderate and massive hemoptysis were found in nine and six patients, respectively. Respiratory tract infection was the most common cause of hemoptysis. Other causes included congenital heart disease, Heiner syndrome, neoplasm in the airway, vasculitis syndrome, and bronchiectasis. In most patients (87.5%), hemoptysis disappeared during medical treatment that included antibiotics or transfusion. Hemoptysis recurred in 12 patients, and the overall mortality rate was 5%. CONCLUSIONS: The most common cause of hemoptysis in children was respiratory tract infection. Most cases had a benign course, but recurrence and mortality occurred in a minority of patients. An accurate diagnosis of the underlying etiology is essential for treatment.","['Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",20090925,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also analyzed the effects of a 20-week detraining period on these hormones. Seven children (3 girls and 4 boys) aged 4-7 years in the maintenance phase of treatment against ALL performed 3 training sessions per week for 16 weeks of resistance (1 set of 8-15 repetitions of 11 exercises) and aerobic training (30 minutes at >or=50% heart rate max) followed by 20 weeks of detraining where no structured exercise program was performed. Levels of IFG-1 and IFG-2 did not significantly change after the intervention period or after the detraining phase. Likewise, levels of GH, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 remained stable pre and posttraining and after the detraining period. IGFBP-1 levels significantly decreased after training (-43.8%, p = 0.014), whereas there were no significant differences between pretraining vs. detraining (-17.8%, p = 0.108) nor between posttraining vs. detraining (17.7%, p = 0.251). Exercise training did not have major effects on the IGFs, IGFBPs, and GH in children with ALL. Although the importance of these findings to long-term cancer prognosis and/or recurrence remains to be determined, the present data (particularly those on IGF-1 and IGFBP-3) support the idea that exercise training can be safely undergone during treatment against ALL with no major adverse effect.","['Department of Biosciences and Nutrition at NOVUM, Unit for Preventive Nutrition, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, it is expected to be a valuable prognostic marker in acute leukemia. Sixty Egyptian children with acute leukemia were enrolled into this prospective study divided into 2 groups: 30 acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and 30 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Flow cytometric assessment of AC133 expression was performed on CD34 blast cells. AC133 was expressed in 66.7% and 40% of AML and ALL patients, respectively. AC133-positive expression was not associated with any of the studied standard prognostic factors. In AML, 80% of patients with poor clinical outcome (relapse or death) were positive for AC133 expression, whereas, all ALL patients who developed resistance as well as those who displayed poor clinical outcome had AC133-positive expression (P<0.05). Patients with positive AC133 expression had significantly shorter overall and disease-free survival times compared with AC133-negative patients in both ALL (P<0.001) and AML (P<0.05) groups. AC133 expression percentage was a reliable poor prognostic marker in ALL patients (P<0.0001). AC133-positive expression is an independent poor prognostic factor in childhood acute leukemia and could characterize a group of patients with resistance to standard chemotherapy, as well as high incidence of relapse and death.","['Departments of *Clinical Pathology daggerPediatric, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The experiments were preformed in cultures of blood and bone marrow obtained from CLL patients. The cultures were supplemented with cladribine and fludarabine. We determined the percentage of caspase-3-positive cells and the BCL-2/BAX ratio, and subsequently these apoptosis markers were correlated with the expression of ZAP-70 and CD38, lymphocyte counts, lactate dehydrogenase and beta(2)-microglobulin levels and clinical stage according to the Rai classification. The results showed that bone marrow cells are more sensitive to apoptosis caused by purine analogues than cells derived from blood, supporting the idea that these two compartments have different proliferative statuses. The cells from ZAP-70-positive patients seem to enter apoptosis more readily than those from ZAP-70-negative patients; thus, ZAP-70-positive patients are more likely to benefit from treatment with purine analogues.","['Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland. monika.podhorecka@am.lublin.pl']",20100311,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The data presented in this study demonstrated that ider(17q), which resulted in an extra RARA-PML fusion gene, was more frequent in males than females (male/female ratio of 2.12/1), was associated with a rather low initial white blood cell count and did not confer an adverse prognosis in APL patients treated with all-trans-retinoic acid and chemotherapy. The most frequent additional chromosome change to ider(17q) was trisomy 8. Ider(17q) was observed in all subtypes of the PML-RARA fusion gene, but the frequency of the bcr1 subtype was increased. Cases of overrepresentation of the RARA-PML fusion gene and ider(17q) cases may help in elucidating the role of RARA-PML in leukemogenesis.","['National Center for Scientific Research Demokritos, Athens, Greece. pmanola@ipta.demokritos.gr']",20100311,,,46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These mutations alter kinase-mediated signaling function and phenotypic outcome. An information theoretic analysis of the correlation of phosphoproteomic profiling and transformation potency of the oncogene in different mutants is presented. The theory seeks to predict the leukemic transformation potency from the observed signaling by constructing a distribution of maximal entropy of site-specific phosphorylation events. The theory is developed with special reference to systems biology where high throughput measurements are typical. We seek sets of phosphorylation events most contributory to predicting the phenotype by determining the constraints on the signaling system. The relevance of a constraint is measured by how much it reduces the value of the entropy from its global maximum, where all events are equally likely. Application to experimental phospho-proteomics data for kinase inhibitor-resistant mutants shows that there is one dominant constraint and that other constraints are not relevant to a similar extent. This single constraint accounts for much of the correlation of phosphorylation events with the oncogenic potency and thereby usefully predicts the trends in the phenotypic output. An additional constraint possibly accounts for biological fine structure.","['Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, Crump Institute for Molecular Imaging, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",20100311,,,,"['HG002807/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'K22 HG002807/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA119347/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U54 CA119347/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 AR059095/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of either oncogene resulted in the arrest of the differentiation of early B cells and lymphomagenesis. We also observed the development of skin keratoacanthoma lesions, probably because of aberrant ALK expression in keratinocytes. The inactivation of the ALK oncogene on doxycycline treatment was sufficient to induce sustained regression of both hematopoietic tumors and skin disease. Importantly, treatment with the specific ALK inhibitor (PF-2341066) also reversed the pathologic states, showing the value of these mouse models for the validation of ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Thus, our results show (1) that NPM-ALK and TPM3-ALK oncogenes are sufficient for lymphoma/leukemia development and required for tumor maintenance, hence validating ALK as potentially effective therapeutic target; and (2) for the first time, in vivo, the equal tumorigenic potential of the NPM-ALK and TPM3-ALK oncogenic tyrosine kinases. Our models offer a new tool to investigate in vivo the molecular mechanisms associated with ALK-induced lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Inserm, U563, Centre de Physiopathologie de Toulouse Purpan, Toulouse, France.']",20100311,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this success, a substantial proportion of B-cell lymphomas are unresponsive or develop resistance, hence more potent anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are continuously being sought. Here we demonstrate that type II (tositumomab-like) anti-CD20 mAbs are 5 times more potent than type I (rituximab-like) reagents in depleting human CD20 Tg B cells, despite both operating exclusively via activatory Fcgamma receptor-expressing macrophages. Much of this disparity in performance is attributable to type I mAb-mediated internalization of CD20 by B cells, leading to reduced macrophage recruitment and the degradation of CD20/mAb complexes, shortening mAb half-life. Importantly, human B cells from healthy donors and most cases of chronic lymphatic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma, showed rapid CD20 internalization that paralleled that seen in the Tg mouse B cells, whereas most follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells were far more resistant to CD20 loss. We postulate that differences in CD20 modulation may play a central role in determining the relative efficacy of rituximab in treating these diseases and strengthen the case for focusing on type II anti-CD20 mAb in the clinic.","['Tenovus Laboratory, Cancer Sciences Division, The Netherlands.']",20100311,,,,"['G0800457/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'C328/A2737/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'C328/A2738/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,['Blood. 2010 Jun 24;115(25):5127-8.

A peak incidence of precursor B cell ALL has emerged as socio-economic conditions have improved in countries worldwide. From twin studies and the use of neonatal blood spots it has been possible to back track the first initiating genetic events within critical haemopoietic cells to foetal development in utero for most precursor B cell ALL and some cases of AML. These events may occur as part of normal foetal development. Whether other factors (environmental or constitutional) are involved to increase the chance of these first genetic changes happening is unclear. For some leukaemias (e.g. infant MLL positive ALL) the first event appears adequate to create a malignant clone but for the majority of ALL and AML further 'genetic' changes are required, probably postnatal. Many environmental factors have been proposed as causative for leukaemia but only ionising irradiation and certain chemicals, e.g. benzene and cytotoxics (alkylators and topoisomerase II inhibitors) have been confirmed and then principally for acute myeloid leukaemia. It appears increasingly likely that delayed, dysregulated responses to 'common' infectious agents play a major part in the conversion of pre-leukaemic clones into overt precursor B cell ALL, the most common form of childhood leukaemia. Constitutional polymorphic alleleic variants in immune response genes (especially the HLA Class II proteins) and cytokines may play a role in determining the type of immune response. High penetrance germ-line mutations are involved in only about 5% of childhood leukaemias (more in AML than ALL). There is little evidence to support any role of viral transformation in causation, unlike in animals. Other environmental factors for which some evidence exists include non-ionising electromagnetic radiation and electric fields, although their mode of action in leukaemogenesis remains unclear. There is no single cause for childhood leukaemia and for most individuals a combination of factors appears to be necessary; all involving gene-environment interactions. To date few clear preventative measures have emerged, except the complete avoidance of first trimester X-rays in pregnancy; a healthy diet with adequate oral folic acid intake both preconception and early in pregnancy; and the early exposure of children to other children outside the home to facilitate stimulation and maturation of the natural immune system. Here then are clear echoes of the ""hygiene hypothesis"" regarding the initiation of allergies, autoimmune disease and type I diabetes mellitus in children and young people.","['University of Manchester, UK.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe incidence patterns of SPMs occurring after CM. METHODS: We calculated incidence rates and relative risks for the development of 65 different SPMs occurring in 16,591 CM survivors during 1.3 million person-years of observation in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program data from 1973 to 2003. RESULTS: Compared with the general population, CM survivors had a 32% higher risk of developing any SPM and demonstrated significantly elevated risks for 13 cancers: melanoma of the skin (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 8.99), soft tissue (SIR 2.80), melanoma of the eye and orbit (SIR 2.64), nonepithelial skin (SIR 2.31), salivary gland (SIR 2.18), bone and joint (SIR 1.70), thyroid (SIR 1.90), kidney (SIR 1.29), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SIR 1.29), brain and nervous system (SIR 1.31), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR 1.25), prostate (SIR 1.13), and female breast (SIR 1.07). Risks of second primary melanoma of the skin, melanoma of the eye and orbit, and cancers of the prostate, soft tissue, salivary gland, and bone and joint were elevated throughout the study period, implying no surveillance bias. LIMITATIONS: Possible underreporting of CM incidence in cancer registries is a limitation. In addition, the lack of individual-level data in cancer registry data precludes detailed examination of coincident risk factors. CONCLUSION: Risks of particular SPMs after CM may be explained by surveillance bias or shared risk factors. However, these probably do not explain the increased risks observed for prostate, soft tissue, salivary gland, and bone and joint cancers years after CM diagnosis. Further investigation into genetic or environmental commonalities between CM and these cancers is warranted.","['Department of Dermatology, Pigmented Lesion and Melanoma Program, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA.']",20100312,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2010 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.

Both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes are infected in vivo; their expansion relies on CD4+ cell cycling and on the prevention of CD8+ cell death. Cloned infected CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells from patients without malignancy also add up nuclear and mitotic defects typical of genetic instability related to the expression of the virus-encoded oncogene tax. HTLV-1 expression is cancer-prone in vitro, but in vivo numerous selection forces act to maintain T cell homeostasis and are possibly involved in clonal selection. RESULTS: Here we demonstrate that the HTLV-1 associated CD4+ preleukemic phenotype and the specific patterns of CD4+ and CD8+ clonal expansion are in vivo selected processes. By comparing the effects of recent (1 month) experimental infections performed in vitro and those observed in cloned T cells from patients infected for >6-26 years, we found that in chronically HTLV-1 infected individuals, HTLV-1 positive clones are selected for tax expression. In vivo, infected CD4+ cells are positively selected for cell cycling whereas infected CD8+ cells and uninfected CD4+ cells are negatively selected for the same processes. In contrast, the known HTLV-1-dependent prevention of CD8+ T cell death pertains to both in vivo and in vitro infected cells. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, virus-cell interactions alone are not sufficient to initiate early leukemogenesis in vivo.","['CNRS UMR5239, Universite de Lyon, Oncovirologie et Biotherapies, Centre Leon Berard, 69008 Lyon, France.']",20100311,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Development and progression of MDS to acute myeloid leukemia is suggested to be a multistep alteration to hematopoietic stem cells consisting of class I and class II alterations: the former targeting genes that are involved in signal transduction (e.g., FLT3, RAS and KIT), whereas the latter affect transcription factors (e.g., RUNX, RARA, EVI1 and WT1). These alterations consist of not only genomic mutations but also epigenetic aberrations, which can lead to reversible gene silencing. However, whether numerical and structural alterations of chromosomes and/or single genes or epigenetic changes represent the initiating event or, more likely, secondary events remains part of the discussion. Accumulation of such defects may finally cause the leukemic transformation of MDS.","['Department of Hematology & Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Germany. florian.nolte@medma.uni-heidelberg.de']",,,,93,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, Akt, a serine/threonine protein kinase, also known as protein kinase B (PKB), represents an attractive potential target for therapeutic intervention. Recent efforts in the development and biological evaluation of small molecule inhibitors of Akt have led to the identification of novel inhibitors with various heterocycle scaffolds. Based on previous results obtained on the antiproliferative activities of new pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoxalines, a novel series was designed and synthesized from various substituted phenyl-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid alkyl esters via a multistep heterocyclization process. These new compounds were tested for their in vitro ability to inhibit the proliferation of the human leukemic cell lines K562, U937, and HL60, and the breast cancer cell line MCF7. The first biological evaluation of our new substituted pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoxalines showed antiproliferative activity against the tested cell lines. From a general SAR point of view, these preliminary biological results highlight the importance of substitution at the C-4 position of the pyrroloquinoxaline scaffold by a benzylpiperidinyl fluorobenzimidazole group, and also the need for a functionalization on the pyrrole ring.","['PPF Medicaments-Parasitologie, UFR des Sciences Pharmaceutiques, Universite Bordeaux 2, Bordeaux, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article reviews pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and clinical data on dasatinib, and highlights some of the most important issues that need to be addressed. Imatinib and dasatinib both target the tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR/ABL oncogenic fusion protein. In terms of pharmacodynamics, the two agents differ in several ways: (i) dasatinib is >300-fold more potent than imatinib in inhibiting BCR/ABL activity; (ii) inhibition profiles on other tyrosine kinases differ between imatinib and dasatinib; and (iii) dasatinib has other peculiar effects on the leukemogenic signaling, including activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and reduction of the apoptotic-inactive form of the BCL2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD) protein. Recent pharmacodynamic data suggested combination therapy with dasatinib and signaling inhibitors (e.g. flavopiridol, farnesyl transferase inhibitors, or histone deacetylase inhibitors) may be beneficial. In contrast to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), dasatinib has a reduced half-life and no active metabolites. In a randomized, open-label, phase III trial, dasatinib 100 mg once daily demonstrated similar efficacy and a better tolerability profile than 70 mg twice daily. This unexpected result has been confirmed in recent studies, in which a dose of dasatinib 100 mg once daily was sufficient to trigger apoptosis in leukemic cells. Furthermore, cytogenetic responses correlate with BCR/ABL inhibition. Data suggest dasatinib 100 mg once daily achieves oncogenic shock and chronic inhibition of BCR/ABL activity, suggesting that in the future, pulse therapy with TKIs may be an option in some specific patients with CML.","['DiSCAFF, Novara, Italy.']",,,,54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed dose- and time-dependent decreases in the proliferation of HL-60 cells treated with propolis (above 3 microg mL(-1) of propolis). Further studies revealed that the anti-proliferative effects of propolis were caused by inducing apoptosis. Agarose electrophoresis of genomic DNA of HL-60 cells treated with propolis showed the ladder pattern typical for apoptotic cells. Propolis induced the activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase in HL-60 cells. Propolis also induced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of propolis on HL-60 cell proliferation is caused by inducing apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway.","['Department of Life Science, Kyonggi University, Suwon, Kyonggi-Do 443-760, Korea.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study found that exposure of HL60 cells to AZD6244 down-regulated the levels of phosphor (p)-4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), a substrate of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), and anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. On the other hand, exposure of EOL-1 and MOLM13 cells to AZD6244 failed to induce apoptosis and levels of p-4E-BP1 and Mcl-1 were not down-regulated in these cells. These observations prompted us to hypothesize that down-regulation od 4E-BP1 and Mcl-1 might play an important role in AZD6244-mediated apoptosis. As expected, down-regulation of 4E-BP1 by an siRNA sensitized EOL-1 cells to AZD6244-mediated apoptosis in parallel with down-regulation of Mcl-1. Moreover, we found that blockade of mTORC1 by RAD001 synergistically enhanced the action of AZD6244 in leukemia cells.","['Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Oko-cho, Nankoku, Kochi, 783-8505, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we aimed at examining apoptotic effects of CAPE on CCRF-CEM leukemic cells and at determining the roles of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in cell death. METHODS: Trypan blue and XTT methods were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity. Apoptosis was examined by ELISA-based oligonucleotide and acridine orange/ethidium bromide dye techniques. Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was evaluated using JC-1 dye by flow cytometric analysis and under fluorescent microscope. RESULTS: We detected the time- and dose-dependent increases in cytotoxic effect of CAPE on CCRF-CEM cells. ELISA and acridine orange/ethidium bromide results showed that apoptotic cell population increased significantly in CCRF-CEM cells exposed to increasing concentrations of CAPE. On the other hand, there was significant loss of MMP determined in response to CAPE in CCRF-CEM cells. CONCLUSION: This in vitro data by being supported with clinical data may open the way of the potential use of CAPE for the treatment of leukemia.","['Department of Medical Biology, School of Medicine, Ege University, Bornova, Izmir 35100, Turkey.']",20100310,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib was approved for the treatment of CML in 2002. Data from clinical trials allow a comparison of treatment options. METHODS: The literature on the treatment and monitoring of CML was selectively reviewed. A total of 94 original articles were analyzed, along with the recommendations of an international expert committee and the medical societies. This review is current as of November 2009. RESULTS: In a clinical phase 3 trial of imatinib treatment for patients in the chronic phase of CML, the rates of progression-free and overall survival at 6 years were 93% and 88%, respectively. Thus, imatinib is clearly superior to interferon-alpha, hydroxyurea, and busulfan with respect to survival. Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation is only a fall back option because of transplantation-associated mortality. One in four patients in the chronic phase of CML has an inadequate cytogenetic response to imatinib and therefore requires a change of treatment. Most imatinib-resistant patients in the chronic phase of CML go into remission again after switching to one of the new tyrosine kinase inhibitors, dasatinib and nilotinib. CONCLUSION: Imatinib is now the standard initial first-line treatment for CML in the chronic phase. Regular hematologic and cytogenetic monitoring during treatment is indispensable so that patients with an inadequate response can be identified.","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Germany. n.bubnoff@lrz.tum.de']",20100219,,,98,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the most significantly deregulated gene pathways in early MDS are immunodeficiency, apoptosis and chemokine signaling, whereas advanced MDS is characterized by deregulation of DNA damage response and checkpoint pathways. We have identified distinct gene expression profiles and deregulated gene pathways in patients with del(5q), trisomy 8 or -7/del(7q). Patients with trisomy 8 are characterized by deregulation of pathways involved in the immune response, patients with -7/del(7q) by pathways involved in cell survival, whereas patients with del(5q) show deregulation of integrin signaling and cell cycle regulation pathways. This is the first study to determine deregulated gene pathways and ontology groups in the HSC of a large group of MDS patients.

On further analysis, the prognostic impact of 1p31-32 loss is due to shortening of post-relapse survival as there is no impact on complete response rates and progression-free survival.","['Department of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ 85259, USA.']",20100311,,,,"['R01 CA083724/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA136671-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA136671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA62242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100707-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA015083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA133966-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA062242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA133966/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA83724-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CA015083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS246101'],,,,,,,,,,,,

CD8(+) T cells primed with the RHAMM-derived epitope R3, which is restricted by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2, effectively lyse RHAMM(+) CLL cells. Therefore, we initiated a phase I clinical trial of R3 peptide vaccination. Six HLA-A2(+) CLL patients were vaccinated four times at biweekly intervals with the R3 peptide (ILSLELMKL; 300 microg per dose) emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant; granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (100 microg per dose) was administered concomitantly. Detailed immunological analyses were conducted throughout the course of peptide vaccination. No severe adverse events greater than CTC I degrees skin toxicity were observed. Four patients exhibited reduced white blood cell counts during vaccination. In five of six patients, R3-specific CD8(+) T cells were detected with the corresponding peptide/HLA-A2 tetrameric complex; these populations were verified functionally in four of five patients using enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assays. In patients with clinical responses, we found increased frequencies of R3-specific CD8(+) T cells that expressed high levels of CD107a and produced both interferon-gamma and granzyme B in response to antigen challenge. Interestingly, vaccination was also associated with the induction of regulatory T cells in four patients. Thus peptide vaccination in six CLL patients was safe and could elicit to some extent specific CD8(+) T-cell responses against the tumor antigen RHAMM.","['Clinical Immunology Department, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland. giannop@tlen.pl']",20100311,,,,['G0501963/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

DS-ML is frequently preceded by transient leukemia (TL), a spontaneously resolving accumulation of blasts during the newborn period. Somatic mutations of GATA1 in the blasts of TL and DS-ML likely function as an initiating event. We hypothesized that the phenotypic difference between TL and DS-ML is due to a divergent functional repertoire of the leukemia-initiating cells. Using an NOD/SCID model, we found that cells initiating DS-ML engrafted, disseminated to distant bone marrow sites, and propagated the leukemic clone in secondary recipients. In contrast, TL cells lacked the ability to expand and to migrate, but were able to persist in the recipient bone marrow. We found some evidence of genomic progression with 1 of 9 DS-ML samples and none of 11 TL samples harboring a mutation of N-RAS. The findings of this pilot study provide evidence for the functional impact of second events underlying the transformation of TL into DS-ML and a needed experimental tool for the functional testing of these promoting events.","['Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",20100311,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Leukemia. 2010 Aug;24(8):1542.

A cohort of 62 CLL patients was divided into migrating and nonmigrating subsets according to chemotaxis toward CXCL12. Migrating patients phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) proteins more than nonmigrating patients (P<0.0002). CD38 expression was the parameter most strongly associated with heightened CXCL12 signaling (P<0.0001), confirmed by independent statistical approaches. Consistent with this observation, CD38(-) CLL cells in samples with bimodal CD38 expression responded less to CXCL12 than the intact clone (P=0.003). Furthermore, lentivirus-induced de novo expression of CD38 was paralleled by increased responses to CXCL12, as compared with cells infected with a control virus. CD38 ligation with agonistic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) enhanced CXCL12 signaling, whereas blocking anti-CD38 mAbs inhibited chemokine effects in vitro. This is attributed to physical proximity on the membrane between CD38 and CXCR4 (the CXCL12 receptor), as shown by (i) coimmunoprecipitation and (ii) confocal microscopy experiments. Blocking anti-CD38 mAbs significantly compromised homing of CLL cells from blood to lymphoid organs in a mouse model. These results indicate that CD38 synergizes with the CXCR4 pathway and support the working hypothesis that migration is a central step in disease progression.","['Department of Genetics, Biology and Biochemistry, University of Torino Medical School, Turin, Italy.']",20100311,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ligand binding ultimately leads to gamma-secretase cleavage within the transmembrane domain, allowing the intracellular domain to translocate to the nucleus and activate target gene transcription. Constitutive Notch signaling has been associated with human cancers such as T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). As tetraspanins have been implicated in many different signaling processes, we assessed their potential contribution to Notch signaling. We used a genetic assay in Caenorhabditis elegans to identify TSP-12 as a positive factor for Notch activity in several cellular contexts. Then, using a cell culture system, we showed that two human TSP-12 orthologs, TSPAN33 and TSPAN5, promote Notch activity and are likely to act at the gamma-secretase cleavage step. We also acquired evidence for functional redundancy among tetraspanins in both C. elegans and human cells. Selective inhibition of tetraspanins may constitute an anti-NOTCH therapeutic approach to reduce gamma-secretase activity.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Institute for Cancer Genetics, USA.']",20100310,,,,"['R01CA095389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA120196-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA120196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R01 CA120196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: Early intervention during imatinib therapy was undertaken in 210 adults with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia less than three months from diagnosis (Sokal high risk: 16%). Patients received imatinib 400 mg/day. At three months, dose was increased if complete hematologic response was not achieved. At six months, patients in complete cytogenetic response were kept on 400 mg and the remainder randomized to higher imatinib dose or 400 mg plus interferon-alfa. At 18 months, randomized patients were switched to a 2(nd) generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor if not in complete cytogenetic response and imatinib dose increased in non-randomized patients not in major molecular response. RESULTS: Seventy-two percent of patients started imatinib within one month from diagnosis. Median follow-up is 50.5 (range: 1.2-78) months. At three months 4 patients did not have complete hematologic response; at six months 73.8% were in complete cytogenetic response; among the remainder, 9 could not be randomized (toxicity or consent withdrawal), 17 were assigned to high imatinib dose, and 15 to 400 mg + interferon-alpha. The low number of randomized patients precluded comparison between the two arms. Cumulative response at three years was: complete hematologic response 98.6%, complete cytogenetic response 90% and major molecular response 82%. On an intention-to-treat basis, complete cytogenetic response was 78.8% at 18 months. At five years, survival was 97.5%, survival free from accelerated/blastic phase 94.3%, failure free survival 82.5%, and event free survival (including permanent imatinib discontinuation) 71.5%.

To assess the clinical implication of changes in angiogenesis shortly after induction chemotherapy, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was performed prospectively before treatment (day 0) and on day 7 in 80 patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia. We demonstrated that a post-therapeutic reduction in Peak (negative DeltaPeak) compared with the day 0 value was significantly associated with a higher chance of achieving complete remission, and better overall and disease free survival (P=0.022, 0.003 and 0.007, respectively). Cox's multivariate analysis also identified negative DeltaPeak value as an independent good prognostic factor for overall and disease free survival.

However, Vgamma9Vdelta2 T-cell based lymphoma clinical trials have suffered from the lack of biomarkers that can be used as prognostic of therapeutic success. DESIGN AND METHODS: We have conducted a comprehensive study of gene expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemias and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, aimed at identifying markers of susceptibility versus resistance to Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. We employed cDNA microarrays and quantitative real-time PCR to screen 20 leukemia and lymphoma cell lines, and 23 primary hematopoietic tumor samples. These data were analyzed using state-of-the-art bioinformatics, and gene expression patterns were correlated with susceptibility to Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell mediated cytolysis in vitro. RESULTS: We identified a panel of 10 genes encoding cell surface proteins that were statistically differentially expressed between ""gammadelta-susceptible"" and ""gammadelta-resistant"" hematopoietic tumors. Within this panel, 3 genes (ULBP1, TFR2 and IFITM1) were associated with increased susceptibility to Vgamma9Vdelta2 T-cell cytotoxicity, whereas the other 7 (CLEC2D, NRP2, SELL, PKD2, KCNK12, ITGA6 and SLAMF1) were enriched in resistant tumors. Furthermore, some of these candidates displayed a striking variance of expression among primary follicular lymphomas and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that hematopoietic tumors display a highly variable repertoire of surface proteins that can impact on Vgamma9Vdelta2 cell-mediated immunotargeting. The prognostic value of the proposed markers can now be evaluated in upcoming Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell-based lymphoma/leukemia clinical trials.","['Unidade de Imunologia Molecular, Instituto de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Moniz, 1649-028 Lisboa, Portugal.']",20100310,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 transmission occurs by transmission of infected cells via breast-feeding by infected mothers, sexual intercourse, and contaminated blood products. The route of exposure and early virus replication events are believed to be key determinants of virus-associated spread, antiviral immune responses, and ultimately disease outcomes. The lack of knowledge of early events of HTLV-1 spread following blood-borne transmission of the virus in vivo hinders a more complete understanding of the immunopathogenesis of HTLV-1 infections. Herein, we have used an established animal model of HTLV-1 infection to study early spatial and temporal events of the viral infection. Twelve-week-old rabbits were injected intravenously with cell-associated HTLV-1 (ACH-transformed R49). Blood and tissues were collected at defined intervals throughout the study to test the early spread of the infection. Antibody and hematologic responses were monitored throughout the infection. HTLV-1 intracellular Tax and soluble p19 matrix were tested from ex vivo cultured lymphocytes. Proviral copy numbers were measured by real-time PCR from blood and tissue mononuclear leukocytes. Our data indicate that intravenous infection with cell-associated HTLV-1 targets lymphocytes located in both primary lymphoid and gut-associated lymphoid compartments. A transient lymphocytosis that correlated with peak virus detection parameters was observed by 1 week postinfection before returning to baseline levels. Our data support emerging evidence that HTLV-1 promotes lymphocyte proliferation preceding early viral spread in lymphoid compartments to establish and maintain persistent infection.","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, 1925 Coffey Road, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",20100310,,,,"['P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100730 S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells were derived from the ventral mesencephalic area of a 14-day-old rat embryo and immortalized retrovirally with the temperature-sensitive mutant of the SV40 Large T-antigen. We investigate the proliferation and differentiation of these cells under various culture conditions, at different temperatures and serum conditions. For differentiation were propagated cells at 39 degrees C in medium supplemented with 1% FCS with or without cytokines. At chosen time points cells were investigated for the expression of different markers by western blot and immunocytochemistry. As controls cells cultured at 33 degrees C with 10% FCS for 3 days were used. We have shown that serum reduction alone is not sufficient for CSM14.1-cells to stop proliferating and begin differentiation. Following serum reduction and elevation of the temperature cells changed their morphology began to express specific band of the neuronal marker NeuN. Following cytokines treatment the mean length of cellular processes increased from 319 to 385 microm per cell, whereas the expression of neuronal markers such as NeuN and TH was not markedly changed. In conclusion, the differentiation cocktail consisting of interleukin 1(Il-1), Il-11, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and GDNF, does influence the outgrowth of neuritis but does not change the expression of mature neuronal markers at the protein level in CSM14.1 cells.","['University of Rostock, Institute of Anatomy, Medical Faculty, Rostock Germany.']",20100228,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied the role of HOX genes in the survival and proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. These are a family of homeodomain-containing transcription factors that determine cell and tissue identity in the early embryo, and have an anti-apoptotic role in a number of malignancies including lung and renal cancer. METHODS: We used QPCR to determine HOX gene expression in normal ovary and in the ovarian cancer cell lines SK-OV3 and OV-90. We used a short peptide, HXR9, to disrupt the formation of HOX/PBX dimers and alter transcriptional regulation by HOX proteins. RESULTS: In this study we show that the ovarian cancer derived line SK-OV3, but not OV-90, exhibits highly dysregulated expression of members of the HOX gene family. Disrupting the interaction between HOX proteins and their co-factor PBX induces apoptosis in SK-OV3 cells and retards tumour growth in vivo. CONCLUSION: HOX/PBX binding is a potential target in ovarian cancer.","['Postgraduate Medical School, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK. r.morgan@surrey.ac.uk']",20100310,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is not yet clear whether the distribution of this virus is primarily limited to the USA or whether it is causally associated with human disease. If future investigations confirm a broad distribution of XMRV and its association with disease, this would have an impact on xenotransplantation of porcine tissues and organs. Xenotransplantation is currently being developed to compensate for the increasing shortage of human material for the treatment of tissue and organ failure but could result in the transmission of porcine pathogens. Maintenance of pathogen-free donor animals will dramatically reduce this risk, but some of the porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) found in the genome of all pigs, can produce infectious virus and infect cultured human cells. PERVs are closely related to XMRV so it is critical to develop tests that discriminate between them. Since recombination can occur between viruses, and recombinants can exhibit synergism, recipients should be tested for XMRV before xenotransplantation.","['Retrovirus induced immunosuppression, Robert Koch Institute, Nordufer 20, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.

Thirty-seven patients were enrolled in this Australasian Leukaemia & Lymphoma Group study and transplanted between 1995 and 1999. Only one patient had received prior rituximab. Two patients died of transplant-related toxicity; 28 of the remainder commenced interferon, but it was discontinued prematurely in most patients due to toxicity (mainly fatigue and depression) or relapse. While the majority of patients (29/36 evaluable: 81%) achieved a complete remission based on clinical and CT scan criteria post-transplant, most relapsed relatively early, with a median progression-free survival of 2.4 years. The overall survival at 7 years was 49%. Eight patients (22%), however, remain alive a median of 9.3 years post-transplant, having never relapsed, and another six patients (16%) remain alive in durable remission after salvage therapy. These results demonstrate that interferon is poorly tolerated post-autograft and hence is unlikely to positively contribute to patient outcome.

Of 42 patients, nine achieved complete remission (CR), 15 very good partial remission, and two nodular partial remission (overall response rate 62%). Stem cell mobilization and harvesting (> or = 2 x 10(6) stem cells/kg body weight) were successful in 12 of 20 patients. Rituximab infusion-related adverse events were moderate. The main grade 3/4 adverse events during induction were neutropenia and lymphocytopenia. Rituximab plus cladribine was effective; however, the CR rate was modest and stem cell harvest was impaired in a large number of responding patients.","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Bern, Inselspital, 3010 Bern, Switzerland.']",,,,,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 Apr;51(4):571-3.

Of retroviruses in veterinary field, receptors for the following viruses have been identified; equine infectious anemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukemia virus subgroups A, B, C, and T, Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus, enzootic nasal tumor virus, avian leukosis virus subgroups A, B, C, D, E, and J, reticuloendotheliosis virus, RD-114 virus (a feline endogenous retrovirus), and porcine endogenous retrovirus subgroup A. Primate lentiviruses require two molecules (CD4 and chemokine receptors such as CXCR4) as receptors. Likewise, feline immunodeficiency virus also requires two molecules, i.e., CD134 (an activation marker of CD4 T cells) and CXCR4 in infection. Gammaretroviruses utilize multi-spanning transmembrane proteins, most of which are transporters of amino acids, vitamins and inorganic ions. Betaretroviruses and alpharetroviruses utilize transmembrane and/or GPI-anchored proteins as receptors.

Herein, we report on a novel analytical method for intracellular accumulation of anthracyclines using MEKC/LIF detection. An aqueous separation system permitted the injection of cell lysates directly into the capillary. The MEKC migrating solution was made up of borate buffer at pH 9.22 containing sodium taurodeoxycholate, (2-hydroxypropyl)-gamma-CD, and SDS. The anthracyclines, Doxorubicin (DOX) and epirubicin (EPI) were detected by LIF using a Nd:YAG laser (532 nm) or an argon ion laser (488 nm) for excitation. Two cell lines, human humerus tumor cells (RDES) and human lung tumor cells (A549), were treated with a mixture of the two anthracyclines for fixed periods of time, and then intracellular concentrations were determined by injecting cell lysates directly. Recovery values of 96.0-100.8% were obtained for DOX and EPI. Reproducibility quantified by RSD was less than 3.9% intraday and 6.7% interday at concentrations ranging between 50 and 500 nM. The uptake of EPI was found to be slightly less than that of DOX for A549, but higher levels of EPI were observed in RDES. Intracellular accumulation of anthracyclines was greater in RDES than in A549, but both types of cells excreted anthracyclines after 12 h. These results indicate that MEKC with an aqueous medium is useful for investigating intracellular uptake and accumulation of drugs, since cell lysates can be used directly with no pretreatment such as deproteination or solvent extraction of analytes.","['Department of Applied Chemistry, Graduate School of Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are obtained using an iterative selection protocol called SELEX. Several small molecules and proteins have been used as targets. Recently, a variant of this methodology, known as cell-SELEX, has been developed for a new generation of aptamers, which are capable of recognizing whole living cells. We have used this methodology for the selection of aptamers, which show high affinity and specificity for several cancer cells. In this chapter, we describe (1) the process followed for the generation of aptamers capable of recognizing acute leukemia cells (CCRF-CEM cells) and (2) the method of enhancing the selectivity and sensitivity of these aptamers by conjugation with a dual-nanoparticle system, which combines magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) and fluorescent silica nanoparticles (FNP). Specifically, the selected aptamers, which showed dissociation constants in the nanomolar range, have been coupled to MNPs in order to selectively collect and enrich cells from complex matrices, including blood samples. The additional coupling of the aptamer to FNPs offers an excellent and highly sensitive method for detecting cancer cells. In order to prove the potential of this rapid and low-cost method for diagnostic purposes, confocal microscopy was used to confirm the specific collection and detection of target cells in concentrations as low as 250 cells. The final fluorescence of the cells labeled with the nanoparticles was quantified using a fluorescence microplate reader.","['Department of Chemistry, Functional Genomics Shands Cancer Center, Center for Research at the Bio/Nano Interface, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An ever increasing body of evidence demonstrates that carcinogenesis is associated with aberrant DNA methylation of the promoters of tumor suppressor genes (Chin Med J (Engl) 111:1028-1030, 1998; Leukemia 17:2533-2535, 2003), hypomethylation of oncogenes (Toxicol Appl Pharmacol 206:288-298, 2005; Toxicology 50:231-245, 1988), and concurrent loss of methylation in the intergenic areas and gene bodies, which may lead to genomic instability and chromosomal fragility (Cytogenet Cell Genet 89:121-128, 2000). Single locus methylation assays have focused largely on specific known tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes (Chin Med J (Engl) 111:1028-1030, 1998; Cancer Res 57:594-599, 1997; Hum Genet 94:491-496, 1994; Mol Cell Biol 14:4225-4232, 1994; Gastroenterology 116:394-400, 1999). Such approaches, while being useful, have clear limitations. With the advent of genome-wide microarray-based techniques, it has become possible to perform genome-wide exploratory studies to better understand genomic patterning of DNA methylation and also to discover new potential disease-specific epigenetic lesions (J Cell Biochem 88:138-143, 2003; Genome Res 16:1075-1083, 2006). In order to capture this type of information from primary human tissues, we have adopted and optimized the HELP assay (HpaII tiny fragment Enrichment by Ligation-mediated PCR) to compare and contrast the abundance of cytosine methylation of genomic regions that are relatively enriched for CpG dinucleotides. While we have mainly used a custom NimbleGen-Roche high-density oligonucleotide microarray containing 25,626 HpaII amplifiable fragments, many other microarray platforms or high throughput sequencing strategies can be used with HELP.","['Division of Immunopathology, Department of Pathology, Weill Medical College, Cornell University, New York, NY, USA. ris9004@med.cornell.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the effect of nucleoprotein from salmon soft roe on animal model of arthritis. Mice transgenic for human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1 Tg) were divided into three experimental groups and supplemented on either nucleoprotein-free (nonNP), or 0.6% or 1.2% nucleoprotein mixed (NP0.6 or NP1.2) diet for 3 months. The mice were evaluated arthritis by morphology, and measured with rheumatoid factor (RF). Moreover, macrophages and oxidative metabolites were assessed in the ankle and/or serum. Anti-oxidative potentials in nucleoprotein were determined with biological anti-oxidative potential (BAP) test, and electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis. NonNP-diet HTLV-1 Tg mice increased an arthritis symptoms and RF. The symptoms were ameliorated in NP-diet groups. Macrophages detected by F4/80 staining, and oxidative metabolites in the serum and/or joints were clearly decreased in 1.2% NP-diet HTLV-1 Tg mice. Nucleoprotein and DNA-nucleotide, but less protamine, had direct anti-oxidative potency with BAP test and/or ESR in vitro. These observations suggest that dietary nucleoprotein ameliorates arthritis symptoms in HTLV-1 Tg mice and offers hope as an alternative treatment for this debilitating medical condition.","['Department of Anatomy, Showa University School of Medicine, Shinagawa-Ku, Tokyo 142-8555, Japan.']",20100224,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: High LIF expression is an indicator of receptive endometrium in fertile women. However, in infertile individuals, the data on endometrial LIF expression and secretion are controversial. Even after ruling out other causes of infertility, such as tubal, endocrine, male factor, and endometriosis, LIF-only detection is not sufficient for assessment of implantation potential in women with unexplained infertility. This is obviously in contrast to evidence of the crucial role of LIF in mouse endometrial physiology. In a large multicenter study, recombinant human LIF failed to improve the outcome of IVF treatment in women with recurrent implantation failure. SUMMARY: A better comprehension of the mechanisms underlying endometrial receptivity and implantation should guide clinicians through proper management and treatment of infertility and implantation failure, and may eventually enable widespread adherence to single embryo transfer practices.","['Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, University of California-San Francisco, 513 Parnassus Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA. aghajanoval@obgyn.ucsf.edu']",,,,48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fludarabine-RIC and PBSC graft were used. Manipulation was done by CD34+ selection (n=9) or CD3/CD19 depletion (n=12). Results were compared with patients (n=26) conditioned with the same regimen and grafted with a CD34+-selected PBSC from identical related donors. Median time to neutrophil recovery was 12 days (range, 10-19 d).

CD3/CD19 depletion showed higher natural killer cell counts even after 1 year. Nonrelapse mortality (7% for matched CD34+-selected grafts and 11% for mismatched/haplo-CD3/CD19-depleted grafts), relapse probability (27% for related CD34+-selected patients and 33% for related CD3/CD19-depleted patients), and disease-free survival were similar for both the groups. In conclusion, using graft engineering procedures after RIC for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation offers a high probability of engraftment, fast immune recovery, and very low mortality even with mismatched donors.","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Cell Therapy Unit, Nino Jesus Children Hospital, Madrid, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we aimed to determine the growth and bone mineral density (BMD) of the children off chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and the probable risk factors. PROCEDURE: The age, anthropometric measurements, lumbar spine BMDs were recorded in 70 children. The risk factors on BMD; daily calcium intake, the time interval from the completion of the chemotherapy, cranial radiotherapy, cumulative steroid dose, decrease in physical activity were investigated. Serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphates, magnesium, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and 25 (OH) vitamin D levels were determined. RESULTS: The mean height percentile at the time of diagnosis was decreased from the value of 53 to a value of 47 at the beginning of the study (P=0.071). Of them; 44% had osteoporosis, 41% had osteopenia, and the rest had normal BMD. BMD z-scores were decreased during the first 2 years from the completion of the treatment. There was a positive correlation between BMD z-scores and daily calcium intake (CC=0.366, P=0.0015). A negative correlation was determined between the time spent on TV and computers and BMD z-scores (CC=-0.464, P=0.0019). Serum IGF-1 and 25 (OH) vitamin D levels of patients were significantly lower than controls (P=0.033). CONCLUSIONS: Our data revealed that 85% of the survivors had bone mineralization defect. BMDs and z scores were decreased during the first 2 years from the completion of the treatment and then gradually began to increase. The most important risk factor for decreased BMD was low daily calcium intake. Therefore, patients and their families should be encouraged to take sufficient amount of calcium. Prophylactic vitamin D may also be supplemented.","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Uludag University Faculty of Medicine, 16059 Gorukle, Bursa, Turkey. adaletm@uludag.edu.tr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explored the role of promoter CpG island hypermethylation in the biology and therapeutic targeting of MLL-r infant ALL. The HELP (HpaII tiny fragment enrichment by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) assay was used to examine genome-wide methylation of a cohort of MLL-r infant leukemia samples (n = 5), other common childhood ALLs (n = 5), and normals (n = 5). Unsupervised analysis showed tight clustering of samples into their known biologic groups, indicating large differences in methylation patterns. Global hypermethylation was seen in the MLL-r cohort compared with both the normals and the others, with ratios of significantly (P < .001) hypermethylated to hypomethylated CpGs of 1.7 and 2.9, respectively. A subset of 7 differentially hypermethylated genes was assayed by quantitative reverse-transcription (qRT)-PCR, confirming relative silencing in 5 of 7. In cell line treatment assays with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) decitabine, MLL-r (but not MLL wild-type cell lines) showed dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity and re-expression of 4 of the 5 silenced genes. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) confirmed promoter hypermethylation at baseline, and a relative decrease in methylation after treatment.

Here we show that high expression of Pim2 is observed in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). To further characterize the cooperative role of Pim2 with promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML/RARalpha), we used a well-established PML-RARalpha (PRalpha) mouse model. Pim2 coexpression in PRalpha-positive hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) induces leukemia in recipient mice after a short latency. Pim2-PRalpha cells were able to repopulate mice in serial transplantations and to induce disease in all recipients. Neither Pim2 nor PRalpha alone was sufficient to induce leukemia upon transplantation in this model. The disease induced by Pim2 overexpression in PRalpha cells contained a slightly higher fraction of immature myeloid cells, compared with the previously described APL disease induced by PRalpha. However, it also clearly resembled an APL-like phenotype and showed signs of differentiation upon all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment in vitro. These results support the hypothesis that Pim2, which is also a known target of Flt3-ITD (another gene that cooperates with PML-RARalpha), cooperates with PRalpha to induce APL-like disease.","['Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.']",20100309,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most optical tracking technologies rely on the use of fluorescent or bioluminescent reporter genes, which need to be stably expressed in the cells of interest. Because gene transfer in primary leukemia samples represents a major risk to impair their capability to engraft in a xenogenic context, we evaluated the possibility to use gene transfer-free labeling technologies. The lipophilic dye 3,3,3',3' tetramethylindotricarbocyanine iodide (DiR) was selected among 4 near-infrared (NIR) staining technologies. Unfortunately we report here a massive transfer of the dye occurring toward the neighbor cells both in vivo and in vitro. We further demonstrate that all lipophilic dyes tested in this study (1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine perchlorate [DiI], DiD, DiR, and PKH26) can give rise to microenvironmental contamination, including when used in suboptimal concentration, after extensive washing procedures and in the absence of phagocytosis or marked cell death. This was observed from all cell types tested. Eventually, we show that this microenvironmental contamination is mediated by both direct cell-cell contacts and diffusible microparticles. We conclude that tracking of labeled cells using non-genetically encoded markers should always be accompanied by drastic cross validation using multimodality approaches.","[""Hematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, London Research Institute, Cancer Research UK, 44 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, United Kingdom.""]",20100309,,,,['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated ATRA-induced cellular responses mediated by the transcription factor FOXO3A in APL cells. FOXO3A was constitutively phosphorylated and localized in the cytoplasm in both APL-derived NB4 cells and primary APL cells. Upon treating the cells with ATRA, FOXO3A phosphorylation was reduced and FOXO3A translocated into the nucleus. In addition, the expression of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a target molecule for FOXO3A, was increased at the transcriptional and protein levels. As expected, transfection of a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) oligonucleotide specific for FOXO3A significantly inhibited ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation and apoptosis in NB4 cells. In NB4-derived ATRA-resistant NB4/RA cells, neither FOXO3A nuclear localization nor subsequent TRAIL induction was observed after ATRA treatment. Furthermore, forced expression of active FOXO3A in the nucleus induced TRAIL production and apoptosis in NB4/RA cells. We conclude that activation of FOXO3A is an essential event for ATRA-induced cellular responses in NB4 cells. FOXO3A is a promising target for therapeutic approaches to overcome ATRA resistance in APL.","['Department of Hematology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo 113-8421, Japan.']",20100309,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that the novel anti-CD22 immunotoxin, RFB4(dsFv)-PE38 (BL22, CAT-3888), would be active and have limited nonspecific side effects in children with CD22-expressing hematologic malignancies. We conducted the first preclinical and phase I clinical studies of BL22 in that setting. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Lymphoblasts from children with B-lineage ALL were assessed for CD22 expression by flow cytometry and for BL22 sensitivity by in vitro cytotoxicity assay. BL22 was evaluated in a human ALL murine xenograft model. A phase I clinical trial was conducted for pediatric subjects with CD22+ ALL and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. RESULTS: All samples screened were CD22+. BL22 was cytotoxic to blasts in vitro (median IC(50), 9.8 ng/mL) and prolonged the leukemia-free survival of murine xenografts. Phase I trial cohorts were treated at escalating doses and schedules ranging from 10 to 40 microg/kg every other day for three or six doses repeated every 21 or 28 days. Treatment was associated with an acceptable safety profile, adverse events were rapidly reversible, and no maximum tolerated dose was defined. Pharmacokinetics were influenced by disease burden consistent with rapid drug binding by CD22+ blasts. Although no responses were observed, transient clinical activity was seen in most subjects.

Knocking down experiments with either p53 or DEK small interfering RNA (siRNA) were done to investigate the potential role of p53 in controlling the expression of DEK and the role of DEK in leukemic cell survival/apoptosis. RESULTS: Both Nutlin-3 and chlorambucil downregulated DEK in primary B-CLL samples (n = 21) and SKW6.4 but not in BJAB cells. Knocking down p53 attenuated the effect of Nutlin-3 on DEK expression, whereas knocking down DEK significantly increased both spontaneous and Nutlin-3-induced apoptosis. Conversely, counteracting DEK downmodulation by using p53 small interfering RNA reduced Nutlin-3-mediated apoptosis. On the other hand, Nutlin-3 potently induced p53 accumulation, but it did not affect DEK levels in normal CD19(+) B lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that the downregulation of DEK in response to either Nutlin-3 or chlorambucil represents an important molecular determinant in the cytotoxic response of leukemic cells, and suggest that strategies aimed to downregulate DEK might improve the therapeutic potential of these drugs.","['Department of Morphology and Embryology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.']",20100309,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used reverse-phase protein array methods to measure the level of total and phosphoprotein expression of FOXO3A, in leukemia-enriched protein samples from 511 newly diagnosed AML patients. RESULTS: The expression range was similar to normal CD34+ cells and similar in blood and marrow. Levels of total FOXO3A were higher at relapse compared with diagnosis. Levels of pFOXO3A or the ratio of phospho to total (PT) were not associated with karyotpe but were higher in patients with FLT3 mutations. Higher levels of pFOXO3A or PT-FOXO3A were associated with increased proliferation evidenced by strong correlation with higher WBC, percent marrow, and blood blasts and by correlation with higher levels of Cyclins B1, D1 and D3, pGSK3, pMTOR, and pStat5. Patients with High levels of pFOXO3A or PT-FOXO3A had higher rates of primary resistance and shorter remission durations, which combine to cause an inferior survival experience (P = 0.0002). This effect was independent of cytogenetics. PT-FOXO3A was a statistically significant independent predictor in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of phosphorylation of FOXO3A is a therapeutically targetable, independent adverse prognostic factor in AML.","['Departments of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030-4095, USA. skornblau@mdanderson.org']",20100309,,,,['P01 CA108631/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS378348'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we initially discovered that the potent antineoplastic effect of niclosamide, a Food and Drug Administration-approved antihelminthic agent, was through inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway in AML cells. Niclosamide inhibited the transcription and DNA binding of NF-kappaB. It blocked tumor necrosis factor-induced IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, translocation of p65, and expression of NF-kappaB-regulated genes. Niclosamide inhibited the steps TAK1-->IkappaB kinase (IKK) and IKK-->IkappaBalpha. Niclosamide also increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in AML cells. Quenching ROS by the glutathione precursor N-acetylcysteine attenuated niclosamide-induced apoptosis. Our results together suggest that niclosamide inhibited the NF-kappaB pathway and increased ROS levels to induce apoptosis in AML cells. On translational study of the efficacy of niclosamide against AML, niclosamide killed progenitor/stem cells from AML patients but spared those from normal bone marrow. Niclosamide was synergistic with the frontline chemotherapeutic agents cytarabine, etoposide, and daunorubicin. It potently inhibited the growth of AML cells in vitro and in nude mice. Our results support further investigation of niclosamide in clinical trials of AML patients.","['Department of Pathophysiology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",20100309,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have shown that MOV10 plays an active role in the RNA interference pathway. Here, we report that MOV10 inhibits retrovirus replication. When it was overexpressed in viral producer cells, MOV10 was able to reduce the infectivity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), simian immunodeficiency virus, and murine leukemia virus. Conversely, when MOV10 expression was reduced by small interfering RNAs, HIV-1 infectivity was increased. Consistently, silencing of MOV10 expression in a human T cell line enhanced HIV-1 replication. Furthermore, we found that MOV10 interacts with HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein in an RNA-dependent manner and is packaged into virions. It blocks HIV-1 replication at a postentry step. In addition, we also found that HIV-1 could suppress MOV10 protein expression to counteract this cellular resistance. All of these results indicate that MOV10 has a broad antiretroviral activity that can target a wide range of retroviruses, and it could be actively involved in host defense against retroviral infection.","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824-4320, USA.']",20100309,,,,"['AI063944/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI063944/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI080225/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K02 AI080225/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI063944/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested that the expression of CADM1 protein promotes infiltration of leukemic cells into various organs and tissues, which is one of the frequent clinical manifestations of ATL. Amino acid sequence alignment revealed that Tiam1 (T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1), a Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, has a type II PDZ domain similar to those of membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologs (MAGUKs) that are known to bind to the PDZ-BM of CADM1. In this study, we demonstrated that the cytoplasmic domain of CADM1 directly interacted with the PDZ domain of Tiam1 and induced formation of lamellipodia through Rac activation in HTLV-I-transformed cell lines as well as ATL cell lines. Our results indicate that Tiam1 integrates signals from CADM1 to regulate the actin cytoskeleton through Rac activation, which may lead to tissue infiltration of leukemic cells in ATL patients.","['Genetics Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan; Tumor Suppression and Functional Genomics Project, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.

Recent evidence has indicated microRNAs (miRNAs) are an integral part of these transcriptional programs, which target key proteins and impact cell growth thereby facilitating changes required for differentiation. To further investigate the role of miRNAs in cell growth and differentiation, we focused on miR-22, a miRNA induced by TPA in the HL-60 leukemia cell line model of monocytic differentiation. TPA-induced miR-22 transcription was found to be downstream of the protein kinase c (PKC)-extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) signaling module, a pathway central to the growth and differentiation of many different cell types. Enforced miR-22 expression inhibited the growth of several different cancer cell lines, causing an accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The mechanism of miR-22's inhibitory effects involves targeting of the obligate c-Myc binding partner Max. Enforced miR-22 expression presumably lowers Max levels available for Myc binding, which differentially influenced the transcription of downstream targets of the Myc-Max complex. Our study provides additional support for miRNAs targeting key cellular regulatory microcircuits such as those governed by the Myc-Max transcriptional complex as well as their being active participants in cell growth and differentiation.","['University of Medicine & Dentistry of New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, The Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ 08901, USA.']",20100307,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, it was demonstrated that it inhibits histone deacetylases (HDAC), modulates cell cycle, induces tumor cell death and inhibits angiogenesis in various tumor models. The exact anticancer mechanisms of VPA remains unclear, but HDAC inhibition, extracellular-regulated kinase activation, protein kinase C inhibition, Wnt-signaling activation, proteasomal degradation of HDAC, possible downregulation of telomerase activity and DNA demethylation participate in its anticancer effect. Hyperacetylation of histones, as a result of HDAC inhibition, seems to be the most important mechanism of VPA's antitumor action. Preclinical data suggest that the anticancer effect of chemotherapy is augmented when VPA is used in combination with cytostatics. Besides the effects of pretreatment with HDAC inhibitors, which increases the efficiency of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, VP-16, ellipticine, doxorubicin and cisplatin, pre-exposure to VPA increases the cytotoxicity of topoisomerase II inhibitors. There are two suggested cell death mechanisms caused by potentiation of anticancer drugs by HDAC inhibitors that are neither exclusive nor synergistic. The first involves apoptosis and can be both p53 dependent or independent; the second involves mechanisms other than apoptosis. In resistant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), VPA restores sensitivity to imatinib. We have demonstrated the synergistic effects of VPA and cisplatin in neuroblastoma cells. VPA can be taken orally, crosses the blood brain barrier and can be used for extended periods. Clinical trials in patients with malignancies are being conducted. The use of VPA prior to or together with anticancer drugs may thus prove a beneficial treatment.","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In general, within a specific disease category, the mere presence or absence of any one of these mutations does not appear to correlate with survival or development of blast phase disease, myelofibrosis, or thrombosis. In contrast, interesting associations between JAK2V617F allele burden and clinical outcome (e.g. lower quartile range allele burden and shorter survival in PMF and higher allele burden and fibrotic transformation in PV) have been made, but require further validation, and their impact on treatment choices is not clear. Similarly, although detection of JAK2V617F status post allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant indicates minimal residual disease, the general use of mutant allele burden for monitoring treatment response has not been systematically studied.

Patients with ATLL frequently develop humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) resulting from increased osteoclastic bone resorption. Our goal was to investigate the mechanisms of ATLL-induced osteoclastic bone resorption. Murine calvaria co-cultured with HTLV-1-infected cells directly or conditioned media from cell cultures had increased osteoclast activity that was dependent on RANKL, indicating that factors secreted from ATLL cells had a stimulatory effect on bone resorption. Factors released from resorbing bone stimulated proliferation of HTLV-1-infected T-cells. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), both osteoclast stimulators, were expressed in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. Interestingly, when HTLV-1-infected T-cells were co-cultured with pre-osteoblasts, the expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG), an osteoclast inhibitory factor, was significantly down-regulated in the pre-osteoblasts. When OPG was added into the ex vivo osteoclastogenesis assay induced by HTLV-1-infected T-cells, osteoclastogenesis was strongly inhibited. In addition, HTLV-1-infected T-cells inhibited expression of early osteoblast genes and induced late genes. These regulators will serve as future therapeutic targets for the treatments of HHM in ATLL.","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, Arthur G.

PROCEDURE: Data from 77 young patients with synovial sarcoma registered or treated by the Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) between 1991 and 2006 were reviewed. The outcome of 21 patients with localised favourable disease who were treated with surgery only is described. RESULTS: Five-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) for all 77 patients were 72% and 76%, respectively. In multivariate analysis survival was influenced by tumour invasiveness and size (T stage) and IRS group (T1b, P = 0.002; T2a, P = 0.041; T2b, P < 0.001; IRS III, P = 0.012). Patients with metastatic disease (IRS group IV) had a very poor prognosis; all but one has died. In IRS III patients, response to chemotherapy was seen in 38%. In a subgroup of 21 patients with small completed resected tumours no further primary treatment was given. Nineteen of this group were alive in first complete remission (CR). CONCLUSION: The outcome of treatment for young patients in this national, multi-centre series of synovial sarcoma cases compares favourably to that in other contemporary series and presents novel information that demonstrates the validity of a conservative approach to further therapy in patients with small completely resected tumours.","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Manchester, Uk. bernadette.brennan@cmft.nhs.uk""]",,,,,['Department of Health/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

SETTING: The standard Phase I oncology trial is designed to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in a setting where serious drug-related toxicity is expected. However, many newer agents hope to show the efficacy without increasing the background rate of adverse events. Formal statistical designs in this setting are needed. RESULTS: The Phase I/II toxicity-evaluation design is suitable when the therapeutic dose is expected to be well below the MTD. In Phase I, the design enrolls multiple cohorts at the target dose, possibly after an initial dose titration stage, and tests a formal safety hypothesis using a standard 3 + 3 enrollment scheme. Phase I serves as an interim safety analysis before proceeding to Phase II efficacy testing. We give an exact upper confidence limit on the toxicity rate at the therapeutic dose using the combined Phase I/II toxicity data, as well as the maximum likelihood estimate of the toxicity rate. We describe an example where the design has been used for a Phase I/II trial of immunotherapy in leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Phase I/II toxicity-evaluation designs are simple to execute and may be suitable for some cancer immunotherapy trials. We show how to compute power, expected sample size, and expected number of dose-limiting toxicities, as well as the maximum likelihood estimator and exact small sample confidence intervals for the toxicity rate at the therapeutic dose. More flexible designs are briefly discussed.","['Division of Biostatistics, Moores UCSD Cancer Center, University of California, La Jolla, CA 92093-0901, USA. kmesser@ucsd.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence rates and 95% confidence intervals of osteosarcoma for all races and both sexes are 4.0 (3.5-4.6) for the range 0-14 years and 5.0 (4.6-5.6) for the range 0-19 years per year per million persons. Among childhood cancers, osteosarcoma occurs eighth in general incidence and in the following order: leukemia (30%), brain and other nervous system cancers (22.3%), neuroblastoma (7.3%), Wilms tumor (5.6%), Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (4.5%), rhabdomyosarcoma (3.1%), retinoblastoma (2.8%), osteosarcoma (2.4%), and Ewing sarcoma (1.4%). The incidence rates of childhood and adolescent osteosarcoma with 95% confidence intervals areas follows: Blacks, 6.8/year/million; Hispanics, 6.5/year/million; and Caucasians, 4.6/year/million. Osteosarcoma has a bimodal age distribution, having the first peak during adolescence and the second peak in older adulthood. The first peak is in the 10-14-year-old age group, coinciding with the pubertal growth spurt. This suggests a close relationship between the adolescent growth spurt and osteosarcoma. The second osteosarcoma peak is in adults older than 65 years of age; it is more likely to represent a second malignancy, frequently related to Paget's disease. The incidence of osteosarcoma has always been considered to be higher in males than in females, occurring at a rate of 5.4 per million persons per year in males vs. 4.0 per million in females, with a higher incidence in blacks (6.8 per million persons per year) and Hispanics (6.5 per million), than in whites (4.6 per million). Osteosarcoma commonly occurs in the long bones of the extremities near the metaphyseal growth plates. The most common sites are the femur (42%, with 75% of tumors in the distal femur), the tibia (19%, with 80% of tumors in the proximal tibia), and the humerus (10%, with 90% of tumors in the proximal humerus). Other likely locations are the skull or jaw (8%) and the pelvis (8%). Cancer deaths due to bone and joint malignant neoplasms represent 8.9% of all childhood and adolescent cancer deaths. Death rates for osteosarcoma have been declining by about 1.3% per year. The overall 5-year survival rate for osteosarcoma is 68%, without significant gender difference. The age of the patient is correlated with the survival, with the poorest survival among older patients. Complete surgical excision is important to ensure an optimum outcome.

A-MuLV specifically transforms murine B cell precursors both in vivo and in vitro. Inhibition of v-Abl by addition of the small molecule inhibitor STI-571 causes these cells to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle prior to undergoing apoptosis. We found that inhibition of v-Abl activity results in upregulation of transcription of the pro-apoptotic TNF-family ligand tumor-necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Similarly to BCR-Abl-transformed human cells, activation of the transcription factor Foxo3a led to increased TRAIL transcription and induction of a G1 arrest in the absence of v-Abl inhibition, and this effect could be inhibited by the expression of a constitutively active AKT mutant. Multiple pathways act to inhibit FoxO3a activity within Abelson cells. In addition to diminishing transcription factor activity via inhibitory phosphorylation by AKT family members, we found that inhibition of IKKbeta activity results in an increase in the total protein level of FoxO3a. Furthermore overexpression of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB results in an increase in TRAIL transcription and in apoptosis and deletion of IKKalpha and beta diminishes TRAIL expression and induction. We conclude that in Abelson cells, the inhibition of both NF-kappaB and FoxO3a activity is required for suppression of TRAIL transcription and maintenance of the transformed state.","['Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.']",20100304,,,,"['R01 AI057487/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI057487-05/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI57487/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS179712'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonadherence can reduce treatment efficacy, which places the patient at higher risk of relapse, adverse effects, and poor outcomes. DESIGN: A review of the English-speaking literature between 1980 and 2008 was conducted to identify relevant publications, which were supplemented by reference and author searches. RESULTS: Definition and measurement of adherence varies. Most studies have not clearly delineated an AYA age group (ie, 15-25 years) and have been dominated by leukemia and lymphoma samples. Estimates for nonadherence in this population range from 27% to 60%, with openness of family relationships and support found to predict adherence. Strategies to avoid, assess, and manage nonadherence are presented. CONCLUSION: Overall, the evidence base for adherence and strategies to promote it in AYAs with cancer is woefully lacking. There is a need for high-quality studies that target clinically important questions, randomized controlled trials of theoretically based interventions, and development and evaluation of training programs for oncology staff in the special issues faced by AYAs with cancer.","['Centre for Medical Psychology and Evidence-Based Decision-Making, Research Group, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. phyllisb@psych.usyd.edu.au']",20100308,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is generally not offered because of concerns of excess morbidity and mortality. Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens allow increased use of allogeneic HCT for older patients. To define prognostic factors impacting long-term outcomes of RIC regimens in patients older than age 40 years with AML in first complete remission or MDS and to determine the impact of age, we analyzed data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR). PATIENTS AND METHODS We reviewed data reported to the CIBMTR (1995 to 2005) on 1,080 patients undergoing RIC HCT. Outcomes analyzed included neutrophil recovery, incidence of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS Univariate analyses demonstrated no age group differences in NRM, grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, or relapse. Patients age 40 to 54, 55 to 59, 60 to 64, and > or = 65 years had 2-year survival rates as follows: 44% (95% CI, 37% to 52%), 50% (95% CI, 41% to 59%), 34% (95% CI, 25% to 43%), and 36% (95% CI, 24% to 49%), respectively, for patients with AML (P = .06); and 42% (95% CI, 35% to 49%), 35% (95% CI, 27% to 43%), 45% (95% CI, 36% to 54%), and 38% (95% CI, 25% to 51%), respectively, for patients with MDS (P = .37). Multivariate analysis revealed no significant impact of age on NRM, relapse, DFS, or OS (all P > .3). Greater HLA disparity adversely affected 2-year NRM, DFS, and OS. Unfavorable cytogenetics adversely impacted relapse, DFS, and OS. Better pre-HCT performance status predicted improved 2-year OS. CONCLUSION With these similar outcomes observed in older patients, we conclude that older age alone should not be considered a contraindication to HCT.","['DO, University of Minnesota, Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, MMC 480, 420 Delaware St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. bmcclune@umn.edu']",20100308,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS In the phase I part of the study, 10 patients with relapsed AML were treated with escalating doses of sorafenib with chemotherapy to establish the feasibility of the combination. We then treated 51 patients (median age, 53 years; range, 18 to 65 years) who had previously untreated AML with cytarabine at 1.5 g/m(2) by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion daily for 4 days (3 days if > 60 years of age), idarubicin at 12 mg/m(2) IV daily for 3 days, and sorafenib at 400 mg orally twice daily for 7 days. RESULTS Overall, 38 (75%) patients have achieved a complete remission (CR), including 14 (93%) of 15 patients with mutated FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3; the 15th patient had complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp]) and 24 (66%) of 36 patients with FLT3 wild-type (WT) disease (three additional FLT3-WT patients had CRp). FLT3-mutated patients were more likely to achieve a CR than FLT3-WT patients (P = .033). With a median follow-up of 54 weeks (range, 8 to 87 weeks), the probability of survival at 1 year is 74%. Among the FLT3-mutated patients, 10 have relapsed and five remain in CR with a median follow-up of 62 weeks (range, 10 to 76 weeks). Plasma inhibitory assay demonstrated an on-target effect on FLT3 kinase activity. CONCLUSION Sorafenib can be safely combined with chemotherapy, produces a high CR rate in FLT3-mutated patients, and inhibits FLT3 signaling.","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030, USA. fravandi@mdanderson.org']",20100308,,,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA128864/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA128864-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS Between October 1, 2000, and December 31, 2007, 635 patients with low-risk ALL were enrolled onto Brazilian Childhood Cooperative Group for ALL Treatment (GBTLI) ALL-99 protocol. Eligible children (n = 544) were randomly allocated to receive either continuous 6-MP/MTX (group 1, n = 272) or intermittent 6-MP (100 mg/m(2)/d for 10 days, with 11 days resting) and MTX (200 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks; group 2, n = 272). RESULTS The 5-year overall survival (OS) and EFS were 92.5% +/- 1.5% SE and 83.6% +/- 2.1% SE, respectively. According to maintenance regimen, the OS was 91.4% +/- 2.2% SE (group 1) and 93.6% +/- 2.1% SE (group 2; P = .28) and EFS 80.9% +/- 3.2% SE (group 1) and 86.5% +/- 2.8% SE (group 2; P = .089). Remarkably, the intermittent regimen led to significantly higher EFS among boys (85.7% v 74.9% SE; P = .027), while no difference was seen for girls (87.0% v 88.8% SE; P = .78). Toxic episodes were recorded in 226 and 237 children, respectively. Grade 3 to 4 toxic events for groups 1 and 2 were, respectively, 273 and 166 for hepatic dysfunction (P = .002), and 772 and 636 for hematologic episodes (P = .005).

We conducted a randomized phase III trial to compare efficacy and safety of cladribine and fludarabine, each combined with cyclophosphamide, in previously untreated progressive CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients received cladribine at 0.12 mg/kg combined with cyclophosphamide at 250 mg/m(2) for 3 days intravenously (CC regimen) or fludarabine at 25 mg/m(2) combined with cyclophosphamide at 250 mg/m(2) for 3 days intravenously (FC regimen), every 28 days for up to six cycles. The primary end point was complete response (CR) rate. Secondary end points included overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and treatment-related toxicity. RESULTS Of 423 randomly assigned patients (211 to CC and 212 to FC), 395 were evaluated in the final analysis. The CR and ORR reached 47% and 88% in the CC arm and 46% and 82% in the FC arm (P = .25 and P = .11, respectively). The median PFS was 2.34 years with CC and 2.27 years with FC (P = .51). OS and grade 3/4 treatment-related toxicity were also comparable. Moreover, we did not observe any significant differences in CC and FC efficacy across different patient prognostic subgroups that included patients with 17p13 (TP53 gene) deletion who had poor survival in both study arms. CONCLUSION Cladribine and fludarabine in combination with cyclophosphamide are equally effective and safe first-line regimens for progressive CLL. Both combinations have unsatisfactory activity in patients with 17p13 (TP53 gene) deletion.","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Copernicus Memorial Hospital, 93-510 Lodz, ul.

We studied the long-term outcomes of CML patients in first chronic phase who receive an allogeneic HCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS Our study included 2,444 patients who received myeloablative HCT for CML in first chronic phase between 1978 and 1998 and survived in continuous complete remission for at least 5 years (median follow-up, 11 years; range, 5 to 25 years). Donor sources were human leukocyte antigen-matched siblings in 1,692 patients, unrelated donors in 639 patients, and other related donors in 113 patients. RESULTS Overall survival rates at 15 years were 88% (95% CI, 86% to 90%) for sibling HCT and 87% (95% CI, 83% to 90%) for unrelated donor HCT. Corresponding cumulative incidences of relapse were 8% (95% CI, 7% to 10%) and 2% (95% CI, 1% to 4%), respectively. The latest relapse was reported 18 years post-HCT. In multivariable analyses, history of chronic graft-versus-host disease increased risks of late overall mortality and nonrelapse mortality but reduced risks of relapse. In comparison with age-, race-, and sex-adjusted normal populations, the mortality of HCT recipients was significantly higher until 14 years post-HCT; thereafter, mortality rates were similar to those of the general population (relative mortality ratio at 15 years, 2.3; 95% CI, 0 to 4.9). CONCLUSION Recipients of allogeneic HCT for CML in first chronic phase who remain in remission for at least 5 years have favorable subsequent long-term survival, and their mortality rates eventually approach those of the general population.","['Imperial College at Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom.']",20100308,,,,"['U01 HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutation-induced changes at the C-terminal domain of NPM1 (Cter-NPM1) compromise its stability and cause the aberrant translocation of NPM1 to the cytosol. Hence, this protein represents a suitable candidate to investigate the relations between folding and disease. Since Cter-NPM1 folds via a compact denatured state, stabilization of the folded state of the mutated variants demands detailed structural information on both the native and denatured states. Here, we present the characterization of the complete folding pathway of Cter-NPM1 and provide molecular details for both the transition and the denatured states. The structure of the transition state was assessed by Phi-value analysis, whereas residual structure in the denatured state was mapped by evaluating the effect of mutations as modulated by conditions promoting denatured state compaction. Data reveal that folding of Cter-NPM1 proceeds via an extended nucleus and that the denatured state retains significant malleable structure at the interface between the second and third helices. Our observations constitute the essential prerequisite for structure-based drug-design studies, aimed at identifying molecules that may rescue pathological NPM1 mutants by stabilizing the native-like state.","['Istituto Pasteur-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti and Istituto di Biologia e Patologia Molecolari del Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Dipartimento di Scienze Biochimiche A.

One class of eIF4E regulators, including eIF4G and the 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs), interact with eIF4E using a conserved YXXXXLPhi-binding site. The structural basis of this interaction and its regulation are well established. Really Interesting New Gene (RING) domain containing proteins, such as the promyelocytic leukemia protein PML and the arenaviral protein Z, represent a second class of eIF4E regulators that inhibit eIF4E function by decreasing eIF4E's affinity for its m(7)G cap ligand. To elucidate the structural basis of this inhibition, we determined the structure of Z and studied the Z-eIF4E complex using NMR methods. We show that Z interacts with eIF4E via a novel binding site, which has no homology with that of eIF4G or the 4E-BPs, and is different from the RING recognition site used in the ubiquitin system. Z and eIF4G interact with distinct parts of eIF4E and differentially alter the conformation of the m(7)G cap-binding site. Our results provide a molecular basis for how PML and Z RINGs reduce the affinity of eIF4E for the m(7)G cap and thereby act as key inhibitors of eIF4E function.

However, a major challenge with ABMT for patients with hematologic malignancies is disease relapse, mainly due to either contamination with cancerous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) within the autograft or the persistence of residual therapy-resistant disease niches within the patient. Oncolytic viruses represent a promising therapeutic approach to prevent cancer relapse by eliminating tumor-initiating cells that contaminate the autograft. Here we summarize an ex vivo ""purging"" strategy with oncolytic Myxoma virus (MYXV) to remove cancer-initiating cells from patient autografts prior to transplantation. MYXV, a novel oncolytic poxvirus with potent anti-cancer properties in a variety of in vivo tumor models, can specifically eliminate cancerous stem and progenitor cells from samples obtained from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients, while sparing normal CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells capable of rescuing hematopoiesis following high dose conditioning. We propose that a broader subset of patients with intractable hematologic malignancies who have failed standard therapy could become eligible for ABMT when the treatment schema is coupled with ex vivo oncolytic therapy.","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.']",20100307,,,76,"['R01 AI080607/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI080607-01A1/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA138541/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS181384'],,,['2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Little is known about the host defense against M. kansasii and its intracellular survival strategy inside macrophages. In the present study, we obtained six clinical isolates from patients with M. kansasii pulmonary disease and investigated the intracellular growth and cytotoxic effects of M. kansasii inside mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) as well as cytokine secretion from BMDM. Interestingly, two isolates, SM-1 and 2693-20, displayed faster growth rates and higher levels of TNF-alpha secretion from macrophages when compared to the other strains. In addition, SM-1 and 2693-20 also induced massive cell death in BMDM and THP-1 acute monocytic leukemia cells, while the slow growing strains induced significantly lower levels of cell death. This cytotoxicity was mainly caused by necrosis, not apoptosis and it was TNF-alpha-independent. Caspase inhibitors failed to block M. kansasii-induced macrophage death. In addition, necrosis caused by the fast growing strains was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)). When dissipation of DeltaPsi(m) was inhibited by the classical mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA), macrophage necrosis was reduced. These results suggest that clinical isolates of M. kansasii that grow faster in macrophages induce higher levels of necrosis in a DeltaPsi(m) loss-dependent manner.","['Department of Microbiology, College of Medicine, Chungnam National University, 6 Munwha-Dong, Jung-Ku, Daejeon 301-747, Republic of Korea. hsmy1558@hanmail.net']",20100306,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Since Nrf2 is associated with elevation of antioxidant defenses in general, and since GVT suppresses ts1-induced neurodegeneration, our aim in this study was to determine whether GVT neuroprotection is linked to Nrf2 upregulation in the brain. We report here that GVT upregulates the levels of Nrf2, both in primary astrocyte cultures and in brainstem of ts1-infected mice. Significant upregulation of Nrf2 expression by GVT occurs in both the cytosolic and nuclear fractions of cultured astrocytes and brainstem cells. Notably, although GVT treatment increases Nrf2 protein levels in cultured astrocytes and brainstem tissues, Nrf2 mRNA levels are not altered. This suggests that the neuroprotective effects of GVT may be mediated by the stabilization of the Nrf2 protein, allowing continuous upregulation of Nrf2 levels in the astrocytes.","['Department of Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Science Park-Research Division, Smithville, TX 78957, USA.']",20100306,,,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'MH071583/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH071583/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'NS043984/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES007784/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES07784/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS043984/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS186913'],,,['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Usually, its expression is investigated by flow cytometric protocols in which the percentage of ZAP-70 positive CLL cells is determined in respect to isotypic control (ISO-method) or residual ZAP-70 positive T cells (T-method). These methods, however, beside suffering of an inherent subjectivity in their application, may give discordant results in some cases. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic significance of these methods in comparison with another in which ZAP-70 expression was evaluated as a Mean-Fluorescence-Intensity Ratio between gated T and CLL cells (T/B Ratio-method). METHODS: Cytometric files relative to ZAP-70 determination according to the three readouts were retrospectively reviewed on a cohort of 173 patients (test set), all with complete clinical and biological prognostic assessment and time-to-treatment (TTT) available. Findings were then validated in an independent cohort of 341 cases from a different institution (validation set). RESULTS: The optimal prognostic cut-offs for ZAP-70 expression were selected at 11% (ISO-method) or 20% of positive cells (T-method), as well as at 3.0 (T/B Ratio-method) in the test set; these cut-offs yielded 66, 60 and 73 ZAP-70+ cases, respectively. Univariate analyses resulted in a better separation of ZAP-70+ vs. ZAP-70- CLL patients utilizing the T/B Ratio, compared to T- or ISO-methods. In multivariate analyses which included the major clinical and biological prognostic markers for CLL, the prognostic impact of ZAP-70 appeared stronger when the T/B-Ratio method was applied. These findings were confirmed in the validation set, in which ZAP-70 expression, evaluated by the T- (cut-off = 20%) or T/B Ratio- (cut-off = 3.0) methods, yielded 180 or 127 ZAP-70+ cases, respectively. ZAP-70+ patients according to the T/B Ratio-method had shorter TTT, both if compared to ZAP-70- CLL, and to cases classified ZAP-70+ by the T-method only. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest to evaluate ZAP-70 expression in routine settings using the T/B Ratio-method, given the operator and laboratory independent feature of this approach. We propose the 3.0 T/B Ratio value as optimal cut-off to discriminate ZAP-70+ (T/B Ratio less than 3.0) from ZAP-70- (T/B Ratio more/equal than 3.0) cases.","['Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.']",20100308,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is well know that leukemias with specific molecular abnormalities display profoundly different global gene expression profiles. However, it is largely unknown whether such subtype-specific leukemic signatures are unique or if they are active also in non-hematopoietic normal tissues or in other human cancer types. METHODS: Using gene set enrichment analysis, we systematically explored whether the transcriptional programs in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and myeloid leukemia (AML) were significantly similar to those in different flow-sorted subpopulations of normal hematopoietic cells (n = 8), normal non-hematopoietic tissues (n = 22) or human cancer tissues (n = 13). RESULTS: This study revealed that e.g., the t(12;21) [ETV6-RUNX1] subtype of ALL and the t(15;17) [PML-RARA] subtype of AML had transcriptional programs similar to those in normal Pro-B cells and promyelocytes, respectively. Moreover, the 11q23/MLL subtype of ALL showed similarities with non-hematopoietic tissues. Strikingly however, most of the transcriptional programs in the other leukemic subtypes lacked significant similarity to approximately 100 gene sets derived from normal and malignant tissues. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates, for the first time, that the expression profiles of childhood leukemia are largely unique, with limited similarities to transcriptional programs active in normal hematopoietic cells, non-hematopoietic normal tissues or the most common forms of human cancer. In addition to providing important pathogenetic insights, these findings should facilitate the identification of candidate genes or transcriptional programs that can be used as unique targets in leukemia.","['Section of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. anna.andersson@med.lu.se']",20100308,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib has revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, and trastuzumab, the humanized monoclonal antibody against the ERBB2 receptor tyrosine kinase, has proved to have a high efficacy in 25% of breast cancers. On the basis of treatment success it is expected that targeted therapies will spread its use in the future. Recent data has shown that some of these therapies are associated with certain cardiotoxicity ranging from asymptomatic mild left ventricular dysfunction to congestive heart failure through different mechanisms. However, rates of cardiotoxicity associated with TKI are not well known mainly because clinical trials usually do not include predefined cardiac endpoints or the assessment of left ventricular function before and during treatment. In addition, it is especially difficult to diagnose heart failure in patients with some kinds of cancer who have many reasons to develop dyspnoea. Here we summarize what is known up to date about the cardiotoxicity of drugs targeting the tyrosine kinases. Being aware of the risk of using these drugs is particularly important to early detect and institute the appropriate treatment to prevent irreversible myocardial injury, especially when some neoplastic diseases, as haematological or breast cancers, can affect to young people with an estimated long-term survival.","[""Cardiology Department, Thorax Institute, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Villaroel 170, Barcelona, Spain.""]",,,,50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pig epiblast stem cell lines (pEpiSC) were established on mouse feeder layers and medium supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). pEpiSC express the core pluripotency factors OCT4 (or POU5F1), NANOG, SOX2, and NODAL, but they do not express REX1 or alkaline phosphatase activity. Blocking leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)/JAK/STAT3 pathway by adding the specific JAK I inhibitor 420099 and an anti-LIF antibody over 3 passages did not affect pluripotency of pEpiSC. In contrast, cells grown with the Alk-5 inhibitor SB431542, which blocks Activin/Nodal pathway, differentiated readily toward the neural lineage. pEpiSC are pluripotent, as established by their differentiation potential to ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. These cells can be induced to differentiate toward trophectoderm and to germ cell precursors in response to bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4). In conclusion, our study demonstrates that pig epiblasts express the core pluripotency genes and that the capacity for maintaining self-renewal in pEpiSC depends on Activin/Nodal signaling. This study provides further evidence that maintenance of pluripotency via Activin/Nodal signal is conserved in mammals.","['Division of Animal Sciences, School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, Loughborough, United Kingdom. ramiro.alberio@nottingham.ac.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several reports have suggested mechanisms for the deregulated Wnt signaling and beta-catenin stabilization observed in CML. One possible mechanism for beta-catenin stabilization could be the acquisition of mutations at its N-terminal domain, especially in the third exon where it is marked via phosphorylation for degradation. We sought to determine whether mutations in the third exon of the beta-catenin gene are responsible for the observed Wnt activation in CML. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We screened bone marrow specimens from 33 patients with CML in the chronic phase and also examined the K562 cell line for beta-catenin mutations. RESULTS: None of the patients nor the K562 cell line were found to carry mutations. CONCLUSION: Beta-catenin amino-terminal mutations are not observed or very rare and therefore are not the underlying mechanism of activated Wnt signaling in CML.","['Department of Medical Biology and Genetics, Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As MDR1-mediated efflux of chemotherapeutic agents from leukemic blasts may contribute to drug resistance, a phase 1 study of valspodar combined with mitoxantrone and etoposide in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory leukemias was performed. PROCEDURE: Patients received a valspodar-loading dose (2 mg/kg) followed by a 5-day continuous valspodar infusion (8, 10, 12.5, or 15 mg/kg/day) combined with lower than standard doses of mitoxantrone and etoposide. The valspodar dose was escalated using a standard 3 + 3 phase I design. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were evaluable for toxicity and 20 for response. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of valspodar was 12.5 mg/kg/day, combined with 50% dose-reduced mitoxantrone and etoposide. The clearance of mitoxantrone and etoposide was decreased by 64% and 60%, respectively, when combined with valspodar. Dose-limiting toxicities included stomatitis, ataxia, and bone marrow aplasia. Three of 11 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) had complete responses while no patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) had an objective response. In vitro studies demonstrated P-glycoprotein expression on the blasts of 5 of 14 patients, although only 1 had inhibition of rhodamine efflux by valspodar.

The goal of the current study was to examine the risk of treatment-associated leukemia and multiple myeloma in patients treated with pelvic radiotherapy. METHODS: Patients with invasive tumors of the vulva, cervix, uterus, anus, and rectosigmoid treated from 1973 to 2005 and recorded in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were analyzed. Patients were stratified based on receipt of pelvic radiotherapy. The incidence of secondary leukemia (except chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and multiple myeloma were examined. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to examine the association between pelvic radiation and the development of subsequent hematologic malignancies. RESULTS: A total of 199,268 individuals, including 66,896 (34%) who received pelvic radiotherapy and 132,372 (66%) not treated with radiation, were identified. In a Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for other risk factors, post-treatment leukemia was increased by 72% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.72; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.37-2.15) in the patients who received pelvic radiotherapy. The risk of secondary leukemia peaked at 5 to 10 years after primary treatment (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.40-2.44) and remained elevated even 10 to 15 years after initial treatment (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.03-2.18). There was no significant association between radiation and the development of multiple myeloma (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.81-1.44).

However, although the prognostic value of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and monocytosis have been documented, little is known about the impact of eosinophils and basophils. METHODS: The authors examined the prognostic significance of eosinophils and basophils in 1008 patients with de novo MDS. Patients were enrolled from 3 centers of the Austrian-German MDS Working Group and were analyzed retrospectively. Blood eosinophils and basophils were quantified by light microscopy, and their impact on survival and leukemia-free survival was calculated by using Cox regression. RESULTS: Eosinophilia (eosinophils >350/microL) and basophilia (basophils >250/microL) predicted a significantly reduced survival (P < .05) without having a significant impact on leukemia-free survival. In multivariate analysis, eosinophilia and basophilia were identified as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-independent prognostic variables with International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)-specific impact. Although elevated LDH was identified as a major prognostic determinant in IPSS low-risk, intermediate-1 risk, and high-risk subgroups, the condition ""eosinophilia and/or basophilia"" was identified as a superior prognostic indicator in the IPSS intermediate-2 risk subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of eosinophils and basophils in patients with MDS was helpful and may complement the spectrum of variables to optimize prognostication in MDS.","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",,,,,,,,,['(c) 2010 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,

Recently, it has been reported that the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors is associated with an increased incidence of pericardial effusions (PEs). To study the characteristics and treatment relationships of PEs in patients with leukemia, the authors retrospectively analyzed a cohort of patients with leukemia evaluated at a single center. METHODS: The authors reviewed 2592 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 1282, 49%), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL, n = 336, 13%), or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, n = 974, 38%), who were evaluated from August 2003 to July 2008. Electronic medical records were reviewed to select patients who had undergone at least 1 echocardiographic evaluation. Data regarding diagnosis, timing, effusion size, survival, and prior therapy were collected for the patients who had echocardiographic evidence of PEs. RESULTS: PEs were detected in 325 (20%) of the patients who had echocardiograms: 21% in AML, 23% in ALL, and 18% in MDS patients. Only a small portion of PEs were detected before the initiation of therapy: 26% in AML, 25% ALL, and 15% in MDS patients. Most PEs were of minimal size (70%) overall. No significant differences in effusion characteristics, including severity, were observed among different types of therapies. The presence of PEs had no impact on the survival of the patients evaluated.

Gene expression profiling studies of patients with AML has provided key insights into disease pathogenesis while exposing potential diagnostic and prognostic markers and therapeutic targets. A systematic comparison of the large body of gene expression profiling studies in AML has the potential to test the extensibility of conclusions based on single studies and provide further insights into AML. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we systematically compared 25 published reports of gene expression profiling in AML. There were a total of 4,918 reported genes of which one third were reported in more than one study. We found that only a minority of reported prognostically-associated genes (9.6%) were replicated in at least one other study. In a combined analysis, we comprehensively identified both gene sets and functional gene categories and pathways that exhibited significant differential regulation in distinct prognostic categories, including many previously unreported associations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We developed a novel approach for granular, cross-study analysis of gene-by-gene data and their relationships with established prognostic features and patient outcome.

AIM: To present an unusual case of the primomanifestation of a multiple myeloma in the form of a focal affection of the central nervous system in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: A female patient diagnosed with chronic B-lymphocytic leukaemia with gradually increasing right-sided cerebellar symptomatology. The CT examination revealed expansion of the cranial vault with significant compression of brain structures. The tumour was extirpated and the histological examination led to a diagnosis of a plasmocytic myeloma. A thorough examination confirmed the diagnosis of multiple myeloma with significant osteolytic involvement of the skeleton. A combined chemo- and radiotherapy resulted in adjustment in the focal neurological finding, and a partial remission of the multiple myeloma was achieved. CONCLUSION: The above presented case describes two very unusual states: the primomanifestation of a multiple myeloma in form of a focal affection of the central nervous system, and the coincidence of a multiple myeloma as the second haematological malignancy in a patient with chronic B-lymphocytic leukaemia.","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital and Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic. tomas.pika@seznam.cz']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This process is disturbed in hematological malignancies that typically show incomplete differentiation but often also display a mixed lineage phenotype. Co-expression of lymphoid and myeloid molecules is a well-known feature of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) with t(8;21). These cells consistently express the B-cell-specific transcription factor PAX5, and the B-cell-specific cell surface protein CD19. However, the functional consequences of PAX5 expression are unknown. To address this question, we studied the chromatin features of CD19, which is a direct target of PAX5 in cells with and without the t(8;21) chromosomal translocation. We show that CD19 chromatin exists in a poised configuration in myeloid progenitors and that this poised chromatin structure facilitates PAX5-dependent CD19 activation. Our results also show a positive correlation between PAX5 and CD19 expression in t(8;21)-positive AML cells and demonstrate that PAX5 binds to the promoter and enhancer of CD19 gene and remodels chromatin structure at the promoter. This study shows that expression of PAX5 in leukemic cells has functional consequences and points to an important role of a progenitor-specific chromatin configuration in myeloid leukemia.","[""Section of Experimental Haematology, Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine, St James's University Hospital, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.""]",20100308,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: To define the relevance of pTalpha in human T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we analyzed in T-ALL cell lines (n=14) pTalpha and p56(Lck) mRNA and protein expression as also the tyrosine-phosphorylation. The p56(Lck) specific src-protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (PTK-I) PP1 was used in growth inhibition assays. IC(50) value determination, cell cycle- and apoptosis analyses were performed in T-ALL-, non-T-ALL- and murine transgenic cell lines. RESULTS: pTalpha expression patterns were markedly different in T-ALL cell lines as compared to those reported for normal lymphoid counterparts. PP1 induced in 6/11 T-ALL cell lines a survival disadvantage resulting from a cell cycle arrest in the G(1/0) phase in thymic lymphoblastic cells and apoptosis induction in the immature cell line HSB-2, respectively. PP1 sensitive cell lines expressed the target protein p56(Lck) and showed a corresponding P-Tyr signal. CONCLUSION: Sensitivity of thymic T-ALLs to PP1 clearly underlines the impact of pTalpha mediated proliferation in this leukemic sub-type. In addition, p56(Lck) represents also independently of pTalpha a promising therapeutical target for the src-kinase inhibitors in neoplastic lymphoid diseases.","['Clinic of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Staphylococcal superantigen-like 5 (SSL5) was recently described to bind P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) on leukocytes and to inhibit neutrophil rolling on a P-selectin surface. As leukocytes and tumor cells share many characteristics in migration and dissemination, we explored the potential of SSL5 as an antagonist of malignant cell behavior. Previously, it was demonstrated that rolling of human HL-60 leukemia cells on activated endothelial cells was mediated by P-selectin. In this study, we show that SSL5 targets HL-60 cells. Binding of SSL5 was rapid and without observed toxicity. Competition of SSL5 with the binding of three anti-PSGL-1 antibodies and P-selectin to HL-60 cells identified PSGL-1 as the ligand on HL-60 cells. Presence of sialyl Lewis x epitopes on PSGL-1 was crucial for its interaction with SSL5. Importantly, SSL5 not only inhibited the interaction of HL-60 cells with activated endothelial cells but also with platelets, which both play an important role in growth and metastasis of cancers. These data support the concept that SSL5 could be a lead in the search for novel strategies against hematological malignancies.","['Department of Medical Oncology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, CXCL13, PD-1 and SAP were described as useful markers for T(FH) cells and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma but also reported in some peripheral T-cell lymphomas, not otherwise specified. DESIGN AND METHODS: In the present study the expression pattern of ICOS protein was investigated by immunohistochemistry-based techniques in routine sections of normal lymphoid tissues and 633 human lymphomas. RESULTS: Cells strongly positive for ICOS were restricted to the light zone of germinal centers and co-expressed T(FH)-associated molecules. In addition, weak to moderate ICOS expression was observed in a small proportion of FOXP3-positive cells. In lymphomas, ICOS expression was confined to angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (85/86), peripheral T-cell lymphomas of follicular variant (18/18) and a proportion of peripheral T-cell lymphomas, not otherwise specified (24/56) that also expressed other T(FH)-associated molecules. CONCLUSIONS: ICOS is a useful molecule for identifying T(FH) cells and its restricted expression to angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and a proportion of peripheral T-cell lymphomas, not otherwise specified (showing a T(FH)-like profile) suggests its inclusion in the antibody panel for diagnosing T(FH)-derived lymphomas. Our findings provide further evidence that the histological spectrum of T(FH)-derived lymphomas is broader than previously assumed.","['Leukaemia Research Immunodiagnostics Unit, Nuffield Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK. teresa@marafioti.org.uk']",,,,,,,['Haematologica. 2010 Mar;95(3):356-8.

We, therefore, evaluated specific BCR-ABL small interfering RNA silencing in BCR-ABL-positive cell lines, including those resistant to imatinib and particularly those with the T315I mutation. DESIGN AND METHODS: The factor-independent 32Dp210 BCR-ABL oligoclonal cell lines and human imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL-positive cells from patients with leukemic disorders were investigated. The effects of BCR-ABL small interfering RNA or the combination of BCR-ABL small interfering RNA with imatinib and nilotinib were compared with those of the ABL inhibitors imatinib and nilotinib. RESULTS: Co-administration of BCR-ABL small interfering RNA with imatinib or nilotinib dramatically reduced BCR-ABL expression in wild-type and mutated BCR-ABL cells and increased the lethal capacity. BCR-ABL small interfering RNA significantly induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation in wild-type (P<0.0001) and mutated cells (H396P, T315I, P<0.0001) versus controls. Co-treatment with BCR-ABL small interfering RNA and imatinib or nilotinib resulted in increased inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis in T315I cells as compared to imatinib or nilotinib alone (P<0.0001). Furthermore, the combination of BCR-ABL small interfering RNA with imatinib or nilotinib significantly (P<0.01) reversed multidrug resistance-1 gene-dependent resistance of mutated cells. In T315I cells BCR-ABL small interfering RNA with nilotinib had powerful effects on cell cycle distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that silencing by BCR-ABL small interfering RNA combined with imatinib or nilotinib may be associated with an additive antileukemic activity against tyrosine kinase inhibitor-sensitive and resistant BCR-ABL cells, and might be an alternative approach to overcome BCR-ABL mutations.","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital of Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstr. 55 45122 Essen, Germany. michael.koldehoff@uk-essen.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods for detecting such molecular changes in lung cancer tumors are desirable. METHODS: We used a nanofluidic digital PCR array platform and 16 cell lines and 20 samples of genomic DNA from resected tumors (stages I-III) to quantify the relative numbers of copies of the EGFR gene and to detect mutated EGFR alleles in lung cancer. We assessed the relative number of EGFR gene copies by calculating the ratio of the number of EGFR molecules (measured with a 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled Scorpion assay) to the number of molecules of the single-copy gene RPP30 (ribonuclease P/MRP 30kDa subunit) (measured with a 6-carboxy-X-rhodamine-labeled TaqMan assay) in each panel. To assay for the EGFR L858R (exon 21) mutation and exon 19 in-frame deletions, we used the ARMS and Scorpion technologies in a DxS/Qiagen EGFR29 Mutation Test Kit for the digital PCR array. RESULTS: The digital array detected and quantified rare gefitinib/erlotinib-sensitizing EGFR mutations (0.02%-9.26% abundance) that were present in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples of early-stage resectable lung tumors without an associated increase in gene copy number. Our results also demonstrated the presence of intratumor molecular heterogeneity for the clinically relevant EGFR mutated alleles in these early-stage lung tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The digital PCR array platform allows characterization and quantification of oncogenes, such as EGFR, at the single-molecule level. Use of this nanofluidics platform may provide deeper insight into the specific roles of clinically relevant kinase mutations during different stages of lung tumor progression and may be useful in predicting the clinical response to EGFR-targeted inhibitors.","['Fluidigm Corporation, South San Francisco, CA, USA.']",20100305,,,,['5K08CA102545-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorescent in situ hybridization with a panel of probes coupled with long distance inverse-PCR was used to identify chromosomal rearrangements involving the MLL gene. Seven unusual chromosomal rearrangements were identified, including two complex translocations, three insertions of material of chromosome 11 in another chromosome and one insertion of chromosome material into the MLL gene. Conventional cytogenetics showed three patients to have a deletion of 11q; one had an unexpected t(6;11)(q27;q23) whereas the other two patients had also an insertion of MLL material in another chromosome. Concurrent 3' deletion in the MLL rearrangement was observed in two patients.

We hypothesized that the rare Runx1c isoform has a distinct role in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have characterized the expression pattern of Runx1c in mouse embryos and human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived embryoid bodies using in situ hybridization and expression levels in mouse and human HSCs by real-time polymerase chain reaction. We then determined the functional effects of Runx1c using enforced retroviral overexpression in mouse HSCs. RESULTS: We observed differential expression profiles of RUNX1 isoforms during hematopoietic differentiation of hESCs. The RUNX1a and RUNX1b isoforms were expressed consistently throughout hematopoietic differentiation, whereas the RUNX1c isoform was only expressed at the time of emergence of definitive HSCs. RUNX1c was also expressed in the AGM region of E10.5 to E11.5 mouse embryos, the region where definitive HSCs arise. These observations suggested that the RUNX1c isoform may be important for the specification or function of definitive HSCs. However, using retroviral overexpression to study the effect of RUNX1 isoforms on HSCs in a gain-of-function system, no discernable functional difference could be identified between RUNX1 isoforms in mouse HSCs. Overexpression of both RUNX1b and RUNX1c induced quiescence in mouse HSCs in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Although the divergent expression profiles of Runx1 isoforms during development suggest specific roles for these proteins at different stages of HSC maturation, we could not detect an important functional distinction in adult mouse HSCs using our assay systems.","['Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Tex. 77030, USA.']",20100303,,,,"['T32 HL092332-06/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL096360/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK075355/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK58192/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EB005173/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL092332/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EB005173-05/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK075355/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'EB005173/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK058192-09/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HL081007/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK058192/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL081007/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HL081007-05/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK075355-04/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS184386'],,,"['2010 ISEH-Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

The pro-apoptotic PBOX compounds are a recently developed novel series of microtubule targeting agents (MTAs) that depolymerise tubulin. Recent data demonstrating enhanced MTA-induced tumour cell apoptosis upon combination with the cyclin dependent kinase (CDK)-1 inhibitor flavopiridol prompted us to examine whether this compound could similarly enhance the effect of the PBOX compounds. We thus characterised the apoptotic and cell cycle events associated with combination therapy of the PBOX compounds and flavopiridol and results showed a sequence dependent, synergistic enhancement of apoptosis in CML cells including those expressing the imatinib-resistant T315I mutant. Flavopiridol reduced the number of polyploid cells formed in response to PBOX treatment but only to a small extent, suggesting that inhibition of endoreplication was unlikely to play a major role in the mechanism by which flavopiridol synergistically enhanced PBOX-induced apoptosis. The addition of flavopiridol following PBOX-6 treatment did however result in an accelerated exit from the G2/M transition accompanied by an enhanced downregulation and deactivation of the CDK1/cyclin B1 complex and an enhanced degradation of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) survivin. In conclusion, results from this study highlight the potential of these novel series of PBOX compounds, alone or in sequential combination with flavopiridol, as an effective therapy against CML.","['School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland.']",20100303,,,,,,,,['(c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs) are involved in the regulation of apoptosis, antiviral responses, the DNA damage response and chromatin structure, but their precise biochemical function in these nuclear pathways is unknown. One strategy to tackle this problem is to assess the biophysical properties of the component parts of these macromolecular assemblies in living cells. In this study we determined PML NB assembly dynamics by live cell imaging, combined with mathematical modeling. For the first time, dynamics of PML body formation were measured in cells lacking endogenous PML. We show that all six human nuclear PML isoforms are able to form nuclear bodies in PML negative cells. All isoforms exhibit individual exchange rates at NBs in PML positive cells but PML I, II, III and IV are static at nuclear bodies in PML negative cells, suggesting that these isoforms require additional protein partners for efficient exchange. PML V turns over at PML Nbs very slowly supporting the idea of a structural function for this isoform. We also demonstrate that SUMOylation of PML at Lysine positions K160 and/or K490 are required for nuclear body formation in vivo.We propose a model in which the isoform specific residence times of PML provide both, structural stability to function as a scaffold and flexibility to attract specific nuclear proteins for efficient biochemical reactions at the surface of nuclear bodies.MCS code: 92C37.","['Leibniz-Institute of Age Research, Fritz-Lipman-Institute, Beutenbergstr, 11, 07745 Jena, Germany. phemmer@fli-leibniz.de.']",20100305,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All children were vaccinated with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. Hemagglutinin-inhibition (HI) antibody titers were determined in sera of both patient and control groups just before and 4 weeks after vaccination. The ability of each group to mount a protective (> or =40) and/or fourfold titer was measured. RESULTS: The protective response for virus subunits among patients and healthy controls were 43.4% versus 88% for H1N1 (P = 0.04), 63.3% versus 80% for H3N2 antigens (P = 0.06), and 26% versus 73% for B antigen (P = 0.001). Responses for H1N1 and B subunits were significantly lower in patients than controls. In the patient group, the significant response to each virus was demonstrated in the analysis of pre- and post-vaccination geometric mean titer (GMT) (P = 0.001). The percentage of patients and controls with fourfold increase in HI titers were 56.2% versus 80% for H1N1 (P = 0.04), 40.6% versus 53.3% for H3N2 (P = 0.31), and 59.4% versus 83.3% for B (P = 0.038).

PROCEDURE: Twelve patients with acute lymphoblastic or myeloblastic leukemia were given a 14-day remission induction therapy. Clofarabine was administered at a dose of 30 or 40 mg/m(2)/day over 2 hr for five consecutive days in six patients each. Patients who achieved a remission proceeded to a stem cell transplant (HSCT). A second cycle could be administered prior to HSCT. RESULTS: Of the six patients at the 30 mg/m(2) clofarabine dose, two achieved a complete response (CR) and one a PR and proceeded to BMT. Three patients had progressive disease. Five of the six patients at the 40 mg/m(2) achieved a CR. Four proceeded to HSCT, and one relapsed prior to HSCT. One patient died on day 45 with marrow hypoplasia without evidence of leukemia. Hematologic and infectious adverse events were universal. The one dose limiting non-infectious toxicity observed was prolonged marrow hypoplasia. CONCLUSION: TVTC has significant anti-leukemic activity in both acute lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemia. The MTD of clofarabine is 40 mg/m(2)/day in this combination. This is the recommended dose for the phase II study in patients with refractory or relapsed leukemia, a population which has limited therapeutic options.","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. steinhep@mskcc.org']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine this hypothesis, we attempted to establish a method to follow the global flux of (13)C-glucose in the cells using metabolomic approaches with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The human monoblastic leukemia cell line U937 was exposed to the CO-releasing molecule (CORM).

The distribution of MDR1 1236, 2677, or 3435 genotypes was significantly different between the resistance patients and sensitivity patients. The resistance incidence correlated with the number of T alleles at locus 1236 and 3435. Resistance was higher for patients homozygous for the 1236T allele when compared to patients with CT/CC genotype groups (75% vs. 31.3%, P = 0.004).

The enforced expression of miR-221/222 in the CLL cell line MEC1 induced a significant down-regulation of p27 protein and conferred a proliferative advantage to the transduced cells that exhibited faster progression into the S phase of the cell cycle. Accordingly, expression of miR-221/miR-222 and p27 was found to be inversely related in leukemic cells obtained from peripheral blood (PB) of 38 patients with CLL. Interestingly, when miR-221/222 and p27 protein were evaluated in different anatomic compartments (lymph nodes or bone marrow) of the same patients, increased expression of the 2 miRNAs became apparent compared with PB. This finding was paralleled by a low expression of p27. In addition, when CLL cells were induced in vitro to enter cell cycle (eg, with cytosine phosphate guanine oligodeoxynucleotide), a significant increase of miR-221/222 expression and a marked down-regulation of p27 protein were evident. These data indicate that the miR-221/222 cluster modulates the expression of p27 protein in CLL cells and lead to suggest that miR-221/222 and p27 may represent a regulatory loop that helps maintaining CLL cells in a resting condition.","['Department of Oncology, Unit and Laboratory of Lymphoid Malignancies, San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.']",20100304,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The significance of multilineage dysplasia (MLD) in NPM1-mutated AML is unclear. Thus, in the 2008 WHO classification, NPM1-mutated AML with MLD is classified as AML with myelodysplasia (MD)-related changes (MRCs). We evaluated morphologically 318 NPM1-mutated AML patients and found MLD in 23.3%. Except for a male predominance and a lower fms-related tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) incidence in the MLD(+) group, no differences were observed in age, sex, cytogenetics, and FLT3--tyrosine kinase domain between NPM1-mutated AML with and without MLD. NPM1-mutated AML with and without MLD showed overlapping immunophenotype (CD34 negativity) and gene expression profile (CD34 down-regulation, HOX genes up-regulation). Moreover, overall and event-free survival did not differ among NPM1-mutated AML patients independently of whether they were MLD(+) or MLD(-), the NPM1-mutated/FLT3-ITD negative genotype showing the better prognosis. Lack of MLD impact on survival was confirmed by multivariate analysis that highlighted FLT3-ITD as the only significant prognostic parameter in NPM1-mutated AML. Our findings indicate that NPM1 mutations rather than MLD dictate the distinctive features of NPM1-mutated AML.

Current approaches for deriving minor H antigen-specific T cells, which provide essential reagents for the molecular identification and characterization of the polymorphic genes that encode the antigens, rely on in vivo priming and are often unsuccessful. We show that minor H antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors are found predominantly in the naive CD8(+) T-cell subset and provide an efficient strategy for in vitro priming of native T cells to generate T cells to a broad diversity of minor H antigens presented with common human leukocyte antigen alleles. We used this approach to derive a panel of stable cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones for discovery of genes that encode minor H antigens and identify a novel antigen expressed on acute myeloid leukemia stem cells and minimally in graft-versus-host disease target tissues.","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. mbleakle@fhcrc.org']",20100304,,,,"['P01 CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['Blood. 2010 Jun 10;115(23):4630-1.

KMT4/Dot1 is a conserved histone methyltransferase capable of methylating chromatin on Lys79 of histone H3 (H3K79). Here we report the identification of a multisubunit Dot1 complex (DotCom), which includes several of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) partners in leukemia such as ENL, AF9/MLLT3, AF17/MLLT6, and AF10/MLLT10, as well as the known Wnt pathway modifiers TRRAP, Skp1, and beta-catenin. We demonstrated that the human DotCom is indeed capable of trimethylating H3K79 and, given the association of beta-catenin, Skp1, and TRRAP, we investigated, and found, a role for Dot1 in Wnt/Wingless signaling in an in vivo model system. Knockdown of Dot1 in Drosophila results in decreased expression of a subset of Wingless target genes. Furthermore, the loss of expression for the Drosophila homologs of the Dot1-associated proteins involved in the regulation of H3K79 shows a similar reduction in expression of these Wingless targets. From yeast to human, specific trimethylation of H3K79 by Dot1 requires the monoubiquitination of histone H2B by the Rad6/Bre1 complex. Here, we demonstrate that depletion of Bre1, the E3 ligase required for H2B monoubiquitination, leads specifically to reduced bulk H3K79 trimethylation levels and a reduction in expression of many Wingless targets. Overall, our study describes for the first time the components of DotCom and links the specific regulation of H3K79 trimethylation by Dot1 and its associated factors to the Wnt/Wingless signaling pathway.","['Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, Missouri 64110, USA.']",20100304,,,,"['R01 CA089455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM069905/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA89455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their incidence has risen dramatically in recent years. The diagnosis of IFDs remains difficult, even if the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)/Mycosis Study Group (MSG) criteria are applied for study purposes to classify the likelihood of these infections. These criteria have been developed for clinical trials, and their relevance in clinical settings outside a clinical trial remains unknown. We evaluated the impact of the EORTC/MSG criteria and a modification thereof for clinical purposes in patients with AML. We retro-spectively analysed 100 AML patients for the occurrence of IFD. First, EORTC/MSG criteria were applied to classify the patients. Second, a modified version of these criteria already used in clinical trials was used to re-classify the patients. Fifty-seven patients developed an invasive fungal infection. Following the original criteria, 43% were classified as 'possible' IFD, whereas 7% each were classified as 'probable' and 'proven' IFD. After application of the modified criteria, only 9% of the patients remained 'possible' IFD, whereas 41% were 'probable'. The occurrence of 'proven' cases was not altered by the modification and thus remained 7%. The application of modified criteria for the classification of IFD in AML patients leads to a considerable shift from 'possible' IFD (according to conventional EORTC criteria) towards 'probable' IFD.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of skin manifestations associated with MDS. In addition, we evaluated the risk of acute myeloid leukaemia transformation associated with skin manifestations. METHODS: We studied a cohort of 157 patients with primary MDS followed up prospectively for a median of 44 months. Skin lesions were prospectively assessed as part of medical examination every 6 months by a board certified dermatologist. Survival analyses were performed to assess the association between the presence of skin lesions and the risk of acute myeloid leukaemia. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (9.55%) experienced skin lesions previously reported as associated with MDS. These were neutrophilic dermatosis (7, 4.46%), specific lesions (5, 3.18%), cutaneous vasculitis (2, 1.27%) and Behcet disease (1, 0.63%). Survival analysis showed that the risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukaemia was slightly but not significantly increased in patients with skin lesions as compared with patients without skin lesions with a relative risk of 2.08 (95% CI 0.92-4.67). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of skin lesions, mostly neutrophilic dermatosis and specific lesions, is relatively high in patients with MDS. There is a trend for a higher risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukaemia in patients with skin lesions.","['Department of Dermatology, Toulouse University Hospital, , Toulouse Cedex 9, France.']",,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2010 The Authors.

Quality of life has become an important issue in childhood and adult cancer patients. The commonest cancers in patients of reproductive age are leukaemia, Hodgkin's lymphomas and testicular germ cell tumors. Fertility is often impaired after chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Cryopreservation of semen before cancer treatment starts is currently the only method to preserve future male fertility. In some malignancies, especially in germ cell tumors, sperm quality is already abnormal at the time of diagnosis. In approximately 12% of men, no viable spermatozoa are present for cryopreservation before the start of chemotherapy. Cytotoxic therapy influences spermatogenesis at least temporarily and in some cases permanently. The amount of damage inflicted by chemotherapy on spermatogenesis depends on the combination of drugs used and on the cumulative dose given for cancer treatment. Alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide and procarbazine, are most detrimental to germ cells. Radiation therapy, especially whole-body irradiation, is also associated with the risk of permanent sterility. Besides the cancer treatment, tumor type and pretreatment fertility are of prognostic value for future fertility in male cancer survivors. After cancer treatment, many men need artificial reproductive techniques to achieve fatherhood; usually in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is indicated for successful treatment. About 15% of men will use their cryopreserved semen because of persistent azoospermia after cancer treatment. Treatment results with cryopreserved semen are generally good and comparable to general IVF and ICSI results. So far, no studies have reported an increased rate of congenital abnormalities or malignancies in children born from fathers who had cancer treatment is the past, but close follow up is warranted, especially in children born after IVF/ICSI.","['Department of Urology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. g.r.dohle@erasmusmc.nl']",20100222,,,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The impressive results of TKIs in this model have been overshadowed by the development of clinical resistance. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: This review focuses on clinical results with imatinib therapy and second generation TKIs. Furthermore, a summary of the guidelines for the management of TKI resistant patients is provided together with a description of the new drugs in clinical or preclinical phases which are developing to overcome resistance. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Future perspective for the 'cure' of CML patients and new drugs designed for this purpose are suggested. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: CML therapy has dramatically changed in the last few years due to the introduction of targeted therapy. Studies on new drugs targeting different pathways other than BCR-ABL are ongoing to improve the clinical results.","['University of Turin, Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, S.

METHODS: We investigated this by following the phenotypic evolution of leukemic cells with flow cytometry from diagnosis to four time points during and after GC containing chemotherapy in the 20 (of 360 consecutive) B-cell precursor patients with ALL who had persistent MRD throughout. RESULTS: The early expression changes of CD10 and CD34 were reversible after stop of GC containing chemotherapy. Modulation of CD20 and CD45 occurred mostly during the GC phase, whereas CD11a also changed later on. Blast cells at diagnosis falling into gates designed according to ""shifted"" phenotypes from follow-up did not form clusters and were frequently less numerous than later on. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the idea that drug-induced modulation rather than selection causes the phenomenon. The good message for MRD assessment is that modulation is transient in at least two (CD10 and CD34) of the five prominent antigens investigated and reverts to initial aberrant patterns after stop of GC therapy, whereas CD20 expression gains new aberrations exploitable for MRD detection.","[""Laboratory of Immunological Diagnostics, Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria. michael.dworzak@ccri.at""]",,,,,,,,,['2010 Clinical Cytometry Society.'],,,,,,,,,

So far, the transcription factors Stat3 and Stat5a/b have been implicated in bcr/abl-induced initial transformation. However, to qualify as a potential drug target, a signalling pathway must be required for the maintenance of the leukaemic state. Data on the roles of Stat3 or Stat5a/b in leukaemia maintenance are elusive. Here, we show that both, Stat3 and Stat5 are necessary for initial transformation. However, Stat5- but not Stat3-deletion induces G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant stable leukaemic cells in vitro. Accordingly, Stat5-abrogation led to effective elimination of myeloid and lymphoid leukaemia maintenance in vivo.

We developed a retroviral vector construct encoding a chimeric T-cell receptor that recognizes the Le(Y) antigen in a major histocompatibility complex-independent manner and delivers co-stimulatory signals to achieve T-cell activation. We have shown efficient transduction of peripheral blood-derived T cells with this construct, resulting in antigen-restricted interferon-gamma secretion and cell lysis of Le(Y)-expressing tumor cells. In vivo activity of gene-modified T cells was demonstrated in the delayed growth of myeloma xenografts in NOD/SCID mice, which prolonged survival.

The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1 (p27) is a critical negative regulator of hematopoietic progenitor proliferation and pool size that is deregulated in BCR-ABL expressing cell lines. However, cell-context specific regulation of p27 in primary human CML progenitors and its contribution to CML progenitor expansion remain unclear. Here, we investigated p27 regulation and function in (1) CD34+ cells from CML patients and (2) human CD34+ cells ectopically expressing the BCR-ABL gene following retrovirus transduction. We found that p27 levels are increased in CML CD34+ cells related to a BCR-ABL-dependent increase in p27 protein translation. However, p27 was relocated to the cytoplasm in CML progenitors and nuclear p27 levels were reduced, allowing increased cell cycling and expansion in culture. Cytoplasmic relocation of p27 in CML progenitors was related to signaling through BCR-ABL Y177, activation of the AKT kinase and phosphorylation of p27 on Thr-157 (T157). Expression of a mutant p27 that cannot be phosphorylated on T157 significantly inhibited CML progenitor proliferation. These studies show the importance of BCR-ABL-Y177-AKT-mediated p27 phosphorylation in altered p27 localization and enhanced proliferation and expansion of primary CML progenitors.","['Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']",20100304,,,,"['R01 HL077847/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL77847/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL077847-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095684-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA95684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS166713'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effect of recombinant protease-resistant galectin-9 (hGal9) on multiple myeloma (MM). In vitro, hGal9 inhibited the cell proliferation of five myeloma cell lines examined, including a bortezomib-resistant subcell line, with IC(50) between 75.1 and 280.0 nM, and this effect was mediated by the induction of apoptosis with the activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3. hGal9-activated Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK signaling pathways followed by H2AX phosphorylation. Importantly, the inhibition of either JNK or p38 MAPK partly inhibited the anti-proliferative effect of hGal9, indicating the crucial role of these pathways in the anti-MM effect of hGal9. hGal9 also induced cell death in patient-derived myeloma cells, some with poor-risk factors, such as chromosomal deletion of 13q or translocation t(4;14)(p16;q32). Finally, hGal9 potently inhibited the growth of human myeloma cells xenografted in nude mice.

Recently, we described that HH signaling proteins are commonly expressed in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL); however, the functional role of HH pathway in DLBCL has not been explored. Here, we assessed the possibility that HH pathway activation contributes to the survival of DLBCL. We found that HH signaling inhibition induces predominantly cell-cycle arrest in DLBCL cells of germinal center (GC) B-cell type, and apoptosis in DLBCL cells of activated B-cell (ABC) type. Apoptosis after HH signaling inhibition in DLBCL cells of ABC type was associated with downregulation of BCL2; however HH inhibition was not associated with BCL2 downregulation in DLBCL of GC type. Functional inhibition of BCL2 significantly increased apoptosis induced by HH inhibition in DLBCL cells of both types. We also showed that DLBCL cells synthesize, secrete and respond to endogenous HH ligands, providing support for the existence of an autocrine HH signaling loop. Our findings provide novel evidence that dysregulation of HH pathway is involved in the biology of DLBCL and have significant therapeutic implications as they identify HH signaling as a potential therapeutic target in DLBCL, in particular for those lymphomas expressing the HH receptor smoothened.","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",20100304,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modulation of cell death regulators represents an attractive strategy for subverting such drug resistance. Here we report complete resensitization of multidrug-resistant childhood ALL cells to glucocorticoids and other cytotoxic agents with subcytotoxic concentrations of obatoclax, a putative antagonist of BCL-2 family members. The reversal of glucocorticoid resistance occurred through rapid activation of autophagy-dependent necroptosis, which bypassed the block in mitochondrial apoptosis. This effect was associated with dissociation of the autophagy inducer beclin-1 from the antiapoptotic BCL-2 family member myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL-1) and with a marked decrease in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity. Consistent with a protective role for mTOR in glucocorticoid resistance in childhood ALL, combination of rapamycin with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone triggered autophagy-dependent cell death, with characteristic features of necroptosis. Execution of cell death, but not induction of autophagy, was strictly dependent on expression of receptor-interacting protein (RIP-1) kinase and cylindromatosis (turban tumor syndrome) (CYLD), two key regulators of necroptosis. Accordingly, both inhibition of RIP-1 and interference with CYLD restored glucocorticoid resistance completely. Together with evidence for a chemosensitizing activity of obatoclax in vivo, our data provide a compelling rationale for clinical translation of this pharmacological approach into treatments for patients with refractory ALL.","[""Department of Oncology, University Children's Hospital, University of Zurich, Switzerland.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of gene-deficient mice revealed specific roles for the hematopoietically expressed PI3K catalytic subunits, p110gamma and p110delta, in development and function of T and B lymphocytes. However, the functional redundancy between these two PI3K isoforms in the B cell lineage remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that p110delta and p110gamma are expressed in B cells at early developmental stages. Normal B cell differentiation requires both isoforms, as p110gamma/p110delta double deficiency causes an increased percentage of CD43(hi)/B220(+)/CD19(-) cells as compared with single deficiency. Interestingly, initial transformation efficiency of B cell precursors was strongly reduced in double-deficient cells following transformation by p185 bcr-abl or v-abl oncogenes as compared with single-deficient cells. The requirement of p110gamma and p110delta in B cell development is underlined by reduced splenic B cell numbers of p110gamma/p110delta double-deficient mice and of lethally irradiated wild-type mice reconstituted with double-deficient BM. Moreover, the peripheral maintenance of p110gamma/p110delta double-deficient T and B cells was highly impaired following adoptive transfer of double-deficient splenocytes into wild-type mice. Functionally, LPS stimulation of splenocytes revealed proliferation defects resulting in decreased survival of p110gamma/p110delta double-deficient B cells, which correlated with impaired induction of D-type cyclins and Bcl-X(L). Surprisingly, this was not observed when purified B cells were analyzed, indicating a contribution of likely cell-extrinsic factor(s) to the impaired proliferation of double-deficient B cells. Thus, we provide novel evidence that p110gamma and p110delta have overlapping and cell-extrinsic roles in the development, peripheral maintenance, and function of B cells.","['1.

Like all RAS proteins, NRAS must undergo a series of post-translational modifications for differential targeting to distinct membrane subdomains. Although farnesylation is the obligatory first step in post-translational modifications of RAS, to date, successes of therapies targeting farnesyl protein transferase are modest. Other RAS modifications, such as palmitoylation, are required for optimal plasma membrane association of RAS proteins. However, the relative importance of these latter modifications of RAS in leukemogenesis is not clear. We have previously shown that expression of oncogenic NRAS using a bone marrow transduction and transplantation model efficiently induces a chronic myelomonocytic leukemia- or acute myeloid leukemia-like disease in mice. Here we examined the role of palmitoylation in NRAS leukemogenesis using this model. We found that palmitoylation is essential for leukemogenesis by oncogenic NRAS. We also found that farnesylation is essential for NRAS leukemogenesis, yet through a different mechanism from that of palmitoylation deficiency. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that palmitoylation is an essential process for NRAS leukemogenesis and suggests that the development of therapies targeting RAS palmitoylation may be effective in treating oncogenic NRAS-associated malignancies.","['Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center and Department of Biology, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA, USA.']",20100303,,,,"['R01 HL083515/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL083515/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: All eligible cases were reviewed with the data of efficacy responses as well as overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) time. RESULTS: A total of 615 cases entered the study. CML mainly afflicted those aged 40-60 years old and was slightly more frequent in males than females. More than 85% of the patients were in chronic phase (CP) when diagnosed. All patients were divided into four groups based on the main regimens - hydroxyurea, interferon alpha (IFN-alpha), imatinib, and hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). With the median follow-up of 18 months, imatinib treatment induced 92.2% complete hematologic responses, and 64.3% complete cytogenetic responses among CML-CP patients. Overall the therapeutic efficacy in the imatinib group was higher than that in the hydroxyurea or IFN-alpha group. Meanwhile, in the imatinib group, all response rates of patients in CP were significantly greater than that in accelerated or blastic crisis phase. The patients treated with imatinib also showed the most promising results regarding OS and PFS. Patients receiving HSCT decreased markedly in number with the introduction of imatinib. CONCLUSIONS: The number of new patients arising in Shanghai increased from 2001 to 2006. There were still patients receiving hydroxyurea and IFN-alpha. As the first-line regime for CML, imatinib was less administered in Shanghai before, but has received considerable development and great responses since 2003.","['Department of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.']",20100303,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematopoietic stem cell transplant was established at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in 1993. Here, we describe 15 years experience with stem cell transplant at our center in southern Iran. We provide information on indication, donor type, conditioning chemotherapy regimen, outcome, survival, and long-term follow-up in our stem cell activity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From May 1993 to October 2008, 423 patients underwent allogeneic (n=311) and autologous (n=112) stem cell transplants at our center. For allogeneic stem cell transplant, the conditioning chemotherapy regimen comprised busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and antithymocyte globulin for thalassemic patients; busulfan and cyclophosphamide for leukemia patients; and cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulin for patients with aplastic anemia. RESULTS: During this period, 155 B-thalassemia major patients (mean age, 9.5 years; range, 2-20 years) underwent allogeneic marrow transplant. Of 155 patients with a diagnosis of thalassemia major, 112 are alive (72%) with full engraftment after a median follow-up of about 8.1 years (range, 12-184 months). During this time, 127 leukemia patients including acute myelogenous leukemia (n=68), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=30) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (n=29), received allogeneic stem cell transplant. In this group, long-term, disease-free survival (cure rate) was 67%, 60%, and 62%. CONCLUSIONS: These data reflect the important role of hematopoietic stem cell transplant in improving survival for a variety of hematopoietic system disorders at our center in Southern Iran. In patients with B-thalassemia major hematopoietic stem cell transplant seems to be the treatment of choice, because it leads to a cure in all classes (Lucarelli risk group, I-III). Based on high success rates in patients with class II and III thalassemia with the addition of the antithymocyte globulin to conditioning regimen of stem cell transplant, we also recommend using this new method of conditioning in transplant of thalassemia patients.","['Department of Hematology, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. ramzim@sums.ac.ir']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied p53 protein expression by flow cytometry (FC) assay in 223 blood and/or bone marrow samples from 72 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML): 54 in chronic phase (CML-CP), 7 in accelerated phase (CML-AP), and 11 in blastic phase (CML-BP); 64 patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL): (34 at diagnosis, 21 in previously treated, and 9 with Richter's syndrome); 44 patients with acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL): 36 at diagnosis and 8 in relapse; and 43 acute myeloid leukemia (AML): 27 de novo, 7 in relapse, and 9 secondary. p53 protein expression was observed in 64 of 223 patient's samples: 14/64 (21.9%) CLL, 13/44 (29.5%) ALL, 19/43 (44.2%) AML, and 17/72 (23.6%) CML. Highest levels were detected in the advanced phases of CLL, ALL, and CML. In addition, in patients with AML, high levels of p53 expression were detected in secondary and relapse disease and also in de novo AML cases. Our results demonstrated that p53 expression levels are strongly associated with advanced disease. On the basis of these results, we concluded that FC can be a reliable approach to study p53 protein expression in leukemic patients.","['Laboratorio de Hemato-Oncologia Celular e Molecular, Hospital do Cancer I, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro - RJ, Brazil. gbcjunior@hotmail.com']",,,,,,,,,['(c) 2010 Clinical Cytometry Society.'],,,,,,,,,

The socioeconomic status of residential area at diagnosis was estimated by county-level poverty rate in Census 2000, i.e., percentage of persons in the county living below the national poverty thresholds. Counties were categorized as low-, medium-, and high-poverty areas when the poverty rates were <10, 10-19.99, and 20% or higher, respectively. The results showed that medium- and high-poverty counties had lower age-adjusted incidence rates than low-poverty counties for total childhood cancers combined, central nervous system neoplasms (ICCC group III), neuroblastoma (group IV), renal tumors (group VI), and other malignant epithelial neoplasms and malignant melanomas (group XI). When the data were stratified by race, these associations were observed among whites, but not blacks. For leukemia (group I), poor counties had higher incidence rates than affluent counties for whites, but lower rates for blacks.

Here, we presented a case of peripheral T-cell lymphoma with morphological features of AITL in Taiwan, a country non-endemic for HTLV, and the patient was seropositive for anti-HTLV antibody, which raised the possibility of ATLL with AITL-like features. Immunohistochemically, there were hyperplastic follicular dendritic meshworks by CD21 immunostaining, and the neoplastic cells expressed CD10, programmed death-1, and CXCL13. Furthermore, Southern blot analysis using DNA extracted from the nodal tissue was negative for HTLV-I proviral integration.

Apg-2 overexpression elevated BaF3-BCR/ABL cell proportions in S and G2/M phase, increased cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro. Moreover, BaF3-MIGR1 and BaF3-BCR/ABL cells were exposed to 50 microM H2O2 in the absence or presence of Apg-2 overexpression and induction of H2AX phosphorylation, the reporters of DNA damage were assessed by Western blot and immunofluorescence.

METHODS: We performed FISH using LSITEL/AML1 ES probe (Vysis, USA) in 123 children diagnosed as having precursor B-ALL and assessed clinical relevance of the TEL/AML1 rearrangement and additional genetic abnormalities. RESULTS: The frequency of TEL/AML1 was 17.1% (21/123) in patients with precursor B-ALL. TEL/ AML1-positive group showed male predominance (P=0.012) and younger age of onset than TEL/ AML1-negative group by 1.6 yr (P=0.013). The outcome of TEL/AML1-positive group tended to show lower incidences of relapse (1/21 vs 20/102), death (1/21 vs 17/102) and longer event free survival. Among TEL/AML1-positive patients, unrearranged TEL deletion, AML1 gain, and unrearranged TEL deletion combined with AML1 gain were detected in 61.9%, 23.8%, and 9.5%, respectively. There were no significant differences in the clinical features and outcome according to the presence or absence of additional genetic changes. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of TEL/AML1 and additional genetic changes in TEL and AML1 is higher than previous studies in Korean children, and in close agreement with usually reported one, 20-25%.

METHODS/RESULTS: A 66-year-old man with MDS-RAEB-2 was admitted to hospital for severe anemia with increased reticulocyte counts. Hemolytic anemia was suspected, and it was ameliorated by methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Although anemia grew worse when steroids were tapered off, later improvement coincided with an increase in myeloblasts in the peripheral blood, i.e. with leukemic transformation. In another case, a 68-year-old man was admitted to hospital when laboratory findings showed a white blood cell count of 24,800/microl with increased myeloblasts (62.5%), leading to the diagnosis of AML with multilineage dysplasia. Following a decrease in blasts due to anti-cancer drugs, supporting the MDS-RAEB-2 status, severe anemia with increased reticulocytes and positive direct antiglobulin test was diagnosed, suggesting the existence of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which was then ameliorated by steroid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous loss of autoimmunity and leukemic cell expansion observed in our cases may possibly suggest a common underlying mechanism.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hyogo Prefectural Tsukaguchi Hospital, Hyogo, Japan. rtabata@hp.pref.hyogo.jp']",20100303,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2010 S.

However, underlying mechanisms leading to leukemogenesis remain unknown. To address this issue, we took advantage of the zebrafish model organism, which expresses 2 genes orthologous to human NPM1, referred to as npm1a and npm1b. Both genes are ubiquitously expressed, and their knockdown produces a reduction in myeloid cell numbers that is specifically rescued by NPM1 expression. In zebrafish, wild-type human NPM1 is nucleolar while NPMc+ is cytoplasmic, as in human AML, and both interact with endogenous zebrafish Npm1a and Npm1b. Forced NPMc+ expression in zebrafish causes an increase in pu.1(+) primitive early myeloid cells. A more marked perturbation of myelopoiesis occurs in p53(m/m) embryos expressing NPMc+, where mpx(+) and csf1r(+) cell numbers are also expanded. Importantly, NPMc+ expression results in increased numbers of definitive hematopoietic cells, including erythromyeloid progenitors in the posterior blood island and c-myb/cd41(+) cells in the ventral wall of the aorta. These results are likely to be relevant to human NPMc+ AML, where the observed NPMc+ multilineage expression pattern implies transformation of a multipotent stem or progenitor cell.","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",20100302,,,,"['T32 CA009382/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32-CA009382-26/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We anticipate that acquired resistance to this promising drug will inevitably arise. To study potential mechanisms of resistance to ABT-737, we derived resistant lines from initially sensitive OCI-Ly1 and SU-DHL-4 lymphoma cell lines via long-term exposure. Resistance was based in the mitochondria and not due to an inability of the drug to bind BCL-2. Resistant cells had increased levels of BFL-1 and/or MCL-1 proteins, which are not targeted by ABT-737. Proapoptotic BIM was displaced from BCL-2 by ABT-737 in both parental and resistant cells, but in resistant cells, BIM was sequestered by the additional BFL-1 and/or MCL-1. Decreasing MCL-1 levels with flavopiridol, PHA 767491, or shRNA restored sensitivity to ABT-737 resistant cells. MCL-1 was up-regulated not by protein stabilization but rather by increased transcript levels. Surprisingly, in addition to stable increases in MCL-1 transcript and protein in resistant cells, there was a dynamic increase within hours after ABT-737 treatment. BFL-1 protein and transcript levels in resistant cells were similarly dynamically up-regulated. This dynamic increase suggests a novel mechanism whereby modulation of antiapoptotic protein function communicates with nuclear transcriptional machinery.","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.']",20100302,,,,"['R01 CA129974/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA10254/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA129974/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

BCR-ABL inhibition with imatinib results in high levels of efficacy in patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase (CP), but an estimated 35% of patients could benefit from more effective treatment. Several novel treatment strategies are being investigated in newly diagnosed CML-CP. These strategies include upfront treatment with next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as dasatinib, nilotinib, or bosutinib, which also target BCR-ABL but with increased in vitro potency compared with imatinib, and possibly a reduced potential for resistance. Recent in vitro studies have shown that short-term exposure to dasatinib or continuous exposure to imatinib result in equivalent levels of apoptosis, indicating that potent intermittent inhibition is a successful strategy for improving dasatinib tolerability. Modified imatinib regimens are also being investigated in newly diagnosed CML-CP, including higher doses and combination with alternative classes of agents, such as interferon. Existing data suggest that both newer agents and combination approaches can improve treatment responses compared with standard imatinib treatment, although further data are needed, particularly from ongoing phase 3 trials, before the standard of care is revised.","['Campus Virchow Klinikum, Charite Universitatsmedizin, Berlin, Germany. philipp.lecoutre@charite.de']",20100302,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined if sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, can induce apoptosis by targeting STAT3 signaling to enhance apoptosis induction by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Human pancreatic cancer cell lines (PANC-1 and BxPC-3) were preincubated with sorafenib (Nexavar) alone or followed by TRAIL. Apoptosis was determined by Annexin V labeling, caspase cleavage, and Bax/Bak activation. Protein expression was analyzed by immunoblotting. Knockdown of STAT3, Mcl-1, and Bim were achieved by lentiviral small hairpin RNA. Adenoviral dominant-negative or retroviral constitutively active (CA) STAT3 were also used. Sorafenib inhibited constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation (Tyr(705)) and suppressed Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) proteins in a dose- and time-dependent manner. CA-STAT3 overexpression was shown to attenuate caspase-3 cleavage and suppression of Mcl-1 by sorafenib. STAT3 knockdown or a DN STAT3 was shown to downregulate Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) and to sensitize cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Treatment with sorafenib enhanced TRAIL-induced Annexin V staining and release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and AIF. Because the BH3-only Bim protein is a potent inducer of mitochondrial apoptosis, Bim knockdown was shown to attenuate caspase-3, caspase-9 cleavage, and Bax/Bak activation by sorafenib plus TRAIL. The suppression of STAT3 by genetic means or using sorafenib was shown to downregulate Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) and to sensitize cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.

The simulations indicate that all three disequilibrium coefficients can usefully detect genotyping error as judged by the area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve. Their discriminative ability increases as the error rate increases, and is greater if the genotyping error is in the direction of the minor allele. Optimal thresholds for detecting genotyping error vary for different allele frequencies and patterns of genotyping error but allele frequency-specific thresholds can be nominated. Applying these thresholds would have picked up about 90% of genotyping errors in our actual dataset.

Finding of specific agonists and antagonists of FPR may provide potential therapeutic agents for FPR related disorders. The binding of agonist by FPR induces a cascade of G protein-mediated signaling events leading to neutrophil chemotaxis, intracellualr calcium mobilization, FPR ligand uptake and so on. This work proposed a microfluidic-based method to characterize FPR-related cellular events in response to small peptides, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLF), in rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3 expressing human FPR (RBL-FPR). The results showed that fMLF triggered chemotaxis, calcium mobilization and FPR ligand uptake in RBL-FPR cells, indicating the potential role of FPR agonist. The chemotaxis index and the calcium mobilization intensity increased but the time course of calcium mobilization decreased, as the rising of fMLF concentration. The basic agreement between the microfluidic results and the previous studies demonstrated good feasibility of the microfluidic method for characterization of FPR agonist. Microfluidic technology displays significant advantages over traditional methods in terms of sample consumption and assay time. It also facilitates experimental process and real-time observation of cellular responses at single cell resolution.","['Department of Biotechnology, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 457 Zhongshan Road, Dalian, 116023, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), the JAK2V617F alone cannot explain the phenotypic heterogeneity. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), clinical variability exists within distinct subgroups. Thus, the search for novel molecular markers continues. Recently, mutations of the tet oncogene family member 2 (TET2) and Casitas B-cell lymphoma (CBL) genes became the focus of interest. With diverse genetic methods, TET2 on chromosome 4q24 was identified as candidate tumor suppressor gene. Sequencing studies revealed heterogeneous mutations in 10-25% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), MDS, and MPNs, while the frequency might be higher in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). The prognostic impact is being explored. The CBL gene is involved in the degradation of tyrosine kinases. In rare cases of human AML (<2%), CBL mutants were identified, with a higher frequency in core binding factor leukemias. Presence of these mutations was suggested to be involved in aberrant FLT3 expression. In the MPNs, a 2-8% frequency of CBL mutations was reported. These novel mutations deepened insights in the mechanisms of leukemogenesis, might contribute to the identification of new therapeutic targets, and improve diagnostics in the myeloid malignancies.","['Interdisciplinary Clinic for Stem Cell Transplantation, University Cancer Center Hamburg, Martinistr. 52, 20246 Hamburg, Germany.']",20100302,,,57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ofatumumab (HuMax-CD20) is a human monoclonal antibody targeting a distinct small-loop epitope on the CD20 molecule. We conducted an international clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ofatumumab in patients with FA-ref and BF-ref CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received eight weekly infusions of ofatumumab followed by four monthly infusions during a 24-week period (dose 1 = 300 mg; doses 2 to 12 = 2,000 mg); response by an independent review committee (1996 National Cancer Institute Working Group criteria) was assessed every 4 weeks until week 24 and then every 3 months until month 24. RESULTS: This planned interim analysis included 138 treated patients with FA-ref (n = 59) and BF-ref (n = 79) CLL. The overall response rates (primary end point) were 58% [corrected] and 47% in the FA-ref and BF-ref groups, respectively. Complete resolution of constitutional symptoms and improved performance status occurred in 57% and 48% of patients, respectively. Median progression-free survival and overall survival times were 5.7 and 13.7 months in the FA-ref group, respectively, and 5.9 and 15.4 months in the BF-ref group, respectively. The most common adverse events during treatment were infusion reactions and infections, which were primarily grade 1 or 2 events. Hematologic events during treatment included anemia and neutropenia. CONCLUSION: Ofatumumab is an active, well-tolerated treatment providing clear clinical improvements for fludarabine-refractory patients with very poor-prognosis CLL.","['The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030-4009, USA. wwierda@mdanderson.org']",20100301,,,,['MC_U132670597/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,['Hx-CD20-406 Study Investigators'],,,['J Clin Oncol. 2010 Aug 1;28(22):3670'],['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00349349'],,,

Promising results have previously been reported in nonrandomized studies in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This trial was designed to compare chemoimmunotherapy with chemotherapy alone in patients with previously treated CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This international, multicenter, randomized trial compared six cycles of rituximab plus fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (R-FC) with six cycles of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide alone (FC) in patients with previously treated CLL. A total of 552 patients with Binet stage A (1%), B (59%), or C (31%) disease entered the study and were randomly assigned to receive R-FC (n = 276) or FC (n = 276). RESULTS: After a median follow-up time of 25 months, rituximab significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with previously treated CLL (hazard ratio = 0.65; P < .001; median, 30.6 months for R-FC v 20.6 months for FC). Event-free survival, response rate, complete response rate, duration of response, and time to new CLL treatment or death were also significantly improved. Although the rates of adverse events, grade 3 or 4 events, and serious adverse events were slightly higher in the R-FC arm, R-FC was generally well tolerated, with no new safety findings and no detrimental effect on quality of life. CONCLUSION: R-FC significantly improved the outcome of patients with previously treated CLL.","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Ciolkowskiego 2, Lodz, Poland 93-510. robaktad@csk.umed.lodz.pl']",20100301,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This virus is therefore an important potential human pathogen and, as such, it is essential to understand its host cell tropism. Intriguingly, infectious virus has been recovered from patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These cells express several antiviral restriction factors that are capable of inhibiting the replication of a wide range of retroviruses, including other gamma retroviruses. This raises the possibility that, similar to HIV, XMRV may have acquired resistance to restriction. We therefore investigated the susceptibility of XMRV to a panel of different restriction factors. We found that both human APOBEC3 and tetherin proteins are able to block XMRV replication. Expression of human TRIM5alpha, however, had no effect on viral infectivity. There was no evidence that XMRV expressed countermeasures to overcome restriction. In addition, the virus was inhibited by factors from nonhuman species, including mouse Apobec3, tetherin, and Fv1 proteins. These results have important implications for predicting the natural target cells for XMRV replication, for relating infection to viral pathogenicity and pathology, and for the design of model systems with which to study XMRV-related diseases.","['Division of Virology, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom.']",20100301,,,,"['MC_U117512710/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U117592729/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed insertional mutagenesis with the MOL4070LTR retrovirus in Mx1-Cre, Kras(G12D) mice and generated a large cohort of T lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs). Molecular analysis infers that retroviral integration within Ikzf1 is an early event in leukemogenesis that precedes Kras(G12D) expression and later acquisition of somatic Notch1 mutations. Importantly, biochemical analysis uncovered unexpected heterogeneity, which suggests that Ras signaling networks are remodeled during multistep tumorigenesis. We tested tumor-derived cell lines to identify biomarkers of therapeutic response to targeted inhibitors. Whereas all T-ALLs tested were sensitive to a dual-specificity phosphoinosityl 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, biochemical evidence of Notch1 activation correlated with sensitivity to gamma-secretase inhibition.

The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor TAL1/SCL plays a critical role in other hematopoietic lineages, and while it had been reported to be expressed by BM-derived macrophages, its role in monocytopoiesis had not been elucidated. Using cell explant models of monocyte/macrophage (MM) differentiation, one originating with CMPs and the other from more committed precursors, we characterized the phenotypic and molecular consequences of inactivation of Tal1 expression ex vivo. While Tal1 knockout had minimal effects on cell survival and slightly accelerated terminal differentiation, it profoundly inhibited cell proliferation and decreased entry into and traversal of the G(1) and S phases. In conjunction, steady-state levels of p16(Ink4a) mRNA were increased and those of Gata2 mRNA decreased. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated the association of Tal1 and E47, one of its E protein DNA-binding partners, with an E box-GATA sequence element in intron 4 of the Gata2 gene and with three E boxes upstream of p16(Ink4a). Finally, wild-type Tal1, but not a DNA binding-defective mutant, rescued the proliferative defect in Tal1-null MM precursors. These results document the importance of this transcription factor in cell cycle progression and proliferation during monocytopoiesis and the requirement for direct DNA binding in these processes.","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Room 777, Preston Research Building, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.']",20100301,,,,"['R01 HL049118/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL049118-17/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The factors on human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) that confer this predisposing effect, especially in synergy with consistently mutated transcription factor GATA1 (GATA1s), remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of Hsa21-encoded miR-125b-2, a microRNA (miRNA) overexpressed in DS-AMKL/TL, in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. We identified a function of miR-125b-2 in increasing proliferation and self-renewal of human and mouse megakaryocytic progenitors (MPs) and megakaryocytic/erythroid progenitors (MEPs). miR-125b-2 overexpression did not affect megakaryocytic and erythroid differentiation, but severely perturbed myeloid differentiation. The proproliferative effect of miR-125b-2 on MEPs accentuated the Gata1s mutation, whereas growth of DS-AMKL/TL cells was impaired upon miR-125b repression, suggesting synergism during leukemic transformation in GATA1s-mutated DS-AMKL/TL. Integrative transcriptome analysis of hematopoietic cells upon modulation of miR-125b expression levels uncovered a set of miR-125b target genes, including DICER1 and ST18 as direct targets. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed that this target gene set is down-regulated in DS-AMKL patients highly expressing miR-125b. Thus, we propose miR-125b-2 as a positive regulator of megakaryopoiesis and an oncomiR involved in the pathogenesis of trisomy 21-associated megakaryoblastic leukemia.","[""Children's Hospital Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",,,,,['R01 HL032259/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

(2) Event-free survival, which was defined as the time from initial diagnosis to either leukemia recurrence or death from any cause. RESULTS: No outcome advantage was found for participants in a clinical trial compared with nonparticipants. Additionally, there were not demographic factors associated with increased clinical trial participation.

The discovery of an activating mutation (V617F) in the gene for JAK2 (Janus kinase 2), a tyrosine kinase utilized by hematopoietic cell receptors for erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, provided an explanation for the shared clinical features of these 3 disorders. Constitutive JAK2 activation provides a growth and survival advantage to the hematopoietic cells of the affected clone. Because signaling by the mutated kinase utilizes normal pathways, the result is overproduction of morphologically normal blood cells, an often indolent course, and (in essential thrombocytosis) usually a normal life span. Because the erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptors are all constitutively activated, polycythemia vera is the potential ultimate clinical phenotype of the JAK2 V617F mutation and, as a corollary, is the most common of the 3 disorders. The number of cells expressing the JAK2 V617F mutation (the allele burden) seems to correlate with the clinical phenotype. Preliminary results of clinical trials with agents that inhibit the mutated kinase indicate a reduction in splenomegaly and alleviation of night sweats, fatigue, and pruritus.","['Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland 21205-2196, USA. jlspivak@jhmi.edu']",,,,59,['P01CA108671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such an atypical fusion has never been reported, so the effect on MYC regulation due to proximity of IGH regulatory elements is unknown. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated no increase in MYC expression (P = 0.12).

METHODS: Data from cancer registries during 1988 to 2002 collected from the 11 cancer registry points were used to analyze the trends and characteristics of cancer incidence rates. RESULTS: There were 695 050 newly developed cancer cases in this study. The crude rate of incidence and the world age-adjusted incidence were 215.50/10(5) and 170.97/10(5) respectively. The leading cancer sites were lung, stomach, liver, esophagus, breast, colon, rectum, pancreas, bladder and leukemia. The sixteen key cancers accounted for 85.56% of all the cancer cases. The crude incidence rate of all cancers had been significantly increased from 1988 to 2002. Among them, prostate (185.48%) ranked the fastest growing one followed by cancers of the gallbladder, breast, colon, ovarian, lymphoma, bladder, pancreas, rectum, lung, leukemia and liver. The one that had reduced the most was cervix uteri (17.00%), followed by esophagus, stomach and nasopharynx. CONCLUSION: Crude cancer incidence rate increased in the 11 areas in China from 1988 to 2002. The ranking of pancreas cancer, bladder cancer and leukemia came into the top ten. Even though the incidence rates of prostate and gallbladder cancer were relative low but had a fast increase.

The mRNA level of A549 cell was analyzed by real time quantitative RT-PCR and the protein level was determined using Western blot. MTT growth curve and plate colony forming assay were used to measure the effect of antisense Bmi-1 RNA expression on the growth of A549. Flow cytometry was used to analyze cell cycle and apoptosis. RESULTS: Antisense Bmi-1 RNA reduced the Bmi-1 expression at the protein level, but did not alter the mRNA level in A549 cells. Compared with the control cells, A549 cells transfected with antisense Bmi-1 RNA showed a strong inhibition of the cell growth.

METHODS: One hundred and fifty-three cases of LBL/ALL were retrospectively analyzed. Immunohistochemical study was carried out. The pathologic findings were correlated with Ann Arbor tumor stage, Ki-67 index, other clinical parameters (including mediastinum/bone marrow involvement, hepato-splenomegaly, age and gender of the patients) and the survival data. RESULTS: Staining for TdT and CD99 was positive in 79.1% (121/153 cases) and 96.3% (131/136 cases), respectively. The cases were categorized into three groups according to the immunohistochemical findings, as follows: precursor T-cell, precursor B-cell and undefined. T-LBL/ALL accounted for 69.3% (106/153 cases) of all of the cases. The male-to-female ratio was 2.4:1 (including 75 males and 31 females). The median age at diagnosis was 17.5 years (ranged from 2 years to 68 years). Ninety-two patients (86.8%) presented with peripheral lymphadenopathy and 59 of them (55.7%) had mediastinal masses. Ninety-one cases (85.8%) were in stage III or IV at diagnosis. The 1-year and 5-year survival rates in patients with T-LBL/ALL were 36.1% and 8.1%, respectively. Patients older than 25 years and those presented in stage III or IV suggested a poor prognosis (P = 0.049 and 0.001, respectively). On the other hand, 29 of the 153 cases (19.0%) belonged to B-LBL/ALL. The median age of the patients was 14 years (ranged from 9 months to 75 years). The male-to-female ratio was 1.6:1 (including 18 males and 11 females). Seventeen patients (58.6%) presented with peripheral lymphadenopathy and 13 of them (44.8%) had involvement of bone marrow or peripheral blood. Mediastinal involvement was found only in 5 cases (17.2%). Twenty-one patients (72.4%) were in stage III or IV at diagnosis. The 1-year and 5-year survival rates were 53.3% and 36.7%, respectively. The remaining 11.7% cases (18/153 cases) were categorized as undefined type, with a negative staining for the following immuno-markers including: CD3epsilon/CD3, CD45RO, CD79a, CD20, MPO, CD5, CD56, cyclin D1, cytokeratin, neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin A and synaptophysin. The median age of the patients was 15.5 years (ranged from 4 to 53 years). The male-to-female ratio was 2.6:1 (including 13 males and 5 females). The percentage of T-LBL/ALL patients with mediastinal masses were significantly higher than that of B-LBL/ALL cases (P = 0.0003). There was no significant difference in prognostic parameters of T-LBL/ALL and B-LBL/ALL (P = 0.07). The difference in median survival time however was statistically significant (6.0 months +/- 1.1 months versus 15.0 months +/- 7.0 months). CONCLUSIONS: Both TdT and CD99 are useful markers for the diagnosis of precursor lymphoblastic malignancy. T-LBL/ALL predominantly affects children or adolescent males and frequently presents with lymphadenopathy and mediastinal masses, whereas B-LBL/ALL are often accompanied by bone marrow and peripheral blood involvement. In general, T-LBL/ALL carries a poor prognosis. The prognostic criteria include age of older than 25 years and a classification of stage III or IV disease.","['Department of Pathology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This study included 88 children with ALL below the age of 18 years during the period from October 1, 2004 to June 30, 2007. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and clinical risk classification were done and the new chemotherapy regimen was used according to the protocol. Patients were stratified into low-risk (LR), medium-risk (MR), and high-risk (HR) groups. Life table method was used to estimate survival rate and statistical analysis was done by using software SPSS for Windows. RESULTS: From October 2004 to June 2007, 88 childhood ALL patients were treated with the 04 Protocol. Sixty-three (91.30%) patients attained complete remission (CR) and 17 patients lost to follow up. The overall 4-year-event-free survival (EFS) rate (+/- SE) was (59.73 +/- 7.22)%. EFS was (75.60 +/- 9.71)% in the LR (n = 30), (65.50 +/- 11.69)% in the MR (n = 20) and (44.03 +/- 12.36)% in the HR. Relapse occurred in 18.18% of patients. Seven (7.95%) of 88 patients with ALL died during he induction therapy. Infection was the most common cause of death. CONCLUSION: The outcome of patients treated with the 04 Protocol was favorable. Clinical risk classification and the leukemia cells of D19 are independent predictors of prognosis of ALL. High dose methotrexate played an important role in prevention and treatment of central nervous system leukemia. The mortality rate of this chemotherapeutic protocol during induction therapy was high.","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Chongqing Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The data of cancer incidence and mortality of children during 2000-2004 were collected from Guangzhou Population-based Cancer Registry, and were calculated and analyzed. RESULTS: The cancer incidence of children between 2000 and 2004 in Guangzhou was 17.91 per 100,000 (18.92 per 100,000 in males, 16.70 per 100,000 in females); the cancer mortality was 4.73 per 100,000 (4.65 per 100,000 in males, 4.83 per 100,000 in females). The incidence of lymphoid leukemia ranked first followed by cancer of central nervous system and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Cancer incidence was 77.52 per 100 000 in children of less than one year old, 21.49 per 100,000 in 1-4 years, 9.66 per 100,000 in 5-9 years and 17.11 per 100 000 in 10-14 years, with significant difference among the four groups (Chi(2) = 307.602, P < 0.001).

Myeloid antigen expression was found in some of the patients, and its clinical significance is worth studying. This study was to compare the clinical features, short-term efficacy and survival of T-LBL patients with or without myeloid antigen expression so as to evaluate its prognostic significance. METHODS: Forty-five T-LBL patients, with a median age of 14 years, were treated at Sun Yet-sen University Cancer Center between January 2000 and July 2008. These patients were divided into myeloid antigen-positive group (My(+) group) and myeloid antigen-negative group (My(-) group) based on the flow cytometric (FCM) analysis in bone marrow or pleural fluid. Myeloid antigen expression and its correlation with the short-term efficacy and overall survival were assessed in the two groups. RESULTS: There were 18 patients (40.0%) in the My(+) group and 27 (60.0%) in the My(-) group. The myeloid antigen expression was negatively correlated with the initial level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), but not with other clinical features. The remission rate was lower in the My(+) group than in the My(-) group (38.8% vs. 70.3%, P = 0.028). The 2-year overall survival rate was lower in the My(+) group than in the My(-) group (51.9% vs. 78.7%, P = 0.036). By age subgroup analysis, there were no differences in response and survival rate among children and adolescents with or without myeloid antigen expression. But the remission rate and the 2-year overall survival rate were significantly lower in adult patients with myeloid antigen expression than in patients without it. Univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated that age and myeloid antigen expression were adverse prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: Myeloid antigen expression is a predictor of a poor response to chemotherapy, and adverse prognostic factor in adult T-LBL, but not in children with T-LBL.","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510060, P.R.

Therefore, potent inhibitors of mammalian PNP are expected to act as selective immunosuppressive agents against, for example, T-cell cancers and some autoimmune diseases. 9-(5',5'-difluoro-5'-phosphonopentyl)-9-deazaguanine (DFPP-DG) was found to be a slow- and tight-binding inhibitor of mammalian PNP. The inhibition constant at equilibrium (1 mm phosphate concentration) with calf spleen PNP was shown to be = 85 +/- 13 pm (pH 7.0, 25 degrees C), whereas the apparent inhibition constant determined by classical methods was two orders of magnitude higher ( = 4.4 +/- 0.6 nm). The rate constant for formation of the enzyme/inhibitor reversible complex is (8.4 +/- 0.5) x 10(5) m(-1).s(-1), which is a value that is too low to be diffusion-controlled. The picomolar binding of DFPP-DG was confirmed by fluorimetric titration, which led to a dissociation constant of 254 pm (68% confidence interval is 147-389 pm). Stopped-flow experiments, together with the above data, are most consistent with a two-step binding mechanism: E + I <--> (EI) <--> (EI)*. The rate constants for reversible enzyme/inhibitor complex formation (EI), and for the conformational change (EI) <--> (EI)*, are k(on1) = (17.46 +/- 0.05) x 10(5) m(-1).s(-1), k(off1) = (0.021 +/- 0.003) s(-1), k(on2) = (1.22 +/- 0.08) s(-1) and k(off2) = (0.024 +/- 0.005) s(-1), respectively. This leads to inhibition constants for the first (EI) and second (EI)* complexes of K(i) = 12.1 nM (68% confidence interval is 8.7-15.5 nm) and = 237 pm (68% confidence interval is 123-401 pm), respectively. At a concentration of 10(-4) m, DFPP-DG exhibits weak, but statistically significant, inhibition of the growth of cell lines sensible to inhibition of PNP activity, such as human adult T-cell leukaemia and lymphoma (Jurkat, HuT78 and CCRF-CEM). Similar inhibitory activities of the tested compound were noted on the growth of lymphocytes collected from patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease. The observed weak cytotoxicity may be a result of poor membrane permeability.","['Department of Biophysics, Institute of Experimental Physics, Warsaw University, Poland.']",20100224,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The intrinsic complexity of this group of disorders and the frequent association with one or more comorbidities have limited for many years the number of effective treatment options available: most patients are, indeed, still managed by supportive care measures, with just a minority of them being eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which is still the only potentially curative modality. In the last two decades, the progressively better understanding of MDS biology has shown how an abnormal epigenetic modulation might play a crucial part in the pathogenesis and in the process of biologic evolution of these disorders. Moreover, pharmacological agents that target the so-called epigenome have shown a significant clinical activity for diverse hematologic malignancies, including MDS. The aim of this review is to highlight recent developments within the context of current knowledge of MDS and its altered epigenetic regulation and to recall the experimental steps that have brought to the clinical development and application of epigenetic modifiers, such as azacytidine and decitabine, trying to explain the biologic rationale for their use in this setting.","['Division of Hematology, University of Messina, Messina, Italy. cmusolino@unime.it']",20100223,,,76,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The infection efficiency of the virus, however, varies greatly among target cells. In this report, we compared the ability of SIN to infect colorectal cancer cells and cells of other cancer origin. While tumor cells from breast, leukemia, and prostate cancers were largely resistant to SIN infection, nine of the ten colorectal cancer cell lines tested were sensitive to SIN infection. Moreover, SIN susceptibility correlated with the metastatic potential of the colorectal cancer cells. Two highly aggressive and invasive cell lines, SW620 and COLO-320DM were the most sensitive to SIN infection. Similarly, SIN preferentially targeted metastatic tumor cells in a mouse xenograft model for colon cancer progression. The higher infection rate was not due to increased expression of the 67kD laminin receptor, a specific receptor for SIN infection, although viral attachment and entry were markedly enhanced in SW620 cells. These results suggest that SIN may employ a novel cell attachment/entry mechanism during infection, allowing selective targeting of colorectal cancer cells.","['Department of Pathology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73190, USA.']",,,,,,,['J Exp Ther Oncol. 2010;8(3):267; author reply 267.

WP1066 inhibited constitutive and inducible STAT3 phosphorylation in both dose- and time-dependant manners. Further, the nuclear translocation of STAT3 was completely inhibited, resulting in decreased DNA binding activity. In vivo testing of WP1066 in a nude mouse orthotopic model of HNSCC demonstrated significant anti-tumor effects, with histological evidence of decreased cellular proliferation and angiogenesis.

Signaling molecules with other cells and bone marrow stroma are part of the leukemic cells phenotype. Genetic and molecular abnormalities have the main prognostic significance and confer the leukemic cell status. The main aim of the current study is to identify correlation between recognized prognostic factors in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and other phenotypic markers. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Imunophenotypic analysis (BDFACS CantoII, FACSDiva Software) was performed on peripheral blood/bone marrow aspirate samples of 56 patients diagnosed with AML (9 M0, 3 M1, 10 M2, 4 M3, 28 M4/M5, 1 M6, 1 M7) between 2007-2009 in Hematology Department of ""Sf. Spiridon"" Hospital Iasi. We used an extended panel of monoclonal antibodies and we determined the level of expression of cytokines receptors (IL3Ra, IL7R) and chemokines (CXCR4, CKR5). RESULTS: In our study, IL7R expression on AML blasts was significant correlate with low WBC count at diagnosis (p = 0.04) and with multilinear displasia (p = 0.01), high CXCR4 expression was correlate (p = 0.05) with lack of response at first induction therapy and CD123 (IL3Ra) expression was correlate with M4 FAB phenotype. Survival was negative influenced by presence of IL3R on AML blasts, but flt3 mutations, CXCR4, IL7R expression on leukemic cells, other phenotypic aberrancies did not influenced treatment response and survival in our patients population. CONCLUSION: Complete investigation of leukemic cells phenotype extended with cytokines/chemokines receptors at diagnostic is useful for correct characterization of the disease, for discover new prognostic categories and for better identification of minimal residual disease.","['Facultatea de Medicina, Disciplina de Hematologie, Universitatea de Medicina si Farmacie ""Gr.T.

The classic MPNs were polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and chronic myelogenous leukemia. They were originally grouped together based on their shared phenotype of myeloproliferation. Since then, important discoveries have been made, identifying a central role of protein tyrosine kinases in the pathogenesis of these disorders. As such, the 2008 WHO diagnostic classification for myeloproliferative neoplasms has incorporated molecular markers with histologic, clinical and laboratory information into the diagnostic algorithms for the MPNs. Important changes include (1) the change of nomenclature of myeloproliferative disorder to myeloproliferative neoplasm emphasizing the clonal nature of these disorders; (2) the classification of mast cell disease as an MPN; (3) the reorganization of the eosinophilic disorders into a molecularly defined category of PDGFRA, PDGFRB and FGFR1-associated myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified; and (4) refinement of the diagnostic criteria for PV, ET and PMF incorporating recently described molecular markers, JAK2V617F, JAK2 exon 12 mutations and MPL mutations.

The current model for the pathophysiology of acute GvHD describes a series of immune pathways that lead to activation of donor T cells and inflammatory cytokines responsible for tissue damage in acute GvHD. This model does not account for how allotransplant can lead to GvL effects without GvHD, or how the initial activation of donor immune cells may lead to counter-regulatory effects that limit GvHD. In this review, we will summarize new findings that support a more complex model for the initiation of GvHD and GvL activities in allogeneic HSCT, and discuss the potential of novel strategies to enhance GvL activity of the transplant.","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Winship Cancer Institute, 1365C Clifton Road NE, Room C4002, Atlanta, GA 3032, USA.']",,,,,"['R01 CA074364/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA074364-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS132027'],,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging of the lumbar spine was performed in 26 patients with histologically proven diffuse bone marrow infiltration, including multiple myeloma (n = 6), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 6), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 5), chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 7), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 2). Twenty subjects whose spinal MRI was normal, made up the control group. Peak enhancement percentage (E(max)), enhancement slope (ES), and time to peak (TTP) were determined from a time-intensity curve (TIC) of lumbar vertebral bone marrow. A comparison between baseline and follow-up MR images and its histological correlation were evaluated in 10 patients. The infiltration grade of hematopoietic marrow with plasma cells was evaluated by a histological assessment of bone marrow. RESULTS: Differences in E(max), ES, and TTP values between the control group and the patients with diffuse bone marrow infiltration were significant (t = -11.51, -9.81 and 3.91, respectively, p < 0.01). E(max), ES, and TTP values were significantly different between bone marrow infiltration groups Grade 1 and Grade 2 (Z = -2.72, -2.24 and -2.89 respectively, p < 0.05). E(max), ES and TTP values were not significantly different between bone marrow infiltration groups Grade 2 and Grade 3 (Z = -1.57, -1.82 and -1.58 respectively, p > 0.05). A positive correlation was found between E(max), ES values and the histological grade of bone marrow infiltration (r = 0.86 and 0.84 respectively, p < 0.01). A negative correlation was found between the TTP values and bone marrow infiltration histological grade (r = -0.54, p < 0.01). A decrease in the E(max) and ES values was observed with increased TTP values after treatment in all of the 10 patients who responded to treatment (t = -7.92, -4.55, and 5.12, respectively, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: DCE-MRI of spine can be a useful tool in detecting diffuse marrow infiltration of hematological malignancies, while its parameters including E(max), ES, and TTP can reflect the malignancies' histological grade.","['Department of Radiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. zhayunfei@hotmail.com']",20100222,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine hundred one patients who underwent medical treatment for malignant hematologic disease and 40,543 patients who visited the emergency room and without malignant hematologic diseases were included in our study. The patients with malignant hematologic diseases were divided into two groups depending on their primary treatment. Group I included patients with acute and chronic leukemia (AML, ALL, CML, CLL) for which chemotherapy and steroid therapy was necessary, and group II included patients with anaplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome and who had undergone repeated transfusion for treatment. Comparisons were made between the two groups in respect to the incidence of urolithiasis and the stones' radiopacity. RESULTS: Twenty nine patients (3.2%) of the 901 malignant hematologic patients were diagnosed with urolithiasis, compared to 575 patients (1.4%) of 40,543 emergency room patients. There was a significant increase of the incidence of urolithiasis in the malignant hematologic group. Compared to the general patients, the patients with malignant hematologic diseases had a higher rate of radiolucent stones (46.6% versus 16.3%, respectively), and the difference was significant. CONCLUSION: The incidence of urolithiasis for malignant hematologic patients was significantly higher than that for the control group.","['Department of Urology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",20100212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This genetic subgroup of leukemia is associated with near-triploidy, near-tetraploidy, and trisomy 21 as rather specific types of secondary changes. Here, we show that, unlike various controls, E/R-expressing Ba/F3 clones acquire a tetraploid karyotype on prolonged culture, corroborating the assumption that E/R may attenuate the mitotic checkpoint (MC). Consistent with this notion, E/R-expressing diploid murine and human cell lines have decreased proportions of cells with 4N DNA content and a lower mitotic index when treated with spindle toxins. Moreover, both RUNX1 and E/R regulate mitotic arrest-deficient 2 L1 (MAD2L1), an essential MC component, by binding to promoter-inherent RUNX1 sites, which results in down-regulation of MAD2L1 mRNA and protein in E/R-expressing cells. Forced expression of E/R also abolishes RUNX1-induced reporter activation, whereas E/R with a mutant DNA-binding site leads to only minor effects. Our data link for the first time E/R, MC, and MAD2L1 and provide new insights into the function of the E/R fusion gene product. Although tetraploidy is an almost exclusive feature of E/R-positive leukemias, its rarity within this particular subgroup implies that further yet unknown factors are required for its manifestation.","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria.""]",20100301,,,,['P 17551/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],['EMS32872'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, the miR-17-92 cluster, containing six individual miRNAs, is highly expressed in haematopoietic cancers and promotes lymphomagenesis in vivo. Clinical use of these findings hinges on isolating the oncogenic activity within the 17-92 cluster and defining its relevant target genes. Here we show that miR-19 is sufficient to promote leukaemogenesis in Notch1-induced T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) in vivo. In concord with the pathogenic importance of this interaction in T-ALL, we report a novel translocation that targets the 17-92 cluster and coincides with a second rearrangement that activates Notch1. To identify the miR-19 targets responsible for its oncogenic action, we conducted a large-scale short hairpin RNA screen for genes whose knockdown can phenocopy miR-19. Strikingly, the results of this screen were enriched for miR-19 target genes, and include Bim (Bcl2L11), AMP-activated kinase (Prkaa1) and the phosphatases Pten and PP2A (Ppp2r5e). Hence, an unbiased, functional genomics approach reveals a coordinate clampdown on several regulators of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase-related survival signals by the leukaemogenic miR-19.","['Cancer Biology & Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",20100228,,,,"['R01CA120196,/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK056465/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA142798/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA120196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA142798-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS249017'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Metabolic disturbances are thought to be the primary cause of clinical ATLS symptoms, which include renal dysfunction, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias. The histopathologic lesions associated with organ dysfunction are largely unknown because of the low rate of mortality of ATLS in humans and the few cases of ATLS identified in laboratory animals. Here, we describe histologic, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic analyses of thirty-one ATLS cases from a cohort of 499 mice that are prone to spontaneous lymphoblastic lymphoma owing to genetic defects in DNA replication fidelity. Seventy-three percent of our cohort died with lymphoblastic lymphoma, and 8% of affected mice died with diffuse microthromboemboli consistent with ATLS. Mice with ATLS had a high spontaneous mortality rate (>50%), a large tumor burden with disseminated disease, and evidence of leukemia. Blood vessels in the lung, kidney, and other organs were occluded by microthromboemboli composed of chromatin, cellular debris, fibrin, platelets, and entrapped erythrocytes and malignant cells. This case series suggests that ATLS can occur at high frequency in mice with disseminated lymphoblastic lymphoma and leads to a high rate of spontaneous death from microthromboemboli.","['Department of Comparative Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-7190, USA. ttreuting@u.washington.edu']",20100226,,,,"['P01 AG01751/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA77852/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES07033/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098243/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA111582/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES09927/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 ES11045/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In AML patient blasts without p15INK4b DNA methylation, a bivalent pattern of active (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) modifications exist at the p15INK4b promoter. AML patient blasts with p15INK4b DNA methylation lose H3K4me3 at p15INK4b and become exclusively marked by H3K27me3. H3K27me3, as well as EZH2, extends throughout p14ARF and p16INK4a, indicating that polycomb repression of p15INK4b is a common feature in all AML blasts irrespective of the DNA methylation status of the gene. Reactivation of p15INK4b expression in AML cell lines and patient blasts using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) and trichostatin A increased H3K4me3 and maintained H3K27me3 enrichment at p15INK4b.

GCS-100 induced inhibition of proliferation, accumulation of cells in sub-G(1) and G(1) phases, and apoptosis with activation of both caspase-8 and -9 pathways. Dose- and time-dependent decreases in MCL-1 and BCL-X(L) levels also occurred, accompanied by a rapid induction of NOXA protein, whereas BCL-2, BAX, BAK, BIM, BAD, BID, and PUMA remained unchanged. The cell-cycle inhibitor p21(Cip1) was up-regulated by GCS-100, whereas the procycling proteins CYCLIN E2, CYCLIN D2, and CDK6 were all reduced. Reduction in signal transduction was associated with lower levels of activated IkappaBalpha, IkappaB kinase, and AKT as well as lack of IkappaBalpha and AKT activation after appropriate cytokine stimulation (insulin-like growth factor-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha).

An interaction between anti-apoptotic Bcl-x(L) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized inositol trisphosphate receptor Ca(2+) release channel (InsP(3)R) enables Bcl-x(L) to be fully efficacious as an anti-apoptotic mediator (White, C., Li, C., Yang, J., Petrenko, N. B., Madesh, M., Thompson, C. B., and Foskett, J. K. (2005) Nat. Cell Biol. 7, 1021-1028). Physiologically, Bcl-x(L) binds to the InsP(3)R to enhance its gating and Ca(2+) signaling. Here we have discovered that structurally related proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 function similarly. Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) bind with comparable affinity to the carboxyl termini of all three mammalian InsP(3)R isoforms with important functional consequences. Stable expression of Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 lowered ER Ca(2+) content and enhanced the rate of InsP(3)-mediated Ca(2+) release in response to submaximal InsP(3) stimulation in permeabilized wild-type DT40 cells but not in cells lacking InsP(3)R. In addition, expression of either Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 enhanced spontaneous InsP(3)R-dependent Ca(2+) oscillations and spiking in intact cells in the absence of agonist stimulation. Bcl-2- and Mcl-1-mediated protection from apoptosis induced by staurosporine or etoposide was enhanced in cells expressing InsP(3)R, demonstrating that their interactions with InsP(3)R enable Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 to be fully efficacious anti-apoptotic mediators. Our data suggest a molecular mechanism that is shared by several anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins that provides apoptosis resistance by direct interactions at the ER with the InsP(3)R that impinges on cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis.","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, North Chicago, Illinois 60064, USA.']",20100226,,,,"['R01 DK056328/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM056328/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM/DK56328/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Three-hundred and four consecutive patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukaemia were evaluated between January 2001 to December 2007, for event-free survival, overall survival, complete cytogenetic response and toxicity profiles. Event-free and overall survivals were calculated by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate the prognostic factors for survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for factors predictive of a complete cytogenetic response. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 48 months. Estimated 5-year event-free and overall survivals of all patients were 79% and 86%, respectively. On Cox regression analysis significant predictive factors for event-free survival were age < 50 years (P 0.002), complete cytogenetic response (P < 0.0001), low Sokal score (P 0.007), complete clinical (P < 0.0001) and haematological response (P < 0.0001). Complete cytogenetic response was achieved in 206 (67.8%) patients. On multivariate analysis, low Sokal score (P < 0.0001) and early chronic phase disease (P < 0.0001) emerged as the most significant predictors for achieving a complete cytogenetic response. An estimated 5.8% patients lost their complete cytogenetic response. Grade III/IV toxicity was observed in only 21 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with Imatinib mesylate results in superior and durable responses in chronic phase chronic myeloid leukaemia. Our survival outcomes are similar to reported rates in the Western population.","['Department of Oncology, Allama Iqbal Medical College, Lahore, Pakistan. azizzeba@gmail.com']",20100226,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One class of these chemicals is the halogenated acetaldehydes (HAs), identified in high quantities when ozone is used as primary or secondary disinfectant. In this study, an analysis of the genotoxic potential of two HAs, namely tribromoacetaldehyde (TBA) and chloral hydrate (CH) has been conducted in human cells (TK6 cultured cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes). The comet assay was used to 1) measure the induction of single and double-strand DNA breaks, 2) evaluate the capacity of inducing oxidative DNA damage, and 3) determine the DNA repair kinetics of the induced primary genetic damage. In addition, chromosome damage, as a measure of fixed damage, was evaluated by means of the micronucleus test. The results of the comet assay show that both compounds are clearly genotoxic, inducing high levels of DNA breaks, TBA being more effective than CH. According to the comet results, both HAs produce high levels of oxidized bases, and the induced DNA damage is rapidly repaired over time. Contrarily, the results obtained in the micronucleus test, which measures the capacity of genotoxic agents to induce clastogenic and aneugenic effects, are negative for the two HAs tested, either using TK6 cells or human peripheral blood lymphocytes. This would indicate that the primary damage induced by the two HAs is not fixed as chromosome damage, possibly due to an efficient repair or the death of damaged cells, which is an important point in terms of risk assessment of DBPs exposure.","['Grup de Mutagenesi, Departament de Genetica i de Microbiologia, Facultat de Biociencies, Edifici Cn, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08193 Bellaterra, Cerdanyola del Valles, Spain.']",20100210,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to confirm or refute these findings. In 1996, a cohort of 6940 individuals was recruited, and information on chronic pain, general health and socio-demographic details collected. Ten years later, a record linkage study was conducted between these data and the routinely collected national dataset for cancer registration. Hazard ratios for the incidence of all cancers and eight cancer-specific sites by chronic pain status were calculated. Eighty-four percent of individuals from the original cohort were linked. After excluding those with a known previous cancer diagnosis, all non-melanoma skin cancers and cancers which were not first occurrences, a total of 646 cancers had occurred in 607 people since the baseline study. The overall cancer incidence in the cohort was 10.4% over the 10 years. There were no significant associations between chronic pain and all cancer, or any of the eight cancer-specific sites, after adjustment for age and sex. There was a significant increased risk of developing lymphoma/leukaemia amongst those with all chronic pain and various causes of chronic pain on univariate analysis. After adjustment, these trends remained, although most of the associations were no longer significant. There were no significant differences between those with severe chronic pain compared to those with mild chronic pain. The findings suggest that those with chronic pain are not at a significantly increased risk of developing cancer.","['Aberdeen Pain Research Collaboration, Centre of Academic Primary Care, University of Aberdeen, UK. a.m.elliott@abdn.ac.uk']",20100226,,,,['CZG/2/287/CSO_/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom'],,,,"['Copyright 2010 European Federation of International Association for the Study of', 'Pain Chapters.

It is notoriously resistant to all of the current therapeutic modalities, including chemotherapy. Suppressed apoptosis and extraordinary invasiveness are the distinctive features that contribute to the malignancy of melanoma. Dacarbazine (DTIC) has been considered as the gold standard for melanoma treatment with a response rate of 15-20%. Unfortunately, the resistance to this chemotherapeutic agent occurs frequently. ZD55-IL-24 is a selective conditionally replicating adenovirus that can mediate the expression of interleukin-24 (IL-24) gene, which has a strong anti-tumor effect. In this study, we hypothesized that a combination of ZD55-IL-24-mediated gene virotherapy and chemotherapy using DTIC would produce an increased cytotoxicity against human melanoma cells in comparison with these agents alone. Our results showed that the combination of ZD55-IL-24 and DTIC significantly enhanced the anti-tumor activity by more effectively inducing apoptosis in melanoma cells than either agent used alone without any overlapping toxicity against normal cells. This additive or synergistic effect of ZD55-IL-24 in combination with DTIC in killing human malignant melanoma cells implies a promising novel approach for melanoma therapy.","['Department of Dermatology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou 221002, China.']",20100226,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Recent studies performed using synthetic p13 and isolated mitochondria demonstrated that the protein triggers an inward potassium (K+) current and inner membrane depolarization. The present study investigated the effects of p13 on mitochondrial inner membrane potential (Deltapsi) in living cells. Using the potential-dependent probe tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester (TMRM), we observed that p13 induced dose-dependent mitochondrial depolarization in HeLa cells. This effect was abolished upon mutation of 4 arginines in p13's alpha-helical domain that were previously shown to be essential for its activity in in vitro assays. As Deltapsi is known to control mitochondrial calcium (Ca2+) uptake, we next analyzed the effect of p13 on Ca2+ homeostasis. Experiments carried out in HeLa cells expressing p13 and organelle-targeted aequorins revealed that the protein specifically reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake.

The role of caspases in this process is a matter of controversy. We have analyzed the relative contribution of caspases and Bcl-2 family of proteins in the induction phase of apoptosis triggered by doxorubicin in two p53-deficient leukemia cell lines, Jurkat and U937. First, we have found that caspases are dispensable for the induction phase of doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in both cell lines but they are needed to speed up the execution phase in Jurkat cells, not expressing Bax. Thus, down-regulation of Bak expression by siRNA significantly prevented doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in Jurkat but not in U937 cells. Reduction of Mcl-1 protein levels with siRNA increased sensitivity to apoptosis in both cell lines. Moreover, our results indicate that the contribution of BH3-only proteins to apoptosis is cell line specific. In Jurkat cells simultaneous silencing of Bim and PUMA was necessary to reduce doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. In U937 cells silencing of Bim or Noxa reduced sensitivity to doxorubicin. Immunoprecipitation experiments discarded an interaction between Mcl-1 and Bak in both cell lines and underscored the role of Bim and PUMA as mediators of Bax/Bak activation.","['Departamento de Bioquimica, Biologia Molecular y Celular, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Zaragoza, Pedro Cerbuna 12, 50009 Zaragoza, Spain.']",20100224,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

A total of 22 genes related to heat shock response, apoptosis signaling, detoxifiers and Phase II enzymes, and regulators of cell growth were altered in expression by array analysis based on the expression fold change criteria of > or =1.5-fold or < or =0.65-fold. Real time quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that 20microM p-NO-ASA strongly upregulated the mRNA levels of two heat shock genes HSPA1A (41.5+/-7.01-fold) and HSPA6 (100.4+/-8.11-fold), and FOS (16.2+/-3.2-fold), moderately upregulated HSPH1 (1.71+/-0.43-fold), FMO4 (4.5+/-1.67-fold), CASP9 (1.77+/-0.03-fold), DDIT3 (5.6+/-0.51-fold), and downregulated NF-kappaB1 (0.54+/-0.01-fold) and CCND1 (0.69+/-0.06-fold).

It was found that toxin--induced apoptotic cell death was attributed mainly to activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsim). Subsequent modulation of Bcl-2 family member and cytochrome c release accompanied with activation of caspase-9 and -3 were involved in the death of U937 cells. SB202190 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) and N-acetylcysteine (antioxidant) significantly attenuated toxin--induced cell death and loss of deltapsim, and completely abolished the production of ROS. In contrast to N-acetylcysteine, degradation of Bcl-2/Bcl-XL and mitochondrial localization of Bax were notably decreased by SB202190. Inhibitors of electron transport (rotenone and antimycin A) or inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (cyclosporine A) reduced the effect of toxin- on ROS generation, loss of deltapsim and cytochrome c release. Noticeably, pre-treatment with N-acetylcysteine or rotenone eliminated markedly ROS accompanied with reduction in p38 MAPK activation. Taken together, these results suggest that the cytotoxicity of toxin- is initiated by p38-MAPK-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction followed by ROS production and activation of caspases, and that ROS further augments p38 MAPK activation and mitochondrial alteration.","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University - Kaohsiung Medical University Joint Research Center, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University - Kaohsiung Medical University Joint Research Center, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: To evaluate whether the tolerability of this regimen could be enhanced without sacrificing efficacy, a phase 2 trial was conducted of P and R without C, using a higher P dose (4 mg/m(2)). Among the 33 patients enrolled, 82% were male, the median age was 65 years (9 patients were aged >or=70 years), and 64% were classified as having Rai stage III to IV disease. RESULTS: The OR rate was 76%, with 9 CRs (27%), 5 nodular partial responses, and 11 partial responses (PRs) reported. At the time of last follow-up, 29 of 33 patients were still alive at a median follow-up of 14 months (range, 1-34.8 months). Four (12%) patients experienced grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity, and 5 (15%) experienced grade 3 or higher nonhematologic toxicity. Comparison of this trial with the previous PCR trial demonstrated that patients treated with PCR had a higher OR rate (91% vs 76%) and CR rate (41% vs 27%) compared with patients treated with PR. The median treatment-free survival for all accrued patients was notably longer in patients treated with PCR compared with PR (30 months vs 16 months). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the current study suggest that increasing the dose of the purine nucleoside analogue does not eliminate the need for cyclophosphamide in chemoimmunotherapy for the treatment of CLL.","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA. kay.neil@mayo.edu']",,,,,"['M01 RR000585/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095241-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95241/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA113408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA136591/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA113408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR000585-332094/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095241/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS219527'],,,['(c) 2010 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have disclosed that arsenite effectively induces the apoptotic response in the HepG2 human hepatoma cells by triggering GADD45alpha induction and the subsequent activation of JNKs/AP-1 cell death pathway. However, signaling events relating to GADD45alpha/JNKs/AP-1 pathway activation have not been observed in HL7702 human diploid hepatic cells under the same arsenite exposure condition. Our results thus have illustrated the selective pro-apoptotic role of arsenite in the hepatoma cells by activating GADD45alpha-dependent cell death pathway whereas with little effect on the normal hepatic cells. The approaches to up-regulate GADD45alpha levels might be helpful in improving the chemotherapeutic action of arsenite on certain solid tumors including hepatoma.","['Department of Cellular Immunology, Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, 27 Taiping Road, Beijing 100850, PR China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many approaches have been used to reduce MDR; however, the results are poor. It has been reported that iron deprivation downregulates MDR genes. To investigate the relationship of iron with MDR and early growth response gene-1 (EGR1), we investigated the effect of iron deprivation on expression and/or function of multidrug resistance-1 (MDR1), early growth response gene-1 (EGR1), ferritin heavy chain gene (H-Fn) and MDR1-encoded P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the K562 leukemic cell line. METHODS: The cells were stimulated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and incubated with either FeCl(3) or the iron-chelating drug DFO. The mRNA levels of MDR1, EGR1 and H-Fn were detected by RT-PCR. The protein expression and function of P-gp were measured by immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS: DFO significantly reduced the intracellular iron level, and led to approximately 70% reduction of MDR1 mRNA, approximately 50% of reduction of H-Fn mRNA and approximately 30% reduction of P-gp protein in TPA-differentiated K562 cells. The P-gp pump function, measured by daunorubicin exclusion, was also reduced by DFO treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a close relationship between iron deprivation and reduced MDR1/P-gp expression and function.

Autoimmune diseases and chronic infections, such as hepatitis C, are commonly recognized causes of MPGN; however, monoclonal gammopathy is a less widely recognized cause of MPGN. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We reviewed all renal biopsies of MPGN in Mayo Clinic patients during a 6-year period to determine the association of monoclonal gammopathy with MPGN. Results were correlated with electrophoresis studies and bone marrow biopsies to clarify the relationship between MPGN and gammopathies. RESULTS: Of 126 patients with MPGN, 20 did not have workup for hepatitis B or C. Of the remaining 106 patients, 25 (23.5%) were positive for hepatitis B or C. Of the 81 hepatitis-negative patients, 13 were not evaluated for gammopathies. Of the remaining 68 patients, 28 (41.1%) had serum and/or urine electrophoresis studies positive for monoclonal gammopathy. Serum immunofixation electrophoresis was the most sensitive method for diagnosing monoclonal gammopathy. Renal biopsy showed a membranoproliferative pattern of injury; immunofluorescence microscopy was often instrumental in diagnosing the underlying gammopathy. On the basis of the bone marrow biopsy, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance was the most common entity associated with MPGN. Other, less common causes included multiple myeloma, low-grade B cell lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Monoclonal gammopathy is an important and common cause of MPGN; therefore, all patients with a diagnosis of MPGN should be evaluated for an underlying monoclonal gammopathy.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. sethi.sanjeev@mayo.edu']",20100225,,,,"['R01 DK074409/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK074409/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that murine T cells lacking CCR7 (CCR7(-/-)) generate attenuated graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) responses compared with wild-type (WT) cells, with the difference varying inversely with the degree of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) disparity between the donor and recipient. CCR7(-/-) T cells exhibited an impaired ability to traffic to recipient lymph nodes, with an increased capacity to home to the spleen. CCR7(-/-) T cells, however, demonstrated a reduced ability to undergo in vivo expansion in the spleen due to impaired interactions with splenic antigen-presenting cells. On a cellular level, CCR7(-/-) T cells were functionally competent, demonstrating a normal in vitro proliferative capacity and a preserved ability to produce inflammatory cytokines. Importantly, CCR7(-/-) T cells were capable of generating robust graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) responses in vivo, as well as complete donor T-cell reconstitution. CCR7(-/-) regulatory T cells were able to protect against lethal GVHD when administered before WT conventional T cells. Our data suggest that CCR7 inhibition in the early posttransplantation period may represent a feasible new therapeutic approach for acute GVHD attenuation without compromising GVL responses.","['Department of Medicine, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA. jcoghill@unch.unc.edu']",20100225,,,,"['K12 CA120780/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 AI072827/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AI056299/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007149/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA102052/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI 34495/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI064363/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI034495/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA72669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 AI072827-01A2/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL056067/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA072669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA142106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL56067/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA065493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['Blood. 2010 Jun 10;115(23):4628-30.

However, the genetic hierarchy governing the emergence of HSCs remains elusive. We report here that zebrafish ets1-related protein (etsrp), which is essential for vascular endothelial development, also plays a critical role in the initiation of definitive hematopoiesis by controlling the expression of 2 stem cell leukemia (scl) isoforms (scl-alpha and scl-beta) in angioblasts. In etsrp morphants, which are deficient in endothelial and HSC development, scl-alpha alone partially rescues angioblast specification, arterial-venous differentiation, and the expression of HSC markers, runx1 and c-myb, whereas scl-beta requires angioblast rescue by fli1a to restore runx1 expression. Interestingly, when vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) signaling is inhibited, HSC marker expression can still be restored by scl-alpha in etsrp morphants, whereas the rescue of arterial ephrinb2a expression is blocked. Furthermore, both scl isoforms partially rescue runx1 but not ephrinb2a expression in embryos deficient in Vegf signaling. Our data suggest that downstream of etsrp, scl-alpha and fli1a specify the angioblasts, whereas scl-beta further initiates HSC specification from this angioblast population, and that Vegf signaling acts upstream of scl-beta during definitive hematopoiesis.","['Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Differentiation, Center of Developmental Biology and Genetics, College of Life Sciences, Peking University, Ministry of Education, China.']",20100225,,,,"['Z01 DK054508/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK054508/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '5F31HL091713-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK054508-13/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 HL091713/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously found that NF-kappaB induces transcription of bfl-1 and that the Bfl-1 protein is also regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. However, the role that dysregulation of Bfl-1 turnover plays in cancer is not known. Here we show that ubiquitination-resistant mutants of Bfl-1 display increased stability and greatly accelerated tumor formation in a mouse model of leukemia/lymphoma. We also show that tyrosine kinase Lck is up-regulated and activated in these tumors and leads to activation of the IkappaB kinase, Akt, and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase signaling pathways, which are key mediators in cancer. Coexpression of Bfl-1 and constitutively active Lck promoted tumor formation, whereas Lck knockdown in tumor-derived cells suppressed leukemia/lymphomagenesis. These data demonstrate that ubiquitination is a critical tumor suppression mechanism regulating Bfl-1 function and suggest that mutations in bfl-1 or in the signaling pathways that control its ubiquitination may predispose one to cancer. Furthermore, because bfl-1 is up-regulated in many human hematopoietic tumors, this finding suggests that strategies to promote Bfl-1 ubiquitination may improve therapy.","['Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ)--Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, USA.']",20100225,,,,"['R01 CA083937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA053370/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA083937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37CA53370/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixteen identical target loci present in HT-1080 human sarcoma cells were all successfully corrected by gene targeting. The gene targeting frequencies varied by as much as 10-fold, and there was a clear bias for correction of one of the targets in clones containing two target sites. The targeting frequency at each site was correlated to the proximity and density of various genomic elements, and we found a significant association of higher targeting frequencies at loci near a subset of dinucleotide microsatellite repeats (r = -0.55, P < 0.05), in particular GT repeats (r = -0.87, P < 0.0001). Additionally, there was a correlation between meiotic recombination rates and targeting frequencies at the target loci (r = 0.52, P < 0.05). There was no correlation between surrounding chromosomal transcription units and targeting frequencies.

Considering the potentially great medical and social relevance of such a discovery, we investigated whether this finding could be confirmed in an independent European cohort of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. DESIGN: Analysis of a well defined cohort of patients and matched neighbourhood controls by polymerase chain reaction. SETTING: Certified (ISO 15189) laboratory of clinical virology in a university hospital in the Netherlands. Population Between December 1991 and April 1992, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 76 patients and 69 matched neighbourhood controls. In this study we tested cells from 32 patients and 43 controls from whom original cryopreserved phials were still available. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detection of XMRV in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by real time polymerase chain reaction assay targeting the XMRV integrase gene and/or a nested polymerase chain reaction assay targeting the XMRV gag gene. RESULTS: We detected no XMRV sequences in any of the patients or controls in either of the assays, in which relevant positive and negative isolation controls and polymerase chain reaction controls were included. Spiking experiments showed that we were able to detect at least 10 copies of XMRV sequences per 10(5) peripheral blood mononuclear cells by real time as well as by nested polymerase chain reaction, demonstrating high sensitivity of both assays. CONCLUSIONS: This study failed to show the presence of XMRV in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome from a Dutch cohort. These data cast doubt on the claim that XMRV is associated with chronic fatigue syndrome in the majority of patients.","['Department of Medical Microbiology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, 6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands. f.vankuppeveld@ncmls.ru.nl']",20100225,,,,,,['BMJ. 2010;340:c1099.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study on 138 patients aged less than 60 years diagnosed with core binding factor acute myeloid leukaemia between 1994 and 2006, comparing allogeneic stem cell transplantation and high-dose cytarabine chemotherapy as post-remission treatment options after the first remission. RESULTS: The 5-year probabilities of disease-free survival and overall survival were not different between allogeneic stem cell transplantation and high-dose cytarabine groups. However, 3-year probabilities of disease-free survival (86.7% vs. 67.0%) and overall survival (90.0% vs. 67.3%) showed a trend towards improvement in the allogeneic stem cell transplantation group compared with the high-dose cytarabine group in cohort after 2003 (2003-2006), whereas outcomes were not different in cohort before 2003 (1994-2002). Especially, 3-year probabilities of disease-free survival (95.2% vs. 59.3%, P = 0.008) and overall survival (95.2% vs. 59.6%, P = 0.032) of allogeneic stem cell transplantation group were significantly better than high-dose cytarabine group in cohort after 2003 of acute myeloid leukaemia patients with t(8;21). The relative risk of overall survival with allogeneic stem cell transplantation, compared with high-dose cytarabine chemotherapy, was significantly improved in the cohort after 2003 (0.33; 95% CI, 0.07-1.48) when compared with that before 2003 (1.92; 95% CI, 0.77-4.82). In multivariate analysis in cohort after 2003, allogeneic stem cell transplantation as post-remission therapy was associated with better disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is currently the more effective post-remission therapy than it was prior to 2003 for core binding factor acute myeloid leukaemia achieving first remission.

These progenitors are considered to be self-renewing cells responsible for the in vivo long-term growth of neoplastic cells in leukemic patients. Therefore, these cells represent an attractive target of therapy. In some lymphoid leukemias, NOD/SCID mouse-repopulating cells were also reported to reside within the CD34+/Lin- subfraction of the clone. More recently, several attempts have been made to transfer the cancer stem cell concept to solid tumors and other non-hematopoietic neoplasms. In several of these tumors, the cell surface antigens AC133 (CD133) and CD44 are considered to indicate the potential of a cell to initiate permanent tumor formation in vivo. However, several questions concerning the phenotype, self-renewal capacity, stroma-dependence, and other properties of cancer- or leukemia-initiating cells remain to be solved. The current article provides a summary of our current knowledge on neoplastic (cancer) stem cells, with special emphasis on clinical implications and therapeutic options as well as a discussion about conceptual and technical limitations.","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. axel.schulenburg@meduniwien.ac.at']",20100225,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Overexpression of HIF-1 and increased transcriptional activity induced by hypoxia are linked to progression of many tumour types such as head and neck cancer, cervical carcinoma, leukaemia and renal cell carcinoma. In this study, we demonstrate that HIF activity is increased in malignant melanoma cells already under normoxic conditions in contrast to other tumour types. HIF-1alpha and -2alpha knockdown by siRNA transfection revealed that this effect is due to constitutive HIF-1alpha expression. Furthermore, the inhibition or activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) decreased or activated, respectively, HIF-1 activity and HIF-1alpha protein expression. Interestingly, the inhibition of the NFkappaB pathway also reduced the accumulation of HIF-1alpha assuming a context between ROS and NFkappaB, and suggesting that ROS and NFkappaB activity contribute to HIF-1alpha accumulation. In summary, we identified an increased HIF-1alpha protein expression and activity in melanoma under normoxia mediated by ROS and the NFkappaB pathway.","['University Medical Center Regensburg, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.']",20100223,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, efficient delivery into tumor cells remains a major obstacle for treatment. Here, we describe a liposomal siRNA carrier system for targeted delivery of siRNA to CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia cells. The siRNA is directed against the t(8;21) translocation resulting in the AML1/MTG8 fusion protein. The siRNA was encapsulated in free or polyethylene imine (PEI)-complexed form into PEGylated liposomes endowed subsequently with an anti-CD33 single-chain Fv fragment (scFv) for targeted delivery. The resulting siRNA-loaded immunoliposomes (IL) and immunolipoplexes (ILP) showed specific binding and internalization by CD33-expressing myeloid leukemia cell lines (SKNO-1, Kasumi-1). Targeted delivery of AML1/MTG8 siRNA, but not of mismatch control siRNA, reduced AML1/MTG8 mRNA and protein levels and decreased leukemic clonogenicity, a hallmark of leukemic self-renewal. Although this study revealed that further modifications are necessary to increase efficacy of siRNA delivery and silencing, we were able to establish a targeted liposomal siRNA delivery system combining recombinant antibody fragments for targeted delivery with tumor cell-specific siRNA molecules as therapeutic agents.","['Institut fur Zellbiologie und Immunologie, Universitat Stuttgart, Allmandring 31, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany.']",20100222,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

High throughput screens are required to identify epigenetic markers that can be useful for diagnostic and prognostic purposes across malignancies. RESULTS: Here we report for the first time the use of the MIRA assay (methylated CpG island recovery assay) in combination with genome-wide CpG island arrays to identify epigenetic molecular markers in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) on a genome-wide scale. We identified 30 genes demonstrating methylation frequencies of > or =25% in childhood ALL, nine genes showed significantly different methylation frequencies in B vs T-ALL. For majority of the genes expression could be restored in methylated leukemia lines after treatment with 5-azaDC. Forty-four percent of the genes represent targets of the polycomb complex. In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) two of the genes, (TFAP2A and EBF2), demonstrated increased methylation in blast crisis compared to chronic phase (P < 0.05). Furthermore hypermethylation of an autophagy related gene ATG16L2 was associated with poorer prognosis in terms of molecular response to Imatinib treatment. Lastly we demonstrated that ten of these genes were also frequently methylated in common epithelial cancers. CONCLUSION: In summary we have identified a large number of genes showing frequent methylation in childhood ALL, methylation status of two of these genes is associated with advanced disease in CML and methylation status of another gene is associated with prognosis. In addition a subset of these genes may act as epigenetic markers across hematological malignancies as well as common epithelial cancers.","['Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, School of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B152TT, UK.']",20100225,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three patients opted for supportive or palliative therapy and survived 1-4 months. Six patients received standard dose chemotherapy. Two patients with a normal karyotype had resistant AML and survived 1.0 and 2.7 months; one patient with a complex karyotype died of septic shock on the 10th day of therapy. All these three patients exhibited erythroblastic and/or megakaryocytic dysplasia (EMD) at presentation (two in more than 26% erythroblasts, all three in a half or more of megakaryocytes). Three remaining patients with AML M4, a normal karyotype but without EMD, achieved complete remission in spite of co-morbidities and a poor performance status. Two of them survived 18.6 and 28 months on maintenance therapy, the third 16.5 months without it. Very elderly AML patients without EMD appear to represent a favorable prognostic biological category (single-lineage AML) that show a good response to standard dose chemotherapy.",['Hematologicko-transfuzni oddeleni Nemocnice Jihlava. plemez@post.cz'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several statistical methods have been used in the field to identify differentially expressed genes. Since different methods generate different lists of genes, it is very challenging to determine the most reliable gene list and the appropriate method. This paper presents a multi-strategy method, in which a combination of several data analysis techniques are applied to a given dataset and a confidence measure is established to select genes from the gene lists generated by these techniques to form the core of our final selection. The remainder of the genes that form the peripheral region are subject to exclusion or inclusion into the final selection. This paper demonstrates this methodology through its application to an in-house cancer genomics dataset and a public dataset. The results indicate that our method provides more reliable list of genes, which are validated using biological knowledge, biological experiments, and literature search. We further evaluated our multi-strategy method by consolidating two pairs of independent datasets, each pair is for the same disease, but generated by different labs using different platforms. The results showed that our method has produced far better results.","['Institute for Information Technology, National Research Council Canada, Ottawa, Ontario K1A0R6, Canada. ziying.liu@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several molecular mechanisms have been attributed to its inhibitory effects on a wide range of tumor cells. In this study, the response of the chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562 cells to 1 is investigated. Curcumin inhibited the viability of K562 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, curcumin-induced cell death was associated with the formation of the apoptosome complex, the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase-3 activation. Curcumin treatment also induced Bid cleavage and downregulated the expression of Bcl-2 protein. Surprisingly, even with these molecular features of apoptosis, we showed that 1 stimulated autophagy, which was evidenced by microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) immunoreactivty. Curcumin also increased the protein levels of beclin 1 and membrane form LC3 (LC3-II). Autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 and the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk suppressed curcumin-induced K562 cell death. Overall, these results suggest that curcumin induces autophagic and apoptotic death of K562 cells. These findings suggest that both apoptotic and autophagic mechanisms contribute to the curcumin-induced K562 cell death.","['Department of Pharmacology, Soochow University School of Medicine, Suzhou, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During homeostasis, signals from this environment keep some HSCs dormant, which preserves long-term self-renewal potential, while other HSCs actively self renew to maintain haematopoiesis. In response to haematopoietic stress, dormant HSCs become activated and rapidly replenish the haematopoietic system. Interestingly, three factors - granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interferon-alpha and arsenic trioxide - have been shown to efficiently activate dormant stem cells and thereby could break their resistance to anti-proliferative chemotherapeutics. Thus, we propose that two-step strategies could target resistant leukaemic stem cells by priming tumours with activators of dormancy followed by chemotherapy or targeted therapies.","['Heidelberg Institute for Stem Cell Technology and Experimental Medicine, German Cancer Research Center, Germany. a.trumpp@dkfz.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enhancement of angiogenesis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been recognized more recently. Our study assesses CD34 and von Willebrand factor (vWf) expression and microvessel density (MVD) in the bone marrow of patients with CLL. AIMS: (1) To assess bone marrow MVD in CLL using 2 different monoclonal antibodies, CD34 and vWf; and (2) To examine the possible association of marrow MVD and clinical course, pattern of marrow infiltration, Rai stage, CD38 positivity, and cytogenetic abnormalities detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone marrow specimens from 33 patients with CLL and 10 controls were studied. A single microvessel was defined as any vessel with a clear lumen. The screening of the slides was carried out by hotspot method. The slides were initially screened at low power to identify the areas with highest number of microvessel or vascularity hotspot. The count of microvessel in a sufficiently extended field (40x objective lens, 10x ocular lens) was then performed. The mean value of 10 most vascularized areas at 400x field was considered as MVD for a sample. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between MVD counts according to the antibody used. MVD was higher using CD34 versus vWF (CD34: mean +/- SD, 35.91+/-15.7; 95% confidence interval of mean, 30.34-41.48 vessels/field versus vWF: 8.15+/-4.65; 95% confidence interval of mean, 4.11-12.44 vessels/field; P<0.0001]. Bone marrow MVD detected by CD34 was significantly higher in patients with CD38 expression more than 30% (P=0.006) and in patients with unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities. However, no significant MVD differences were detected between CLL subgroups with regard to clinical course, pattern of marrow infiltration, and Rai stage. Bone marrow MVD in patients with CLL was significantly higher than that in controls (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: MVD assessment using anti-CD34 resulted in higher MVD counts than when using anti-vWF antibody. However, no MVD differences were detected between CLL subgroups subdivided according to the above-mentioned prognostic factors except CD38 expression and genetic abnormalities.","['Clinic for Hematology, Clinical Center Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia. tweety@scnet.rs']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, whether and how SUMO2/3-specific proteases are involved in de-conjugation under cell stress is unclear. Here, we show that low doses of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) induce an increase of the SENP3 protein, which removes SUMO2/3 from promyelocytic leukemia (PML). Low dose H(2)O(2) causes SENP3 to co-localize with PML bodies and reduces the number of PML bodies in a SENP3-dependent manner. Furthermore, de-conjugation of SUMO2/3 from PML is responsible for the accelerated cell proliferation caused by low dose H(2)O(2). Knocking down PML promotes basal cell proliferation as expected. This can be reversed by reconstitution with wild-type PML but not its mutant lacking SUMOylation, indicating that only the SUMOylated PML can play an inhibitory role for cell proliferation. Thus, SENP3 appears to be a key mediator in mild oxidative stress-induced cell proliferation via regulation of the SUMOylation status of PML. Furthermore, SENP3 is over-accumulated in a variety of primary human cancers including colon adenocarcinoma in which PML is hypo-SUMOylated. These results reveal an important role of SENP3 and the SUMOylation status of PML in the regulation of cell proliferation under oxidative stress.","['Department of Cell Biology, Key Laboratory of the Education Ministry for Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis, Institutes of Medical Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.']",20100224,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, understanding the influences of TGF-beta on bone resorbing osteoclasts is critical to the design of therapies to reduce excess bone loss. Here we investigated the mechanisms by which TGF-beta sustains suppression of osteoclast apoptosis. We found TGF-beta rapidly increased leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) expression and secretion by phosphorylated mothers against decapentaplegic-dependent and -independent signaling pathways. TGF-beta also induced suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) expression, which was required for TGF-beta or LIF to promote osteoclast survival by. Blocking LIF or SOCS3 blocked TGF-beta promotion of osteoclast survival, confirming that LIF and SOCS3 expression are necessary for TGF-beta-mediated suppression of osteoclast apoptosis. Investigation of the mechanisms by which LIF promotes osteoclast survival revealed that LIF-induced expression of Bcl-X(L) and repressed Bcl-2 interacting domain expression by activating MAPK kinase, AKT, and nuclear factor-kappaB pathways. Suppression of Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling further increased Bcl-X(L) expression and enhanced osteoclast survival, supporting that this pathway is not involved in prosurvival effects of TGF-beta and LIF. These data show that TGF-beta coordinately induces LIF and SOCS3 to promote prosurvival signaling. This alters the ratio of prosurvival Bcl2 family member Bcl-X(L) to proapoptotic family member Bcl-2 interacting domain, leading to prolonged osteoclast survival.","['Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",20100224,,,,"['R01 DE014680/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE14680/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Z not only activates early lytic viral gene transcription but also plays a direct role in lytic viral genome replication. Although a small fraction of Z is known to be sumoylated, the effects of this posttranslational modification on various different Z functions have not been well defined. In this report, we show that only the lysine at amino acid residue 12 is required for the sumoylation of Z, and that Z can be sumoylated by SUMO isoforms 1, 2, and 3. We also demonstrate that the sumo-defective Z mutants ZK12A and ZK12R have enhanced transcriptional activity. The sumoylated and nonsumoylated forms of Z were found to have a similar cellular location, both being localized primarily within the nuclear matrix. The Z sumo-defective mutants were, however, partially defective for disrupting promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies compared to the ability of wild-type Z. In addition, we show that lytic viral genome replication does not require the sumoylation of Z, although a Z mutant altered at both amino acids 12 and 13 is replication defective. Furthermore, we show that the sumoylation of Z is greatly increased (from less than 1 to about 11%) in lytically induced 293 cells infected with an EBV mutant virus deleted for the EBV-encoded protein kinase (EBV-PK) compared to that of 293 cells infected with wild-type EBV, and that the overexpression of EBV-PK leads to the reduced sumoylation of Z in EBV-negative cells. Our results suggest that the sumoylation of Z helps to promote viral latency, and that EBV-PK inhibits Z sumoylation during viral reactivation.","['McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, Department of Oncology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, 1400 University Ave., Madison, WI 53706, USA.']",20100224,,,,"['R01 CA066519/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA058853/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA022443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI078985/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-H6064851/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01-107034/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01-CA66519/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA022443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA58853/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009681/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have reported on a patient with thrombocytopenia and impaired agonist-induced aggregation, secretion, and protein phosphorylation associated with a RUNX1 mutation. Expression profiling of platelets revealed approximately 5-fold decreased expression of 12-lipoxygenase (12-LO, gene ALOX12), which catalyzes 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid production from arachidonic acid. We hypothesized that ALOX12 is a direct transcriptional target gene of RUNX1. In present studies, agonist-induced platelet 12-HETE production was decreased in the patient. Four RUNX1 consensus sites were identified in the 2-kb promoter region of ALOX12 (at -1498, -1491, -708, -526 from ATG). In luciferase reporter studies in human erythroleukemia cells, mutation of each site decreased activity; overexpression of RUNX1 up-regulated promoter activity, which was abolished by mutation of RUNX1 sites. Gel shift studies, including with recombinant protein, revealed RUNX1 binding to each site.

A current clinical target for B-cell lymphoma is CD22, a B-cell-specific member of the sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin (siglec) family that recognizes alpha2-6-linked sialylated glycans as ligands. Here, we describe a novel approach for targeting B lymphoma cells with doxorubicin-loaded liposomal nanoparticles displaying high-affinity glycan ligands of CD22. The targeted liposomes are actively bound and endocytosed by CD22 on B cells, and significantly extend life in a xenograft model of human B-cell lymphoma. Moreover, they bind and kill malignant B cells from peripheral blood samples obtained from patients with hairy cell leukemia, marginal zone lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The results demonstrate the potential for using a carbohydrate recognition-based approach for efficiently targeting B cells in vivo that can offer improved treatment options for patients with B-cell malignancies.","['Department of Chemical Physiology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",20100224,,,,"['R01 CA138891/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '081882/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'R01 AI050143/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI050143/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM060938/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-GM060938/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,"['Blood. 2010 Jun 10;115(23):4626-7.

The use of gold nanoparticles derivatized with thiol modified oligonucleotides (Au-nanoprobes) for the detection of specific nucleic acid targets has been gaining momentum as an alternative to more traditional methodologies. Here, we present an Au-nanoparticles based approach for the molecular recognition and quantification of the BCR-ABL fusion transcript (mRNA), which is responsible for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and to the best of our knowledge it is the first time quantification of a specific mRNA directly in cancer cells is reported. This inexpensive and very easy to perform Au-nanoprobe based method allows quantification of unamplified total human RNA and specific detection of the oncogene transcript. The sensitivity settled by the Au-nanoprobes allows differential gene expression from 10 ng/mul of total RNA and takes less than 30 min to complete after total RNA extraction, minimizing RNA degradation. Also, at later stages, accumulation of malignant mutations may lead to resistance to chemotherapy and consequently poor outcome. Such a method, allowing for fast and direct detection and quantification of the chimeric BCR-ABL mRNA, could speed up diagnostics and, if appropriate, revision of therapy. This assay may constitute a promising tool in early diagnosis of CML and could easily be extended to further target genes with proven involvement in cancer development.","['CIGMH, Departamento de Ciencias da Vida, Faculdade de Ciencias e Tecnologia, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Campus de Caparica, 2829-516 Caparica, Portugal. pmvb@fct.unl.pt.']",20100224,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE PRESENTATION: The current report describes a patient who presented with the abrupt onset of hypertension, mixed nephritic/nephrotic syndrome and acute renal failure. Kidney biopsy was consistent with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, type 1. Bone marrow biopsy performed in the evaluation of periaortic lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and thrombocytopenia confirmed the diagnosis of low grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The patient's renal function improved and proteinuria resolved after initial treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with chemotherapy. During eleven years of follow up, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis has remained in remission, as confirmed by repeatedly negative urinalyses, normal blood pressure and absence of clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of nephritic/nephrotic syndrome. CONCLUSION: Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis has been known to be associated with both chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, particularly with B cell lymphocytic type non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. There is limited information available concerning the effects of treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma on the progression of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma associated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. In the few reported cases we found, long term follow up after initial resolution of the membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis was lacking.

We have previously shown that components of the 19S proteasome are crucial for regulating inducible histone activation events in mammalian cells. The 19S ATPase Sug1 binds to histone-remodeling enzymes, and in the absence of Sug1, a subset of activating epigenetic modifications including histone H3 acetylation, H3 lysine 4 trimethylation and H3 arginine 17 dimethylation are inhibited at cytokine-inducible major histocompatibilty complex (MHC)-II and class II transactivator (CIITA) promoters, implicating Sug1 in events required to initiate mammalian transcription. RESULTS: Our previous studies indicate that H3 lysine 4 trimethylation at cytokine-inducible MHC-II and CIITA promoters is dependent on proteolytic-independent functions of 19S ATPases. In this report, we show that multiple common subunits of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)/complex of proteins associated with Set I (COMPASS) complexes bind to the inducible MHC-II and CIITA promoters; that overexpressing a single common MLL/COMPASS subunit significantly enhances promoter activity and MHC-II HLA-DRA expression; and that these common subunits are important for H3 lysine 4 trimethylation at MHC-II and CIITA promoters. In addition, we show that H3 lysine 27 trimethylation, which is inversely correlated with H3 lysine 4 trimethylation, is significantly elevated in the presence of diminished 19S ATPase Sug1. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these experiments suggest that the 19S proteasome plays a crucial role in the initial reorganization of events enabling the relaxation of the repressive chromatin structure surrounding inducible promoters.","['Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology and Physiology, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.']",20100204,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Central retinal artery occlusion following herpes zoster ophthalmicus is poorly recognised. This is likely due to the difficulties in obtaining tissue for histopathology to establish causality. We report a case of central retinal artery occlusion and complete internal carotid artery occlusion following herpes zoster ophthalmicus. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44 year old Caucasian female presented with sudden painless loss of vision in her right eye on a background of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and right sided herpes zoster ophthalmicus. She was initially treated with steroids and antivirals for an underlying presumed vasculitic cause, but review at 24 hours demonstrated a right central retinal artery occlusion. Embolic screen identified complete occlusion of the right internal carotid artery. She was treated with oral antiviral medication for three weeks but had no visual recovery. CONCLUSION: This case highlights an uncommon cause of acute visual loss. We propose that the underlying small and large vessel occlusion in this patient was due to herpes zoster related vasculopathy. A review of the literature is presented to trace the historical perspective of herpes zoster related vasculopathy.","['Department of Ophthalmology, The Alfred Hospital, Commercial Road, Prahran, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia. hall@eyesurgery.com.au.']",20100112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of WT1-targeting cancer immunotherapy in clinical settings. As expression of WT1 protein in tumor cells is a prerequisite for WT1-targeting immunotherapy, immunohistochemical methods to detect WT1 protein with high sensitivity and specificity are required. In the present study, we developed a rabbit polyclonal antibody (WT1-R) against the 9-mer WT1 235 peptide, which is used for vaccination. The specificity of WT1-R was confirmed by immunoprecipitation, western blotting analysis, and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunocytochemistry showed the same reactivity against five cell lines (K562, Daudi, HT-180, SW480, and PC-14), whereas levels of WT1 mRNA expression determined by real-time qPCR (RT-PCR) analysis were not equivalent. Next, we examined the reactivity of WT1-R in tissue samples compared with a previously developed anti-WT1 antibody, 6F-H2. WT1-R showed greater sensitivity for detecting WT1 protein expression in samples from four different breast cancer patients than 6F-H2 antibody. The discrepancy in WT1 expression between these methods suggested that immunohistochemical detection of WT1 peptide may be advantageous for predicting the efficacy of WT1 vaccine compared to RT-PCR, and the highly sensitive WT1 antibody, WT1-R, may be useful to detect WT1 protein in tumors.","['Division of Hematopathology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan. ryo@mail.tains.tohoku.ac.jp']",20100203,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown previously that Aurora A expression is increased aberrantly in human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-infected T-cell lines and primary adult T-cell leukemia cells, and a pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor, which inhibits both Aurora A and Aurora B kinases, reduces viability and induces apoptosis in these cells. However, the specific effects of Aurora A inhibition on HTLV-1-infected T-cells are poorly understood. In this study, we addressed this question by comparing the effects of MLN8237, a selective inhibitor of Aurora A, on cell viability, cell cycle progression, and induction of apoptosis in HTLV-1-infected and -uninfected T-cell lines. MLN8237 reduced the viability of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines within 24 h, but its effects on that of HTLV-1-uninfected T-cell lines were moderate. MLN8237 induced early apoptosis of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines without induction of polyploidy. It induced p53 and p21 expression in HTLV-1-infected but not in -uninfected T-cell lines, suggesting that MLN8237-treated HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines exit from mitosis and activate a p53-dependent postmitotic G(1) checkpoint, leading to G(1) arrest followed by the induction of apoptosis. Our results suggest that specific inhibition of Aurora A kinase is a potentially useful therapeutic strategy in the treatment of adult T-cell leukemia and that further in vivo exploration is warranted.","['Division of Molecular Virology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan. mtomita@med.u-ryukyu.ac.jp']",20100119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CP patients received 600 mg/day, while AP/BC patients received 600-800 mg/day imatinib. Patients received imatinib for at least 12 months or until the disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Along with cytogenetic response (CyR), molecular response was assessed with BCR-ABL/ABL ratio. Baseline BCR-ABL gene mutation test was performed. Seventy-one patients (median age, 49.0 years, M:F = 50:21) received escalated dose imatinib. Grade 3 edema in two patients was the only nonhematologic toxicities more than grade 2. For evaluable patients, 30.8% of patients achieved CCyR at 6 months, and median time to treatment failure (TTFx) was 18.0 months. TTFx was longer in patients who achieved greater than 50% reduction in BCR-ABL/ABL within 6 months (early molecular responder (EMR)) compared with those who did not (non-EMR; p < 0.001). Of 31 patients who had mutational status data, three had mutation. All mutants failed to achieve CCyR. In conclusion, escalated dose imatinib shows considerable efficacy with tolerable toxicity in CML patients showing suboptimal response to standard dose imatinib.

We identified the expression of Bcl-2 family genes that correlated best with sensitivity to ABT-263 in a panel of 36 SCLC and 31 leukemia/lymphoma cell lines. In cells sensitive to ABT-263, expression of Bcl-2 and Noxa is elevated, whereas expression of Mcl-1 is higher in resistant cells. We also examined global expression differences to identify gene signature sets that correlated with sensitivity to ABT-263 to generate optimal signature sets predictive of sensitivity to ABT-263. Independent cell lines were used to verify the predictive power of the gene sets and to refine the optimal gene signatures. When comparing normal lung tissue and SCLC primary tumors, the expression pattern of these genes in the tumor tissue is most similar to sensitive SCLC lines, whereas normal tissue is most similar to resistant SCLC lines. Most of the genes identified using global expression patterns are related to the apoptotic pathway; however, all but Bcl-rambo are distinct from the Bcl-2 family.

DESIGN AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to ascertain whether the presence of minimal residual disease detected by multiparametric flow cytometry prior to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is related to outcome in children acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Minimal residual disease was quantified by multiparametric flow cytometry at a median of 10 days prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in 31 children (age range, 10 months to 16 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Thirteen patients were transplanted in first remission. Stem cell donors were HLA-identical siblings in 8 cases and matched unrelated donors in 23. Twenty-six children received a total body irradiation-containing conditioning regimen. According to the level of minimal residual disease, patients were divided into two groups: minimal residual disease-positive (>or=0.01%) (n=10) and minimal residual disease-negative (<0.01%) (n=21). RESULTS: Estimated event-free survival rates at 2 years for the minimal residual disease-negative and -positive subgroups were 74% and 20%, respectively (P=0.004) and overall survival rates were 80% and 20%, respectively (P=0.005). Bivariate analysis identified pre-transplant minimal residual disease as the only significant factor for relapse and also for death (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of minimal residual disease measured by multiparametric flow cytometry identified a group of patients with a 9.5-fold higher risk of relapse and a 3.2-fold higher risk of death than those without minimal residual disease. This study supports the strong relationship between pre-transplantation minimal residual disease measured by multiparametric flow cytometry and outcome following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and concur with the results of previous studies using polymerase chain reaction techniques.","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Hospital Universitario Vall d'Hebron Paseig de la Vall d'Hebron 119-129 08035 Barcelona, Spain. ielorza@vhebron.net""]",20100223,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mesenchymal stromal cells in the bone marrow may favor the persistence and progression of leukemia by preserving the proliferation and self-renewal capacities of the malignant progenitor cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: BV173 or primary chronic myeloid leukemia cells were co-cultured with human mesenchymal stromal cells and imatinib-induced cell death was then measured. The roles of pro-and anti-apoptotic proteins and chemokine CXCL12 in this context were evaluated. We also studied the ability of BV173 cells to repopulate NOD/SCID mice following in vitro exposure to imatinib and mesenchymal stromal cells. RESULTS: Whilst imatinib induced dose-dependent apoptosis of BV173 cells and primary chronic myeloid leukemia cells, co-culture with mesenchymal stromal cells protected both types of chronic myeloid leukemia cells. Molecular analysis indicated that mesenchymal stromal cells reduced caspase-3 activation and modulated the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL. Furthermore, chronic myeloid leukemia cells exposed to imatinib in the presence of mesenchymal stromal cells retained the ability to engraft into NOD/SCID mice. We observed that chronic myeloid leukemia cells and mesenchymal stromal cells express functional levels of CXCR4 and CXCL12, respectively. Finally, the CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100 restored apoptosis by imatinib and the susceptibility of the SCID leukemia repopulating cells to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: Human mesenchymal stromal cells mediate protection of chronic myeloid leukemia cells from imatinib-induced apoptosis. Disruption of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis restores, at least in part, the leukemic cells' sensitivity to imatinib. The combination of anti-CXCR4 antagonists with tyrosine kinase inhibitors may represent a powerful approach to the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Department of Haematology, Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, Imperial College, London, UK.']",20100223,,,,"['12011/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'MC_G0802523/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review highlights new therapies from the last 18 months. RECENT FINDINGS: Immunosuppressants, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or all-trans-retinoic-acid have shown improvement in decreasing the need for transfusions and improving quality-of-life and/or survival. Eltrombopag has shown promising results in the treatment of thrombocytopenia. However, determination of an optimal chemotherapeutic approach remains elusive and controversial. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors are well tolerated in outpatient settings, with azacitidine prolonging survival and decreasing time to acute myeloid leukemia progression in patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. A novel erythroid-specific gene expression profile may predict response to lenalidomide in patients who lack the deletion of 5q31.1. Tools such as the Charlson comorbidity index may help select appropriate patients for allogeneic stem cell transplant. A variety of promising new agents are under investigation.

METHODS: In this study, we investigated retrospectively the role of early DFO administration postallografting, in terms of relapse incidence (RI) and disease-free survival (DFS) in 143 patients consecutively transplanted for hematological malignancies. RESULTS: Thirty-seven of 143 patients received DFO. The 5-year RI and DFS in patients who received more than 2 months DFO were 5% and 76%, respectively, as opposed to 47% and 41% in no DFO-treated patients (P=0.01, respectively). Not a single relapse event was detected in DFO-treated patients who were allotransplanted in first complete remission, and in addition, the RI was lower in DFO-treated patients with advanced disease at time of transplantation (31% vs. 75%, P=0.03). Patients with chronic graft versus host disease who received DFO had lower RI than unntreated patients (17% vs. 39%, P=0.03). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that DFO administration for more than 2 months was an independent factor for lower RI and improved DFS.

Previous studies have demonstrated that PKC-delta is activated by hypoxia and increases the protein stability and transcriptional activity of HIF-1 alpha in human cancer cells. Furthermore, activation of PKC-delta mediates cardiac differentiation of ESCs and hematopoietic stem cells. However, the role of PKC-delta in hypoxia-induced early differentiation of mESCs remains largely unknown. Here, we show the inhibition of PKC-delta activity prevents the early differentiation of mESCs under hypoxia using PKC-delta inhibitors, GF 109203X and rottlerin. Reduction of PKC-delta activity under hypoxia effectively decreased HIF-1 alpha protein levels and substantially recovered the expression of LIF-specific receptor (LIFR) and phosphorylated-STAT3 in mESCs. Furthermore, PKC-delta inhibitors aid to sustain the expression of self-renewal markers and suppress the expression of early differentiation markers in mESCs under hypoxia. Taken together, these results suggest that PKC-delta inhibitors block the early differentiation of mESCs via destabilization of HIF-1 alpha under hypoxia.","['Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, NeuroVascular Coordination Research Center, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Korea.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This phase I study assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics, recommended phase II dose and efficacy of KW-0761 in patients with relapsed CCR4-positive adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) or peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients received KW-0761 once a week for 4 weeks by intravenous infusion. Doses were escalated, starting at 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, and finally 1.0 mg/kg by a 3 + 3 design. RESULTS: Fifteen patients completed the protocol treatment. Only one patient, at the 1.0 mg/kg dose, developed grade 3 dose-limiting toxicities, skin rash, and febrile neutropenia, and grade 4 neutropenia. Other treatment-related grade 3 to 4 toxicities were lymphopenia (n = 10), neutropenia (n = 3), leukopenia (n = 2), herpes zoster (n = 1), and acute infusion reaction/cytokine release syndrome (n = 1). Neither the frequency nor severity of toxicities increased with dose escalation. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Therefore, the recommended phase II dose was determined to be 1.0 mg/kg. No patients had detectable levels of anti-KW-0761 antibody. The plasma maximum and trough, and the area under the curve of 0 to 7 days of KW-0761, tended to increase dose and frequency dependently. Five patients (31%; 95% CI, 11% to 59%) achieved objective responses: two complete (0.1; 1.0 mg/kg) and three partial (0.01; 2 at 1.0 mg/kg) responses. CONCLUSION: KW-0761 was tolerated at all the dose levels tested, demonstrating potential efficacy against relapsed CCR4-positive ATL or PTCL. Subsequent phase II studies at the 1.0 mg/kg dose are thus warranted.","['Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan. kyamamoto@aichi-cc.jp']",20100222,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2010 Aug 10;28(23):e404-5; author reply e406.

Additionally, limited epidemiological evidence for leukemia in humans is available; however, this is inconsistent across studies. Both genotoxicity and cytotoxicity are key events in formaldehyde nasal carcinogenicity in rats, but mechanistic data for leukemia are not well established. Formation of DNA adducts is a key event in initiating carcinogenesis. Formaldehyde can induce DNA monoadducts, DNA-DNA cross-links, and DNA protein cross-links. In this study, highly sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-selected reaction monitoringmethods were developed and [(13)CD(2)]-formaldehyde exposures utilized, allowing differentiation of DNA adducts and DNA-DNA cross-links originating from endogenous and inhalation-derived formaldehyde exposure. The results show that exogenous formaldehyde induced N(2)-hydroxymethyl-dG monoadducts and dG-dG cross-links in DNA from rat respiratory nasal mucosa but did not form [(13)CD(2)]-adducts in sites remote to the portal of entry, even when five times more DNA was analyzed. Furthermore, no N(6)-HO(13)CD(2)-dA adducts were detected in nasal DNA. In contrast, high amounts of endogenous formaldehyde dG and dA monoadducts were present in all tissues examined. The number of exogenous N(2)-HO(13)CD(2)-dG in 1- and 5-day nasal DNA samples from rats exposed to 10-ppm [(13)CD(2)]-formaldehyde was 1.28 +/- 0.49 and 2.43 +/- 0.78 adducts/10(7) dG, respectively, while 2.63 +/- 0.73 and 2.84 +/- 1.13 N(2)-HOCH(2)-dG adducts/10(7) dG and 3.95 +/- 0.26 and 3.61 +/- 0.95 N(6)-HOCH(2)-dA endogenous adducts/10(7) dA were present.

Despite the potent hemodynamic and proatherosclerotic activities of salusin-beta, its exact distribution and biological functions remain largely undetermined because of technical difficulties associated with its unique physicochemical characteristics, such as marked adhesiveness to polypropylene and polystyrene. By circumventing these problems, we recently established a specific radioimmunoassay for detecting immunoreactive human salusin-beta. In the current study, we demonstrated the release of salusin-beta from the human monoblastic leukemia cell lines, THP-1 and U937. Dilution curves of extracted conditioned media from both cells were parallel with those of standard human salusin-beta by radioimmunoassay. Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography coupled with radioimmunoassay detection of the culture supernatants revealed a major immunoreactive component that co-eluted with authentic salusin-beta. Both cell lines secreted salusin-beta-like immunoreactivity (LI) into serum-free media as a function of time (1234.3 + or - 122.7 and 186.7 + or - 9.1 fmol/10(5) cells per 24h). When THP-1 and U937 cells differentiated into macrophages after incubation with 2-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), they secreted far greater amounts of salusin-beta-LI into the culture supernatant (3351.9 + or - 899.3 and 1545.8 + or - 183.3 fmol/10(5) cells per 24h). TPA treatment accelerated the processing of prosalusin into its cleaved fragments, suggesting that the increased secretion of salusin-beta-LI in THP-1-derived macrophages was caused by the enhanced intracellular processing of prosalusin. Stimulation with the inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), resulted in increased secretion of salusin-beta without inducing expression of the gene for preprosalusin, suggesting that TNF-alpha and LPS stimulated the release of salusin-beta. These data demonstrate that salusin-beta, which induces macrophage foam cell formation, is secreted in its authentic form from human monocytes/macrophages.","['Laboratory of Molecular Genetics and Hematology, Graduate School of Health Care Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan.']",20100220,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It is overexpressed in many cancers and thus may be an important molecular target for chemotherapy. AZD1152 is the prodrug for AZD1152-HQPA, which is a selective inhibitor of Aurora B kinase activity. Preclinical antineoplastic activity of AZD1152 against acute myelogenous leukemia, multiple myeloma and colorectal cancer has been reported. However, this compound has not been evaluated in breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women. RESULTS: The antineoplastic activity of AZD1152-HQPA in six human breast cancer cell lines, three of which overexpress HER2, is demonstrated. AZD1152-HQPA specifically inhibited Aurora B kinase activity in breast cancer cells, thereby causing mitotic catastrophe, polyploidy and apoptosis, which in turn led to apoptotic death. AZD1152 administration efficiently suppressed the tumor growth in a breast cancer cell xenograft model. In addition, AZD1152 also inhibited pulmonary metastatic nodule formation in a metastatic breast cancer model. Notably, it was also found that the protein level of Aurora B kinase declined after inhibition of Aurora B kinase activity by AZD1152-HQPA in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Investigation of the underlying mechanism suggested that AZD1152-HQPA accelerated protein turnover of Aurora B via enhancing its ubiquitination. CONCLUSIONS: It was shown that AZD1152 is an effective antineoplastic agent for breast cancer, and our results define a novel mechanism for posttranscriptional regulation of Aurora B after AZD1152 treatment and provide insight into dosing regimen design for this kinase inhibitor in metastatic breast cancer treatment.","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",20100222,,,,"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25T CA57730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P30CA016672-29/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089266/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 CA089266/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA089266/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009299/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the mechanisms that underlie the variable expression of these genes in the leukemic cells. RESULTS: To address this question, we compared the level of their expression with the DNA methylation and histone acetylation status of 5' sequences of both genes in leukemic cell lines and primitive (lin-CD34+) leukemic cells from chronic phase CML patients. DNA methylation of the ELA2 gene promoter did not correlate with its expression pattern in lin-CD34+ cells from chronic phase CML patient samples even though there was clear differential DNA methylation of this locus in ELA2-expressing and non-expressing cell lines. In contrast, we found a strong relation between CD7 expression and transcription-permissive chromatin modifications, both at the level of DNA methylation and histone acetylation with evidence of hypomethylation of the CD7 promoter region in the lin-CD34+ cells from CML patients with high CD7 expression. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate a link between epigenetic modifications and CD7 expression in primitive CML cells.","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, 675 West 10th Avenue, Vancouver, British Columbia V5Z 1L3, Canada. srogers@bccrc.ca']",20100222,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, a broader panel of markers is often desirable. CD163 is highly specific for normal and neoplastic cells of the monocyte/histiocyte lineage. In this study, we examined the value of CD163 in the diagnosis of acute myeloid LC. METHODS: A total of 34 cases, including 18 cases of myelomonocytic or monocytic LC, 10 cases of myeloid LC without monocytic component and 6 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL), were stained with CD163. RESULTS: CD163 was expressed in 8 of 18 (44%) of myelomonocytic or monocytic LC and 1 of 10 (10%) of other myeloid LC, but in none of the ALL cases (0/6). CD163 was highly specific (90%) for myeloid LC with a monocytic component, but showed low sensitivity in the diagnosis of both myeloid LC in general (24%) and myeloid LC with a monocytic component (44%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that CD163 has utility as a specific marker for myeloid LC in conjunction with currently used immunohistochemical stains, but should not be used alone for diagnosis.","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0602, USA.']",20100218,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorescence and CD instruments were used to assess effect of the complex on the protein structure at different temperatures. Growth inhibitory and apoptotic effect of the Pd(II) complex toward the cancer cells was measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry. This complex exhibited potent cytotoxic properties against chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562. The cells showed different sensitivity to complex. Cytotoxic studies shown that Pd(II) complex induced apoptosis of K562 cells in a concentration and time dependent manner. Then, it might be concluded that Pd(II) complex is a promising antiproliferative agent and should execute its biological effects by inducing apoptosis. Results of fluorescence studies revealed that Pd(II) complex can quench the intrinsic fluorescence emission of the protein at different temperatures. The far- and near-UV CD studies displayed that the Pd(II) complex induces changes in the secondary and tertiary structures of BLG-B at different temperatures. The biological significance of this work is evident since BLG serves as a carrier molecule for several antitumor compounds. Therefore, the interaction of the Pd(II) complex (with antitumor activity) can provide useful information to better design metal anticancer complexes with fewer side effects.","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran. divsalar@ibb.ut.ac.ir']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MLL gene is a recurrent target for translocations in both acute myeloid and acute lymphoid leukemias. MLL gene rearrangements involve a variety of translocation partners, giving rise to MLL fusion proteins whose transforming ability is mediated through upregulated expression of Homeobox (Hox) genes as well as other targets. Recent work indicates that menin is an essential partner of MLL fusion proteins in leukemic cells and that it regulates normal hematopoiesis. In the absence of menin, steady-state hematopoiesis is largely preserved; however, menin-deficient hematopoietic stem cells are markedly deficient in situations of hematopoietic stress, such as during recovery after bone marrow transplantation. In leukemias driven by MLL fusion proteins, menin is essential for transformation and growth of the malignant cells. Thus, menin-MLL interactions represent a promising therapeutic target in leukemias with MLL rearrangements.","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, 5249 Medical Sciences 1, 1301 Catherine Avenue, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105, USA.']",,,,,"['R01 CA092251/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092251-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS247293'],,,,,,,,,,,,

THDF induced G(2)-M phase cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis through a caspase-dependent mechanism involving cytochrome c release, processing of multiple caspases (caspase-3, -6, -7, and -9) and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Overexpression of the protective mitochondrial proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) conferred partial resistance to THDF-induced apoptosis. This flavonoid induced the phosphorylation of members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) family and cell death was attenuated by inhibition of c-jun N-terminal kinases/stress-activated protein kinases (JNK/SAPK) and of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2.

On the other hand, however, treatment should not be stopped or started in any patient in whom treatment is necessary due to the current knowledge. Adequate patient information, surveillance and documentation of treatment in the registry of the GKJR is strongly recommended.","['Zentrum fur Allgemeine Padiatrie und Neonatologie, Asklepios Klinik St Augustin, Arnold-Janssen-Str 29, 53757 Sankt Augustin. g.horneff@asklepios.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding cellular proteins involved in the multistep process of HIV-1 infection may result in the discovery of more adapted and effective therapeutic targets. Kinases and phosphatases are a druggable class of proteins critically involved in regulation of signal pathways of eukaryotic cells. Here, we focused on the discovery of kinases and phosphatases that are essential for HIV-1 replication but dispensable for cell viability. We performed an iterative screen in Jurkat T-cells with a short-hairpin-RNA (shRNA) library highly enriched for human kinases and phosphatases. We identified 14 new proteins essential for HIV-1 replication that do not affect cell viability. These proteins are described to be involved in MAPK, JNK and ERK pathways, vesicular traffic and DNA repair. Moreover, we show that the proteins under study are important in an early step of HIV-1 infection before viral integration, whereas some of them affect viral transcription/translation. This study brings new insights for the complex interplay of HIV-1/host cell and opens new possibilities for antiviral strategies.","['URIA-Centro de Patogenese Molecular, Faculdade de Farmacia, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.']",20100217,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mice lacking Id3 were previously shown to have subtle defects in positive and negative selection of TCRalphabeta+ T lymphocytes. More recently, Id3(-/-) mice on a C57BL/6 background were shown to have a dramatic expansion of gammadelta T cells. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we report that mice lacking Id3 have reduced thymocyte numbers but increased production of gammadelta T cells that express a Vgamma1.1+Vdelta6.3+ receptor with restricted junctional diversity. These Vgamma1.1+Vdelta6.3+ T cells have multiple characteristics associated with ""innate"" lymphocytes such as natural killer T (NKT) cells including an activated phenotype, expression of the transcription factor PLZF, and rapid production of IFNg and interleukin-4. Moreover, like other ""innate"" lymphocyte populations, development of Id3(-/-) Vgamma1.1+Vdelta6.3+ T cells requires the signaling adapter protein SAP. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide novel insight into the requirements for development of Vgamma1.1+Vdelta6.3+ T cells and indicate a role for Id3 in repressing the response of ""innate"" gammadelta T cells to SAP-mediated expansion or survival.","['Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.']",20100219,,,,"['R01 AI073922/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA099978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007281/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM07281/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that missing KIR ligands in recipients were significantly associated with a decreased leukemic relapse risk (P=0.019, HR=0.329), mainly in myeloid disease (P=0.003, HR=0.193). This beneficial effect was seen in AML/myelodysplastic syndrome and also in chronic myeloid leukemia. In myeloid disease, missing KIR ligands also improved 5-year OS (P=0.034, HR=0.430) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P=0.024, HR=0.445). Meanwhile, the presence of donor-activating KIR2DS3 gene was associated with increased relapse risk (P=0.003, HR=5.046), decreased OS (P=0.004, HR=3.181) and DFS (P=0.003, HR=2.919) in myeloid disease. No effect was seen in patients with lymphoid disease. Our study indicated that, in unrelated HSCT for myeloid leukemia, missing KIR ligands in recipients offered a lower relapse risk and a long-term survival advantage. The presence of KIR2DS3 in the donor was an important risk factor for myeloid leukemia.","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",20100222,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The GM-CSF receptor (GMR) shares a signaling subunit, beta(c), with interleukin-3 and interleukin-5 receptors and has recently been shown to induce activation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and downstream signaling via formation of a unique dodecameric receptor complex. In this study we use 2 activated beta(c) mutants that display distinct signaling capacity and have differential requirements for the GMR alpha-subunit (GMR-alpha) to dissect the signaling pathways associated with the GM-CSF response. The V449E transmembrane mutant selectively activates JAK2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways, resulting in a high level of sensitivity to JAK and ERK inhibitors, whereas the extracellular mutant (FIDelta) selectively activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt and IkappaKbeta/nuclear factorkappaB pathways. We also demonstrate a novel and direct interaction between the SH3 domains of Lyn and Src with a conserved proline-rich motif in GMR-alpha and show a selective requirement for Src family kinases by the FIDelta mutant. We relate the nonoverlapping nature of signaling by the activated mutants to the structure of the unique GMR complex and propose alternative modes of receptor activation acting synergistically in the mature liganded receptor complex.","['Division of Haematology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia.']",20100219,,,,"['R01 HL060657/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL60657/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many felt anxious and self-conscious and were reluctant to reveal appearance changes in public. These feelings were compounded by the negative reactions of others (e.g., staring, teasing, and inappropriate questioning), which sometimes lead to avoidance of social activity and threats of noncompliance. Parents of these children felt ill-prepared to manage appearance-related anxieties. Adolescents wanted support to develop the practical and social skills necessary to maintain a ""normal"" appearance and manage the negative responses of others. However, some adolescents showed resilience and, with support from friends and family, developed strategies to manage their altered appearance and its social consequences.

The frequency of occurrence, risk factors, and optimal treatment of CA-MRSA CAP are unclear. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of patients admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital from January 2005 to April 2007 with initial clinical presentation of pneumonia and respiratory or blood culture positive for CA-MRSA. Definition of CA-MRSA was based on sensitivity to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with CA-MRSA CAP were identified during the 28-month period. Only one of the 14 patients tested had evidence of preceding influenza, and no seasonal pattern was seen. Seven patients were never admitted to the ICU. Eight of 14 with chest CT scans had evidence of lung necrosis. Nine of 15 had evidence of pleural effusions early in their hospital course, and five of nine required at least one pleural drainage procedure. Seven of 15 were immunocompromised (three HIV, one acute lymphocytic leukemia [ALL], one high-dose steroids, and two immunoglobulin deficiency) with an additional three patients with diabetes. Mortality was only 13% (two of 15); both deaths occurred in patients with severe immunocompromise (ALL post chemotherapy and AIDS). Fourteen of 15 patients were treated with antimicrobials that inhibit exotoxin production (clindamycin or linezolid). CONCLUSIONS: CA-MRSA pneumonia is not necessarily a post-influenza infection. Despite necrotizing features in many, the mortality of CA-MRSA pneumonia in our series is lower than previously reported, and patients do not routinely require ICU care.

Biologically, these cells have a short lifespan of 1-3 d in the circulation, yet infected cells remain viable for weeks despite the lack of viral antiapoptotic gene expression during this period. To understand the mechanism by which HCMV inhibits the initial phase of monocyte apoptosis, we focused on the viral modulation of early prosurvival cell signaling events after infection. We demonstrate in this study that the viral upregulation of the PI3K pathway promotes an early block in apoptosis after infection. Temporal transcriptome and protein analyses revealed Mcl-1, a member of the Bcl-2 family, was transiently induced in a PI3K-dependent manner during the early stages of HCMV infection. In accord with the survival studies, virally induced levels of Mcl-1 expression dissipated to mock levels by 72 h postinfection. Through the use of Mcl-1-specific small interfering RNA, we confirmed the functional role that Mcl-1 plays as a key early regulator of apoptosis in monocytes. Lastly, we showed that HCMV engagement and activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor during viral binding triggered the upregulation of Mcl-1. Overall, our data indicates that activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor/PI3K signaling pathway, via the PI3K-dependent upregulation of Mcl-1, is required to circumvent apoptosis in naturally short-lived monocytes during the early stages of HCMV infection, thus ensuring the early steps in the viral persistence strategy.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Center for Molecular and Tumor Virology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, LA 71130, USA.']",20100219,,,,"['P20 GM103433/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR018724/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI056077/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS499497'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The drug of this class most commonly used in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the pro-apoptotic nucleoside analog fludarabine (Flu), which enters CLL cells primarily through human equilibrative nucleoside transporters (hENTs). Although CLL cells lack hCNT3 activity, they do express this transporter protein, which is located mostly in the cytosol. The aim of our study was to identify agents and mechanisms capable of promoting hCNT3 trafficking to the plasma membrane. Here, we report that all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), currently used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), increases hCNT3-related activity through a mechanism that involves trafficking of pre-existing hCNT3 proteins to the plasma membrane. This effect is mediated by the autocrine action of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, which is transcriptionally activated by ATRA in a p38-dependent manner. TGF-beta1 acts through activation of ERK1/2 and the small GTPase RhoA to promote plasma membrane trafficking of the hCNT3 protein.","['Departament de Bioquimica i Biologia Molecular, the Institut de Biomedicina de la Universitat de Barcelona, and CIBER EHD, Universitat de Barcelona, Diagonal 645, 08028 Barcelona, Spain. pfernandezcalotti@ub.edu']",20100219,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Automatic pairing of bone marrow cells is a difficult task because these chromosomes appear distorted, overlapped, and their images are usually blurred with undefined edges and low level of detail. In this paper, a new metric is proposed to compare this type of chromosome images toward the design of an automatic pairing algorithm for leukemia diagnostic purposes. Besides the features used in the traditional karyotyping procedures, a new feature, based on mutual information , is proposed to increase the discriminate power of the G-banding pattern dissimilarity between chromosomes and improve the performance of the classifier. The pairing algorithm is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem where the distances between homologous chromosomes are minimized and the distances between nonhomologous ones are maximized. The optimization task is solved by using an integer programming approach. A new bone marrow chromosome dataset--Lisbon-K1 (LK1) chromosome dataset with 9200 chromosomes---was build for this study. These chromosomes have much lower quality than the classic Copenhagen, Edinburgh, and Philadelphia datasets, and its classification and pairing is therefore more difficult. Experiments using real images from the LK(1) and Grisan et al. datasets based on a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy are performed to test and validate the pairing algorithm.","['Institute for Systems and Robotics, Instituto Superior Tecnico, 1049-001 Lisbon, Portugal. aihmel@gmail.com']",20100217,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We observed no differences between patients who received grafts from the same or different donors, or in those who received fresh or cryopreserved product. The outcomes after a second allogeneic HCT for primary graft failure are dismal. Identifying risk factors for primary graft failure can decrease the incidence of this complication. Further studies are needed to test whether early recognition and hastened procurement of alternative grafts can improve transplant outcomes for primary graft failure.","['Banner Blood Marrow Transplant Program and City of Hope Banner, Phoenix, Arizona, USA.']",20100219,,,,"['5U01HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSH234200637015C/PHS HHS/United States', 'U24-CA76518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS181010'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to evaluate an isolation method that can be used with Good Manufacturing Practices-grade reagents and to compare three cytokines for expansion in order to design future clinical protocols based on donor NK-cell infusions to cure relapse after allograft. MATERIALS AND METHODS: NK cells were enriched using a CD3/CD19 depletion method and expanded for 13 days in the presence of 2, 10, and 50 ng/mL interleukin (IL)-2, IL-15, or IL-7. NK-cell cytotoxicity was evaluated after isolation and culture. Expression of NKG2D, KIR2DL2, and KIR2DL1 was monitored during expansion. RESULTS: Highly T- and B-cell-depleted NK cells were obtained and enriched 2.6-fold. The optimal cytokine concentration for expansion was 10 ng/mL for IL-2 or 50 ng/mL for IL-15. NK-cell cytotoxicity was significantly improved after an overnight incubation with 10 or 50 ng/mL IL-2 or with 2, 10, or 50 ng/mL IL-15, and after 13 days with 50 ng/mL IL-15. The use of a combination of IL-2 and IL-15 showed no additional benefit and negative results were obtained with IL-7. The three NK cell receptors were significantly upregulated after culture, mainly with IL-2 or IL-15. CONCLUSION: In our study, 10 ng/mL IL-2 or 50 ng/mL IL-15 were the optimal concentrations for expansion and were equivalent in significantly enhancing cytotoxicity and modifying NK-cell receptor expression patterns.","['Unite de Therapie Cellulaire et Tissus, CHU Nancy, Nancy, France. v.decot@chu-nancy.fr']",20100219,,,,,,,,"['2010 ISEH-Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Treatment of hypertension is likely to have a favourable role and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is most often reversible.

Treatment with S. thunbergii significantly reduced intracellular ROS mediated cell damage and inhibited myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity assessed in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) stimulated human monocytic leukemia in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, antioxidative mechanisms by S. thunbergii were evaluated by measuring the expression levels of antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD-1), catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase. SOD-1 and glutathione reductase were up-regulated by S. thunbergii. Furthermore, S. thunbergii contains polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid, arachidic acid, palmitic acid, elaidic acid, linoleic acid, stearic acid and cis-5,8,11,14,17-eicosanoic acid.

A large number of ligands have been described to bind AhR and promote its nuclear translocation. In the nucleus, the AhR and its dimerization partner the AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT) form a DNA-binding complex that acts as a transcriptional regulator. Animal and human data suggest that, beyond its mediating responses to xenobiotic and/or unknown endogenous ligands, the AhR has a role, although as yet undefined, in the regulation of cell cycle and inflammation. The AhR also appears to regulate the hematopoietic and immune systems during development and adult life in a cell-specific manner. While accidental exposure to xenobiotic AhR ligands has been associated with leukemia in humans, the specific mechanisms of AhR involvement are still not completely understood.

We hypothesized that there is a threshold level of GR transcripts/protein needed for cells to respond to the apoptosis-inducing effects of hormone. GR knock down using a doxycycline-controllable shRNAmir indicated that the apoptotic response changes from sensitive to resistant with changing GR levels. Titration of the 697 cell GR to equal that of the CEM-C7 T-cell ALL line caused a shift in sensitivity to that seen in CEM-C7 cells. While the same level of GR is required to trigger apoptosis in both T-cell and pre-B-cell ALL lineages, similarities and differences were observed for the regulation of target genes in these lineages.

METHODS: Neurosurgeons who died during the study period were identified from the Physician Master File database. Using the National Death Index, the reported cause of death was identified for 93.7% of decedents. Standardized mortality ratios were used to compare mortality risk in the study cohort to that of the US population. RESULTS: There was a marked reduction in mortality from virtually all causes in comparison with the control population. This finding is consistent with prior studies of mortality in physicians. The small number of deaths among female neurosurgeons precluded meaningful analysis for this group. Increased mortality risk for male neurosurgeons was seen from leukemia, nervous system disease (particularly Alzheimer disease), and aircraft accidents. Deaths from viral hepatitis and HIV infection, considered to be occupational hazards for surgeons, were less frequent than in the general population. Suicide, drug-related deaths, and alcohol-related deaths were less frequent than in the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgeons may be at higher risk for death from leukemia, aircraft accidents, and diseases of the nervous system, particularly Alzheimer disease; however, the mortality profile of neurosurgeons is favorable when compared with the general population.","['Section of Neurosurgery, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire 03756, USA. scottlollis98@gmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The need for a control group is also recommended by the major international institutions that govern the ethics and the practice of clinical research. Despite these principles and recommendations, inspection of a purposive sample of ongoing clinical trials listed in the NIH registry ( http://ClinicalTrials.gov ) reveals that as many as one-third of trials are uncontrolled. Since these trials were approved through a formal evaluation by ethics committees, the lack of adequate control was not perceived as a major deficiency in the study design. Most uncontrolled trials belong to the oncology/hematology area. If two extreme disease conditions for nature and progression are analyzed, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic heart failure (CHF), the difference in the prevalence of uncontrolled trials is very striking. The number of uncontrolled trials is only 13% in CHF, whereas it reaches 66% in the AML group. I believe that the underlying disease condition plays a primary role in orienting the design of the study: oncology and hematology may be fields in which uncontrolled studies are common, whereas in other fields, e.g., cardiology, this phenomenon can be reduced. Within the limitations of the selection process of the examined trials, the current analysis indicates that the clinical trial reality does not strictly follow experimental design theory and official recommendations.","['Department of Internal Medicine and Cardiovascular Sciences, University Federico II, Via Pansini 5, Naples, Italy. sacca@unina.it']",20100219,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of these studies revealed the presence of seven BLV genotypes in this geographic region and the suitability of partial gp51 env gene sequences for phylogenetic inference. A significant number of amino acid substitutions found in BLV strains isolated in South America map to the second neutralization domain of gp51.

Such therapeutic application in humans requires large numbers of functional NK cells that have been selected and expanded using clinical grade protocols. We established an extremely efficient cytokine-based culture system for ex vivo expansion of NK cells from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood (UCB). Systematic refinement of this two-step system using a novel clinical grade medium resulted in a therapeutically applicable cell culture protocol. CD56(+)CD3(-) NK cell products could be routinely generated from freshly selected CD34(+) UCB cells with a mean expansion of >15,000 fold and a nearly 100% purity. Moreover, our protocol has the capacity to produce more than 3-log NK cell expansion from frozen CD34(+) UCB cells. These ex vivo-generated cell products contain NK cell subsets differentially expressing NKG2A and killer immunoglobulin-like receptors. Furthermore, UCB-derived CD56(+) NK cells generated by our protocol uniformly express high levels of activating NKG2D and natural cytotoxicity receptors. Functional analysis showed that these ex vivo-generated NK cells efficiently target myeloid leukemia and melanoma tumor cell lines, and mediate cytolysis of primary leukemia cells at low NK-target ratios. Our culture system exemplifies a major breakthrough in producing pure NK cell products from limited numbers of CD34(+) cells for cancer immunotherapy.","['Laboratory of Hematology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",20100215,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, MIClique algorithm is proposed to identify DEC gene subsets based on mutual information and clique analysis. Mutual information is used to measure the coexpression relationship between each pair of genes in two different kinds of samples. Clique analysis is a commonly used method in biological network, which generally represents biological module of similar function.

In this study we report that TRAIL activates a TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 --> mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 3 (MKK3)/MKK6 --> p38 pathway in prostate cancer cells that transcriptionally upregulates expression of the antiapoptotic BCL-2 family member MCL-1. TRAIL alone triggered robust formation of the 'death-inducing signaling complex' (DISC), activation of the initiator caspase-8, and truncation of the BH3-only protein BID (tBID). Nevertheless, simultaneous disruption of the p38 MAPK pathway was required to suppress MCL-1 expression, thereby allowing tBID to activate the proapoptotic BCL-2 family member BAK and stimulate mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Release of the inhibitor-of-apoptosis (IAP) antagonist, Smac/DIABLO, from the intermembrane space was sufficient to promote TRAIL-induced apoptosis, whereas release of cytochrome c and activation of the apoptosome was dispensable. Even after MOMP, however, mitochondrial-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) activated a secondary signaling pathway, involving c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), that similarly upregulated MCL-1 expression and partially rescued some cells from death. Thus, stress kinases activated at distinct steps, before and after mitochondrial injury, mediate TRAIL resistance through maintenance of MCL-1 expression.","['Center for Molecular and Cellular Toxicology, Division of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA.']",20100219,,,,"['R01 CA129521/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA129521/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS456247'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients diagnosed in the first 3 months of life have especially high mortality. By morphology, infant ALL is classified as a lymphoid lineage leukemia; however, its physiologic behavior has brought many to consider it a pathologic hybrid between lymphoid leukemia and myeloid leukemias. As such, standard of care currently employs the use of chemotherapeutic agents used commonly in ALL protocols and agents typically reserved for the treatment of myelogenous lineage leukemias. The role of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and graft-versus-leukemia effect in these patients has not been well studied. CASE PRESENTATION: An earlier healthy 9-week-old Hispanic male diagnosed with precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia was treated with protocol P9407 and matched sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Relapse was noted on posttransplant day +114 with blasts on peripheral blood smear. The sole antigraft-versus-host disease (GVHD) agent, cyclosporine, was discontinued. Blast clearance from the peripheral blood was obtained by posttransplant day +128 with the appearance of skin and liver GVHD at posttransplant day +181. Bone marrow examination on posttransplant day +205 revealed normal marrow with no evidence of leukemic cells. He remains disease free more than 2 years posttransplant. CONCLUSION: Traditionally, graft-versus-leukemia effect was thought to contribute therapeutically little to the treatment of ALL by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The effects of graft-versus-leukemia immunologic phenomenon in our patient with infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia underscore the potential that infant ALL may not be entirely the same biologic entity as standard pediatric ALL and may be more responsive than understood earlier. Therapeutic response and appearance of GVHD after the withdrawal of immunosuppression in this patient provides evidence that graft-versus-leukemia effect may play a role in disease control in infant ALL after HSCT. Patients who relapse after the HSCT may be salvaged with the withdrawal of immunosuppression. This suggests that other immunotherapeutic interventions in the context of relapse may offer potential clinical benefit in this disease.","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, David Geffen School of Medicine/Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

None of the patients had received radiotherapy. Esophageal candidiasis was seen in 2 patients but the remaining 2 patients had earlier systemic candidiasis. High-dose dexamethasone may predispose these children to both esophageal candidiasis and peptic esophagitis. The etiology of esophageal strictures during treatment for acute leukemia is likely to be multifactorial but systemic candidiasis may play a significant role.,"[""Departments of Haematology, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland. kevrkelly77@hotmail.com""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We documented leukemia cases among children aged 0 to 14 years for each of the last 15 years. Population data were obtained from a 1997 census and various subsequent estimates to calculate rates. RESULTS: We observed 698 cases of childhood leukemia between 1993 and 2007, ranging between 15 cases (2.6 per 100 000 annual rate) in the first year and 56 cases (6.9 per 100 000 annual rate) in the final year, reaching a peak of 97 cases in 2006 (12.2 per 100 000 annual rate). CONCLUSIONS: Childhood leukemia rates in Basrah more than doubled over a 15-year period. The test for trend was significant (P = .03). Basrah's childhood leukemia rate compared unfavorably with neighboring Kuwait and nearby Oman, as well as the United States, the European Union, and other countries.","['Department of Global Health, School of Public Health, University of Washington, 4534 11th Avenue NE, Seattle, WA 98105, USA. hagopian@u.washington.edu']",20100218,,,,,,['Am J Public Health. 2010 Sep;100(9):1556-7; author reply 1557.

In this study, we found a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional signature in JAK1 mutation-positive human ALL samples. This signature was recapitulated in vitro by the expression of JAK1 mutants in BW5147 and BaF3 hematopoietic cell lines. Binding of JAK1 to the IFN receptor was essential because mutations in the FERM domain abrogated this effect. Beside the constitutive activation of the type I IFN signaling cascade, JAK1 mutations also strongly potentiated the response to IFN in vitro. Typically, the proliferation of cell lines expressing JAK1(A634D) was abrogated by type I IFNs. Interestingly, we found that different JAK1 mutations differentially potentiate responses to type I IFNs or to interleukin-9, another cytokine using JAK1 to mediate its effects. This suggests that the type of mutation influences the specificity of the effect on distinct cytokine receptor signaling. Finally, we also showed in an in vivo leukemia model that cells expressing JAK1(A634D) are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic effect of type I IFN, suggesting that type I IFNs should be considered as a potential therapy for ALL with JAK1-activating mutations.","['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium.']",20100218,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disturbances in the balance of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and deacetylase (HDAC) leads to a change in cell morphology, cell cycle, differentiation, and carcinogenesis. In particular, HDAC plays an important role in carcinogenesis and therefore it has been a target for cancer therapy. Structurally diverse group of HDAC inhibitors are known. The broadest class of HDAC inhibitor belongs to hydroxamic acid derivatives that have been shown to inhibit both class I and II HDACs. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and Trichostatin A (TSA), which chelate the zinc ions, fall into this group. In particular, SAHA, second generation HDAC inhibitor, is in several cancer clinical trials including solid tumors and hematological malignancy, advanced refractory leukemia, metastatic head and neck cancers, and advanced cancers. To our knowledge, selenium-containing HDAC inhibitors are not reported in the literature. In order to find novel HDAC inhibitors, two selenium based-compounds modeled after SAHA were synthesized. We have compared two selenium-containing compounds; namely, SelSA-1 and SelSA-2 for their inhibitory HDAC activities against SAHA. Both, SelSA-1 and SelSA-2 were potent HDAC inhibitors; SelSA-2 having IC50 values of 8.9 nM whereas SAHA showed HDAC IC(50) values of 196 nM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen leukemic cell lines bearing different cytogenetic abnormalities and normal hematopoietic cells were used in cytotoxicity and colony assays. The drug activity at the molecular level was analyzed by Western blotting. PHA-793887 was also tested in vivo in several leukemia xenograft models. RESULTS: PHA-793887 was cytotoxic for leukemic cell lines in vitro, with IC(50) ranging from 0.3 to 7 microM (mean: 2.9 microM), regardless of any specific chromosomal aberration. At these doses, the drug was not cytotoxic for normal unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells or CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells. Interestingly, in colony assays PHA-793887 showed very high activity against leukemia cell lines, with an IC(50) <0.1 microM (mean: 0.08 microM), indicating that it has efficient and prolonged antiproliferative activity. PHA-793887 induced cell-cycle arrest, inhibited Rb and nucleophosmin phosphorylation, and modulated cyclin E and cdc6 expression at low doses (0.2-1 microM) and induced apoptosis at the highest dose (5 microM). It was also effective in vivo in both subcutaneous xenograft and primary leukemic disseminated models that better mimic naturally occurring human disease. Interestingly, in one disseminated model derived from a relapsed Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoid leukemia patient, PHA-793887 showed strong therapeutic activity also when treatment was started after establishment of high disease burden. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that PHA-793887 has promising therapeutic activity against acute leukemias in vitro and in vivo.","['Nerviano Medical Sciences Srl, Business Unit Oncology, Nerviano, Italy.']",20100216,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goals of the present study were to investigate this FeLV reoccurrence and molecularly characterize the progeny viruses. RESULTS: The FeLV reoccurrence was detected by the presence of FeLV antigen and RNA in the blood and saliva. The cat was feline immunodeficiency virus positive and showed CD4+ T-cell depletion, severe leukopenia, anemia and a multicentric monoclonal B-cell lymphoma. FeLV-A, but not -B or -C, was detectable. Sequencing of the envelope gene revealed three FeLV variants that were highly divergent from the virus that was originally inoculated (89-91% identity to FeLV-A/Glasgow-1). In the long terminal repeat 31 point mutations, some previously described in cats with lymphomas, were detected. The FeLV variant tissue provirus and viral RNA loads were significantly higher than the FeLV-A/Glasgow-1 loads. Moreover, the variant loads were significantly higher in lymphoma positive compared to lymphoma negative tissues. An increase in the variant provirus blood load was observed at the time of FeLV reoccurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that ostensibly recovered FeLV provirus-positive cats may act as a source of infection following FeLV reactivation. The virus variants that had largely replaced the inoculation strain had unusually heavily mutated envelopes. The mutations may have led to increased viral fitness and/or changed the mutagenic characteristics of the virus.","['Clinical Laboratory, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. khungerbuehler@vetclinics.uzh.ch']",20100219,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The T315I mutation at the gatekeeper residue is very frequent in advanced phases of the disease and is one of the main causes of resistance, disrupting important contact points between the inhibitors and the enzyme. Different strategies have been implemented to overcome this resistance, including the synthesis of new Bcr-Abl ATPcompetitive or non-ATP-competitive inhibitors, dual Aurora/Bcr-Abl inhibitors and multi-targeted kinase inhibitors. An alternative approach is the use of other compounds that do not bind directly to the Bcr-Abl protein; instead, these molecules act on several downstream pathways, regulated by or linked in different ways to Bcr-Abl, that lead to the malignant transformation of the cells. For this reason, farnesyl transferase inhibitors, MAPK inhibitors, Rac guanosine triphosphatase inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, Hsp90 inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, PP2A activators and apoptosis inducers have been tested, alone or in combination with ATP-competitive inhibitors, against CML cell lines. This review discusses compounds that act on Bcr-Abl or different cell pathways and reports on the molecules active against the T315I mutation, particularly the most recent findings in this field. New molecules that are claimed by recent patents to be active on this mutation are also reported.

In addition, CECs were characterized by immunophenotypic, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and gene expression profile analyses. RESULTS: In patients with CLL, CECs were increased compared with controls. A higher level of CECs (>20/microL) identified a subset of patients with a more aggressive disease course characterized by a shorter time to first treatment both in univariate and multivariate analyses. In FISH analysis, 7 patients had a significant proportion of CECs and presented with the same cytogenetic lesion of neoplastic lymphocytes and immunophenotypic features of endothelial progenitor cells. The gene expression profile of sorted CECs revealed a molecular pattern, suggesting a derivation from CLL leukemic cells with increased cell survival and proliferation, diminished cell adhesion to extracellular matrix, and enhanced proangiogenic function compared with their normal counterparts.

The aim of this study was to learn if inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) would produce tumor responses. METHODS: This was a phase 2 study of oral single-agent everolimus (10 mg/day) for recurrent/refractory indolent lymphoid malignancies including CLL. RESULTS: Four of 22 patients with CLL (18%; 95% confidence interval, 5%-40%) achieved a partial remission to therapy. An unanticipated finding in this study was an increase in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) associated with a decrease in lymphadenopathy in 8 (36%) patients. ALC increased a median of 4.8-fold (range, 1.9- to 25.1-fold), and the clinically measurable lymphadenopathy decreased a median of 75.5% (range, 38%-93%) compared with baseline measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus has modest antitumor activity against CLL and can mobilize malignant cells from nodal masses into the peripheral circulation in a subset of CLL patients. Because CLL cells in lymphatic tissue and bone marrow can be more resistant to therapy than circulating CLL cells, the ability of everolimus to mobilize CLL cells into the circulation could be used in combination therapeutic regimens.","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA. zent.clive@mayo.edu']",,,,,"['P50 CA097274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA097274-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA97274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS189697'],,,['(c) 2010 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation were performed to test the interaction between ELL and HIF-1alpha. PC3 cells with stable ELL knockdown and PC3 cells with stable ELL overexpression, along with their controls, were established using lentiviral expression system. Western blot and real-time PCR were performed to test the effect of ELL on HIF-1alpha protein and its down-stream gene transcription. To elucidate potential effect of hypoxia on ELL, cell growth and colony formation assays were performed using PC3 subline with stable ELL overexpression. RESULTS: ELL is associated with HIF-1alpha in transfected cells. In PC3 prostate cancer cells, ELL inhibited HIF-1alpha protein level and down-stream gene expression. As expected, ELL inhibited cell growth and colony formation under normoxia. Interestingly, the inhibition was alleviated under hypoxia.

In this context, the development of high-dimensional models where the number of covariates is much larger than the number of observations (p>>n) is an ongoing challenge. A practicable approach is to use ridge penalized Cox regression in such situations. Beside focussing on finding the best prediction rule, one is often interested in determining a subset of covariates that are the most important ones for prognosis. This could be a gene set in the biostatistical analysis of microarray data. Covariate selection can then, for example, be done by L(1)-penalized Cox regression using the lasso (Tibshirani (1997). Statistics in Medicine 16, 385-395). Several approaches beyond the lasso, that incorporate covariate selection, have been developed in recent years. This includes modifications of the lasso as well as nonconvex variants such as smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) (Fan and Li (2001). Journal of the American Statistical Association 96, 1348-1360; Fan and Li (2002). The Annals of Statistics 30, 74-99). The purpose of this article is to implement them practically into the model building process when analyzing high-dimensional data with the Cox proportional hazards model. To evaluate penalized regression models beyond the lasso, we included SCAD variants and the adaptive lasso (Zou (2006). Journal of the American Statistical Association 101, 1418-1429). We compare them with ""standard"" applications such as ridge regression, the lasso, and the elastic net. Predictive accuracy, features of variable selection, and estimation bias will be studied to assess the practical use of these methods. We observed that the performance of SCAD and adaptive lasso is highly dependent on nontrivial preselection procedures. A practical solution to this problem does not yet exist. Since there is high risk of missing relevant covariates when using SCAD or adaptive lasso applied after an inappropriate initial selection step, we recommend to stay with lasso or the elastic net in actual data applications. But with respect to the promising results for truly sparse models, we see some advantage of SCAD and adaptive lasso, if better preselection procedures would be available. This requires further methodological research.","['Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany. benner@dkfz.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Infantile agranulocytosis,"" as Rolf Kostmann named this hereditary syndrome, has been known for more than half a century, yet the underlying genetic mutations have remained unknown for many decades. Fifty years later, homozygous mutations in the gene encoding the mitochondrial protein HCLS1-associated X1 were found in affected members of the original Kostmann pedigree. Therefore, the eponym ""Kostmann disease"" best fits this specific mutation and mode of inheritance. The identification of genetic cause now allows the analysis of genotype-phenotype correlations. After the development of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), the prognosis and quality of life improved dramatically.

Blockade of c-Kit will cause ICC loss in vivo. Stem cell leukemia (SCL) gene acts as a positive regulator of upstream transcription of c-Kit expression. This study aimed to explore whether the restoration of c-Kit expression promoted by SCL gene transfer could rescue ICC in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A modified ICC-loss mouse model was created by continual administration of anti-c-Kit antibody (ACK2) to obtain a steady status of ICC loss, and a recombinant adenovirus vector containing SCL gene (Ad-SCL) was designed to rescue ICC in these mice. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence labeling assays were performed to analyze the SCL and c-Kit expression in vitro and in vivo. The distribution and configuration of ICC were observed with immunohistochemistry and electromicroscope. RESULTS: Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence labeling assays showed that SCL gene was successfully delivered to cultured HeLa and ICC cells in vitro. Moreover, significantly increased c-Kit expression could be detected in the colon of Ad-SCL-infected ICC-loss mice. Furthermore, rescue of the ICC network and ICC with typical ultrastructural features could be detected in Ad-SCL-infected ICC-loss mice at day 37. CONCLUSIONS: Ad-SCL was able to enhance c-Kit expression, reactivate the c-Kit/SCF pathway, and rescue ICC in ICC-loss mice. Since loss and defects of ICC are associated with many human gut motility disorders, Ad-SCL may be of potential use in gene therapy of these patients.","['Department of General Surgery, Institute of Surgery Research, Daping Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400042, China.']",20100218,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this, CML resembles glioblastoma in that imatinib, which otherwise may be effective, cannot get to the tumor. Although a common street drug of abuse, methamphetamine is Food and Drug Administration-approved and marketed as a pharmaceutical drug to treat attention-deficit disorders. It has shown the ability to open the BBB in rodents. We have some clinical hints that it may do so in humans as well. This short note presents three new points potentially leading to better tyrosine kinase inhibition behind the BBB: 1) Pharmaceutical methamphetamine may have a useful role in treating both CML and glioblastoma by allowing higher imatinib concentrations behind the BBB. 2) The old antidepressant and monoamine oxidase inhibitor selegiline, used to treat Parkinson disease, is catabolized to methamphetamine. Selegiline, as a nonscheduled drug,may therefore be an easier way to open the BBB, allowing more effective chemotherapy with tyrosine kinases. 3) Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with a spectrum of inhibition only partially overlapping that of imatinib and a mechanism of tyrosine kinase inhibition that is different from that of imatinib. The two should be additive. In addition, dasatinib crosses the BBB poorly, and it can therefore be expected to benefit from methamphetamine-assisted entry.","['Department of Psychiatry, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT 05401, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several gene families are enriched among these regions of focal SCNA, including the BCL2 family of apoptosis regulators and the NF-kappaBeta pathway.

These parasitic elements are responsible for >10% of spontaneous mutations. Whereas DNA methylation has an important role in proviral silencing in somatic and germ-lineage cells, an additional DNA-methylation-independent pathway also functions in embryonal carcinoma and embryonic stem (ES) cells to inhibit transcription of the exogenous gammaretrovirus murine leukaemia virus (MLV). Notably, a recent genome-wide study revealed that ERVs are also marked by histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and H4K20me3 in ES cells but not in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. However, the role that these marks have in proviral silencing remains unexplored. Here we show that the H3K9 methyltransferase ESET (also called SETDB1 or KMT1E) and the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB)-associated protein 1 (KAP1, also called TRIM28) are required for H3K9me3 and silencing of endogenous and introduced retroviruses specifically in mouse ES cells. Furthermore, whereas ESET enzymatic activity is crucial for HP1 binding and efficient proviral silencing, the H4K20 methyltransferases Suv420h1 and Suv420h2 are dispensable for silencing. Notably, in DNA methyltransferase triple knockout (Dnmt1(-/-)Dnmt3a(-/-)Dnmt3b(-/-)) mouse ES cells, ESET and KAP1 binding and ESET-mediated H3K9me3 are maintained and ERVs are minimally derepressed. We propose that a DNA-methylation-independent pathway involving KAP1 and ESET/ESET-mediated H3K9me3 is required for proviral silencing during the period early in embryogenesis when DNA methylation is dynamically reprogrammed.","['Experimental Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, 53 Shogoin, Kawara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",20100217,,,,"['77805/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada', '92090/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada']",,,,,,,,,['Nature. 2014 Sep 4;513(7516):128'],,,,

Numerous epidemiologic studies support the hypothesis that individuals with lower serum vitamin D levels have a higher risk of a number of cancers. Measures of vitamin D level in such studies include both surrogate estimates of vitamin D level (residence in more northern latitudes, history of activity, and sun exposure) as well as measured serum 25(OH) cholecalciferol levels. Perhaps, the most robust of these epidemiologic studies is that of Giovannucci et al, who developed and validated an estimate of serum 25(OH) cholecalciferol level and reported that among >40,000 individuals in the Health Professionals Study, an increase in 25(OH) cholecalciferol level of 62.5 ng/mL was associated with a reduction in the risk of head/neck, esophagus, pancreas cancers, and acute leukemia by >50%. Unfortunately, very limited data are available to indicate whether or not giving vitamin D supplements reduces the risk of cancer. Many preclinical studies indicate that exposing cancer cells, as well as vascular endothelial cells derived from tumors, to high concentrations of active metabolites of vitamin D halts progression through cell cycle, induces apoptosis and will slow or stop the growth of tumors in vivo. There are no data that one type of cancer is more or less susceptible to the effects of vitamin D. Vitamin D also potentiates the antitumor activity of a number of types of cytotoxic anticancer agents in in vivo preclinical models. Vitamin D analogues initiate signaling through a number of important pathways, but the pathway(s) essential to the antitumor activities of vitamin D are unclear. Clinical studies of vitamin D as an antitumor agent have been hampered by the lack of a suitable pharmaceutical preparation for clinical study. All commercially available formulations are inadequate because of the necessity to administer large numbers of caplets and the poor ""bioavailability"" of calcitriol (the most carefully studied analogue) at these high doses. Preclinical data suggest that high exposures to calcitriol are necessary for the antitumor effects. Clinical data do indicate that high doses of calcitriol (>100 mcg weekly, intravenously, and 0.15 microg /kg weekly, orally) can be given safely. The maximum tolerated dose of calcitriol is unclear. While a 250-patient trial in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer comparing docetaxel (36 mg/sqm weekly) +/- calcitriol 0.15 microg/kg indicated that calcitriol was very safe may have reduced to death rate, an adequately powered (1000 patients) randomized study of weekly docetaxel + calcitriol versus q3 week docetaxel was negative. The limitations of this trial were the unequal chemotherapy arms compared in this study and the failure to use an optimal biologic dose or maximum-tolerated dose of calcitriol. In view of the substantial preclinical and epidemiologic data supporting the potential role of vitamin D in cancer, careful studies to evaluate the impact of vitamin D replacement on the frequency of cancer and the impact of an appropriate dose and schedule of calcitriol or other active vitamin D analogue on the treatment of established cancer are indicated.","['Department of Medicine, The Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA. donald.trump@roswellpark.org']",,,,98,"['P30 CA016056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA112914-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA085142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095045/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095045-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA067267/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095045-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA067267/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA095045/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA085142-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'PC040238/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA085142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA016056-32/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA112914/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016056-33/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA067267-15A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS167261'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors regulate chromatin structure and activate the DNA damage checkpoint pathway involving Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM). Herein, we investigated the impact of histone acetylation/deacetylation modification on the ATM-mediated transcriptional modulation to provide a better understanding of the transcriptional function of ATM. The prototype HDAC inhibitor trichostain A (TSA) reprograms expression of the myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL1) and Gadd45 genes via the ATM-mediated signal pathway. Transcription of MCL1 and Gadd45alpha is enhanced following TSA treatment in ATM(+) cells, but not in isogenic ATM(-) or kinase-dead ATM expressing cells, in the ATM-activated E2F1 or BRCA1- dependent manner, respectively. These findings suggest that ATM and its kinase activity are essential for the TSA-induced regulation of gene expression.

Our aim was to evaluate the optimal cut-off for IgVh mutational status, ZAP-70 expression and cytogenetic abnormalities in association with disease progression defined as the need for treatment within 3~years from diagnosis in 170 patients with B-CLL. DESIGN AND METHODS: Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and multivariate general linear models (GLMs) were used to investigate the most significant cut-off values of these biomarkers and their prognostic impact. RESULTS: Our findings estimated that the optimal cut-off for IgVh mutation status and for ZAP-70 protein expression was 97% and 16.5% respectively and a high concordance between the two was demonstrated. We identified 30% as being the best-cut-off for 17p-, 11q- and 6q-. In univariate analysis 17p- was found to be a significant predictor of the event only for the whole population. Multivariate analysis including all biological parameters, identified 11q deletion as the only significant regressor. CONCLUSIONS: We assessed that IgVh mutational status, ZAP-70 protein and 6q- are powerful prognostic markers.

CD160 is a multifunctional molecule in normal lymphocytes, but its role in CLL biology is unknown. In vitro, CLL cells undergo rapid spontaneous apoptosis, which CD160 activation protected against-mean cell viability increased from 67% to 79% (P < .001). This was associated with up-regulation of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, but not Bax. As expected from these changes in Bcl-2/Bax and Bcl-xL/Bax ratios, CD160 triggering reduced mitochondrial membrane potential collapse and cytochrome c release. CD160 stimulation also induced DNA synthesis, cell cycle progression, and proliferation. B-cell antigen receptor (BCR)-induced CLL proliferation was generally greater than with CD160, but marked variation was seen. Both BCR and CD160 signaling led to CLL secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8, although CD160 induced greater increases of IL-6 (51-fold) and IL-8 (15-fold). Survival and activation signals mediated by CD160 showed dose-dependent suppression by phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitors. Thus, in vitro, CLL cells can use the CD160 pathway for survival and activation, mimicking CD160 signaling in normal NK and CD8(+) T cells.

The aim of the present work was to investigate the factors involved in stimulating PKCbetaII expression in CLL cells. Here we show that the activation of PKCbetaII in CLL cells stimulated with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can drive expression of the gene for PKCbeta, PRKCB1. We found that this effect of VEGF on PRKCB1 transcription is paralleled by high expression of PKCbetaII protein and therefore probably contributes to the malignant phenotype of CLL cells. Taken together, the data presented in this study demonstrate that VEGF, in addition to its role in providing prosurvival signals, also plays a role in overexpression of PKCbetaII, an enzyme with a specific pathophysiologic role in CLL.","['Division of Haematology, School of Cancer Studies, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.']",20100217,,,,,,['Blood. 2010 Jun 3;115(22):4325-6.

TPbeta is activated by oligomerization mediated by the pointed domain of TEL/ETV6, leading to constitutive activation of the PDGFRbeta kinase domain. The receptor transmembrane (TM) domain is retained in TPbeta and in most of the described PDGFRbeta hybrids. Deletion of the TM domain (DeltaTM-TPbeta) strongly impaired the ability of TPbeta to sustain growth factor-independent cell proliferation. We confirmed that TPbeta resides in the cytosol, indicating that the PDGFRbeta TM domain does not act as a transmembrane domain in the context of the hybrid receptor but has a completely different function. The DeltaTM-TPbeta protein was expressed at a lower level because of increased degradation. It could form oligomers, was phosphorylated at a slightly higher level, co-immunoprecipitated with the p85 adaptor protein, but showed a much reduced capacity to activate STAT5 and ERK1/2 in Ba/F3 cells, compared with TPbeta. In an in vitro kinase assay, DeltaTM-TPbeta was more active than TPbeta and less sensitive to imatinib, a PDGFR inhibitor. In conclusion, we show that the TM domain is required for TPbeta-mediated signaling and proliferation, suggesting that the activation of the PDGFRbeta kinase domain is not enough for cell transformation.","['Universite Catholique de Louvain, de Duve Institute, BE-1200 Brussels, Belgium.']",20100217,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pioglitazone (PIO), a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonist, protects against myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. We assessed the effects of PPAR-gamma activation on myocardial miRNA levels and the role of miRNAs in IR injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the expression changes of miRNAs in the rat heart after PIO administration using miRNA arrays and then confirmed the result by northern blot. miR-29a and c levels decreased remarkably after 7-day treatment with PIO. In H9c2 cells, the effects of PIO and rosiglitazone on miR-29 expression levels were blocked by a selective PPAR-gamma inhibitor GW9662. Downregulation of miR-29 by antisense inhibitor or by PIO protected H9c2 cells from simulated IR injury, indicated as increased cell survival and decreased caspase-3 activity. In contrast, overexpressing miR-29 promoted apoptosis and completely blocked the protective effect of PIO. Antagomirs against miR-29a or -29c significantly reduced myocardial infarct size and apoptosis in hearts subjected to IR injury. Western blot analyses demonstrated that Mcl-2, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, was increased by miR-29 inhibition. CONCLUSION: Downregulation of miR-29 protected hearts against IR injury. The modulation of miRNAs can be achieved by pharmacological intervention. These findings provide a rationale for the development of miRNA-based strategies for the attenuation of IR injury.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Medical Branch, MRB 5:108, 301 University Boulevard, Galveston, TX 77555, USA. yumye@utmb.edu']",20100217,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Laromustine has limited extramedullary toxicity. In Phase II studies, it produced 32% complete responses in elderly patients with previously untreated AML. In a Phase III comparative study of its combination with cytarabine in relapsed AML, increased response rate was offset by excessive toxicity.

Notwithstanding, various questions concerning the management of APL remain unanswered. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: The aim of this article is to focus on still controversial issues in the management of APL, such as the role of arsenic trioxide as front-line therapy, the management of older unfit patients, the potential utility of gemtuzumab-ozogamycin and the effectiveness (if any) of maintenance therapy for patients in molecular remission. In addition, the possibility of reducing the intensity of post-remission therapy, which is associated with substantial morbidity in potentially cured patients, is discussed. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Current and future therapeutic options for the treatment of newly diagnosed and relapsed APL.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) controls several vital functions in the liver, including GH-mediated transcription of IGF-1. To investigate the role of STAT5 in liver fibrogenesis, we specifically deleted the Stat5a/b locus both in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes in the multidrug resistance gene 2 knockout (Mdr2(-/-)) mouse model of cholestasis. Double knockout mice develop an early and severe liver fibrosis phenotype, accompanied by perturbed expression of key regulators of bile acid homeostasis. Deletion of Stat5 resulted in GH resistance, and IGF-1 levels in serum were undetectable. We could observe reduced expression of important hepatoprotective genes, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr), hepatocyte nuclear factor 6 (Hnf6), prolactin receptor (Prlr), and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (Lifr) as well as increased numbers of apoptotic hepatocytes. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that loss of STAT5 sensitizes hepatocytes to bile acid-induced damage and apoptosis caused by disruption of GH-induced transcription of Igf-1 and down-regulation of hepatoprotective genes.

The cause of death (COD) of these patients is not well understood. Identifying the COD could help to guide early therapy decisions. METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed the COD in a cohort of 273 deceased patients with lower-risk MDS according to the International Prognostic Scoring System at presentation to The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from 1980 to 2004. MDS-related death was defined as infection, bleeding, transformation to AML, or disease progression. Remaining CODs were classified as non-MDS-related. RESULTS: Median age at presentation was 66 years (range, 19-88 years). Overall median survival was 59 weeks (range, 1-831 weeks). All French-American-British leukemia classification subgroups were represented. The percentage of International Prognostic Scoring System low and intermediate-1 groups were 21% and 79%, respectively. The most common cytogenetic abnormality (9%) was del(5q). Patients received supportive care only. The COD was identified as MDS-related in 230 of 273 (84%) patients. The most common disease-related CODs were infection (38%), transformation to AML (15%), and hemorrhage (13%). The most frequent non-disease-related COD was cardiovascular events (19 of 43 patients). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with low- or intermediate-1 risk MDS will die because of causes related to their underlying disease. Although these results need to be validated in different populations, early therapeutic intervention could be considered in the management of these patients to improve survival.","['Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas M.

AIMS: To ascertain whether these guidelines form standard unit policy by undertaking a survey of UK paediatric principal treatment centre (PTC) consultants and shared care (SC) consultants. PROCEDURES: In October 2008, a link to an on-line anonymised survey was sent by e-mail to all UK PTC consultants in Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) centres and to SC consultants linked to eight of these centres. RESULTS: Responses were received from 55 PTC consultants (representing all 21 CCLG centres) and 54 SC consultants. In accordance with the RCPCH guidelines, most PTC and SC consultants recommend initiating re-immunisation at 6 months after completion of standard-dose chemotherapy (99/105, 94.3%). Re-immunisation at the recommended time after HSCT for each transplant type was reported by 93-100% of respondents. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was recommended after chemotherapy by 58.3% (35/60) of respondents and by 51.7% (30/58) after HSCT. There were distinct differences between PTC and SC consultants in their choice of varicella (VZV) post-exposure prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high level of stated compliance with RCPCH guidelines. Recommendations for PCV after chemotherapy and HSCT were lower than expected. This may reflect the absence of specific guidelines after chemotherapy but not in HSCT patients where guidelines do exist. Variation in VZV post-exposure prophylaxis suggests further studies are required.","[""Division of Child Health, St. George's University of London, London, UK. jbate@sgul.ac.uk""]",,,,,['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,"['Copyright 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,"[""Supportive Care Group of the Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG)""]",,,,,,,

The toxic effect was abolished by converting QS fractions into stable nanoparticles through the binding of QS to cholesterol. Two fractions of QS were selected for particle formation, one with an acyl-chain (ASAP) was used to form killing and growth-inhibiting (KGI) particles, and the other without the acyl-chain (DSAP) was used to formulate blocking and balancing effect (BBE) particles. KGI showed significant growth inhibiting and cancer cell-killing activities in nine of 10 cell lines while BBE showed that on one cell line. The monoblastoid lymphoma cell line U937 was selected for analyzing the mode of action. Low concentrations of KGI (0.5 and 2 microg/mL) induced irreversible exit from the cell cycle, differentiation measured by cytokine production, and eventually programmed cell death (apoptosis). Compared to normal human monocytes, the U937 cells were 30-fold more sensitive to KGI. The nontoxic BBE blocked the cell killing effect of KGI in a concentration-dependent manner. In conclusion, the formulation of QS into nanoparticles has the potential of becoming a new class of anticancer agents.","['Department of Medical Sciences, Section of Virology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",20100202,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This apoptosis was not abrogated by chelation of intracellular iron with salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (SIH), but suppressed by N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a thiol antioxidant and GSH precursor, indicating that the cytotoxic effect of geoditin A is likely mediated by a NAC-inhibitable oxidative stress.

On the other hand, dysregulation of Notch1 signaling is associated with many different types of cancer as well as tumor angiogenesis, making Notch1 a potential therapeutic target. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we report the in vitro activities of inhibitory Notch1 monoclonal antibodies derived from cell-based and solid-phase screening of a phage display library. Two classes of antibodies were found, one directed against the EGF-repeat region that encompasses the ligand-binding domain (LBD), and the second directed against the activation switch of the receptor, the Notch negative regulatory region (NRR). The antibodies are selective for Notch1, inhibiting Jag2-dependent signaling by Notch1 but not by Notch 2 and 3 in reporter gene assays, with EC(50) values as low as 5+/-3 nM and 0.13+/-0.09 nM for the LBD and NRR antibodies, respectively, and fail to recognize Notch4. While more potent, NRR antibodies are incomplete antagonists of Notch1 signaling. The antagonistic activity of LBD, but not NRR, antibodies is strongly dependent on the activating ligand. Both LBD and NRR antibodies bind to Notch1 on human tumor cell lines and inhibit the expression of sentinel Notch target genes, including HES1, HES5, and DTX1. NRR antibodies also strongly inhibit ligand-independent signaling in heterologous cells transiently expressing Notch1 receptors with diverse NRR ""class I"" point mutations, the most common type of mutation found in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). In contrast, NRR antibodies failed to antagonize Notch1 receptors bearing rare ""class II"" or ""class III"" mutations, in which amino acid insertions generate a duplicated or constitutively sensitive metalloprotease cleavage site. Signaling in T-ALL cell lines bearing class I mutations is partially refractory to inhibitory antibodies as compared to cell-penetrating gamma-secretase inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Antibodies that compete with Notch1 ligand binding or that bind to the negative regulatory region can act as potent inhibitors of Notch1 signaling. These antibodies may have clinical utility for conditions in which inhibition of signaling by wild-type Notch1 is desired, but are likely to be of limited value for treatment of T-ALLs associated with aberrant Notch1 activation.","['Department of Biologics Research, Merck Research Laboratories, West Point, Pennsylvania, United States of America.']",20100208,,,,"['R56 CA092433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA119070-040003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 CA092433-06A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA119070-049001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 119070/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092433-06A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA119070/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cholesterol depletion impairs virus assembly and infectivity. This study examined the effects of exogenous cholesterol addition (delivered as a complex with methyl beta cyclodextrin) on the production of Molony murine leukemia virus retroviral vector and HIV-1-based lentiviral vector pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G). Cholesterol supplementation before and during vector production enhanced the infectivity of retroviral and lentiviral vectors up to 4-fold and 6-fold, respectively. In contrast, the amount of retroviral vector produced was unchanged, and that of lentiviral vector was increased less than two-fold. Both free cholesterol and cholesterol ester content in 293-gag-pol producer cells increased with cholesterol addition. In contrast, the phospholipids headgroup composition was essentially unchanged by cholesterol supplementation in 293-gag-pol packaging cells. Based on these results, it is proposed that cholesterol supplementation increases the infectivity of VSV-G-pseudotyped retroviral and lentiviral vectors, possibly by altering the composition of the producer cell membrane where the viral vectors are assembled and bud, and/or by changing the lipid composition of the viral vectors.","['Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston IL 60208.']",,,,,"['K01 CA082177-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL068585/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL068585-06/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 HL068585/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS83056'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This study presents a detailed pathological description of newly diagnosed lymphomas in Johannesburg, South Africa (January 2004 and December 2006). The review coincides with introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy. RESULTS: One thousand eight hundred and ninety-seven new lymphoproliferative disorders were referred to the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital. B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma accounted for 83%, T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma 3.5%, and Hodgkin lymphoma 7% of cases. The overall prevalence of HIV infection was 37% (n = 709). Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (21%; n = 401) was the most common lymphoma. HIV prevalence ranged from an absence in follicular or mantle cell lymphoma to a low prevalence in diseases like small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (4%) and pre-B/common ALL (5%) to a high prevalence in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (80%), Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia (86%), and primary effusion lymphoma (100%). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a baseline for monitoring the impact of HIV and management thereof on lymphoma trends. The high prevalence of HIV in certain lymphoma categories emphasizes the need for capacity to diagnose and manage dual conditions. This study highlights the need for strengthening of cancer registries within South Africa and the region.","['Department of Molecular Medicine and Haematology, Johannesburg, South Africa.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,['J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2010 Jun;54(2):221'],,,,

We analyzed 153 adult and child B-ALL harboring karyotypic abnormalities at chromosome 9p, to determine the frequency and the nature of PAX5 alterations. We found PAX5 internal rearrangements in 21% of the cases. To isolate fusion partners, we used classic and innovative techniques (rolling circle amplification-rapid amplification of cDNA ends) and single nucleotide polymorphism-comparative genomic hybridization arrays. Recurrent and novel fusion partners were identified, including NCoR1, DACH2, GOLGA6, and TAOK1 genes showing the high variability of the partners. We noted that half the fusion genes can give rise to truncated PAX5 proteins. Furthermore, malignant cells carrying PAX5 fusion genes displayed a simple karyotype. These data strongly suggest that PAX5 fusion genes are early players in leukemogenesis. In addition, PAX5 deletion was observed in 60% of B-ALL with 9p alterations. Contrary to cases with PAX5 fusions, deletions were associated with complex karyotypes and common recurrent translocations. This supports the hypothesis of the secondary nature of the deletion. Our data shed more light on the high variability of PAX5 alterations in B-ALL. Therefore, it is probable that gene fusions occur early, whereas deletions should be regarded as a late/secondary event.","['Inserm, U563, 31024 Toulouse, France.']",20100216,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it remains unclear how fetal LIF level is regulated. Here we show evidence that maternal LIF signals drive fetal LIF levels via the placenta, thereby promoting neurogenesis in the fetal brain in rats. Chronological changes showed that LIF concentration in fetal sera (FS) and fetal cerebrospinal fluid peaked at gestational day (GD) 15.5, after the peak of maternal LIF at GD14.5. LIF injection into rat dams at GD15.5 increased the level of ACTH in FS and subsequently increased LIF levels in FS and fetal cerebrospinal fluid. The elevation of fetal LIF after LIF injection into dams was inhibited by in utero injection of anti-ACTH antibody into fetuses. Cultured syncytiotrophoblasts, which express the LIF receptor and glycoprotein 130, were induced to secrete ACTH and up-regulate Pomc expression by the addition of LIF. Nucleated red blood cells from fetuses at GD15.5, but not GD13.5 or GD17.5, displayed LIF secretion in response to ACTH. Moreover, injection of LIF into dams at GD13.5 or GD17.5 did not result in elevation of ACTH or LIF in fetuses. The labeling index of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-positive cells in the ventricular zone of the cerebral neocortex increased 24 h after injection of LIF into dams at GD15.5 but not GD13.5 or GD17.5. These results suggest that in rats maternal LIF induces ACTH from the placenta, which in turn induces fetal nucleated red blood cells to secrete LIF that finally increases neurogenesis in fetuses around GD15.","['Department of Molecular and Cell Structural Science, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Ishikawa 920-0293, Japan.']",20100216,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because relatively few mHAs are known, we developed a new approach to predict and subsequently validate candidate mHA. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We developed an algorithm based on genetic disparities between Y chromosome-encoded and X chromosome-encoded proteins and known requirements for binding to HLA class I molecules to predict Y chromosome-derived, HLA A*0201-restricted peptides (HY) and ranked peptides based on potential immunogenicity. We evaluated T-cell responses to 41 candidate peptides in 28 male recipients with female donors (FM), 22 male recipients with male donors (MM), and 26 normal individuals. All patients and donors were HLA A*0201 positive. RESULTS: Thirteen peptides derived from five proteins elicited significantly greater T-cell responses in FM patients compared with MM patients and in normal females compared with normal males. Six peptides were more immunogenic than the only previously known HLA A*0201-restricted Y-encoded mHA. Twenty-seven of 28 FM patients responded to at least one HY peptide, but despite a common Y chromosome mismatch and expression of HLA A*0201, each patient responded to a unique set of peptides. CONCLUSIONS: Novel HLA A*0201-restricted HY epitopes can be predicted and validated in patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Highly diverse patterns of T-cell response against these epitopes have been identified. Prospective monitoring of responses to large panels of immunogenic peptides can facilitate the identification of clinically relevant targets of graft-versus-host disease and graft versus leukemia.","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Cancer Vaccine Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",20100216,,,,"['P01 HL070149/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA142106-06A16809/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA142106-06A16807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL070149-050003/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL070149-059001/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI029530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI29530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA142106-06A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA142106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AI029530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA155258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA142106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS169269'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We have developed the humanized defucosylated anti-CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) monoclonal antibody KW-0761 as a next generation immunotherapeutic agent. The first aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the antitumor activity of KW-0761 would likely be sufficient for therapeutic clinical application against ATLL. The second aim was to fully elucidate the mechanism of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by this defucosylated monoclonal antibody. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The antitumor activity of KW-0761 against ATLL cell lines was evaluated in vitro using human cells and in mice in vivo. Primary ATLL cells from 23 patients were evaluated for susceptibility to autologous ADCC with KW-0761 by two independent methods. RESULTS: KW-0761 showed potent antitumor activity against ATLL cell lines both in vitro and in the ATLL mouse model in vivo. In addition, KW-0761 showed potent antitumor activity mediated by highly enhanced ADCC against primary ATLL cells both in vitro and ex vivo in an autologous setting. The degree of KW-0761 ADCC against primary ATLL cells in an autologous setting was mainly determined by the amount of effector natural killer cells present, but not the amount of the target molecule CCR4 on the ATLL cell surface. CONCLUSION: KW-0761 should be sufficiently active for therapeutic clinical application for ATLL. In addition, combination treatment strategies that augment natural killer cell activity should be promising for amplifying the effect of KW-0761. In the near future, the actual efficacy of KW-0761 will be established in pivotal clinical trials.","['Department of Medical Oncology and Immunology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.']",20100216,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we report the effects of AZD1152-HQPA, a highly selective inhibitor of aurora-B kinase, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and primary samples. We show that AZD1152-HQPA inhibits the phosphorylation of Histone H3 (pHH3) on serine 10 resulting in polyploid cells, apoptosis, and loss of viability in a panel of AML cell lines. We also show that AZD1152-HQPA sensitivity in our cell lines is irrespective of p53 status and the FLT3-ITD-expressing MOLM-13 and MV4-11 cell lines are particularly sensitive to AZD1152-HQPA. Internal tandem duplications (ITD) within the FLT3 tyrosine kinase receptor are found in approximately 25% of AML patients and are associated with a poor prognosis. Here, we report that AZD1152-HQPA directly targets phosphorylated FLT3 along with inhibiting its downstream target phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) in the FLT3-ITD cell lines. We show pHH3 expression in primary AML blasts and its inhibition by AZD1152-HQPA at low doses in all of our primary samples tested. AZD1152-HQPA inhibits the clonogenic potential of primary AML samples, with FLT3-ITD samples being the most sensitive (P = 0.029). FLT3-ITD primary samples are also more sensitive to pHH3 inhibition (P = 0.022) and are particularly sensitive to pSTAT5 downregulation after treatment with AZD1152-HQPA compared with FLT3 wild-type samples (P = 0.007). We conclude that mutant FLT3 is a secondary target of AZD1152-HQPA and that FLT3-ITD primary samples are particularly sensitive to the drug.","['Department of Academic Haematology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom. mrxmg3@nottingham.ac.uk']",20100216,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding cellular mechanisms and pathways that are activated in leukemic cells to control the generation of As(2)O(3) responses should have important implications in the development of novel approaches using As(2)O(3) for the treatment of leukemias. In this study, we used immunoblotting and immune complex kinase assays to provide evidence that the kinases thousand-and-one amino acid kinase 2 (TAO2) and transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) are rapidly activated in response to treatment of acute leukemia cells with As(2)O(3). Such activation occurs after the generation of reactive oxygen species and regulates downstream engagement of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Our studies demonstrate that siRNA-mediated knockdown of TAO2 or TAK1 or pharmacological inhibition of TAK1 enhances the suppressive effects of As(2)O(3) on KT-1-derived leukemic progenitor colony formation and on primary leukemic progenitors from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. These results indicate key negative-feedback regulatory roles for these kinases in the generation of the antileukemic effects of As(2)O(3).

In 2003, less stringent response categories were introduced, most notably CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp). Although the significance of CRp for survival remains unclear, reports of AML trials frequently combine CR with CRp rather than considering CR as a separate entity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This practice led us to retrospectively examine the effect of CR on outcome in newly diagnosed AML, by using data from 6,283 patients treated on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) and Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) protocols or at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. This effect was then contrasted with the effect of CRp in the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center cohort. RESULTS: At least 94% of patients receiving cytarabine-based therapy and surviving for more than 3 or 5 years achieved a CR with either initial or salvage therapy; limited data suggest the same for patients receiving initial therapies that did not contain cytarabine. Patients with CR were more likely to live beyond 3 or 5 years than patients with CRp. The likelihood of achieving a CR rather than CRp was greater for patients with AML who had better prognosis. After adjustment for covariates, the relapse-free survival of patients achieving CR was longer than that of patients achieving CRp, whereas patients with CRp survived longer than those with resistant disease. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that CR is of unique clinical significance and should be reported as separate response in trials of newly diagnosed AML. Nonetheless, our findings validate CRp as a clinically meaningful response.","['Clinical Research Division and Southwest Oncology Group Statistical Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA. rwalter@fhcrc.org']",20100216,,,,"['K23 CA137161/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23CA137161/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Binding of soluble or immobilized (pro)MMP-9, a catalytically inactive proMMP-9 mutant, or the MMP-9 hemopexin domain to its docking receptors alpha4beta1 integrin and CD44v, induces an intracellular signaling pathway that prevents B-CLL apoptosis.

Various processing methods significantly affected total saponin, phytic acid, and total phenolic content and individual isoflavone distribution. The laboratory UHT and the two-stage processed soy milk exhibited relatively higher total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, saponin and phytic acid than those processed by the traditional and steam processed methods. Thermal processing caused obvious intertransformation but did not cause severe degradation except for breaking down of aglycons. Thermal processing significantly increased antioxidant capacities of soy milk determined by chemical analyses, but decreased cellular antioxidant capacities as compared to the raw soy milk. The raw and all processed soy milk exhibited antipoliferative activities against human HL-60 leukemia cells, AGS gastric tumor cells, and DU145 prostate cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. The raw soy milk, but not the processed soy milk, exhibited a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect against colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells.

The main limitation of ADI from Pseudomonas plecoglossicida (PpADI) lies in its pH-dependent activity profile, its pH optimum is at 6.5. A pH shift from 6.5 to 7.5 results in an approximately 80 % drop in activity. (The pH of human plasma is 7.35 to 7.45.) In order to shift the PpADI pH optimum, a directed-evolution protocol based on an adapted citrulline-screening protocol in microtiter-plate format was developed and validated. A proof of concept for ADI engineering resulted in a pH optimum of pH 7.0 and increased resistance under physiological and slightly alkaline conditions.

When bound to CNTF, neuropoietin (NP), or cardiotrophin-like-cytokine (CLC), CNTFR forms a signaling complex with gp130 and the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, which both play critical roles in bone cell biology. This study aimed to determine the role of CNTFR-signaling cytokines in bone. Immunohistochemistry detected CNTF in osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteoclasts, and proliferating chondrocytes. CNTFR mRNA was detected in primary calvarial osteoblasts and was upregulated during osteoblast differentiation. Treatment of osteoblasts with CNTF or CLC, but not NP, significantly inhibited mineralization and osterix mRNA levels. Twelve-week-old male CNTF ( -/- ) mice demonstrated reduced femoral length, cortical thickness, and periosteal circumference; but femoral trabecular bone mineral density (Tb.BMD) and tibial trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) were not significantly different from wild-type, indicating a unique role for CNTF in bone growth in male mice. In contrast, female CNTF ( -/- ) femora were of normal width, but femoral Tb.BMD, tibial BV/TV, trabecular number, and trabecular thickness were all increased. Female CNTF ( -/- ) tibiae also demonstrated high osteoblast number and mineral apposition rate compared to wild-type littermates, and this was intrinsic to the osteoblast lineage. CNTF is expressed locally in bone and plays a unique role in female mice as an inhibitor of trabecular bone formation and in male mice as a stimulus of cortical growth.","[""St. Vincent's Institute, 9 Princes Street, Fitzroy, VIC 3065, Australia.""]",20100216,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Calcif Tissue Int. 2013 May;92(5):493'],,,,

In order to investigate the relationship between Notch signaling and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in this study, we expressed a recombinant Notch ligand protein, the DSL domain of the human Jagged1 fused with GST (GST-Jag1). GST-Jag1 could activate Notch signaling in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60, as shown by a reporter assay and the induced expression of Notch effector gene Hes1 and Hes5. However, GST-Jag1 had no effect on the proliferation and survival of HL60 cells. HL60 cells expressed both Notch ligands and receptors, and had a potential of reciprocal stimulation of Notch signaling between cells. We, therefore, blocked Notch signaling in cultured HL60 cells using a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI). We found that GSI inhibited the proliferation of HL60 cells significantly by blocking the cell-cycle progression in the G1 phase. Furthermore, GSI induced remarkably apoptosis of HL60 cells. These changes in GSI-treated HL60 cells correlated with the down-regulation of c-Myc and Bcl2, and the low phosphorylation of the Rb protein. These results suggested that reciprocal Notch signaling might be necessary for the proliferation and survival of AML cells, possibly through the maintenance of the expression of c-Myc and Bcl2, as well as the phosphorylation of the Rb protein.","[""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710038, China.""]",20100216,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An important effector of aging is the cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p16(INK4a), which is also a known suppressor of cancer. The expression of p16(INK4a) is very low or absent in young organisms but increases with advancing age. We recently showed that, unlike healthy cells, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) derived blasts show a down-regulation of p16(INK4a) mRNA with increasing age. Based on this observation we hypothesize that suppression of defense mechanisms which protect older cells against cellular and DNA damage might facilitate oncogenesis in older individuals.","[""Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.""]",20091023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mast cells and basophils activated by multivalent antigen-IgE complexes, this step is mediated by Src family kinase Lyn, which phosphorylates the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilonRI). However, the exact molecular mechanism of this phosphorylation step is incompletely understood. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that changes in activity and/or topography of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) could play a major role in the Fc epsilonRI triggering. We found that exposure of rat basophilic leukemia cells or mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells to PTP inhibitors, H(2)O(2) or pervanadate, induced phosphorylation of the Fc epsilonRI subunits, similarly as Fc epsilonRI triggering. Interestingly, and in sharp contrast to antigen-induced activation, neither H(2)O(2) nor pervanadate induced any changes in the association of Fc epsilonRI with detergent-resistant membranes and in the topography of Fc epsilonRI detectable by electron microscopy on isolated plasma membrane sheets. In cells stimulated with pervanadate, H(2)O(2) or antigen, enhanced oxidation of active site cysteine of several PTPs was detected. Unexpectedly, most of oxidized phosphatases bound to the plasma membrane were associated with the actin cytoskeleton. Several PTPs (SHP-1, SHP-2, hematopoietic PTP, and PTP-MEG2) showed changes in their enzymatic activity and/or oxidation state during activation. Based on these and other data, we propose that down-regulation of enzymatic activity of PTPs and/or changes in their accessibility to the substrates play a key role in initial tyrosine phosphorylation of the Fc epsilonRI and other multichain immune receptors.","['Laboratory of Signal Transduction, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, CZ-142 20 Prague 4, Czech Republic.']",20100215,,,,['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: We assessed the ability of OncoVEX(GALV/CD) and OncoVEX(GFP) to infect, replicate within, and lyse 4 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma lines in vitro. The effects of adding fluorocytosine with OncoVEX(GALV/CD) were evaluated. RESULTS: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma was permissive to green fluorescent protein expression in100% of cells by OncoVEX(GFP) at a multiplicity of infection of 1 after 48 hours and supported logarithmic viral replication. Virus caused more than 60% cell death 6 days after exposure to virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 in 3 of the 4 cell lines. Fluorocytosine did not enhance cytotoxicity induced by OncoVEX(GALV/CD) at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. However, for the least-sensitive SCC25 cell line, virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 was cytotoxic to only 4% of cells after 6 days but was cytotoxic to 35% of cells with fluorocytosine. CONCLUSIONS: OncoVEX(GALV/CD) efficiently infects, replicates within, and lyses head and neck squamous cell carcinoma at relatively low viral doses. Prodrug conversion by cytosine deaminase did not enhance therapy at viral doses that cause efficient cytotoxicity but may have beneficial effects in less-sensitive cell lines at low viral doses.","['Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.']",,,,,"['T32 CA009685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009685-17/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA009685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21DE019015/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS137228'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, such protocols are complicated by extensive ex vivo manipulations of tumor-reactive cells and have largely focused on CD8(+) CTLs, with much less emphasis on the role and contribution of CD4(+) T cells. Using a mouse model of advanced melanoma, we found that transfer of small numbers of naive tumor-reactive CD4(+) T cells into lymphopenic recipients induces substantial T cell expansion, differentiation, and regression of large established tumors without the need for in vitro manipulation. Surprisingly, CD4(+) T cells developed cytotoxic activity, and tumor rejection was dependent on class II-restricted recognition of tumors by tumor-reactive CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore, blockade of the coinhibitory receptor CTL-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) on the transferred CD4(+) T cells resulted in greater expansion of effector T cells, diminished accumulation of tumor-reactive regulatory T cells, and superior antitumor activity capable of inducing regression of spontaneous mouse melanoma. These findings suggest a novel potential therapeutic role for cytotoxic CD4(+) T cells and CTLA-4 blockade in cancer immunotherapy, and demonstrate the potential advantages of differentiating tumor-reactive CD4(+) cells in vivo over current protocols favoring in vitro expansion and differentiation.","['Ludwig Center for Cancer Immunotherapy, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",20100215,,,,"['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']",,['Immunotherapy. 2010 Sep;2(5):607.

In tumor cells, the glycolytic pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 (PKM2, M2-PK) determines whether glucose is converted to lactate for regeneration of energy (active tetrameric form, Warburg effect) or used for the synthesis of cell building blocks (nearly inactive dimeric form). This review discusses the regulation mechanisms of pyruvate kinase M2 expression by different transcription factors as well as the regulation of pyruvate kinase M2 activity by direct interaction with certain oncoproteins, tyrosine and serine phosphorylation, binding of phosphotyrosine peptides, association with other glycolytic and non glycolytic enzymes, the promyelocytic leukemia tumor suppressor protein, as well as metabolic intermediates. An intervention in the regulation mechanisms of the expression, activity and tetramer to dimer ratio of pyruvate kinase M2 has severe consequences for metabolism as well as proliferation and tumorigenic capacity of the cells which makes this enzyme a promising target for potential therapeutic approaches. The quantification of the dimeric form of pyruvate kinase M2 (Tumor M2-PK) in plasma and stool allows early detection of tumors and therapy control. Several different mechanisms may induce a translocation of pyruvate kinase M2 into the nucleus. The role of pyruvate kinase M2 in the nucleus is complex as witnessed by evidence of its effect both as pro-proliferative as well as pro-apoptotic stimuli.","['Institute of Biochemistry & Endocrinology, Veterinary Medicine, University of Giessen, Giessen, Germany.

Its therapeutic activity is dependent on maintenance of the synergistic 5:1 drug:drug ratio in vivo. CPX-351 liposomes have a mean diameter of 107 nm, a single phase transition temperature of 55.3 degrees C, entrapped volume of 1.5 microL/micromol lipid and a zeta potential of -33 mV. Characterization of these physicochemical properties led to identification of an internal structure within the liposomes, later shown to be produced during the cytarabine loading procedure. Fluorescence labeling studies are presented that definitively show that the structure is composed of lipid and represents a second lamella.

We have studied a total of 170 samples from chronic fatigue syndrome patients from two UK cohorts and 395 controls for evidence of XMRV infection by looking either for the presence of viral nucleic acids using quantitative PCR (limit of detection <16 viral copies) or for the presence of serological responses using a virus neutralisation assay. RESULTS: We have not identified XMRV DNA in any samples by PCR (0/299). Some serum samples showed XMRV neutralising activity (26/565) but only one of these positive sera came from a CFS patient. Most of the positive sera were also able to neutralise MLV particles pseudotyped with envelope proteins from other viruses, including vesicular stomatitis virus, indicating significant cross-reactivity in serological responses. Four positive samples were specific for XMRV. CONCLUSIONS: No association between XMRV infection and CFS was observed in the samples tested, either by PCR or serological methodologies. The non-specific neutralisation observed in multiple serum samples suggests that it is unlikely that these responses were elicited by XMRV and highlights the danger of over-estimating XMRV frequency based on serological assays. In spite of this, we believe that the detection of neutralising activity that did not inhibit VSV-G pseudotyped MLV in at least four human serum samples indicates that XMRV infection may occur in the general population, although with currently uncertain outcomes.","['Division of Virology, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, The Ridgeway, Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, UK.']",20100215,,,,"['MC_U117592729/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'U117512710/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'U117592729/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U117512710/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '084955/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major phosphorylation site of human GR targeted by MAPK family is the serine 226 and multiple kinase complexes phosphorylate receptor at the serine 211 residue. We hypothesize that GR posttranslational modifications are involved in the determination of the cellular fate in human lymphoblastic leukemia cells. We investigated whether UV signalling through alternative GR phosphorylation determined the cell type specificity of glucocorticoids (GCs) mediated apoptosis. RESULTS: We have identified putative Glucocorticoid Response Elements (GREs) within the promoter regulatory regions of the Bcl-2 family members NOXA and Mcl-1 indicating that they are direct GR transcriptional targets. These genes were differentially regulated in CEM-C7-14, CEM-C1-15 and A549 cells by glucocorticoids and JNK pathway. In addition, our results revealed that the S211 phosphorylation was dominant in CEM-C7-14, whereas the opposite was the case in CEM-C1-15 where prevalence of S226 GR phosphorylation was observed. Furthermore, multiple GR isoforms with cell line specific patterns were identified in CEM-C7-14 cells compared to CEM-C1-15 and A549 cell lines with the same antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: GR phosphorylation status kinetics, and site specificity as well as isoform variability differ in CEM-C7-14, CEM-C1-15, and A549 cells. The positive or negative response to GCs induced apoptosis in these cell lines is a consequence of the variable equilibrium of NOXA and Mcl-1 gene expression potentially mediated by alternatively phosphorylated GR, as well as the balance of MAPK/CDK pathways controlling GR phosphorylation pattern. Our results provide molecular base and valuable knowledge for improving the GC based therapies of leukaemia.","['School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.']",20100215,,,,"['069024/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'Y52450X/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the clinical course in B-CLL patients is highly variable, the most conserved feature is the prolonged survival of malignant B-cells, which has been associated to defects in the apoptotic machinery. The apoptosis defects are mainly determined by a defective balance among pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, often related to resistance of CLL B-cells to chemotherapy. Purine nucleoside analogs or alkylating agents, alone or in combination, are the first-line treatment for B-CLL patients. Alternative, more specifically tailored therapeutics have been developed in recent years, including humanized monoclonal antibodies and kinase inhibitors. Here we shall review the drugs which are commonly used or are currently being assessed in clinical trials on B-CLL patients, their chemical structure, mechanisms of action, pharmacological properties, molecular targets, clinical efficacy and side effects, with a focus on drugs designed to promote apoptosis of malignant B-cells by targeting the Bcl-2 family.","['Department of Evolutionary Biology, University of Siena, Via Aldo Moro 2, Siena, Italy.']",,,,104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When performing drug screens, compounds decreasing the signal are therefore considered as putative inhibitors. However, this approach can cause the selection of many false positives, since, for example, both killing of the host cell and inhibiting viral cell-entry results in the same signal. Using a model system based on murine leukemia virus (MLV) particles pseudotyped with the G-protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G), we have developed generic assays coupling a positive readout to the inhibition of viral transduction. Consequently, the system favors drug candidates (and concentrations thereof) that do not harm human cells and significantly decreases the probability for selecting false positives. The assay allows Z-factors of approximately 0.9, takes cytotoxic side effects into account and could in theory be adapted for high-throughput screening of inhibitors against further viral species.","[""Institut de Science et d'Ingenierie Supramoleculaires, Universite de Strasbourg, 8 Allee Gaspard Monge, 67083 Strasbourg Cedex, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies in precursor B cell ALL (B-ALL) have demonstrated that chemotherapy commonly results in the loss of antigens associated with immaturity, limiting their utility for minimal residual disease (MRD) detection. Little information is available about the stability of these antigens in precursor T cell ALL (T-ALL) though it is presumed that CD99 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) are highly informative based on limited studies. METHODS: In a longitudinal investigation, we explored patterns of lineage specific and immaturity-associated antigens in T-ALL in a large cohort of patients treated under the multicenter Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocol. All samples were analyzed using multicolor flow cytometry in a standardized fashion at a single institution. RESULTS: We report that markers of immaturity particularly, TdT and CD99, dramatically decline on leukemic blasts during therapy. CD34 and CD10 expression is confined to a minority of pretreatment samples and is also not stable. In contrast, lineage-associated markers including CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, and CD8 failed to show significant trends. CONCLUSIONS: Our study strongly argues for expansion of immunophenotyping panels for T-ALL MRD to decrease reliance on immature antigens.

This study demonstrates that the frequency of RARA-PML expression has been underestimated and highlights remarkable complexity at chromosomal breakpoint regions in APL even in cases with an apparently simple balanced t(15;17)(q24;q12).","['Pathologisches Institut, Universitatsmedizin Mannheim, Theodor-Kutzer-Ufer 1-3, Mannheim, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,

Given the high plasticity of cells, we searched for leukemia-associated genetic aberrations and immunoglobulin (IG) gene rearrangements in mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from childhood B-cell precursor ALL patients. MSC from all ten ALL patients analyzed presented the chromosomal translocations that had been detected in leukemia cells (TEL-AML1, E2A-PBX1, or MLL rearrangement). The proportions of translocation-positive MSC varied between 10% and 54% depending on the patients and the time point of analysis. Leukemia-specific IG gene rearrangements were detected in the MSC from three ALL patients. The detection of leukemia-associated genetic aberrations in MSC indicates a clonal relationship between MSC and leukemia cells and suggests their involvement in the pathogenesis and/or pathophysiology of childhood ALL.","['Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow Klinikum, Berlin, Germany.

Terbufos has not been demonstrated to be carcinogenic in rodents, although non-arsenical insecticides, including OPs, have been associated with excess cancer in epidemiologic studies. We investigated associations between use of terbufos and the incidence of cancer. METHODS: The Agricultural Health Study is a prospective cohort study of 57,310 licensed pesticide applicators from Iowa and North Carolina. Detailed information about 50 pesticides, including terbufos, and potential confounders was obtained from self-administered questionnaires. Terbufos intensity-weighted lifetime exposure-days were defined as (lifetime exposure-days) x (exposure intensity score). Cases include all first primary cancers diagnosed between enrollment and December 31, 2005. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI were calculated with Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Overall cancer risk was slightly increased among terbufos users [HR 1.21 (1.06-1.37)]. Suggestive associations were observed between terbufos use and cancers of the prostate (HR(highest tertile) = 1.21; 95% CI = 0.99-1.47) and lung (HR(middle tertile) = 1.45; 95% CI = 0.95-2.22) and leukemia (HR(middle tertile) = 2.38; 95% CI = 1.35-4.21) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (HR(middle tertile) = 1.94; 95% CI = 1.16-3.22), although the exposure-response gradients were non-monotonic and p for trends were not significant. CONCLUSION: We found suggestive associations between occupational terbufos use and several cancer sites. However, cautious interpretation of these results is warranted by the lack of existing experimental and epidemiologic evidence to support carcinogenic effects of terbufos.","['Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health and Health Professions, University at Buffalo, 270 Farber Hall, Buffalo, NY, USA. mrbonner@buffalo.edu']",20100213,,,,"['Z01 CP010119/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01-ES049030-11/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 ES049030/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01-CP010119/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 CP010119-12/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS232228'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The cumulative incidences of tMDS/AML relapse and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were 38 and 17%, respectively. Those outcomes were very similar to those of patients with de novo disease. In multivariable analyses, a history of breast cancer had no impact on OS, DFS, relapse or NRM.

Our data revealed that triptolide decreases the expression of multidrug resistance protein and MDR in both KB-7D and KB-tax cells. It also induces apoptosis in these multidrug-resistant cancer cells by activating caspase-3, and decreasing Mcl-1 and XIAP. Triptolide not only inhibits tumor growth but also induces apoptosis of these drug-resistant cancer cells in xenograft mouse models.

Computed tomography revealed several enlarged lymph nodes assembling at the left axilla. The serum soluble IL-2 receptor was 47,500 U/mL, and HTLV-1 antibody was positive. His parents came from Kyushu. The pathological diagnosis was peripheral T-cell lymphoma, CD4(+). He was clinically diagnosed as having an adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, lymphoma type, and clinical stage II. Two courses of CHOP therapy were given to the patient, without any response. Because the patient had to undergo hemodialysis consistently, we preferred mild salvage therapy to more intensive treatment. Then, sobuzoxane (SBZ), 1,600 mg/day in two divided doses, was administered orally for 5 days. Soon thereafter, unexpectedly, the axillary tumor rapidly became small, resulting in disappearance four months later. SBZ therapy, 800 mg/day x 3 days, was continued at intervals of 7 to 8 weeks until October 2008. At the time of reporting, May 2009, the patient was well without recurrence of ATLL, and the remission has lasted 26 months or more. The reason why CHOP-resistant ATLL responded dramatically to SBZ alone is not clear, but the plasma concentration of the metabolite of SBZ was possibly very high because of renal failure. Another possibility is that hemodialysis removed the growth factor(s) or anti-apoptotic factor(s) derived from ATLL cells.","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Chiba Cancer Center Hospital.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is caused by inherited or acquired disorders including low mass or high mass multiple myeloma. OBJECTIVES: To report the first case series of patients with lymphoma and FS. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: Patients with lymphoma and FS were identified in the nephrology department of two teaching hospitals in Paris, France and Ghent, Belgium. FS was defined by the presence of at least three out of the four following criteria: hypophosphataemia, metabolic acidosis, normoglycaemic glucosuria and hypokalaemia. Patients files were reviewed and relevant data were collected. RESULTS: Eight patients with lymphoma and FS were identified. In six patients, the lymphoma was of the acute T cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL) type, related to human T cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV1) infection. In all patients, FS was severe requiring supplementation. A kidney biopsy performed in a patient with post-transplantation primary renal lymphoma disclosed intense proximal tubule infiltration by lymphomatous cells. In one patient with ATLL, FS features regressed following the successful treatment of lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Patients with lymphoma require careful monitoring for features of FS; lymphoma should also be added to the spectrum of disorders associated to FS. Prospective studies are needed to ascertain the implication of HTLV1 in the genesis of FS.","['Nephrology Department, Universite Paris Descartes, AP-HP, Hopital Necker, Paris, France.']",20100214,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, CCL3 (MIP-1alpha), a high-affinity CCR1 ligand, was identified as part of a model that independently predicts survival in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, the role of chemokine signaling in the pathogenesis of human lymphomas is unclear. In normal human hematopoietic tissues, we found CCR1 expression in intraepithelial B cells of human tonsil and granulocytic/monocytic cells in the bone marrow. Immunohistochemical analysis of 944 cases of hematolymphoid neoplasia identified CCR1 expression in a subset of B- and T-cell lymphomas, plasma cell myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. CCR1 expression correlated with the non-germinal center subtype of DLBCL but did not predict overall survival in follicular lymphoma. These data suggest that CCR1 may be useful for lymphoma classification and support a role for chemokine signaling in the pathogenesis of hematolymphoid neoplasia.","['Dept. of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, 300 Pasteur Drive, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",,,,,"['P01 CA034233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA124435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS637012'],,,,,,,,,,,,

DS children have greatly increased rates of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL); DS newborns present with transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD), a preleukemic form of AMKL. TMD and DS-AMKL almost always carry an acquired mutation in GATA1 resulting in exclusive synthesis of a truncated protein (GATA1s), suggesting that both trisomy 21 and GATA1 mutations are required for leukemogenesis. To gain further understanding of how Hsa21 contributes to hematopoietic abnormalities, we examined the Tc1 mouse model of DS, which carries an almost complete freely segregating copy of Hsa21, and is the most complete model of DS available. We show that although Tc1 mice do not develop leukemia, they have macrocytic anemia and increased extramedullary hematopoiesis. Introduction of GATA1s into Tc1 mice resulted in a synergistic increase in megakaryopoiesis, but did not result in leukemia or a TMD-like phenotype, demonstrating that GATA1s and trisomy of approximately 80% of Hsa21 perturb megakaryopoiesis but are insufficient to induce leukemia.","['Division of Immune Cell Biology, Medical Research Council National Institute for Medical Research, London, UK.']",20100212,,,,"['G0601056/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U117527252/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'R01 HL032259/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U117527252/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation (p) of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 occurs in several solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. In CLL, however, STAT3 is constitutively phosphorylated on serine 727, not tyrosine 705, residues. Because the biologic significance of serine pSTAT3 in CLL is not known, we studied peripheral blood cells of 106 patients with CLL and found that, although tyrosine pSTAT3 was inducible, serine pSTAT3 was constitutive in all patients studied, regardless of blood count, disease stage, or treatment status. In addition, we demonstrated that constitutive serine pSTAT3 translocates to the nucleus by the karyopherin-beta nucleocytoplasmic system and binds DNA. Dephosphorylation of inducible tyrosine pSTAT3 did not affect STAT3-DNA binding, suggesting that constitutive serine pSTAT3 binds DNA. Furthermore, infection of CLL cells with lentiviral STAT3-small hairpin RNA reduced the expression of several STAT3-regulated survival and proliferation genes and induced apoptosis, suggesting that constitutive serine pSTAT3 initiates transcription in CLL cells. Taken together, our data suggest that constitutive phosphorylation of STAT3 on serine 727 residues is a hallmark of CLL and that STAT3 be considered a therapeutic target in this disease.","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

Moreover, C. pneumoniae infection led to IRF3 and IRF7 nuclear translocation in HUVECs and RNA interference experiments showed that IRF3 and IRF7 as well as the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) were essential for IFN-beta induction. Finally, C. pneumoniae replication was enhanced in endothelial cells in which IRF3, IRF7, or MAVS expression was inhibited by small interfering RNA and attenuated by IFN-beta treatment. In conclusion, C. pneumoniae infection of endothelial cells activates an MAVS-, IRF3-, and IRF7-dependent signaling, which controls bacterial growth and might modulate development of vascular lesions.","['Division of Infectious Diseases and Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']",20100212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, because 20-30% of patients affected by CML display either primary or secondary resistance to imatinib, intentional activation of Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells by phosphoantigens or by agents that cause their accumulation within cells, such as zoledronate, may represent a promising strategy for the design of a novel and highly innovative immunotherapy capable to overcome imatinib resistance. In this study, we show that Vgamma9Vdelta2 T lymphocytes recognize, trogocytose, and efficiently kill imatinib-sensitive and -resistant CML cell lines pretreated with zoledronate. Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell cytotoxicity was largely dependent on the granule exocytosis- and partly on TRAIL-mediated pathways, was TCR-mediated, and required isoprenoid biosynthesis by zoledronate-treated CML cells. Importantly, Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells from patients with CML can be induced by zoledronate to develop antitumor activity against autologous and allogeneic zoledronate-treated leukemia cells, both in vitro and when transferred into immunodeficient mice in vivo. We conclude that intentional activation of Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells by zoledronate may substantially increase their antileukemia activities and represent a novel strategy for CML immunotherapy.","['Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Metodologie Biomediche, Universita di Palermo, Palermo, Italy.']",20100212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The stem cell component, termed spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), is capable of self-renewal and differentiation. These unique attributes have made them a target for novel technologies to enhance reproductive function in males. With bulls, culture and transplantation of SSCs have the potential to enhance efficiency of cattle production and provide a novel avenue to generate transgenic animals. Isolation of SSCs is an essential component for the development of these techniques. In rodents and non-human primates, undifferentiated spermatogonia and SSCs express the surface marker THY1. The hypothesis tested in this study was that THY1 is a conserved marker of the undifferentiated spermatogonial population in bulls. Flow cytometric analyses showed that the THY1+ cell fraction comprises a rare sub-population in testes of pre-pubertal bulls. Immunocytochemical analyses of the isolated THY1+ fraction for expression of VASA showed that this cell population is comprised mostly of germ cells. Additionally, expression of the undifferentiated spermatogonial specific transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF, ZBTB16) protein was found to be enriched in the isolated THY1+ testis cell fraction. Lastly, xenogeneic transplantation of bull testis cells into seminiferous tubules of immunodeficient mice resulted in greater than sixfold more colonies from isolated THY1+ cells compared to the unselected total testis cell population indicating SSC enrichment. Collectively, these results demonstrate that THY1 is a marker of undifferentiated spermatogonia in testes of pre-pubertal bulls, and isolation of THY1+ cells results in their enrichment from the total testis cell population.","['Department of Dairy and Animal Science, Center for Reproductive Biology and Health, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA.']",20100212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its temporal influence during early development and, of particular interest, its regulation of binary fate decision at different stages during neurogenesis are among the least explored. Here, using an embryonic stem cell (ESC) model, we have deciphered Notch ligand preference during ESC commitment to different germ layers and determined the stage-specific temporal effect of Notch during neural differentiation. ESCs during maintenance remain impervious to Notch inhibition. However, Notch activation promotes differentiation even in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), displaying ligand preference-associated lineage discrimination, where Jagged-1 favors neural commitment and Delta-like-4 favors the mesoderm. This differential ligand action involves a combination of Notch receptors influencing specific downstream target gene expression. Though Notch activation during early neural differentiation specifically promotes neural stem cells or early neural progenitors and delays their maturation, its inhibition promotes late neural progenitors and expedites neurogenesis, with a preference for neurons over glia. However, gliogenesis is promoted upon Notch activation only when executed in combination with ciliary neurotrophic factor. Thus, our investigation underscores a multifaceted role of Notch, demonstrating the interdependency of ligand usage and lineage specification and Notch acting as a master switch, displaying stage-specific influence on neurogenesis.","['National Centre for Cell Science, Ganeshkhind, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India.']",20100212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As indicated by assays that measure plasma membrane integrity, phosphatidylserine exposure, mitochondrial activity, and activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3, celastrol potentiated the TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human breast cancer cells, and converted TRAIL-resistant cells to TRAIL-sensitive cells. When examined for its mechanism, we found that the triterpene down-regulated the expression of cell survival proteins including cFLIP, IAP-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, survivin, and XIAP and up-regulated Bax expression. In addition, we found that celastrol induced the cell surface expression of both the TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5. This increase in receptors was noted in a wide variety of cancer cells including breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, esophageal, and pancreatic cancer cells, and myeloid and leukemia cells. Gene silencing of the death receptor abolished the effect of celastrol on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Induction of the death receptor by the triterpenoid was found to be p53-independent but required the induction of CAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), inasmuch as gene silencing of CHOP abolished the induction of DR5 expression by celastrol and associated enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We found that celastrol also induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and ROS sequestration inhibited celastrol-induced expression of CHOP and DR5, and consequent sensitization to TRAIL. Overall, our results demonstrate that celastrol can potentiate the apoptotic effects of TRAIL through down-regulation of cell survival proteins and up-regulation of death receptors via the ROS-mediated up-regulation of CHOP pathway.","['Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.

This differential diagnosis often requires a combined assessment of clonality and tumour burden. In this study we assessed the utility of flow cytometric (FC) analysis of T cell receptor beta chain variable region (TCR-Vbeta) expression by using 24 antibodies reactive to 70% of the TCR-Vbeta repertoire. METHODS: Analyses were performed on peripheral blood samples obtained from 20 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of T-LGL leukaemia and 18 patients without known T cell lymphoproliferative diseases. RESULTS: The results were compared with TCR gene rearrangement status assessed by PCR. By FC analysis, 19/20 T-LGL leukaemia cases were CD3+CD8+ and one case was CD3+CD4+. All the cases demonstrated at least one immunophenotypic aberration, with altered CD5 expression being most frequent. Abnormal Vbeta expression was detected by FC in 19 of 20 (95%) T-LGL leukaemia cases, but in none of the controls; this showed 100% concordance with TCR gene rearrangement studies. In addition to establishing clonality, FC Vbeta analysis enables calculation of absolute numbers of clonal T cells; this is important in monitoring tumour burden after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that FC Vbeta analysis is a fast, reliable and quantitative method that can simultaneously assess T-LGL leukaemia clonality and tumour burden.","['Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The erythrocytes of sheep, cow and carp were resistant to such hemolytic action of the lectin (1 mg/mL). The lectin-mediated hemolysis was blocked by the polyethylene glycol with molecular mass over 1350. A. virosa lectin, unlike Amanita phalloides lectin, did not interact with tested monosaccharides. However, the 4-nitrophenyl derivates of the monosaccharides inhibited the action of A. virosa lectin which did not prefer targeting O-type glycoproteins over the N-type glycoproteins. Murine leukemia cells of L1210 line and human leukemia T-cells of CEM T4 and Jurkat lines were shown to be sensitive to toxic effect of the lectin and another protein toxovirin isolated from A. virosa fruit bodies It was found that toxovirin possessed an enzymatic activity of L-amino acid oxidase.

However, their role in hematologic neoplasms is largely unknown. Possible effects of Spreds on other signal pathways closely related to Ras-ERK have been poorly investigated. In this study, we investigated the in vitro effects of Spred2 on chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. In addition to inhibiting the well-established Ras-ERK cascade, adenovirus-mediated Spred2 over-expression inhibits constitutive and stem cell factor (SCF)-stimulated sphingosine kinase-1 (SPHK1) and Mcl-1 expression, as well as inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis in CML cells. In K562 cells and primary CML cells, imatinib induces endogenous Spred2 expression. Spred2 silencing by stable RNA interference partly protects K562 cells against imatinib-induced apoptosis. Together, these data implicate Spred2 in imatinib-induced cytotoxicity in CML cells, possibly by inhibiting the Ras-ERK cascade and the pro-survival signaling molecules SPHK1 and Mcl-1. These findings reveal potential targets for selective therapy of CML.","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 100850, PR China.']",20100212,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Pisiferdiol having a unique seven-membered ring showed more specific PP2C activation activity (1.3-fold at 100 microM) than pisiferic acid having a normal six-membered ring and oleic acid, which is known to activate PP2C. Pisiferdiol and pisiferic acid showed mixed-type activation with respect to alpha-casein, and this differed from the non-competitive activation of oleic acid in vitro. In vivo, the cytotoxicity of pisiferdiol toward human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 with an IC(50) value of 18.3 microM was 2-fold and 7-fold stronger than those of pisiferic acid and oleic acid, and pisiferdiol induced apoptosis through a caspase 3/7-dependent mechanism involving the dephosphorylation of Bad(1), which is a PP2C substrate. We thus conclude that pisiferdiol and pisiferic acid are novel PP2C activators, and the more specific activator, pisiferdiol, may be a useful chemical probe to study PP2C-mediated signaling pathways, and a lead compound for pharmaceutical agents.","['Laboratory of Chemical Biology, The United Graduate School of Agricultural Sciences, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate 020-8550, Japan.']",20100212,,,,,,,,['2010 Elsevier GmbH.

To determine if JAK2 V617F mutation is implicated in the abnormal thrombopoiesis of the 3q21q26 syndrome, we analyzed bone marrow samples of 12 patients, including 10 patients with acute myeloid leukemia and 2 patients with a myelodysplastic syndrome, associated with either inv(3)(q21;q26) or t(3;3)(q21;q26). The platelet count ranged from 142 to 597 x 10(3)/microL. Using polymerase chain reaction and pyrosequencing assays, no evidence of JAK2 V617F was identified in 11 of 12 cases. A JAK2 V617F mutation was identified in one patient who had acute myeloid leukemia with concurrent mast cell disease. Separate DNA analysis of myeloblasts and mast cells after laser capture microdissection confirmed that JAK2 V617F was present in both components. We conclude that JAK2 V617F mutation is uncommon in the 3q21q26 syndrome and that its presence may indicate an unusual coexistence of a myeloproliferative neoplasm.","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.

Recently, this protein has also been demonstrated to be capable of restricting the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells, a process that appears to be vital for the long-term competency of hematopoietic stem cells. These two seemingly opposite outcomes of regulation are likely to arise from its interactions with a variety of cellular partners. Such interactions can directly affect the genes that Gfi-1 recognizes through its DNA binding zinc-finger domain. In this work, we report the determination of the solution structure of Gfi-1 zinc fingers 3-5 in complex with a 16-mer consensus DNA using multidimensional NMR method. Unlike a proposed minor-groove binding model based on methylation interference experiments, our structure clearly shows that Gfi-1 zinc fingers 3-5 bind into the major groove of the target DNA reminiscent of canonical C(2)H(2) zinc-finger domains. The fourth and fifth zinc fingers recognize the AATC core sequence by forming base-specific hydrogen bonds between the side chains of Asn382, Gln379, and Asp354 and the bases of the invariant adenines and cytosine. Overall, the current work provides valuable insight into the structural determinants for DNA binding specificity, in particular for the TCA triplet that has not been observed in any other structures of zinc finger-DNA complexes, as well as molecular rationales for a naturally occurring mutation that causes acute myeloid leukemia.","['Biochemistry Department, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",20100211,,,,,,,,['(c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

It contrasts with mechanism of action, which generally involves a detailed understanding of the molecular basis for an effect. A framework to consider the weight of evidence for hypothesized modes of action in animals and their relevance to humans, has been widely adopted and used by government agencies and international organizations. The framework, developed and refined through its application in case studies for principally non-DNA-reactive carcinogens, has more recently been extended to DNA-reactive carcinogens, non-cancer endpoints and different life stages. In addition to increasing transparency, use of the framework promotes consistency in decision-making concerning adequacy of weight of evidence, facilitates peer input and review and identifies critical research needs. The framework provides an effective tool to facilitate discussion between the research and risk assessment communities on critical data gaps, which if filled, would permit more refined estimates of risk. As a basis for additionally coordinating and focusing research on critical data gaps in a risk assessment context, five key events in the mode of action for benzene-induced leukemia are proposed: (1) benzene metabolism via Cytochrome P450, (2) the interaction of benzene metabolites with target cells in the bone marrow, (3) formation of initiated, mutated target cells, (4) selective proliferation of the mutated cells and (5) production of leukemia. These key events are considered in a framework analysis of human relevance as a basis to consider appropriate next steps in developing research strategies.","['McLaughlin Centre for Population Health Risk Assessment, University of Ottawa, One Stewart Street, Suite 309, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. bmeek@uottawa.ca']",20100211,,,,,,,,['Crown Copyright (c) 2010.

Furthermore, MLL-AF6, an MLL fusion with a cytoplasmic protein, does not form such hybrid complexes, but nevertheless constitutively recruits AEP to target chromatin via unknown alternative mechanisms.

Similar results were obtained in cells transfected with a construct expressing a Z mutant in zinc-binding site 2 of the RING domain, confirming that this Z-PML interaction requires the integrity of only one zinc-binding site.

In addition, many malignant cells also show aberrant gene activation due to constitutively active signalling. The next frontier in cancer research will be to examine how, at the molecular level, small mutations that alter the regulatory phenotype of a cell give rise after a number of cell divisions to the vast deregulation phenomena seen in malignant cells. This review outlines recent insights into how normal cell differentiation in the haematopoietic system is subverted in leukaemia and it introduces the molecular players involved in this process.

Infection results in apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Sindbis vector uptake is mediated by the LAMR, which is upregulated on a number of different tumor types, thus conferring specificity of the vector to a wide range of cancers. In this study we elucidate the mechanism of apoptosis in two tumor cell lines, MOSEC, derived from the ovarian epithelium and Pan02, derived from a pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of apoptosis would facilitate the design of more effective vectors for cancer therapy. RESULTS: The initial phase of Sindbis vector induced apoptosis in MOSEC and Pan02 models reconfirms that viral infection is sensed by PKR due to double-stranded RNA intermediates associated with genomic replication. PKR activation results in translation inhibition through eIF2alpha phosphorylation and initiation of the stress response. Our studies indicate that the roles of two proteins, Mcl-1 and JNK, intimately link Sindbis induced translational arrest and cellular stress. Translational arrest inhibits the synthesis of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, Mcl-1. JNK activation triggers the release of Bad from 14-3-3, which ultimately results in apoptosis. These signals from translational arrest and cellular stress are propagated to the mitochondria where Bad and Bik bind to Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 respectively. Formation of these heterodimers displaces Bak, which results in caspase 9 cleavage and signaling through the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. CONCLUSION: The host cell response to Sindbis is triggered through PKR activation. Our studies demonstrate that PKR activation and subsequent translational arrest is linked to both cellular stress and apoptosis. We have also found the linkage point between translational arrest and apoptosis to be Mcl-1, a protein whose constant translation is required for inhibition of apoptosis. With this information vectors can be designed, which express or repress proteins implicated in this study, to enhance their therapeutic potential.","['NYU Cancer Institute and the NYU Gene Therapy Center, NYU School of Medicine, 550 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016, USA. lisa.venticinque@gmail.com']",20100212,,,,['CA100687/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike the west where multiple sclerosis (MS) is the commonest white matter disease encountered, in the tropics, there are myriad causes for the same. Infectious and post infectious disorders probably account for the vast majority of these diseases. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection tops the list of infective conditions. Central nervous system (CNS) tuberculosis occasionally presents with patchy parenchymal lesions unaccompanied by meningeal involvement. Human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) infection and cystic inflammatory lesions such as neurocysticercosis are important causes to be considered in the differential diagnosis. Diagnosing post infectious demyelinating disorders is equally challenging since more than a third of cases seen in the tropics do not present with history of past infection or vaccinations. Metabolic and deficiency disorders such as Wernicke's encephalopathy, osmotic demyelinating syndrome associated with extra pontine lesions and Vitamin B12 deficiency states can occassionaly cause confusion in diagnosis.

One of the functions of this progesterone-induced blocking factor (PIBF) is to suppress natural killer cell activity. Mifepristone has not only been shown to down-regulate PIBF expression by human leukemic cell lines but has also been shown to prolong and improve the length of life of mice with spontaneous leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mifepristone at 0.3 mg was gavaged three times weekly from 8 weeks vs. olive oil in the controls. RESULTS: The survival at one year for mice treated with mifepristone was 57.6% vs. 26.6% for controls (p=0.056). There were 66.7% of mice treated with mifepristone with no sick days whereas there was not one control mouse that did not become sick within the first year.

METHODS: The biodistribution of the (111)In-labeled anti-CD66 antibody of 8 patients with acute leukemia was measured. The data were fitted to 2 PBPK models. Model A incorporated effective values for antibody binding, and model B explicitly described mono- and bivalent binding. The best model was selected using the corrected Akaike information criterion. The predictive power of the model was validated comparing simulations and (90)Y-anti-CD66 serum measurements. The amount of antibody (range, 0.1-4 mg) leading to the most favorable therapeutic distribution was determined using simulations. RESULTS: Model B was better supported by the data. The fits of the selected model were good (adjusted R(2) > 0.91), and the estimated parameters were in a physiologically reasonable range. The median deviation of the predicted and measured (90)Y-anti-CD66 serum concentration values and the residence times were 24% (range, 17%-31%) and 9% (range, 1%-64%), respectively. The validated model predicted considerably different biodistributions for dosimetry and therapeutic settings. The smallest (0.1 mg) simulated amount of antibody resulted in the most favorable therapeutic biodistribution. CONCLUSION: The developed model is capable of adequately describing the anti-CD66 antibody biodistribution and accurately predicting the time-activity serum curve of (90)Y-anti-CD66 antibody and the therapeutic serum residence time. Simulations indicate that an improvement of radioimmunotherapy with anti-CD66 antibody is achievable by reducing the amount of administered antibody; for example, the residence time of the red marrow could be increased by a factor of 1.9 +/- 0.3 using 0.27 mg of anti-CD66 antibody.","['Klinik fur Nuklearmedizin, Universitat Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",20100211,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design, setting, and participants Nationwide, population based retrospective cohort study of 8173 Australian kidney transplant recipients registered on the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry who first received a transplant during 1982-2003. Incident cancers were ascertained using linkage with national cancer registry records. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cancer-specific standardised incidence ratios for periods of transplant function and for dialysis after transplant failure. Incidence was compared between periods using multivariate incidence rate ratios adjusted for current age, sex, and duration of transplantation. RESULTS: All cases of Kaposi's sarcoma occurred during transplant function. Standardised incidence ratios were significantly elevated during transplant function, but not during dialysis after transplant failure, for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, lip cancer, and melanoma. For each of these cancers, incidence was significantly lower during dialysis after transplant failure in multivariate analysis (incidence rate ratios 0.20 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.65) for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 0.04 (0.01 to 0.31) for lip cancer, and 0.16 (0.04 to 0.64) for melanoma). In contrast, standardised incidence ratios during dialysis after transplant failure remained significantly elevated for leukaemia and lung cancer, and cancers related to end stage kidney disease (kidney, urinary tract, and thyroid cancers), with thyroid cancer incidence significantly higher during dialysis after transplant failure (incidence rate ratio 6.77 (2.64 to 17.39)). There was no significant difference in incidence by transplant function for other cancers. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of immunosuppression on cancer risk is rapidly reversible for some, but not all, cancer types. Risk reversal was mainly observed for cancers with a confirmed infectious cause. Risk of other cancers, especially those related to end stage kidney disease, remained significantly increased after reduction of immunosuppression.","['National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research, University of New South Wales, 376 Victoria St, Sydney, NSW, 2010, Australia.']",20100211,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complex 2a was particularly efficacious against multi-drug resistant EGFR(+) MCF-7/Topo breast carcinoma cells and also against mTOR-dependent EGFR(-) HL-60 leukemia cells. Complex 3a showed enhanced activity only against 518A2 melanoma cells and HL-60 cells, which are both known to express the mTOR protein.

In the light of rampant human immunodeficiency syndrome, largely centred in sub-Sahara, this experience is updated in a further 512 consecutive individuals treated over an 8-year period in a privately based academic centre. Median age was 55.2 years 61% were males, 10% had Hodgkin lymphoma and, overall, constitutional symptoms were present in 20%. Prior to referral 19% had received chemotherapy and a further 20% some form of irradiation. Median survival in hairy cell leukaemia (n=14), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia-small lymphocytic lymphoma (n=103), Hodgkin (n=41) and follicular lymphoma (n=59) was not reached at the time of analysis and exceeded 36 months. This was followed by 32 months for those with mantle cell (n=7), splenic (n=2) and extranodal marginal cell (n=11), 24 months for T-cell lymphomas (n=24), 20 months for diffuse large B-cell variants (n=88) but only 12 months for the aggressive tumours exemplified by Burkitt (n=7) and lymphoblastic subtypes (n=6). The remaining 36 patients had to be excluded because numbers were too small for statistical analysis or unreliable staging. Adverse factors were constitutional symptoms, prior treatment with chemotherapy, intermediate or high-risk scores as defined by the international prognostic index, histologic grading and certain anatomical sites of primary tumour. In contrast gender, staging by Rye or Rai classification, retroviral infection and prior treatment with radiotherapy were without effect. Overall survival at 3 years in each category was compared to the curve for the entire cohort and was 100% in hairy cell leukaemia receiving two chlorodeoxyadenosine and greater than 88% in Hodgkin lymphoma treated according to the German study group protocols (p=0.0004). Corresponding figures for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia-small lymphocytic lymphoma were 82% (p=0.0006), follicular lymphoma 71% (p=0.060), peripheral T-cell lymphoma 43% (p=0.0156), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 39% (p<0.0001), aggressive tumours 25% (p=0.0002) and for the indolent categories including mantle cell, splenic and extra nodal marginal cell lymphomas 22% (p=0.2023). Outcome argues in favour of patient management by a multidisciplinary team implicit in which are standardised protocols for diagnosis, staging and treatment. Under these circumstances the well recognized centre effect applies when results approximate those from first world reference centres. Conversely any deviation from such a disciplined approach is unlikely to achieve comparable benefit and therefore to be strongly discouraged.","['Division of Clinical Haematology - Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University, South Africa.']",20100210,,,,,,,,['(c) 2010.

METHOD: A qualitative design using a grounded theory approach was used. Data were collected by participant observation and by conducting 16 semi-structured interviews with patients who had undergone SCT and six interviews with nurses. RESULTS: Research findings provide an explanation for the process of keeping courage during SCT. In this publication we focus on the core category in that process: the writing of a positive story. To endure and give meaning to the suffering of the therapy, patients do their best to believe in a happy ending. Patients exert every effort to keep faith: they count their blessings, they protect their positive story from the assaults of negative information and threatening signals through rationalization and they do everything in their power to increase their chances of a happy ending. The positive story is most vulnerable during aplasia, when patients seem to lose both physical and mental strength. Patients feel nurses and doctors help them to muster up courage. Nurses carry patients through the hardest and most despondent moments. CONCLUSIONS: During stem cell transplantation, patients make many efforts in order to write a positive story and to keep courage. These efforts involve much more active strategies than the rather passive concept of hope suggests.","['University Hospitals Leuven, Department of oncology/Hematology, Leuven, Belgium. annemarie.coolbrandt@uz.kuleuven.ac.be <annemarie.coolbrandt@uz.kuleuven.ac.be>']",20100210,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, resistance to imatinib due to point mutations in Bcr-Abl kinase domain is an emerging problem. We recently reported that triptolide (compound 1) could effectively kill CML cells including those harboring T315I mutant Bcr-Abl. In the present study, we designed a series of C-14 triptolide derivatives with C-14-hydroxyl substituted by different amine esters (3-18): 3-6 and 13 (by aliphatic chain amine esters); 7-9, 11, 12 and 15-18 (by alicyclic amine esters with different size), and 10 and 14 (by aralkylamine esters).The compounds were examined for their antineoplastic activity against CML cells (including KBM5-T315I cells) in terms of proliferation inhibition, apoptosis and signal transduction. Nude mouse xenograft model was also used to evaluate the in vivo activity. Compounds 2-9, 11-14, 17 and 18 exhibited a potent inhibitory activity against KBM5 and KBM5-T315I cells. This series of derivatives down-regulated Bcr-Abl mRNA. Compounds 4, 5, 8 and 9 were further examined for their impact on signaling and apoptosis with immunoblotting. Compound 5 was chosen for evaluation in a nude mouse xenograft model. The stereo-hindrance of C-14 group appeared to be responsible for the antitumor effect. The computational small molecule-protein docking analysis illustrated the possible interaction between compound 9 and RNA polymerase II. Our results suggest that this series of derivatives may be promising agents to overcome imatinib-resistance caused by the Bcr-Abl-T315I mutation.","[""School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, 135 Xingangxi Road, Guangzhou 510275, People's Republic of China.""]",20100125,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

JAK3 has also been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of tumorigenesis. Recent studies identified activating JAK3 mutations in patients with various hematopoietic malignancies, including acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Importantly, functional analyses of some of those JAK3 mutations have been shown to cause lethal hematopoietic malignancies in animal models. These observations make JAK3 an ideal therapeutic target for the treatment of various human diseases. To identify novel small molecule inhibitors of JAK3, we performed structure-based virtual screen using the 3D structure of JAK3 kinase domain and the NCI diversity set of compounds. RESULTS: We identified NSC114792 as a lead compound. This compound directly blocked the catalytic activity of JAK3 but not that of other JAK family members in vitro. In addition, treatment of 32D/IL-2Rbeta cells with the compound led to a block in IL-2-dependent activation of JAK3/STAT5 but not IL-3-dependent activation of JAK2/STAT5. Consistent with the specificity of NSC114792 for JAK3, it selectively inhibited persistently-activated JAK3, but failed to affect the activity of other JAK family members and other oncogenic kinases in various cancer cell lines. Finally, we showed that NSC114792 decreases cell viability by inducing apoptosis through down-regulating anti-apoptotic gene expression only in cancer cells harboring persistently-active JAK3. CONCLUSIONS: NSC114792 is a lead compound that selectively inhibits JAK3 activity. Therefore, our study suggests that this small molecule inhibitor of JAK3 can be used as a starting point to develop a new class of drugs targeting JAK3 activity, and may have therapeutic potential in various diseases that are caused by aberrant JAK3 activity.","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York 10595, USA.']",20100211,,,,['R01 GM085075/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This was a prospective non-comparative unblinded study in the Hematology/Oncology Unit over a two-year period, administering linezolid as monotherapy in children with cancer. RESULTS: Seventeen children received linezolid (30 mg/kgr: 3 i.v. per day). Mean duration of linezolid administration was 12.2 days (range, 6-38 days), while the median age of the evaluable patients was 2.2 years (range, 6 months-11.2 years). Primary diagnosis was acute lymphoblastic leukemia (nine patients), brain tumor (three patients), multi-organ Langerhans cell histiocytosis (two patients), rhabdomyosarcoma, Burkitt's lymphoma and ovarian tumor (one patient each). All patients were in the midst of chemotherapy cycles. Ten out of 17 children had positive blood cultures (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, four patients; vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, three patients; penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, three patients), while seven of the 17 had fever and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus in stool cultures. All patients were considered clinically cured after the end of the linezolid regimen (100% efficacy). The main adverse events were thrombocytopenia grade 1-3 and anemia grade 2-3 (four and two patients, respectively). Chemotherapy-induced myelotoxicity (six patients) was not worsened during linezolid therapy. No bleeding episodes were presented. Self-limited diarrhea grade 1-2 was presented in four patients (mean duration 2 days). The total adverse event rate was 23.5%; however, there was no premature cessation of linezolid in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid may be another effective and safe therapy to treat infections from resistant Gram-positive bacteria in immunocompromised children, even in young ages.","[""First Department of Paediatrics, Athens University Medical School, Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital, Athens, Greece.""]",,,,,,,,,['(c) 2010 The Authors.

It has been previously described in patients suffering from other kinds of immunodeficiency (e.g. primary immunodeficiency diseases in children or hairy cell leukaemia). We report two cases of disseminated MAC disease in young women with extended granulomatosis that revealed a new form of severe immunodeficiency syndrome. Both clinical observations initially appeared to be very similar to WHIM syndrome (Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infection, Myelokathexis), a rare immunodeficiency disease correlated with CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) mutation leading to an impaired internalization of the receptor upon its ligand CXCL12. We investigated the CXCR4 status of the lymphocytes in both patients and found a severe defect in CXCL12-promoted internalization but no mutation of its gene. Moreover, myelokathexis was not noted in bone marrow biopsies and therefore a diagnosis of WHIM syndrome could not be assessed. This immunodeficiency syndrome associated with CXCR4 dysfunction was responsible for severe MAC infection in our patients, with a fatal outcome in one case. It may be possible that these patients would have benefited from early antimycobacterial infection or azythromycin prophylaxis.","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes, Rennes, France.""]",,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2010 The Authors.

Drug resistance and toxicity are major concerns with the treatment. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNA molecules that might modulate cellular sensitivity to anticancer drugs. miRNA-21 (miR-21) is one of the most prominent miRNAs involved in various aspects of human cancers. However, miR-21 has been rarely characterized in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Here, we used a specific anti-miR-21 oligonucleotide (AMO-miR-21) to sensitize K562 cells to ATO by degradation of miR-21. The results showed that both AMO-miR-21 and ATO caused growth inhibition, apoptosis, and G1-phase arrest in K562 cells. Meanwhile, AMO-miR-21 significantly promoted ATO-mediated growth inhibition and apotosis without affecting the G1 phase. Apoptotic cells were confirmed morphologically with Giemsa's staining. Furthermore, dual-luciferase reporter vector, containing two tandem miR-21 binding sites from PDCD4 3'UTR, validated that PDCD4 was directly regulated by miR-21. Therefore, AMO-miR-21 sensitized leukemic K562 cells to ATO by inducing apoptosis partially due to its up-regulation of PDCD4 protein level.

Here, we review the role of constitutive NF-kappaB activation in CLL pathogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target for CLL treatment. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: This review highlights the different strategies reported to inhibit NF-kappaB signaling in CLL cells. They include both IkappaB kinase inhibitors and several natural compounds that act at different steps of the pathway. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Targeting NF-kappaB leads to apoptosis of CLL cells, corroborating the role of NF-kappaB in the survival and clonal expansion of these tumoral cells. Moreover, several studies confirmed a synergistic effect between NF-kappaB inhibitors and other antitumoral agents and that inhibition of NF-kappaB could overcome the microenvironmental protection of CLL cells. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: NF-kappaB is a relevant target in CLL and inhibitors of this prosurvival pathway, alone or in combination, represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of CLL patients.","[""Hematopathology Unit, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Villarroel 170, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.""]",,,,98,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the underlying mechanisms of MDR is the increased efflux of anticancer drugs by overexpressed P-glycoprotein (P-gp) of multidrug resistant cells. In this work, the antibody of P-gp (anti-P-gp) functionalized water-soluble single-walled carbon nanotubes (Ap-SWNTs) loaded with doxorubicin (Dox), Dox/Ap-SWNTs, were synthesized for challenging the MDR of K562 human leukemia cells. The resulting Ap-SWNTs could not only specifically recognize the multidrug resistant human leukemia cells (K562R), but also demonstrate the effective loading and controllable release performance for Dox toward the target K562R cells by exposing to near-infrared radiation (NIR). The recognition capability of Ap-SWNTs toward the K562R cells was confirmed by flow cytometry (FCM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The binding affinity of Ap-SWNTs toward drug-resistant K562R cells was ca. 23-fold higher than that toward drug-sensitive K562S cells. Additionally, CLSM indicated that Ap-SWNTs could specifically localize on the cell membrane of K562R cells and the fluorescence of Dox in K562R cells could be significantly enhanced after the employment of Ap-SWNTs as carrier. Moreover, the composite of Dox and Ap-SWNTs (Dox/Ap-SWNTs) expressed 2.4-fold higher cytotoxicity and showed the significant cell proliferation suppression toward K562R leukemia cells (p < 0.05) as compared with free Dox which is popularly employed in clinic trials. These results suggest that the Ap-SWNTs are the promising drug delivery vehicle for overcoming the MDR induced by the overexpression of P-gp on cell membrane. Ap-SWNTs loaded with drug molecules could be used to suppress the proliferation of multidrug resistant cells, destroy the tumor stem cells, and inhibit the metastasis of tumor.","['National Chromatographic R&A Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Separation Sciences for Analytical Chemistry,Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Dalian 116023, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allogeneic CST replaces recipient dysplastic hemopoiesis with healthy donor haemopoiesis and immune system with an attendant graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect. Its applicability, however, is limited by the age of MDS patients, high rates of transplant-related mortality (TRM) and availability of a suitable HLA-matched donor. Results from several large centres indicated 3-year overall survival (OS) rates of 20-45%, which are almost equal with the results obtained by intensive chemotherapy alone. Failure was due primarily to TRM in patients with low-risk MDS and to disease recurrence in patients with high-risk MDS. Allogeneic SCT from matched unrelated donors produce poorer results than matched related siblings' transplantations. In an attempt to reduce TRM and deliver allogeneic SCT in a greater subgroup of MDS patients, many researchers used reduced-intensity allografts (RIC or ""mini""-allograft) for MDS. Although differences in patient populations, preparative regimens, and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis, as well as donor source (related vs. unrelated) have to be considered, OS of up to 40% at 3 years and disease-free survival (DFS) rates of almost 35% at 3 years have been reported in selected centres. However, randomized prospective studies are needed to further address the optimal choice of transplant conditioning intensity in MDS. Autologous SCT has been extremely investigated in MDS. It is limited to patients who have achieved a complete remission (CR), can be harvested, and are candidates for the procedure. Autologous SCT after successful induction chemotherapy may increase the proportion of long-term survivors, thus improving CR duration in some patients with MDS, particularly in younger patients in remission. Results for older patients are unsatisfactory. The relapse rate is up to 75%, with a 2-year probability of DFS of only 25% for patients 40-60 years of age. Therefore, there is very limited enthusiasm for the future of autologous SCT in the management of MDS patients.","['First Department of Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, School of Medicine, Laikon General Hospital, Athens, Greece. imeletis@cc.uoa.gr']",,,,73,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We observed that molecular detection of the virus in stool specimens commonly precedes AdV viremia, suggesting that intestinal infections may represent a common source of virus dissemination. To address this notion, we have investigated 153 consecutive allogeneic transplantations in 138 pediatric patients by quantitative monitoring of AdV in stool specimens and peripheral blood by a pan-adenovirus real-time (RQ)-PCR approach. AdV was detectable in serial stool specimens in all cases of AdV viremia during the post-transplant course (P<0.0001). The incidence of AdV viremia in individuals with peak virus levels in stool specimens above 1 x 10E6 copies per gram (n=22) was 73% vs 0% in patients with AdV levels in stool specimens below this threshold (n=29; P<0.0001). Serial measurement of AdV levels in stool specimens by RQ-PCR permitted early diagnosis of impending invasive infection with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% (95% confidence interval (CI) 96-100%) and 83% (95% CI 67-92%), respectively. The median time span between detection of AdV loads in stool specimens above 1 x 10E6 copies per gram and first observation of viremia was 11 days (range 0-192).

As a result, SHIP-1 deficiency in mice results in myeloproliferation and B-cell lymphoma. On the other hand, SHIP-1-deficient mice have a reduced T-cell population, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In this work, we hypothesized that SHIP-1 plays anti-apoptotic functions in T cells upon stimulation of the death receptor CD95/APO-1/Fas. Using primary T cells from SHIP-1(-/-) mice and T leukemic cell lines, we report that SHIP-1 is a potent inhibitor of CD95-induced death. We observed that a small fraction of the SHIP-1 pool is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in which it promotes CD95 glycosylation. This post-translational modification requires an intact SH2 domain of SHIP-1, but is independent of its phosphatase activity. The glycosylated CD95 fails to oligomerize upon stimulation, resulting in impaired death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) formation and downstream apoptotic cascade. These results uncover an unanticipated inhibitory function for SHIP-1 and emphasize the role of glycosylation in the regulation of CD95 signaling in T cells. This work may also provide a new basis for therapeutic strategies using compounds inducing apoptosis through the CD95 pathway on SHIP-1-negative leukemic T cells.","['Grappe Interdisciplinaire de Genoproteomique Appliquee (GIGA)-Research, Signal Transduction Unit, Faculty of Sciences, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.']",20100211,,,,['BBF0083091/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over-expression of Aurora kinases, particularly Aurora A, has been demonstrated in a number of solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Not surprisingly, these serine/threonine kinases have become attractive small molecule targets for cancer therapeutics, with several inhibitors currently in early-phase clinical trials. A small number of compounds developed to date are highly selective for either Aurora A or Aurora B, while the majority inhibit both Aurora A and Aurora B; many of these compounds exhibit 'off-target' inhibition of kinases such as ABL, JAK2 and FLT3. It is currently unclear whether the therapeutic activity of these compounds in leukemia is primarily due to selective Aurora or multi-kinase inhibition. The most promising application for Aurora kinase inhibitors to date appears to be in FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia/Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia, particularly when caused by the T315I mutation.

Functional activity of OCT-1 (OCT-1 Activity) in mononuclear cells is an excellent predictor of molecular response over the first 24 months of imatinib therapy for chronic phase patients. CML progenitor cells are less sensitive to imatinib-induced apoptosis and are likely contributors to disease persistence. We investigated whether alterations in the expression and function of OCT-1 have a role in imatinib resistance in progenitors. We found the intracellular uptake and retention (IUR) of imatinib, OCT-1 Activity and OCT-1 mRNA expression are all significantly lower in CML CD34+ cells compared with mature CD34- cells (P<0.001). However, no differences in IUR or OCT-1 Activity were observed between these subsets in healthy donors. In contrast to OCT-1, ABCB1 and ABCG2 seemed to have no functional role in the transport of imatinib in CML CD34+ cells. Consistent with the observation that nilotinib uptake is not OCT-1 dependent, the IUR of nilotinib did not differ between CML CD34+ and CD34- cells. These results indicate that low imatinib accumulation in primitive CML cells, mediated through reduced OCT-1 Activity may be a critical determinant of long-term disease persistence.","['Department of Haematology, SA Pathology (RAH Campus), Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.']",20100211,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both samples were analyzed for salivary flow rate, calcium, urea, total proteins, and amylase. The SSFR was analyzed by gravimetric method and calcium, urea, total protein, and amylase concentrations were realized by chemistry tests. RESULTS: Mean values of SSFR for experimental and control groups were, respectively, 0.5 mL/min and 0.8 mL/min (P<0.05). Calcium concentration was 36% (P<0.05) and urea concentration was 21% (P<0.01) lower in the FA group saliva compared with saliva from the controls.

Intake routes included ingestion, inhalation, and injection. The lifetime effects are best described by three-dimensional average-dose-rate/time/response surfaces that compete with other causes of death during an individual's lifetime. Using maximum likelihood survival regression methods, the characteristic logarithmic slope for cancer induction was found to be about negative one-third for alpha-emitters or about negative two-thirds for beta-emitters. At the higher average dose-rates the principal deleterious effects were those associated with radiation-induced injury while at intermediate average dose-rates radiation-induced cancer predominates. The relative biological effectiveness for cancer induction of high linear energy transfer alpha radiation with respect to low linear energy transfer beta radiation is a strong function of dose-rate. As average dose-rate decreases, the effectiveness of the beta irradiation drops off more rapidly than that of the alpha irradiation. The cumulative dose yielding a specific level of induced cancer risk is less at lower dose-rates than at higher dose-rates showing an apparent inverse dose-rate effect (up to a factor of about 10 for high linear energy transfer alpha radiation and a factor of about 2 for low linear energy transfer beta radiation). The cumulative radiation dose is neither an accurate nor an appropriate measure of cancer risk associated with protracted ionizing radiation exposure. Cancer risk associated with protracted ionizing radiation exposure is a non-linear function of lifetime average dose-rate to the affected tissues. At low average dose-rates the long latency time required for radiation-induced cancer may exceed the natural lifespan. This long latency results in a lifespan virtual threshold (cancer risk p < 0.001) for each internally deposited radionuclide. For young adult beagles, bone sarcoma induction from alpha-emitting radionuclides was unlikely for cumulative doses below about 1 Gy (20 Sv) delivered specifically to the sensitive tissues at bone surfaces in a manner associated with radionuclide relative potency from highest for Th, Pu, and Pu to lowest for Ra. Bone sarcoma induction from ingested Sr was unlikely for cumulative beta radiation doses below about 20 Gy (20 Sv), but beta irradiation of tissues adjacent to bone also induced leukemia and soft tissue carcinomas above 10 Gy (10 Sv). Inhaled radionuclides tended to be most potent in producing lung carcinoma when the radiation dose was most uniformly distributed in the lung. In young adult beagles lung carcinoma from inhaled alpha-emitting Pu in the dispersible nitrate form was unlikely for cumulative doses below about 0.5 Gy (10 Sv) and below higher cumulative doses for other forms of Pu and Pu depending on relative potency. Lung carcinoma from inhaled beta-emitting Y in relatively insoluble fused aluminosilicate particles was unlikely for cumulative doses below about 5 Gy (5 Sv) and below higher doses for inhaled particles with Y, Ce, or Sr in order of decreasing potency.","['Center for Health and the Environment, University of California, Davis, 95616, USA. ograabe@ucdavis.edu']",,,,,['R01 CA46296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The normal functions of these, if any, are unknown, but some HERV proteins have been implicated in cancers, in particular germ-cell cancers. For instance, it has been documented that (i) patients with germ-cell tumours frequently produce antibodies against HERV proteins; (ii) transgenic mice expressing HERV-K (HML-2) rec are prone to testicular carcinoma in situ; and (iii) Rec can bind and suppress a guardian of germline stem-cell pluripotency, the promyelocytic leukaemia zinc-finger protein (PLZF). This study identified the PLZF-related testicular zinc-finger protein (TZFP) as a binding partner of HERV-K (HML-2) Rec. Interactions occurred via the N- and C-terminal domains of Rec and the C-terminal DNA-binding zinc-finger domain of TZFP (aa 375-450). Not much is known about the function of TZFP. The protein is expressed predominantly in the testis, where it functions as a transcriptional repressor that is active during specific stages of spermatogenesis. The most intensely studied function of TZFP is that of a co-repressor of the activated androgen receptor (AR). Here, it was shown that Rec can form a trimeric complex with TZFP and AR, and can relieve the TZFP-mediated repression of AR-induced transactivation. In addition, Rec was able to overcome the direct transcriptional repression by TZFP of the c-myc gene promoter in reporter assays. Thus, HERV-K (HML-2) Rec may function as an oncoprotein by de-repressing oncogenic transcription factors such as AR.","['Institute of Virology, Building 47, University of Saarland Medical School, 66421 Homburg/Saar, Germany.']",20100210,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transcription factor Sox10 is expressed throughout early neural crest. We exploited Sox10 reporter and selection markers created by homologous recombination to investigate the generation, maintenance and expansion of neural crest progenitors. Sox10-GFP-positive cells are produced transiently from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells by treatment with retinoic acid in combination with Fgf8b and the cytokine leukaemia inhibitory factor (Lif). We found that expression of Sox10 can be maintained using noggin, Wnt3a, Lif and endothelin (NWLE). ES cell-derived Sox10-GFP-positive cells cultured in NWLE exhibit molecular markers of neural crest progenitors. They differentiate into peripheral neurons in vitro and are able to colonise the enteric network in organotypic gut cultures. Neural crest cells purified from embryos using the Sox10 reporter also survive in NWLE, but progressively succumb to differentiation. We therefore applied selection to eliminate differentiating cells. Sox10-selected cells could be clonally expanded, cryopreserved, and multiplied for over 50 days in adherent culture. They remained neurogenic in vitro and in foetal gut grafts. Generation of neural crest from mouse ES cells opens a new route to the identification and validation of determination factors. Furthermore, the ability to propagate undifferentiated progenitors creates an opportunity for experimental dissection of the stimuli and molecular circu that govern neural crest lineage progression. Finally, the demonstration of robust enteric neurogenesis provides a system for investigating and modelling cell therapeutic approaches to neurocristopathies such as Hirschsprung's disease.","['Wellcome Trust Centre for Stem Cell Research, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, CB2 1QR Cambridge, UK.']",,,,,"['G1100526/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'G0800784/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G15381/2/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'G15381/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G9806702/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used a whole blood assay to investigate T cell proliferation and cytokine release during the period of pre-engraftment cytopenia. The study included 13 acute leukemia patients receiving myeloablative conditioning followed by transplantation of G-CSF-mobilised peripheral blood stem cells derived from HLA-matched family donors. Maximal proliferation and cytokine release could not be reached by anti-CD3 stimulation alone, but was dependent on the presence of additional costimulation with anti-CD28. Circulating T cells showed a broad cytokine release profile after activation, and the highest levels were detected for IFNgamma, GM-CSF and IL-6. Correlation analyses showed that TNFalpha/IL-4/IL-5/IL-13 in particular were released as a separate cluster, IFNgamma and GM-CSF correlated strongly, whereas IL-17 showed a weak correlation to IL-6 only. The capacity of circulating T cells derived during pre-engraftment cytopenia to release high levels of IFNgamma, IL-6 and IL-17 in response to in vitro activation with anti-CD3+anti-CD28 showed statistically significant correlations with later acute GVHD. We conclude that allotransplanted patients have a functional T cell system even during the pre-engraftment period of severe pancytopenia.","['The Blood Bank, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of 226 patients with WHO-confirmed diagnosis (median age 66), 91.3% survived at the median follow-up of 5.84 years and 77.5% are projected alive at 13 years. Eighteen percent had major thrombosis and 2.7% acute myeloid leukemia. Twenty-two percent of patients maintained an Hct <0.45: their overall and thrombosis-free survival are similar to those of patients with a 0.45-0.48 value. Conversely, an Hct >0.48 and a ""high thrombotic risk"" according to ECLAP criteria were both significantly associated to shorter survival and higher thrombosis risk. Chemotherapy reduced thrombotic events without affecting survival. Our study revealed suboptimal compliance to published guidelines. However, in our casistic characterized by wide use of anti-platelet- and avoidance of alkylating drugs, patients' survival, although analyzed retrospectively, seemed to have improved compared to old literature data. The optimal Hct target was not clearly defined, although a value <0.48 looks highly advisable.","[""Divisione di Ematologia dell' Universita di Torino, Azienda Ospedaliera S.

Although myeloid/NK cell precursor acute leukemia is characterized by CD7(+), CD56(+), CD3(-), CD34(+) and myeloid antigen(+) phenotype, the blast cells of our patients lacked CD34 and CD7 expression while expressing myeloid antigens. Furthermore, CD94 1A transcripts were predominantly expressed rather than CD94 1B, implying their origin in immature NK cells. After acute myeloid leukemia-oriented combination chemotherapy, his blasts acquired stable CD3 expression and TCRgammadelta rearrangement at recurrence.

These particles display potent biological activities that can impact on physiologic and pathologic processes. Previous studies with the Jurkat T leukemia cell line demonstrated that staurosporine (STS) induces the release of MPs as cells undergo apoptosis. To investigate further this process, we tested the effects of STS, its analogue, 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01), and other protein kinase C (PKC) and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. FACS analysis was used to assess MP release. Results of these studies indicate that STS and UCN-01 induce MP release by Jurkat cells; in contrast, other PKC and CDK inhibitors failed to induce comparable release, suggesting that release does not result from simple inhibition of either kinase alone. Time course experiments indicated that STS-induced particle release occurred as early as 2 h after treatment, with the early release MPs displaying low levels of binding of annexin V and propidium iodide (PI). Early-release MPs, however, matured in culture to an annexin V- and PI-positive phenotype. Together, these results indicate that STS and UCN-01 induce MPs that are phenotypically distinct and reflect specific patterns of kinase inhibition during apoptosis.","['Department of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA. anirudh.ullal@duke.edu']",,,,,"['R21 AI082402/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI082402-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI082402/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS194954'],,,,,,,,,,,,

PCI-24781 treatment also causes an increase in superoxide levels, which has been reported for other HDACi. However, an antioxidant does not reverse histone alterations caused by PCI-24781, indicating that ROS generation is likely downstream of the effects that PCI-24781 exerts on histone H3.

RS can involve extranodal sites including the gastrointestinal tract, lungs and skin. Cutaneous RS is rare, we describe 4 cases with clinical manifestations, histological and immunohistological patterns, and outcome. METHODS: Clinical data were analyzed and all patients' skin biopsy samples stained with HE for the CD20, CD5, CD3 and CD30 antigens. Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV)-encoded early RNA and clonal rearrangements were also analyzed. RESULTS: The patients' mean age at CLL diagnosis was 57 years (53-62 years), with a male/female sex ratio of 3:1. The transformation to cutaneous RS occurred between 8 and 75 months after initial diagnosis and progressed to a fatal systemic disease in 3 cases, between 24 and 129 months. Cutaneous CLL was associated with earlier transformation in our series and could not be distinguished from RS on clinical grounds alone. All patients had a large-cell infiltrate and clonal rearrangements. CONCLUSIONS: The precise mechanism of RS is unclear, but a role of EBV has been suggested in fludarabine-treated CLL. For all our patients, the diagnosis of transformation was made on the basis of cutaneous localizations and led to intensified CLL treatment.","['Department of Pathology, Hopital Necker-Enfants-Malades (AP-HP), Universite Paris-Descartes, Paris, France.']",20100210,,,29,,,,,"['2010 S.

The objective of this study was to explore the factors influencing the outcome of adult patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the characteristics, the outcome and the prognostic factors for survival after first relapse in a series of 263 adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (excluding those with mature B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia) prospectively enrolled in four consecutive risk-adapted PETHEMA trials. RESULTS: The median overall survival after relapse was 4.5 months (95% CI, 4-5 months) with a 5-year overall survival of 10% (95% CI, 8%-12%); 45% of patients receiving intensive second-line treatment achieved a second complete remission and 22% (95% CI, 14%-30%) of them remained disease free at 5 years. Factors predicting a good outcome after rescue therapy were age less than 30 years (2-year overall survival of 21% versus 10% for those over 30 years old; P<0.022) and a first remission lasting more than 2 years (2-year overall survival of 36% versus 17% among those with a shorter first remission; P<0.001). Patients under 30 years old whose first complete remission lasted longer than 2 years had a 5-year overall survival of 38% (95% CI, 23%-53%) and a 5-year disease-free survival of 53% (95% CI, 34%-72%). CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who relapse is poor. Those aged less than 30 years with a first complete remission lasting longer than 2 years have reasonable possibilities of becoming long-term survivors while patients over this age or those who relapse early cannot be successfully rescued using the therapies currently available.","[""Servei d'Hematologia Clinica, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, 08916 Badalona, Barcelona, Spain. aoriol@iconcologia.net""]",20100209,,,,,,,,,,['Programa Espanol de Tratamiento en Hematologia Group'],"['Ribera JM', 'Oriol A', 'Vives S', 'Feliu E', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'San Miguel JF', 'Tormo M', 'Terol MJ', 'Heras MI', 'Bernal T', 'Martinez-Revuelta E', 'Fuster J', 'Esteve J', 'Calvo C', 'Carbone A', 'Brunet S', 'Sierra J', 'Bergua JL', 'Marin J', 'Egurbide I', 'Sanchez J', 'Garcia-Boyero R', 'Perez de Oteyza J', 'Sarra J', 'Bueno J', 'Ortega JJ', 'Bastida MP', 'Olive T', 'Perez-Hurtado JM', 'Parody R', 'Gonzalez-Valentin ME', 'Rivas C', 'Fernandez-Abellan P', 'Sanz MA', 'Moscardo F', 'Montesinos P', 'del Potro E', 'Diaz-Mediavilla J', 'Guinea JM', 'Guardia R', 'Marti JM', 'Vall-llobera F', 'Poderos C', 'Queizan JA', 'Martinez J', 'Bethencourt C', 'Maldonado J', 'Martin-Reina V', 'Gil JL', 'Moreno MJ', 'Ortega-Rivas F', 'Rodriguez JA', 'Moro MJ', 'Molines A', 'Lodos V', 'Macia J', 'Novo A', 'Besalduch J', 'Pedro C', 'Abella E', 'Deben G', 'Casanova F', 'Gamez F', 'Alcala A', 'Arias J', 'Leon P', 'Ares A', 'Llorente A', 'Atutxa K', 'Hernandez-Nieto L', 'Diaz-Morfa G', 'Vivancos P', 'Rodriguez-Villa A', 'Bello JL', 'Carbonell F', 'Orts M', 'Fernandez-Calvo J', 'Borrego D', 'Grande C']","['Ribera, J M', 'Oriol, A', 'Vives, S', 'Feliu, E', 'Hernandez-Rivas, J M', 'San Miguel, J F', 'Tormo, M', 'Terol, M J', 'Heras, M I', 'Bernal, T', 'Martinez-Revuelta, E', 'Fuster, J', 'Esteve, J', 'Calvo, C', 'Carbone, A', 'Brunet, S', 'Sierra, J', 'Bergua, J L', 'Marin, J', 'Egurbide, I', 'Sanchez, J', 'Garcia-Boyero, R', 'Perez de Oteyza, J', 'Sarra, J', 'Bueno, J', 'Ortega, J J', 'Bastida, M P', 'Olive, T', 'Perez-Hurtado, J M', 'Parody, R', 'Gonzalez-Valentin, M E', 'Rivas, C', 'Fernandez-Abellan, P', 'Sanz, M A', 'Moscardo, F', 'Montesinos, P', 'del Potro, E', 'Diaz-Mediavilla, J', 'Guinea, J M', 'Guardia, R', 'Marti, J M', 'Vall-llobera, F', 'Poderos, C', 'Queizan, J A', 'Martinez, J', 'Bethencourt, C', 'Maldonado, J', 'Martin-Reina, V', 'Gil, J L', 'Moreno, M J', 'Ortega-Rivas, F', 'Rodriguez, J A', 'Moro, M J', 'Molines, A', 'Lodos, V', 'Macia, J', 'Novo, A', 'Besalduch, J', 'Pedro, C', 'Abella, E', 'Deben, G', 'Casanova, F', 'Gamez, F', 'Alcala, A', 'Arias, J', 'Leon, P', 'Ares, A', 'Llorente, A', 'Atutxa, K', 'Hernandez-Nieto, L', 'Diaz-Morfa, G', 'Vivancos, P', 'Rodriguez-Villa, A', 'Bello, J L', 'Carbonell, F', 'Orts, M', 'Fernandez-Calvo, J', 'Borrego, D', 'Grande, C']",,,,,

The European Group for the Immunological Classification of Leukemias (EGIL) scoring system unambiguously defines MPAL expressing aberrant lineage markers. Discussions surrounding it have focused on scoring details, and information is limited regarding its biological, clinical and prognostic significance. The recent World Health Organization classification is simpler and could replace the EGIL scoring system after transformation into unambiguous guidelines. DESIGN AND METHODS: Simple immunophenotypic criteria were used to classify all cases of childhood acute leukemia in order to provide therapy directed against acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia. Prognosis, genotype and immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor gene rearrangement status were analyzed. RESULTS: The incidences of MPAL were 28/582 and 4/107 for children treated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia regimens, respectively. In immunophenotypic principal component analysis, MPAL treated as T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia clustered between cases of non-mixed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia, while other MPAL cases were included in the respective non-mixed B-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia clusters. Analogously, immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor gene rearrangements followed the expected pattern in patients treated as having acute myeloid leukemia (non-rearranged, 4/4) or as having B-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (rearranged, 20/20), but were missing in 3/5 analyzed cases of MPAL treated as having T-cell acute lymphobastic leukemia. In patients who received acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment, the 5-year event-free survival of the MPAL cases was worse than that of the non-mixed cases (53+/-10% and 76+/-2% at 5 years, respectively, P=0.0075), with a more pronounced difference among B lineage cases. The small numbers of MPAL cases treated as T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or as acute myeloid leukemia hampered separate statistics. We compared prognosis of all subsets with the prognosis of previously published cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Simple immunophenotypic criteria are useful for therapy decisions in MPAL. In B lineage leukemia, MPAL confers poorer prognosis. However, our data do not justify a preferential use of current acute myeloid leukemia-based therapy in MPAL.","['CLIP-Childhood Leukemia Investigation Prague Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Charles University, 2ndFaculty of Medicine and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic. ester.mejstrikova@lfmotol.cuni.cz']",20100209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent reports suggested higher and more rapid cytogenetic and molecular responses with higher doses of imatinib. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this prospective international, multicenter phase III study, 227 patients with pre-treated Philadelphia chromosome-positive, BCR-ABL-positive chronic myeloid leukemia were randomized to a standard-dose imatinib arm (400 mg/day) or a high-dose imatinib arm (800 mg/day for 6 months followed by 400 mg/day as maintenance therapy). In this planned interim analysis hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses as well as toxicity were evaluated. RESULTS: Compared to the standard-dose, high-dose imatinib led to higher rates of major and complete cytogenetic responses at both 3 months (major: 21% versus 37%, P=0.01; complete: 6% versus 25%, P<0.001) and 6 months (major: 34% versus 54%, P=0.009; complete: 20% versus 44%, P<0.001). This was paralleled by a significantly higher major molecular response rate at 6 months in the high-dose imatinib arm (11.8% versus 30.4%; P=0.003). At 12 months, the rates of major cytogenetic response (the primary end-point) were comparable between the two arms (57% versus 59%). In contrast to non-hematologic toxicities, grade 3/4 hematologic toxicities were more common in the high-dose arm. Cumulative complete cytogenetic response rates were higher in patients without dose reduction in the high-dose arm (61%) than in the patients with no dose reduction in the standard-dose arm (36%) (P=0.014).

Stromal cell-derived factor-1 and its receptor, CXCR4, have been shown to play an important role in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell trafficking and survival. DESIGN AND METHODS: Since histone acetylation is involved in the modulation of gene expression, we evaluated the effects of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, on chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and in particular on cell survival, CXCR4 expression, migration, and drug sensitization. RESULTS: Here, we showed that treatment with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (20 microM) for 48 hours induced a decrease in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell viability via apoptosis (n=20, P=0.0032). Using specific caspase inhibitors, we demonstrated the participation of caspases-3, -6 and -8, suggesting an activation of the extrinsic pathway. Additionally, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid significantly decreased CXCR4 mRNA (n=10, P=0.0010) and protein expression (n=40, P<0.0001). As a result, chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell migration in response to stromal cell-derived factor-1 (n=23, P<0.0001) or through bone marrow stromal cells was dramatically impaired. Consequently, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid reduced the protective effect of the microenvironment and thus sensitized chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells to chemotherapy such as fludarabine. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid induces apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells via the extrinsic pathway and down-regulates CXCR4 expression leading to decreased cell migration. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid in combination with other drugs represents a promising therapeutic approach to inhibiting migration, chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell survival and potentially overcoming drug resistance.","[""Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Laboratoire d'Hematologie Experimentale -Boulevard de Waterloo n 121 - 1000 Bruxelles, Belgium. bstamato@ulb.ac.be""]",20100209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acquisition of both, inhibiting and activating, receptors on developing natural killer cells is an important step in their functional maturation. Here, we report on the reconstitution of natural killer receptors after haploidentical transplantation of T-and B-cell (CD3/CD19) depleted grafts with co-transfusion of natural killer cells in children and its influence on natural killer cell activity and clinical outcome. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed reconstitution patterns of natural killer receptors at different time intervals after haploidentical transplantation by multi-color flow cytometry. Natural killer cell activity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity was tested against cell lines and leukemic blasts in vitro. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates. RESULTS: Recovery of CD56(+)/CD16(+) cells was fast with high cytolytic activity against K562 and strong antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity against neuroblastoma and leukemic blasts as early as day 14 posttransplant. KIR reconstitution showed a predominance of KIR negative natural killer cells early after transplantation and an early reconstitution of CD158b compared to CD158a and CD158e. These differences were independent of presence or absence of the corresponding KIR ligands in donors or recipients. This reconstitution pattern was associated with a higher relapse probability of patients homozygous for HLA-C1-alleles compared to patients homozygous or even heterozygous for HLA-C2-alleles. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a fast recovery of functional and alloreactive natural killer cells with a constant KIR pattern after haploidentical transplantation with T- and B-cell depleted grafts. Moreover, these natural killer cells can mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and therefore may allow for an early use of antibodies against residual malignant cells.","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Eberhard Karl's University, Tuebingen, Germany. matthias.pfeiffer@med.uni-tuebingen.de""]",20100209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: By performing chemotaxis assays towards CXCL12, CCL21 and CCL19, we sought to evaluate the migratory potential of T cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. We next analyzed the chemokine-induced migration of T cells, dividing the chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples according to their expression of the poor prognostic factors CD38 and ZAP-70 in leukemic cells determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: We found that T cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia are less responsive to CXCL12, CCL21 and CCL19 than T cells from healthy adults despite similar CXCR4 and CCR7 expression. Following separation of the patients into two groups according to ZAP-70 expression, we found that T cells from ZAP-70-negative samples showed significantly less migration towards CXCL12 compared to T cells from ZAP-70-positive samples and that this was not due to defective CXCR4 down-regulation, F-actin polymerization or to a lesser expression of ZAP-70, CD3, CD45, CD38 or CXCR7 on these cells. Interestingly, we found that leukemic cells from ZAP-70-negative samples seem to be responsible for the defective CXCR4 migratory response observed in their T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired migration towards CXCL12 may reduce the access of T cells from ZAP-70-negative patients to lymphoid organs, creating a less favorable microenvironment for leukemic cell survival and proliferation.","['Laboratorio de Inmunologia Oncologica, IIHema, Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buneos Aires, Argentina.']",20100209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a significant number of patients will receive a diagnosis of SCLC, and approximately 40% of patients with SCLC will have limited-stage (LS) disease, which is potentially curable with the combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The standard therapy for LS-SCLC is concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and the 5-year survival rate observed in clinical trials is approximately 25%. The standard chemotherapy remains cisplatin and etoposide, but carboplatin is frequently used in patients who cannot tolerate or have a contraindication to cisplatin. Substantial improvements in survival have been made through improvements in radiation therapy. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the preferred therapy for patients who are appropriate candidates. The optimal timing of concurrent chemoradiotherapy is during the first or second cycle, based on data from meta-analyses. The optimal radiation schedule and dose remain topics of debate, but 1.5 Gy twice daily to a total of 45 Gy and 1.8-2.0 Gy daily to a total dose of 60-70 Gy are commonly used treatments. For patients who obtain a near complete or complete response, prophylactic cranial radiation reduces the incidence of brain metastases and improves overall survival. The ongoing Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and Cancer and Leukemia Group B and the European and Canadian phase III trials will investigate different radiation treatment paradigms for patients with LS-SCLC, and completion of these trials is critical.","['Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-7305, USA.

Because Src kinases contribute to multiple blood cell functions by triggering a variety of signaling pathways, we hypothesized that their molecular targeting might lead to growth inhibition in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We studied growth factor-dependent and growth factor-independent leukemic cell lines, including three cell lines expressing mutants of receptor tyrosine kinases (Flt3 or c-Kit) as well as primary AML blasts for responsiveness to dasatinib. RESULTS: Dasatinib resulted in the inhibition of Src family kinases in all cell lines and blast cells at approximately 1 x 10(-9) mol/L. It also inhibited mutant Flt3 or Kit tyrosine phosphorylation at approximately 1 x 10(-6) mol/L. Mo7e cells expressing the activating mutation (codon 816) of c-Kit were most sensitive to growth inhibition with a GI(50) of 5 x 10(-9) mol/L. Primary AML blast cells exhibited a growth inhibition of <1 x 10(-6) mol/L. Cell lines that showed growth inhibition at approximately 1 x 10(-6) mol/L showed a G(1) cell cycle arrest and correlated with accumulation of p21 and p27 protein. The addition of rapamycin or cytotoxic agents enhanced growth inhibition. Dasatinib also caused the apoptosis of Mo7e cells expressing oncogenic Kit. CONCLUSIONS: Although all of the precise targets for dasatinib are not known, this multikinase inhibitor causes either growth arrest or apoptosis in molecularly heterogeneous AML. The addition of cytotoxic or targeted agents can enhance its effects.","['Division of Pediatrics, Departments of Leukemia and Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 60611, USA.']",20100209,,,,"['R01 CA108922/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA108922-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA120535/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA108922/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA120535/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K02 HL003794-06/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS163746'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we used methyl-CpG immunoprecipitation to generate comparative DNA methylation profiles of healthy and malignant cells (acute leukemia and colorectal carcinoma) for human CpG islands across the genome. While searching for sequence patterns that characterize DNA methylation states, we discovered several nonredundant sequences in CpG islands that were resistant to aberrant de novo methylation in cancer and that resembled consensus binding sites for general transcription factors (TF). Comparing methylation profiles with global CpG island binding data for specific protein 1, nuclear respiratory factor 1, and yin-yang 1 revealed that their DNA binding activity in normal blood cells correlated strictly with an absence of de novo methylation in cancer. In addition, global evidence showed that binding of any of these TFs to their consensus motif depended on their co-occurrence with neighboring consensus motifs. In summary, our results had two major implications. First, they pointed to a major role for cooperative binding of TFs in maintaining the unmethylated status of CpG islands in health and disease. Second, our results suggest that the majority of de novo methylated CpG islands are characterized by the lack of sequence motif combinations and the absence of activating TF binding.","['Department of Hematology and Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Regensburg, D-93042 Regensburg, Germany.']",20100209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, resistance or intolerance to imatinib and other BCR/ABL inhibitors may occur during therapy. Therefore, CML research is focusing on novel targets and targeted drugs. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays an essential role in mitosis. In this study, we examined the expression of Plk1 in CML cells and its potential role as a therapeutic target. Plk1 was found to be expressed in phosphorylated form in the CML cell line K562 as well as in primary CML cells in all patients tested. Inhibition of BCR/ABL by imatinib or nilotinib (AMN107) led to decreased expression of the Plk1 protein in CML cells, suggesting that BCR/ABL promotes Plk1 generation. Silencing of Plk1 in CML cells by a small interfering RNA approach was followed by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, the Plk1-targeting drug BI 2536 was found to inhibit proliferation of imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML cells, including leukemic cells, carrying the T315 mutation of BCR/ABL with reasonable IC(50) values (1-50 nmol/L). The growth-inhibitory effects of BI 2536 on CML cells were found to be associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, BI 2536 was found to synergize with imatinib and nilotinib in producing growth inhibition in CML cells. In conclusion, Plk1 is expressed in CML cells and may represent a novel, interesting target in imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML.","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Institute of Immunology, Clinical Institute of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, Medical University of Vienna, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.']",20100209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Silencing of MZF1 inhibits cell proliferation, and abnormal expression of MZF1 results in cancer development. However, a potential role of MZF1 in metastasis remains unclear. Axl is a receptor tyrosine kinase and was first identified as a transforming gene in chronic myeloid leukemia. Axl overexpression induces proliferation, migration, and invasion and is highly expressed in different human cancers. In this study, we show that overexpression of MZF1 induces migration and invasion in colorectal (Rko, SW480) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cells. In addition, we show that MZF1 binds to the Axl promoter, transactivates promoter activity, and enhances Axl-mRNA and protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. In vitro, sh-RNA knockdown of Axl reduced MZF1-induced migration and invasion in HeLa and Rko cells (P = 0.05). Additionally, Rko cells overexpressing MZF1 showed increased tumor formation and liver metastasis in the chicken-embryo-metastasis assay in vivo. Furthermore, the expression of MZF1 and Axl was significantly higher in resected colorectal tumors compared with corresponding normal tissues (P = 0.02; P = 0.05), and MZF1 expression was positively correlated with Axl gene expression in tumor tissues (P < 0.01). Taken together, this is the first study to show that MZF1 induces invasion and in vivo metastasis in colorectal and cervical cancer, at least in part by regulating Axl gene expression.","['Department of Experimental Surgery/Molecular Oncology of Solid Tumors, DKFZ and University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",20100209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the outcome of adult patients with unrelated SCT for HR-ALL and studied the possible effect of the hematopoietic stem cell source of the transplant. A total of 149 adult patients (median age, 29 years, range, 15-59 years) with HR-ALL underwent unrelated SCT in 13 Spanish institutions between 2000 and 2007. Patients in first complete remission (CR1) at transplantation had at least one adverse prognostic factor (advanced age, adverse cytogenetics, hyperleukocytosis, or slow response to induction therapy). ALL was in CR1 in 81 patients (54%), in second CR (CR2) in 37 patients (25%), in third CR (CR3) in 11 patients (7%), and with overt disease in 20 patients (13%). The hematopoietic source was unrelated cord blood (UCB) in 62 patients and an unrelated donor (UD) in 87 patients. The patients undergoing UCB-SCT and UD-SCT were comparable in terms of the main clinical and biological features of ALL, except for a higher frequency of patients with more overt disease in the UCB-SCT group. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 years between the 2 groups. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was significantly lower in the UCB-SCT group (P = .021). The probability of relapse at 1 year was 17% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7%-27%) for the UD-SCT group and 27% (95% CI, 14%-40%) for the UCB-SCT group (P = .088), respectively.

Studies in leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) knockout animals showed that the conditioning lesion effect in sensory neurons is dependent in part on this cytokine; however, similar studies on sympathetic neurons revealed no such effect. Comparable studies with sensory neurons taken from mice lacking the related cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) have yielded conflicting results. LIF and IL-6 belong to a family of cytokines known as the gp130 family because they act on receptors containing the subunit gp130. In sympathetic ganglia, axotomy leads to increases in mRNA for four of these cytokines (LIF, IL-6, IL-11, and oncostatin M). To test the role of this family of cytokines as a whole in the conditioning lesion response in sympathetic neurons, mice in which gp130 was selectively eliminated in noradrenergic neurons were studied. The postganglionic axons of the SCG were transected, and 7days later the ganglia were removed and neurite outgrowth was measured in explant and dissociated cell cultures. In both systems, neurons from wild type animals showed enhanced growth after a conditioning lesion. In contrast, no enhancement occurred in neurons from mutant animals. This lack of stimulation of outgrowth occurred despite an increase in expression of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) in the mutant mice. These studies demonstrate that stimulation of enhanced growth of sympathetic neurons after a conditioning lesion is dependent on gp130 cytokine signaling and is blocked in the absence of signaling by these cytokines in spite of an increase in ATF3.","['Department of Neurosciences, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland OH, 44106-4975, USA.']",20100208,,,,"['R01 NS017512/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS017512-24/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS177593'],,,['Copyright (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In cell extracts the L60F mutant enzyme showed unusual inhibition by thiol reagents not seen in wild-type enzyme. Here we compare the properties of purified recombinant L60F SOD2 with a previously described SOD2 mutant, I58T. Both mutant proteins display a weakened dimer-dimer interaction and thermal instability at 55 degrees C. Both I58T and L60F lose activity at 37 degrees C in the presence of 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide, whereas the wild-type SOD2 does not. Each subunit contains one exposed, reactive cysteine residue at position 196 and a second cysteine residue at 140, which is buried and unreactive in the wild-type tetramer. We propose that the mutant enzymes, which exist largely as dimers, allow both cysteine residues to react with thiol reagents. When the cysteine residue at 140 was changed to serine by site-directed mutagenesis, both double mutants I58T/C140S and L60F/C140S lost their increased thiol sensitivity.

Upon exposure to CMS-9, activation of p38 MAPK and JNK was observed in K562 cells.

Also, we investigated expression of CDKN2A/B and the apoptosis in U937 cells when hCLP46 is downregulated in vitro. RESULTS: Our findings showed that hCLP46 was overexpressed in AML, T-ALL, and the leukemic cell lines. Suppressing hCLP46 overexpression had no effect on expression of CDKN2A/B and apoptosis of U937 cells. CONCLUSION: Considering that hCLP46 has the capability of modifying the Notch pathway, our finding adds weight to the importance of Notch signaling in hematopoiesis and suggests that overexpression of hCLP46 might be an early event in the pathogenesis of AML and T-ALL.","['College of Life Science, Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The compound also inhibited the activity of monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL), the enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of the endogenous cannabinoid receptor ligand 2-arachidonoylglycerol, with an IC(50) value of 1.9 microM. It is concluded that the compound may be a useful template for the design of potent novel inhibitors of FAAH.","['Department of Toxicology, Unit of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Cagliari, via Ospedale 72, Cagliari I-09124, Italy. vonnis@unica.it']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a first report, we have shown that priming with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) may enhance complete remission (CR) rate and event-free survival (EFS) in younger adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: : In this randomized trial, 259 patients with AML were randomized at baseline to receive or not receive GM-CSF concurrently with all cycles of chemotherapy. The effects of GM-CSF on survival were reported herein with a long-term follow-up and studied according to distinct biological subgroups defined on cytogenetics and molecular markers. RESULTS: : The EFS rate was better in the GM-CSF group (43% vs 34%; P = .04). GM-CSF did not improve the outcome in patients from good risk subgroups, while patients from poor risk subgroups benefited from GM-CSF therapy. In this population, the difference in terms of EFS probability was mainly observed in patients with high initial white blood cell count and in those with FLT3-ITD or MLL rearrangement. When combining these 2 molecular abnormalities for comparison of the effect of GM-CSF priming, the difference in terms of EFS was highly significant (5-year EFS, 39% with GM-CSF vs 8% without GM-CSF; P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: : Sensitization of leukemic cells and their progenitors by GM-CSF appears as a plausible strategy for improving the outcome of patients with newly diagnosed AML. Patients with poor-prognosis FLT3-ITD or MLL rearrangement might be a good target population to further investigate priming strategies. Cancer 2010.

However, these agents may also affect anti-tumor immunity. Here, we analyzed the effects of the 3 BCR/ABL-inhibitors on natural killer (NK) cell reactivity. Exposure of CML cells (K562, Meg-01) to pharmacological concentrations of Imatinib, Nilotinib and Dasatinib diminished expression of ligands for the activating immunoreceptor NKG2D to a similar extent. This resulted in comparably reduced NK cell cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production. When direct effects on NK cell responses to K562 and primary CML cells as well as activating cytokines were studied, Dasatinib was found to abrogate NK cytotoxicity and cytokine production. Nilotinib did not alter cytotoxicity but, at high levels, impaired NK cytokine production, while Imatinib had no direct influence on NK cell reactivity. Of note, Nilotinib, but not the other BCR/ABL-inhibitors increased cell death within the preferentially cytokine-secreting CD56(bright)CD16(-) NK cell subset, which may, at least in part, serve to explain the effect of Nilotinib on NK cytokine production. Analysis of NK cell signaling revealed that Dasatinib inhibited proximal signaling events leading to decreased phosphorylation of PI3K and ERK that are crucial for NK cell reactivity. Imatinib and Nilotinib, in contrast, showed no relevant effect on NK cell PI3K or ERK activity. In light of the potential role of NK cells in the immunesurveillance of residual leukemia and for future combinatory immunotherapeutic approaches, our data indicate that choice and dosing of the most suitable BCR/ABL-inhibitor for a given patient require careful consideration.","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Eberhard-Karls-University, Tuebingen, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better understand Gfi1b regulation and to know the implication of the level of expression of this gene in human pathology, we have searched for promoter punctual sequence variations in 214 patients with different hematological diseases. We found two previously unknown congenital mutations at evolutionary conserved GATA and octamer-binding (Oct) transcription factor sites. The Oct site mutation was also found in five relatives of the patient. The GATA motif mutation reduced promoter activity by 50% in vitro, while homozygous patients with the octamer site mutation showed a four-to-five times increase of Gfi1b RNA in platelets. Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses demonstrated that different protein complexes bind to both sites and that binding is reduced by the mutations. Finally, we found that GATA-1 and Oct-1 are the main components of each complex. This study provides evidences of a new mechanism for Gfi1b repression.

Here, we used a specific precursor miRNA-21 (pre-miR-21) or anti-miRNA-21 oligonucleotide (AMO-miR-21) to study sensitivity of HL60 and K562 cells to ATO. Cell viability and cell cycle were evaluated by MTT assay and PI assay using flow cytometry, respectively. Levels of miR-21 and its target PDCD4 were quantified by real-time PCR and/or western blot. AMO-miR-21 or ATO alone led to growth inhibition, apoptosis and G1 phase arrest of cell cycle. Apoptotic cells were confirmed morphologically with Hoechst staining. Moreover, there was somewhat synergistic effect of AMO-miR-21 and ATO in growth inhibition and apoptosis promotion. Meanwhile, enforced pre-miR-21 expression increased resistance to ATO, nevertheless not affecting cell growth alone. Dual-luciferase reporter vector containing two tandem PDCD4 3' UTR validated that PDCD4 was directly up-regulated by miR-21. Therefore, miRNA-21 by targeting PDCD4 may play a functional role in modulating ATO-induced cell death, and strategy using AMO-miR-21 and its combination with ATO may be useful as a myelogenous leukemia therapy.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Jinan University, 601 Western huangpu avenue, 510632 Guangzhou, China.']",20100209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This first success, achieved after retroviral therapy, was later overshadowed by the occurrence of vector-related leukemia in a significant number of the treated children, demonstrating that the future success of gene therapy depends on our understanding of vector biology.

METHODS: We prospectively examined children (aged 10-18 years) with suspected small bowel disease and recorded capsule transit times, findings, and complications. RESULTS: We performed 19 CE examinations in 12 patients (median age 11.8 years; range 10-18 years). One of the two patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB), a 14-year-old girl whose OGIB occurred after cord-blood transplantation due to leukemia, was diagnosed with thrombotic microangiopathy. Repeated CE allowed visualization of real-time mucosal changes, such as the improvement of ulcers and bleeding, and newly emerged lymphangiectasia, without causing the patient physical and mental stress. This information facilitated both subsequent evaluation of the clinical course and determination of the appropriate treatment strategy. In the second patient with chronic OGIB, a 10-year-old girl, the detection of severe ileal stenoses by capsule retention led to the diagnosis of non-specific multiple ulcers of the small intestine. After ileal resection, repeated CE detected the recurrence of multiple ulcers and enabled the optimal treatment strategy to be applied. CE confirmed small bowel involvement in a patient with unresponsive Crohn's disease (CD) and excluded CD in all five patients with suspected CD.

This is of major concern regarding the issues of cure, long-term imatinib tolerability, and imatinib resistance. We therefore asked whether interferon alfa-2a (IFN) alone could maintain molecular remissions achieved by a prior combination therapy with imatinib and IFN. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Imatinib therapy was stopped in 20 patients who had concomitantly been pretreated with imatinib and IFN for a median of 2.4 years (range, 0.2 to 4.8 years) and 2.5 years (range, 0.2 to 4.9 years), respectively. After imatinib discontinuation, remission status was monitored monthly by quantitative analysis of the peripheral-blood BCR-ABL mRNA levels using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Proteinase-3 expression and proteinase-3-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) were longitudinally measured to assess putative markers of IFN response. RESULTS: With a median time of 2.4 years after imatinib withdrawal (range, 0.5 to 4.0 years), 15 (75%) of 20 patients remained in remission. The number of patients in complete molecular remission increased under IFN from two patients at baseline to five patients after 2 years. Relapses occurred in five patients within 0.4 years (range, 0.2 to 0.8 years), but patients underwent rescue treatment with imatinib, re-establishing molecular remission. IFN therapy was associated with an increase in the expression of leukemia-associated antigen proteinase 3 and induction of proteinase-3-specific CTLs. CONCLUSION: Treatment with IFN enables discontinuation of imatinib in most patients after prior imatinib/IFN combination therapy and may result in improved molecular response. Induction of a proteinase-3-specific CTL response by IFN may contribute to this effect.","['Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und Immunologie, Philipps Universitat Marburg und Universitatsklinikum Giessen und Marburg, Standort Marburg, Marburg, Germany.']",20100208,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2010 Sep 1;28(25):e439; author reply e440.

The envelope-mediated immunosuppression was manifested by the ability of the proteins, when expressed by allogeneic tumor cells normally rejected by engrafted mice, to allow these cells to escape, at least transiently, immune rejection. Using this approach, we identified key residues whose mutation specifically abolishes IS activity without affecting the ""mechanical"" fusogenic function of the entire envelope. Here, we genetically ""switched off' the envelope-mediated immunosuppression of an infectious retrovirus, the Friend murine leukemia virus, while preserving mutant envelope infectivity both ex vivo and in vivo, thus allowing us to test the functional importance of envelope-mediated immunosuppression in retrovirus physiology. Remarkably, we show, in vivo, that the non-IS mutant virus displays the same propagation kinetics as its WT counterpart in irradiated immunocompromised mice but that it is rapidly and totally cleared from normal immunocompetent mice, which become fully protected against a challenge with the WT retrovirus. Using cell depletion strategies, we further establish that envelope-mediated immunosuppression enables the retrovirus to escape innate (natural killer cells) and adaptive (CD8 T cells) antiviral effectors. Finally, we show that inactivated mutant virions induce higher humoral and cellular responses than their WT counterparts. In conclusion, our work demonstrates the critical role of Env-induced immunosuppression for retrovirus propagation in vivo and identifies a unique definite target for antiretroviral therapies and vaccine strategies, also characterized in the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) and xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) retroviruses, opening unprecedented prospects for the treatment of retroviral diseases.","['Unite Mixte de Recherche 8122 Institut Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, and Universite Paris-Sud, 91405 Orsay, France.']",20100208,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IDH1/2 mutations are heterozygous, and affect a single arginine residue. Recently, IDH1 mutations were identified in 8% of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients. A glioma study revealed that IDH1 mutations cause a gain-of-function, resulting in the production and accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Genotyping of 145 AML biopsies identified 11 IDH1 R132 mutant samples. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolite screening revealed increased 2-HG levels in IDH1 R132 mutant cells and sera, and uncovered two IDH2 R172K mutations. IDH1/2 mutations were associated with normal karyotypes. Recombinant IDH1 R132C and IDH2 R172K proteins catalyze the novel nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) to 2-HG. The IDH1 R132C mutation commonly found in AML reduces the affinity for isocitrate, and increases the affinity for NADPH and alpha-KG. This prevents the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-KG, and facilitates the conversion of alpha-KG to 2-HG. IDH1/2 mutations confer an enzymatic gain of function that dramatically increases 2-HG in AML. This provides an explanation for the heterozygous acquisition of these mutations during tumorigenesis. 2-HG is a tractable metabolic biomarker of mutant IDH1/2 enzyme activity.","['Agios Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.']",20100208,,,,['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,"['J Exp Med. 2010 Feb 15;207(2):265.

Several lines of evidence support a role for the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-x(L) in MPM chemoresistance. Since it has been recently suggested that Mcl-1 cooperates with Bcl-x(L) for protection against cell death, we investigated the response of mesothelioma cell lines to the downregulation of Bcl-x(L) (alone or in combination with cisplatin) and the potential interest of its concomitant inhibition with that of Mcl-1. Using RNA interference, we showed that Bcl-x(L) depletion sensitized two highly chemoresistant mesothelioma cell lines to cisplatin and that under this treatment, one cell line, MSTO-211H, displayed an apoptotic type of cell death, whereas the other, NCI-H28, evidenced mainly necrotic-type cell death. Otherwise, the inhibition of Mcl-1 by cisplatin may contribute to this induction of cell death observed after Bcl-x(L) downregulation. Strikingly, we observed that the simultaneous inhibition of Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) induced a massive cell death in the absence of chemotherapy and was sufficient to avoid escape to treatment in MSTO-211H cells. In NCI-H28, the addition of a low cisplatin concentration allowed to impede the long-term recovery observed after treatment by the siRNA combination. Together, these findings provide a strong molecular basis for the clinical evaluation of therapies targeting both Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1, alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy, for the treatment of MPM.","[""Unite BioTICLA (Biologie et Therapies Innovantes des Cancers Localement Agressifs) du Groupe Regional d'Etudes sur le Cancer (EA 1772, Universite de Caen Basse-Normandie et IFR146 ICORE), Centre de Lutte Contre le Cancer Francois Baclesse, Avenue du General Harris, BP5026, 14076 Caen Cedex 05, France.""]",20100208,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies implicated myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the induction of CD8(+) T cell tolerance in tumor-bearing hosts. However, the mechanism of this phenomenon remained unclear. We have found that incubation of Ag-specific CD8(+) T cells, with peptide-loaded MDSCs, did not induce signaling downstream of TCR. However, it prevented subsequent signaling from peptide-loaded dendritic cells. Using double TCR transgenic CD8(+) T cells, we have demonstrated that MDSC induced tolerance to only the peptide, which was presented by MDSCs. T cell response to the peptide specific to the other TCR was not affected. Incubation of MDSCs with Ag-specific CD8(+) T cells caused nitration of the molecules on the surface of CD8(+) T cells, localized to the site of physical interaction between MDSC and T cells, which involves preferentially only TCR specific for the peptide presented by MDSCs. Postincubation with MDSCs, only nitrotyrosine-positive CD8(+) T cells demonstrated profound nonresponsiveness to the specific peptide, whereas nitrotyrosine-negative CD8(+) T cells responded normally to that stimulation. MDSCs caused dissociation between TCR and CD3zeta molecules, disrupting TCR complexes on T cells. Thus, these data describe a novel mechanism of Ag-specific CD8(+) T cell tolerance in cancer.","['Department of Immunology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.']",20100208,,,,"['R01 CA084488-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA084488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA157303/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA084488-11S2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 84488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS176555'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Second primary cancer risks were quantified in a cohort of 60,949 individuals surviving > or = 1 year of uterine corpus cancer diagnosed from 1973 to 2003 in Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program cancer registries. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were estimated by comparing patients treated with surgery plus various types of radiotherapy with patients receiving surgery only. RESULTS: The IRRs of a second cancer were increased among irradiated patients compared with patients having surgery only [combination radiotherapy, IRR = 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.16-1.36; external beam therapy, IRR = 1.15; 95% CI CI, 1.08-1.22; brachytherapy, IRR = 1.07; 95% CI, 1.00-1.16]. IRRs were highest for heavily irradiated sites (that is colon, rectum, and bladder) and for leukemia following any external beam therapy, with the largest risks for solid cancers among 10-year survivors. Any external beam therapy had a 44% higher cancer risk at heavily irradiated sites than brachytherapy when the two treatments were directly compared (5-year survivors: IRR = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.19-1.75). We estimated that of 2,012 solid cancers developing > or = 5 years after irradiation, 213 (11%) could be explained by radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy for uterine cancer increases the risk of leukemia and second solid cancers at sites in close proximity to the uterus, emphasizing the need for continued long-term surveillance for new malignancies.

An earlier study from this laboratory demonstrated 17beta-oestradiol (E2) induced apoptosis in macrophages derived from human peripheral blood monocytes and THP-1 acute monocytic leukaemia cell line when Bcl-2 was down-regulated; however, the involvement of E2 receptor subtypes in the modulation of death pathways in these cells remain unknown. Using macrophages derived from THP-1 human acute monocytic leukaemia cells as a model, we demonstrate that plasma membrane associated oestrogen receptor (ER) -alpha participate in E2 induced Bcl-2 increase, through activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway whereas cytosolic ER-beta transmits signals for the pro-apoptotic event of Bax translocation. The mechanistic basis of Bax translocation comprised of ER-beta mediated increase in intracellular pH, facilitated by activation of the Na(+)-H(+) exchanger. Intracellular alkalinization accompanied by concomitant Bcl-2 increase and Bax migration does not cause cellular apoptosis; however, siRNA mediated down-regulation of ER-alpha during E2 exposure leads to inhibition of Bcl-2 increase and consequently apoptosis due to the unopposed action of mitochondrial Bax. In summary, this study underscores the importance of integrative signalling modality from multiple oestrogen receptor pools in modulating oestrogen effects on human monocyte-derived macrophage apoptotic signalling pathway, which opens new vistas to explore the use of selective oestrogen receptor modulators in apoptosis-based therapies.","['Cell Death and Differentiation Research Laboratory, National Institute of Immunology, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, India.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we showed that CD38, a proliferation marker in leukaemia cells, plays an important role in the hypothalamus in the process of oxytocin release in adult mice. Disruption of Cd38 (Cd38 (-/-)) elicited impairment of maternal behaviour and male social recognition in adult mice, similar to the behaviour observed in Oxt and oxytocin receptor (Oxtr) gene knockout (Oxt (-/-) and Oxtr (-/-), respectively) mice. Locomotor activity induced by separation from the dam was higher and the number of ultrasonic vocalisation calls was lower in Cd38 (-/-) than Cd38( +/+) pups. However, these behavioural changes were much milder than those observed in Oxt (-/-) and Oxtr (-/-) mice, indicating less impairment of social behaviour in Cd38 (-/-) pups. These phenotypes appeared to be caused by the high plasma oxytocin levels during development from the neonatal period to 3-week-old juvenile mice. ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity was markedly lower in the knockout mice from birth, suggesting that weaning for mice is a critical time window of plasma oxytocin differentiation. Breastfeeding was an important exogenous source of plasma oxytocin regulation before weaning as a result of the presence of oxytocin in milk and the dam's mammary glands. The dissimilarity between Cd38 (-/-) infant behaviour and those of Oxt (-/-) or Oxtr (-/-) mice can be explained partly by this exogenous source of oxytocin. These results suggest that secretion of oxytocin into the brain in a CD38-dependent manner may play an important role in the development of social behaviour.","['Department of Biophysical Genetics, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medicine, Kanazawa 920-8640, Japan. haruhiro@med.kanazawa-u.ac.jp']",20100105,,,50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All major subtypes predominantly affected the elderly except Hodgkin lymphoma (incidence peaks at 20-24 and 75-79 years) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (0-9 years). After an initial rise, overall lymphoid and myeloid incidence stabilized in the mid-1990s. The 5-year relative survival was 58% for lymphoid and 35% for myeloid neoplasms. Survival improved during 1990-2004 for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes (p < 0.001) and declined with advancing age for all subtypes (p < 0.001).

However, the function of miR-21 is yet unknown in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), as inhibitors of miRNAs, have already been applied to therapeutic development and functional identification in miRNA research. In this study, we found that the antisense inhibition of miR-21 in K562 cells suppressed cell migration, promoted cell apoptosis, and inhibited cell growth, and up-regulated the expression of the tumor suppressor gene PDCD4. Meanwhile, pre-miRNA-21 increased migration and decreased cell apoptosis without affecting proliferation. We also validated that PDCD4 is a functional target of miR-21 in K562 cells. These effects of miR-21 might be partially due to its regulation of PDCD4. Our data suggest that miR-21 may play an oncogenic role in the cellular processes of CML, and antisense inhibition of miR-21 may therefore be useful as CML therapy.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2016 May;57(5):1246.

OBJECTIVES: The specific hypothesis tested was that lifetime substance use disorders increased the risk of adverse outcome, in the context of other psychosocial and clinical characteristics demonstrated in other studies to have an impact on treatment outcome. METHOD: Prospective cohort study of 106 adults with chronic myelogenous leukemia or primary myelodysplastic syndrome. None satisfied criteria for current substance abuse or dependence, but the lifetime rates of substance use disorders in this sample were 28% for alcohol, 12% for cannabis, and 9% for cocaine. RESULTS: Participants received treatment as directed by their physicians, and were followed until death or the end of the study (median 1.5 years). Twenty-eight died. Multivariate survival analysis identified three predictors of outcome: lifetime cocaine use, associated with a six-fold increased risk of death (p = .04), and two protective variables, baseline hemoglobin (p = .002) and estimated intelligence quotient (IQ) (p = .04). CONCLUSION: The results of this study highlight the potential significance of substance use disorders, and lifetime cocaine diagnoses in particular, on treatment outcome for people with chronic myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Whereas neither lifetime alcohol nor cannabis use were associated with survival on either the univariate or multivariate models of survival, lifetime cocaine diagnoses were associated with significant six-fold increased risk of death (p = .04).","['Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. gchang@partners.org']",,,,,"['K24 AA000289/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA142106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA142106-06A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 AA00289/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS180226'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the discovery of lestaurtinib as a potent FLT3 inhibitor, in 1985, there has been considerable interest in the development of this agent (CEP-701, Cephalon, Frazer, PA, USA) for treatment of this population. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: An extensive literature search was conducted that included published articles and abstracts on the preclinical and clinical development of this agent spanning the last decade. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The review describes the historical development of this agent and reviews the available preclinical and clinical data on lestaurtinib and expands on potential future directions in development of this agent. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Lestaurtinib is a multi targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor which has been shown to potently inhibit FLT3 at nanomolar concentrations in preclinical studies, leading to its rapid development as a potential targeted agent for treatment of AML. Phase I studies have shown lestaturtinib to be an active agent particularly when used in combination with cytotoxic drugs. Currently, Phase II and Phase III studies are underway aiming to establish the future of this agent as a treatment option for patients with FLT3-ITD AML.","['Medical University of South Carolina, Hematology and Oncology, 96 Jonathan Lucas Street, CSB 903, Charleston, SC 29425, USA.']",,,,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bombesin-directed peptides (KB, BB27, and BB28) contained the same bombesin leader sequence but had different mitochondria-disrupting peptides, which selectively induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in solid tumor cells and leukemia cell lines. The IC50 values of these peptides (BB27, 3-5 micromol/L; BB28, 4-6 micromol/L) for solid tumor cells and leukemia cells are approximately 5-10 times lower than the IC50 values for normal cells. BB27 and BB28 also displayed cytotoxicity in primary leukemia cells from patients (n = 4) with acute myeloid leukemia. Intratumoral (10 mg/kg) and intraperitoneal (20 mg/kg) injection of BB27 and BB28 exerted substantial inhibition on K562 tumor xenograft growth without obvious systematic toxicity. Our results suggest that the bombesin-directed mitochondria-disrupting peptides BB27 and BB28 might be used as therapeutic agents not only for solid tumors but also for hematologic tumors.","['Key Laboratory of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, Ministry of Health, and Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041 China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vascular ports applied in those children improved the conditions of treatment and a quality of life, additionally, made the job of personnel taking care of them easier. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study presents own experience in long-term venous access into the central veins system, so called vascular ports, gathered for 15 years of using them in children with hemato-oncogical diseases. The analysis of 309 of implanted vascular ports was done taking into consideration the maintenance and complications. Ports were implanted in 300 children with oncological diseases. The received results are presented in numbers and percentage. RESULTS: Mean time of port insertion has decreased in comparison to earlier studies by 35 days and now is 722 days, median 658 days, however, minimal and maximal time of port insertion has changed respectively 7 and 2099 days. The total time of port insertion in this period was 232 536 days. The observation showed 31 (10.03%) cases of complications, out of which the most common were set infection (16 - 5.18%), catheter occlusion by a clot (7 - 2.27%) and ""spontaneous"" catheter move out of vessel lumen (3 - 0.97%), migration of a torn-off catheter into the right heart ventricle (2 - 0.65%). CONCLUSIONS: 1. Application of vascular ports enabled a long-term and intensive chemotherapy in children with oncological and hematological diseases. 2. Application of vascular ports bears a minor risk of complications, the most dangerous observed complication was a replacement of a torn-off catheter into the right heart ventricle.","['Katedra i Zaklad Propedeutyki Chirurgii i Medycyny Ratunkowej w Bytomiu, Slaski Uniwersytet Medyczny w Katowicach. bubog@interia.pl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hallmark of the disease is the presence of oncogene expression in bone marrow or peripheral blood as a result of some chromosome translocations. The development of leukemia with transfer to disease progression presents a multistage process implicating series of molecular changes leading to chromosomal instability and aneuploidy. The most possible of these changes include the followings: appearance of additional chromosome translocations, activation of other not previously expressed oncogenes, loss of tumor suppressor genes, abnormal centrosome duplication, and dysfunction of the genes which coordinate the accurate chromosome alignment and chromosome segregation during mitosis. The two latter molecular changes which are controlled by mitotic spindle checkpoints play the role in leukemogenesis and are probably involved in apoptosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) cells from 57 cases of CLL were collected and cultured with CpG-ODN DSP30+interleukin-2 (IL-2), phytohemagglutinin (PHA), pokeweed (PWM) or IL-2, respectively. Five days later cells were harvested for chromosome preparation. Karyotypic analysis was done using R banding technique. Panel fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was carried out on 19 cases of CLL with normal karyotypes using the following probes: Cen12, D13S25, Rb1, ATM, p53, MYB and IgH. Genomic DNA from 21 cases of them was extracted from BM or PB leukocytes. The immunoglobulin variable heavy chain (IgVH) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced. CD38 and ZAP70 expressions in the leukemic cells were determined by flow cytometry (FCM). RESULTS: The detection rate of karyotypic abnormalities in the CpG-ODN+IL-2 group (43.85%) was obviously higher than that in the PHA (15.09%), PWM (17.31%) and IL-2 (3.13%) groups (P<0.01). Fifty-two types of karyotypic abnormalities were found. Among them, trisomy12 (+12) or +12 with other abnormalities were the most common, while translocations were the most frequent structural abnormalities including 3 unbalanced and 11 balanced translocations, among them 7 had rearrangements involving 14q32. Thirteen cases showed one or more abnormalities on FISH including trisomy 12 and p53 deletion each in one case, IgH rearrangement and partial deletion each in one case, 13q14.3 deletion in 11 cases of which 5 cases also had Rb1 deletion, 1 case had Rb1 partial deletion. No case with ATM or MYB deletions was found. PCR detected IgVH mutations in 10/21 cases. FCM showed 10/45 cases were CD38 positive, but 35 /45 were CD38 negative, 11/27 cases expressed ZAP70, but 16/27 did not. Among the 26 cases examined for CD38 and ZAP70 expressions simultaneously, 5 cases were CD38+ZAP70+, 13 were CD38-ZAP70-, 6 were CD38-ZAP70+, and 2 were CD38+ZAP70-, respectively. Statistic analysis showed a correlation between complex karyotype and IgVH without mutation, but no association between karyotype and CD38 or ZAP70 expression was observed. CONCLUSION: CpG-ODN immunostimulation can obviously raise the detection rate of abnormal karyotypes, especially translocations in CLL. FISH is an important complement to conventional karyotypic analysis. The combination of both methods can provide more comprehensive genetic information for CLL.","['The First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, Jiangsu, 215006 P.R.China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As an aptamer, AS-1411 does not appear to engage in hybridization-requiring pathways such as antisense effect, siRNA or triple helix formation. Instead, AS-1411 appears to bind to nucleolin specifically, and is subsequently internalized into the tumor cell. Nucleolin is an abundant protein, with expression that is correlated with the proliferative status of the cell: nucleolin levels are higher in tumors and actively dividing cells. Because of the multifunctional nature of nucleolin, it is probable that many secondary targets are affected following treatment with AS-1411. AS-1411 has demonstrated preclinical growth inhibition activity against a wide variety of tumor cell lines at concentrations in the micromolar range, and resulted in good efficacy in mice xenografted with tumor cells of human origin. In a phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced, refractory cancers with metastases at multiple sites, AS-1411 was safe and well tolerated; in addition, one complete response and one ongoing partial response were reported in two patients with renal cell carcinoma. A phase II trial of AS-1411 in combination with cytarabine in patients with AML demonstrated the combination to be superior to cytarabine alone.

There is a need for novel antileukemia agents due to toxicity and resistant to existing chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, the effects of pseudolaric acid B (PAB) on three human leukemia cell lines, acute promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells, acute lymphoblastic leukemia CCRF-CEM cells, and human chronic myeloid leukemia blast-phase K562 cells were investigated in vitro, compared to normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). METHODS: Cell viability was determined using CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent. Colony formation was assessed by Microtitration cloning assay. Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. Tubulin polymerization was measured by recording the increase in absorbance. Inhibition of topoisomerase I (topo I) and topoisomerase II (topo II) enzyme activities was measured by DNA relaxation assay using topo I and II drug screening kit. Apoptosis was observed by DAPI staining assay and Caspase3/7 activities was measured using Caspase-Glo((R)) 3/7 assay kit. RESULTS: Pseudolaric acid B selectively inhibited the growth of human leukemia HL-60, CCRF-CEM and K562 cells, but not normal PBMC. PAB suppressed colony formation in HL-60 cells. Cell cycle analysis showed that PAB blocked the cell cycle at G(2)/M phase in HL-60 cells, suggesting that it suppresses mitosis. DNA topo I and topo II were not inhibited, but tubulin polymerization was inhibited. PAB-induced apoptosis and activated caspase-3/7 activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that PAB has a potential for use against leukemia and its effects might be mediated by inhibiting tubulin polymerization, preventing cell division and activating caspase-3, which leads to apoptosis.","['The National Center for Natural Products Research, School of Pharmacy, The University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677, USA.']",20100207,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elaborate further the DNA elements which control its regulation, we used genomic tiling microarrays covering 256 kb of the human SCL locus to perform a concerted analysis of chromatin structure and binding of regulatory proteins in human haematopoietic cell lines. This approach allowed us to characterise further or redefine known human SCL regulatory elements and led to the identification of six novel elements with putative regulatory function both up and downstream of the SCL gene. They bind a number of haematopoietic transcription factors (GATA1, E2A LMO2, SCL, LDB1), CTCF or components of the transcriptional machinery and are associated with relevant histone modifications, accessible chromatin and low nucleosomal density. Functional characterisation shows that these novel elements are able to enhance or repress SCL promoter activity, have endogenous promoter function or enhancer-blocking insulator function. Our analysis opens up several areas for further investigation and adds new layers of complexity to our understanding of the regulation of SCL expression.","['The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, United Kingdom.']",20100205,,,,['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several host factors that restrict HIV and other retroviral infections have also recently been described. Here we demonstrate that Mov10, a protein associated with P-bodies that has a putative RNA-helicase domain, when overexpressed in cells can inhibit the production of infectious retroviruses. Interestingly, reducing the endogenous Mov10 levels in virus-producing cells through siRNA treatment also modestly suppresses HIV infectivity. The actions of Mov10 are not limited to HIV, however, as ectopic expression of Mov10 restricts the production of other lentiviruses as well as the gammaretrovirus, murine leukemia virus. We found that HIV produced in the presence of high levels of Mov10 is restricted at the pre-reverse transcription stage in target cells. Finally, we show that either helicase mutation or truncation of the C-terminal half of Mov10, where a putative RNA-helicase domain is located, maintained most of its HIV inhibition; whereas removing the N-terminal half of Mov10 completely abolished its activity on HIV. Together these results suggest that Mov10 could be required during the lentiviral lifecycle and that its perturbation disrupts generation of infectious viral particles. Because Mov10 is implicated as part of the P-body complex, these findings point to the potential role of cytoplasmic RNA processing machinery in infectious retroviral production.","['Department of Microbiology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America.']",20100205,,,,"['R21 AI078839/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A ternary classification system which classifies leukemia expression data into three subclasses including B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia was also developed. In each classification system gene expression profiles of leukemia patients were first subjected to a sequence of simple preprocessing steps. This resulted in filtering out approximately 95 percent of the non-informative genes. The remaining 5 percent of the informative genes were used to train a set of artificial neural networks with different parameters and architectures. The networks that gave the best results during initial testing were recruited into a committee. The committee decision was by majority voting. The committee neural network system was later evaluated using data not used in training. The binary classification system classified microarray gene expression profiles into two categories with 100 percent accuracy and the ternary system correctly predicted the three subclasses of leukemia in over 97 percent of the cases.","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Akron, Akron, OH 44325-0302.']",20090903,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human Bcr-Abl(+) cells engrafted in the bone marrow of immunodeficient mice survive under severe hypoxia. We generated two hypoxia-adapted (HA)-Bcr-Abl(+) sublines by selection in long-term hypoxic cultures (1.0% O(2)). Interestingly, HA-Bcr-Abl(+) cells exhibited stem cell-like characteristics, including more cells in a dormant, increase of side population fraction, higher beta-catenin expression, resistance to Abl TKIs, and a higher transplantation efficiency. Compared with the respective parental cells, HA-Bcr-Abl(+) cells had higher levels of protein and higher enzyme activity of glyoxalase-I (Glo-I), an enzyme that detoxifies methylglyoxal, a cytotoxic by-product of glycolysis.

DC-stimulating substances were cytokines (""standard-medium"", ""MCM-Mimic"", ""cytokine-method""), bacterial lysates (""Picibanil""), double-stranded RNA [""Poly (I:C)""] or a cytokine bypass method (""Ca-ionophore""). The quality/quantity of DC generated was estimated by flow cytometry studying (co) expressions of ""DC""antigens, costimulatory, maturation, and blast-antigens. Comparing these methods on average 15% to 32% DC, depending on methods used, could be obtained from blast-containing mononuclear cells (MNC) in AML/MDS cases with a DC viability of more than 60%. In all, 39% to 64% of these DC were mature; 31% to 52% of leukemic blasts could be converted to DCleu and DCleu-proportions in the suspension were 2% to 70% (13%). Average results of all culture methods tested were comparable, however not every given case of AML could be differentiated to DC with 1 selected method. However performing a pre-analysis with 3 DC-generating methods (MCM-Mimic, Picibanil, Ca-ionophore) we could generate DC in any given case. Functional analyses provided proof, that DC primed T cells to antileukemia-directed cytotoxic cells, although an anti-leukemic reaction was not achieved in every case. In summary our data show that a successful, quantitative DC/DCleu generation is possible with the best of 3 previously tested methods in any given case. Reasons for different functional behaviors of DC-primed T cells must be evaluated to design a practicable DC-based vaccination strategy.","['Medical Department III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, 81377 Munich, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody, conjugated to calicheamicin, which targets the CD33 antigen that is expressed in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blasts. The selectivity of GO for CD33-positive leukemic cells makes it an attractive agent for use in patients with multiple sites of IEMR after allo-HSCT, because GO does not suppress cells responsible for the putative graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Herein, we describe a 54-year-old male patient who developed AML with multiple sites of extramedullary (EM) relapse after allo-HSCT, and who exhibited apparent donor-derived hematopoiesis in the bone marrow. At approximately 120 days after allo-HSCT, the patient complained of severe lumbago. T2-weighted magnetic resonance images and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography showed multiple mass lesions in soft tissue and bone. A biopsy specimen from a lumbar soft tissue mass confirmed EM relapse, and revealed that donor T lymphocytes were present in the relapse site and that leukemic cells expressed CD33. Therefore, to maintain the GVL effect of donor T lymphocytes, the patient was treated with GO as a single agent. He achieved complete hematological remission, and has remained in remission, with only mild liver injury, for more than 10 months since GO treatment. GO can be an effective therapy for IEMR after allo-HSCT, especially when cytotoxic T lymphocytes react to leukemic cells at the site of EM relapse.","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Yamaguchi University School of Medicine, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan. ando1013@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to explore whether repeated oral and single vaginal administration of levonorgestrel affect the endometrium and thus potentially increase the EC efficacy, compared with the standard regimen. METHODS: Endometrial biopsies were taken from non-smoking, healthy women with proven fertility on cycle days LH + 6 to LH + 8 in control and levonorgestrel treatment cycles (each woman serving as her own control). Levonorgestrel was administered either orally (0.75 mg x 4, at 24 h intervals on LH + 1 to LH + 4; n = 8) or vaginally (a single dose of 1.5 mg on LH + 2; n = 7). Immunohistochemistry and real-time RT-PCR was performed to compare the levels of protein and mRNA for sex steroid receptors, interleukin-1beta, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), vascular endothelial growth factor, cyclooxygenase-2, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, integrin alpha(v)beta(3) and mucin 1 in endometrial cells. RESULTS: Following the repeated oral treatment, the immunoreactivity of both progesterone receptor (PR)-A and PR-B declined in glandular epithelium (P = 0.03 and P = 0.02, respectively), whereas stromal immunoreactivity and mRNA expression of LIF increased compared with control (P < 0.001 and P = 0.03, respectively). However, vaginal levonorgestrel did not cause any significant endometrial changes. CONCLUSIONS: The two regimens of levonorgestrel caused either only minor or no alterations in markers of endometrial receptivity. New agents targeting the endometrial development should be explored in order to increase EC efficacy.","[""Division of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska University Hospital/Karolinska Institutet, SE-17176 Stockholm, Sweden.""]",20100206,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we propose that committed lymphoid progenitor/precursor cells with an active V-D-J recombination program are the initiating cells of follicular lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma when targeted by immunoglobulin (IG)- gene translocations in the bone marrow. However, these pre-malignant lymphoma-initiating cells cannot drive complete malignant transformation, requiring additional cooperating mutations in specific stem-cell programs to be converted into the lymphoma-originating cells able to generate and sustain lymphoma development. Conversely, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma derive from B lymphocytes that acquire translocations through IG-hyper-mutation or class-switching errors within the germinal center. Although secondary reprogramming mutations are generally required, some cells such as centroblasts or memory B cells that have certain stem cell-like features, or lymphocytes with MYC rearrangements that deregulate self-renewal pathways, may bypass this need and directly function as the lymphoma-originating cells. An alternative model supports an aberrant epigenetic modification of gene sets as the first occurring hit, which either leads to retaining stem-cell features in hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells, or reprograms stemness into more committed lymphocytes, followed by secondary chromosomal translocations that eventually drive lymphoma development. Isolation and characterization of the cells that are at the origin of the different B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas will provide critical insights into the disease pathogenesis and will represent a step towards the development of more effective therapies.","['Division of Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research, University of Navarra, Avda.

To better assess durability of response to and tolerability of dasatinib, data from a 2-year minimum follow-up for a dose-optimization study in chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia are reported here. DESIGN AND METHODS: In a phase 3 study, 670 chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients with resistance, intolerance, or suboptimal response to imatinib were randomized to dasatinib 100 mg once-daily, 50 mg twice-daily, 140 mg once-daily, or 70 mg twice-daily. RESULTS: Data from a 2-year minimum follow-up demonstrate that dasatinib 100 mg once daily achieves major cytogenetic response and complete cytogenetic response rates comparable to those in the other treatment arms, and reduces the frequency of key side effects. Comparable 2-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates were observed (80% and 91%, respectively, for 100 mg once daily, and 75%-76% and 88%-94%, respectively, in other arms). Complete cytogenetic responses were achieved rapidly, typically by 6 months. In patients treated with dasatinib 100 mg once daily for 6 months without complete cytogenetic response, the likelihood of achieving such a response by 2 years was 50% for patients who had achieved a partial cytogenetic response, and only 8% or less for patients with minor, minimal, or no cytogenetic response. Less than 3% of patients suffered disease transformation to accelerated or blast phase. CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent kinase inhibition can achieve rapid and durable responses, indistinguishable from those achieved with more continuous inhibition.","['1Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA, USA. nshah@medicine.ucsf.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One case had both IGH@-CRLF2 and P2RY8-CRLF2, and another had a novel CRLF2 rearrangement. Only 2 of 29 cases were Down syndrome. CRLF2 rearrangements were significantly associated with activating mutations of JAK1 or JAK2, deletion or mutation of IKZF1, and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (Fisher exact test, P < .001 for each). Within this cohort, patients with CRLF2 rearrangements had extremely poor treatment outcomes compared with those without CRLF2 rearrangements (35.3% vs 71.3% relapse-free survival at 4 years; P < .001).

To clarify the molecular function of PU.1, we initially tried to identify bona fide target genes regulated by PU.1. Dual microarrays were employed for this study to compare PU.1-knockdown K562 cells (K562PU.1KD) stably expressing PU.1 short inhibitory RNAs versus control cells and PU.1-overexpressing K562 cells (K562PU.1OE) versus control cells. In these analyses, we found that several genes, including metallothionein (MT)-1 isoforms (MT-1G and MT-1A) and vimentin (VIM), were markedly induced while Jun dimerization protein (JDP) 2 was suppressed in K562PU.1KD cells. Furthermore, the mRNA expressions of the MT-1 and VIM genes were inversely correlated and the mRNA expression of JDP2 was positively correlated with PU.1 mRNA expression in 43 primary acute myeloid leukemia specimens (MT-1G: R = -0.50, p < 0.001; MT-1A: R = -0.58, p < 0.0005; VIM: R = -0.39, p < 0.01; and JDP2: R = 0.30, p < 0.05). Next, we analyzed the regulation of the MT-1 and VIM genes. We observed increased associations of acetylated histones H3 and H4 with the promoters of these genes in K562PU.1KD cells. Sequence analyses of the regions approximately 1 kb upstream from the transcription start sites of these genes revealed numerous CpG sites, which are potential targets for DNA methylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and PU.1 bound to the CpG-rich regions in the MT-1 and VIM promoters. Bisulfite sequencing analyses of the PU.1-bound regions of these promoters revealed that the proportions of methylated CpG sites were tightly related to the PU.1 expression levels.","['Division of Molecular Hematology, Kitasato University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, 1-15-1 Kitasato, Minamiku, Sagamihara 252-0373, Japan.']",20100205,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Out of 31 cases of maternal leukemia diagnosed during pregnancy at our institution, 5 were ALL cases. Three of the 5 patients had MLL gene rearrangement. The data for these 5 patients are presented in this report.

Despite emerging studies, our understanding of the key molecular machineries that profoundly influence key stem cell properties is poor. This review discusses the seminal aspects of stem cell self-renewal mechanisms with an emphasis on various influencing factors, including DNA damage, and intrinsic and extrinsic factors that govern the significant characteristics of tissue stem cells under normal and stress conditions.

KIR(-) cells, which compose nearly half of the circulating NK cell population, exhibit tolerance to primary leukemia targets, suggesting signaling through other inhibitory receptors. Both acute myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia targets were rendered susceptible to lysis by fresh resting KIR(-) NK cells when inhibitory receptor-major histocompatibility class I interactions were blocked by pan-HLA antibodies, demonstrating that these cells are functionally competent. Blockade of a single inhibitory receptor resulted in slightly increased killing, whereas combined LIR-1 and NKG2A blockade consistently resulted in increased NK cell cytotoxicity. Dual blockade of NKG2A and LIR-1 led to significant killing of targets by resting KIR(-) NK cells, demonstrating that this population is not hyporesponsive. Together these results suggest that alloreactivity of a significant fraction of KIR(-) NK cells is mediated by NKG2A and LIR-1.

A bone marrow-engrafting CCRF-CEM leukemia model in Rag2-M mice was utilized to correlate the therapeutic and myelosuppressive properties of CPX-351 with bone marrow delivery and drug uptake in leukemia cells relative to normal bone marrow cell populations. When administered to mice bearing CCRF-CEM human leukemia xenografts, CPX-351 ablated bone marrow (BM) leukemic cells to below detectable levels for multiple weeks, whereas the free-drug cocktail only transiently suppressed leukemia growth. In contrast to the activity against leukemia cells, CPX-351 and free-drug cocktail induced similar myelosuppression in non-tumor-bearing BM. In leukemia-laden BM, drug concentrations were markedly elevated for CPX-351 over free-drug cocktail and the first dose of CPX-351, but not free-drug cocktail, potentiated BM drug accumulation for subsequent doses. Confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that CPX-351 liposomes are taken up by CCRF-CEM cells and subsequently release drugs intracellularly. The improved in vivo efficacy of CPX-351 appears related to increased and prolonged exposure of synergistic cytarabine:daunorubicin ratios in BM, and the selective killing of leukemia may arise from direct liposome-leukemia cell interactions. These features may also have broader applicability in the treatment of other haematological malignancies.","['Celator Pharmaceuticals Corporation, 1779W. 75th Avenue, Vancouver, BC V6P 6P2, Canada.']",20100206,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The majority of patients with EMI suffered poor prognosis. To explore mechanism underlying EMI, we analyzed SHI-1 cells, a highly invasive human acute monocytic leukemia cell line, and found their strong expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), membrane type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP-2). SHI-1 cells showed higher invasive ability to traverse reconstituted basement membranes (Matrigel) and stronger activation of proMMP-2 than other leukemia cell line such as NB4, K562, U937 and THP-1 cells. When co-cultured with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), the invasive capacity and proMMP-2 activation of SHI-1 cells enhanced remarkably. Furthermore, the inhibition of MMP-2, MT1-MMP, or TIMP-2 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) substantially impaired SHI-1 cells invasion and decreased proMMP-2 activation. In the contrast, up-regulated expression of TIMP-2 for 2-3 folds level increased cell invasion and proMMP-2 activation. These results demonstrated that constitutively high expression of MMP-2, MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 in SHI-1 cells facilitated cell invasion by promoting proMMP-2 activation. Moreover, up-regulation of TIMP-2 exhibited not a repressive but an activating effect on SHI-1 cells invasion. Our study indicated that increasing TIMP-2 in AML patients with EMI may potentially cause adverse effects, particularly in patients containing high levels of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP.","['Leukemia Research Unit, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, 1st Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, 188 Shizi Street, Suzhou, 215006, China.']",20100206,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Further, SPAG9 protein expression was also detected on cell surface suggesting that this molecule may be a suitable target for immunotherapy. Interestingly, 90% CML-CP patients showed humoral response against SPAG9, suggesting its important role in early diagnostic of CML-CP. Further investigation is warranted in establishing the potential of SPAG9 as a biomarker and immunotherapeutic target for early treatment of CML-CP patients.","['Cancer Microarray, Genes and Proteins Laboratory, National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi, India.']",20100206,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The rationale is not scientific, but largely economically based. We analyzed a cohort of 46 CML patients who participated in a graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis clinical trial and underwent related HLA-matched allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. The median time of follow-up in surviving patients was 43 months (range: 4-89 months). Risk stratification of the population was done by European Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) criteria. The estimated probabilities of overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 3 years in low EBMT risk score (0-2) patients were both 91%, respectively. We conclude that in countries with restricted access to imatinib, allo-SCT should be considered early on as front-line therapy.

An adaptive model predictive control (MPC) strategy is presented in which maintenance therapy for childhood ALL is personalized using routine patient measurements of red blood cell mean corpuscular volume as a surrogate for the active drug metabolite concentration. A clinically relevant mathematical model is developed and used to describe the patient response to the chemotherapeutic drug 6-mercaptopurine, with some model parameters being patient-specific. During the course of treatment, the patient-specific parameters are adaptively identified using recurrent complete blood count measurements, which sufficiently constrain the patient parameter uncertainty to support customized adjustments of the drug dose.

METHODS: The human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) was chosen in our study. The differentiation of THP-1 cells into macrophages was induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Macrophages were then incubated with oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) to generate foam cells. Ghrelin and [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6, the special antagonist of growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R), were treated during foam cells formation. The ACAT-1 protein and mRNA levels were detected by Western blot and RT-PCR. The effect of variance of cholesterol content was measured by zymochemistry via-fluorospectrophotometer. RESULTS: Ghrelin reduced the content of cholesterol ester in foam cells obviously. ACAT-1 protein and mRNA levels were also decreased. The antagonist of GHS-R inhibited the effects of Ghrelin on ACAT-1 expression in dose-dependent manner. The ACAT-1 mRNA levels of the GHS-R specific antagonist groups (10(-5), 5 x 10(-5), 10(-4) mol/L) were 1.14 +/- 0.04, 1.58 +/- 0.03, 2.40 +/- 0.16, significantly higher than that of the Ghrelin group (0.89 +/- 0.05).

METHODS: Data of hospitalized CML patients in 2005 whole year and outpatient information (July 1 through September 30, 2006) from 15 hospitals throughout China were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 1824 CML cases were analyzed, including 722 inpatients and 1102 outpatients. The male/female ratio was 1.78:1. The median age at diagnosis was 40.02 (2.45 - 83.29) years old, 90.41% of the patients were diagnosed at chronic phase. Proportion of accelerated phase or blast crisis patients increased to 21.66% during study period. 93.20% of the patients received blood routine and bone marrow morphologic examination at diagnosis and in monitoring; 70.29% were performed cytogenetic analysis and 51.54% performed molecular measurement in addition. The most common therapy for CML treatment was hydroxycarbamide. The proportion of patients treated with imatinib and interferon was 37.45% and 25.55%, respectively. Of 722 inpatients, 164 (22.72%) received hemotopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The proportions of accelerated phase and blast crisis patients treated with imatinib were 48.28% and 48.42%, respectively, being significantly higher than that of chronic phase patients (35.9%) (P < 0.05). The mean imatinib dosage administered in the three phases patients did not differ significantly. Imatinib resistance rates were 6.87% and 16.28% for outpatient and inpatient, respectively. In the outpatient group, the primary resistance to imatinib occurred comparably to the secondary resistance (68.75%), while primary resistance was predominant in inpatient group (65.71%). The intolerance rates of imatinib for outpatient and inpatient were 3.21%, 11.63%, respectively. The majority of patients treated with imatinb were not monitored in time: 63.38% patients evaluated hematologic response after 3 months of treatment, proportions of patients received cytogenetic examination after 6 months and 12 months of treatment were 41.41% and 27.35%, respectively. Mean cost for HSCT was 213 092 +/- 125 890 RMB. CONCLUSIONS: CML in China tends to afflict younger population than in Western countries. Most patients were diagnosed in the chronic phase.

METHODS: An oligonucleotide containing the primer binding sequence of mouse Moloney leukemia viral reverse transcriptase (MLV-RT), a multiple cloning site (MCS) and a stem-loop structure for termination of reverse transcription was designed and inserted into one MCS of plasmid pBUDCE4.1, downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter (P(CMV)). The gene fragment encoding MLV-RT was inserted into another MCS of pBUDCE4.1, downstream of elongation factor 1alpha promoter (P(EF-1alpha)). The resulting plasmid was named pSDE01. Then pSDE01 was transfected into RAW264.7 cell and the expression of MLV-RT and the reverse transcriptase activity of expression product was identified by RT-PCR. To identify the cellular expression of 10-23DZ by pSDE01, a 10-23DZ targeting the TACO mRNA of macrophage was designed according to the predicted secondary structure of TACO mRNA. The expression sequence of designed 10-23DZ, DZ1, was synthesized and inserted into the MCS of ODN-PSL in pSDE01. The resulting plasmid, pSDE01-DZ1, was transfected into RAW264.7 cell and the expression of DZ1 was identified by PCR and dot-blot respectively. At 48 h after transfection of pSDE01 into RAW264.7 cells, total RNA and proteins were extracted and the TACO mRNA and protein expression level was assayed by RT-PCR and Western blotting respectively. RESULTS: Restrictive analysis and sequencing data showed that the 10-23DZ expression vector, pSDE01, was successfully constructed and could express MLV-RT with reverse transcriptase activity in cell. When transfected into RAW264.7 cells, pSDE01-DZ1 expressed DZ1 effectively and inhibited the expression of TACO gene.

High-resolution atomic force microscopy topography shows an eye-shaped VDAC with 3.8 nm x 2.7 nm pore dimensions. New work suggests pore formation by the assembly of homo-oligomers and supramolecule of VDAC or hetero oligomers composed of VDAC and pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax. The oligomeric VDAC pore allows for release of cytochrome C. Thus, VDAC plays a central role in the cell life and apoptosis. It has been shown that the hexokinase (HK)-VDAC1 interaction is critical for preventing induction of apoptosis in tumor cells. VDACs are expressed more highly in cancer cells than normal cells, thus can be used as the target in chemotherapy for cancer. VDAC is also involved in pathogenesis of hematological malignancies such as myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Following identification of sequence and structure of VDAC, studies have focused on VDAC as important pharmacological target for new anticancer therapy. To induce apoptosis, agents directly interact with VDAC or detach HK from VDAC to disrupt the anti-apoptosis activity of VDAC-HK interaction, such as methyl jasmonate (MJ) and VDAC1-based peptides. In this review, the function, modulation, structure and location of the VDAC, progress of its researches in hematological malignancies and potential as targets of anti-cancer drugs are summarized.","['Department of Hematology, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University, 100050, Beijing, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the past 20 years since then, understanding of the relationship between Notch 1 activating mutation and T-ALL has been deepened and widened. This review briefly discusses the four main subtypes of Notch 1 activating mutations, also focuses on how these mutations change the normal signaling pathways and genes expression during their participation in the pathogenesis of T-ALL, and how these insights will promote the development of newly targeting therapies for patients with this aggressive form of leukemia.","['Center for Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic cells of some patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic myeloid leukemia also express the leptin receptor. Furthermore, leptin also stimulates leukemic cell growth in vivo by promoting angiogenesis. These findings suggest the possibility that leptin and its receptor play roles in the pathophysiology of leukemia, and blockage of leptin binding to its receptor might have potential therapeutic benefits in the treatment of certain leukemias.

It is increasingly recognized that the cause of relapse resides in a small portion of the leukemia stem/progenitor cell population which has self-renewal and multilineage differentiation potential. As traditional chemotherapeutic drugs only kill the majority of differentiated tumor cells and hardly affect the tumor stem/progenitor cell, that is why most of the chemotherapies did not achieve good results. In order to completely eradicate hematological malignancies, intrinsic properties of stem/progenitor cells must be studied and only the therapy targeting this population could make tumor curable. Targeting the surface markers which distinguish the tumor stem/progenitor cells from normal stem/progenitor cells, inducing the tumor stem/progenitor cell differentiation, disrupting the signal pathways and niche which regulate the tumor stem/progenitor cell self-renewal are all probable strategies.

Clinical efficiency, side effects, and therapy-relevant mortality were observed. By using U937 cell line as in vitro model, effect of G-CSF on cell cycle was determined by propidium iodide staining method. The inhibition rate, apoptosis rate of U937 cell line treated with various combination of G-CSF, homoharringtonine and cytarabine were detected by flow cytometry. The expression of MLAA34 on U937 before or after treating with chemotherapy was analyzed by immunohistochemical method. The results showed that in all the 37 patients, the total remission rate was 62.2% [complete remission rate was 45.95% (17/37) and partial remission rate was 16.2% (6/37)]. The incidence of granulocyte deficiency was 18.92% (2/37) with median time of 4 days. The severe infection occurred in 2 cases. No severe bleeding, no mild digestive effect occurred. Other non-hematological toxicities were low in vitro when incubated with G-CSF for 24 hours, the S-phase cells obviously increased. The inhibition rate, apoptosis rate and expression of MLAA34 of U937 cells treated by GHA significantly decreased as compared with cells treated with HA. It is concluded that the GHA priming therapy can be used to treat patients with refractory, relapse, senile and hypocellular acute monocytic leukemia with satisfied response rate and low hematological and non-hematological toxicities. G-CSF can enhance cytotoxicity of drugs such as Ara-C and HHT by promoting G(0) phase cells into the reproductive cycle. GHA and HA therapy can inhibit cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, and the former has a more significant function. GHA priming therapy can down regulate the expression of MLAA 34.

The results showed that the median follow-up was 21 (range 9 - 78) months. Cumulative complete hematological remission (CHR) rate was 100%, major cytogenetic remission (MCyR) rate was 80%, complete cytogenetic remission (CCyR) rate was 67.1% and complete molecular remission (CMoR) rate was 36.4%. The median time to complete hematological remission (CHR) was 1 (range 1 - 3) month, to complete cytogenetic remission (CCyR) was 6 (range 1 - 24) months. The estimated overall survival rates for patients who received Imatinib for 1, 2, 3 years were (98.7 +/- 1.3)%, (96.5 +/- 2.5)% and (90.1 +/- 6.6)% respectively. The estimated progression-free survival rates at 1, 2, 3 years were (97.6 +/- 1.6)%, (96.1 +/- 2.2)% and (90.0 +/- 1.4)% respectively. The CHR, MCyR and CCyR between low risk, intermediate risk and high risk groups according to the Sokal scoring system and between primarily treated and retreated groups all had no difference. The overall survival of patients who achieved MCyR or CCyR was better than that in patients only achieved hematologic remission (p = 0.026), but there was no significant difference in progression-free survival between them. Univariate analysis for efficacy of Imatinib mesylate revealed that WBC count < 100 x 10(9)/L (p = 0.024), Hb level > or = 130 g/L (p = 0.036), and peripheral basophil count < or = 0.05 (p = 0.024) before therapy were independent favourable factors for achieving MCyR or CCyR. It is concluded that the patients with CML in chronic phase treated with Imatinib can achieve the best hematologic remission and higher cytogenetic remission, it should be considered that the imatinib is a drug of the first-line therapy for untreated and treated patients with CML.","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 30020, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
