The attitude of 97 medical students and 103 students of other subjects from Hannover and Oldenburg, Germany, was analyzed in winter 2017/18. For this purpose, two dilemmas on somatic and germline genome editing concerning familial leukemia were developed. After reading the dilemmas, the students filled out a paper-and-pencil test with five open questions. The qualitative evaluation of the answers was carried by a deductive-inductive procedure of content analysis. There was a high approval for the use of somatic genome editing. When it came to germline genome editing, concerns were raised regarding enhancement, interventions in nature, and loss of uniqueness. The students recognized that somatic genome editing and germline genome editing prove different ethical challenges and need to be judged separately. Many students expressed not feeling fully informed. The results of this project show the importance of educating the public about the possibilities, limitations, and risks of somatic and germline genome editing. We recommend that this should already be addressed in schools in order to optimally prepare students and adults for participation in public discourse. Especially for patients affected by genetic diseases, it is of great importance that the treating physicians and geneticists are sufficiently informed about the method of genome editing to ensure good counseling.","['Vajen, Beate', 'Ronez, Joelle', 'Rathje, Wiebke', 'Heinisch, Laura', 'Ebeling, Smilla', 'Gebhard, Ulrich', 'Hossle, Corinna', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte']","['Vajen B', 'Ronez J', 'Rathje W', 'Heinisch L', 'Ebeling S', 'Gebhard U', 'Hossle C', 'Schlegelberger B']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6973-3339'],"['Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. vajen.beate@mh-hannover.de.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute for Biology and Environmental Science, Carl-von-Ossietzky University Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Biology and Environmental Science, Carl-von-Ossietzky University Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Education, University Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Education, University Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Biology and Environmental Science, Carl-von-Ossietzky University Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],['01GP1612A/Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung'],['Journal Article'],20210508,Germany,J Community Genet,Journal of community genetics,101551501,PMC8241980,['NOTNLM'],"['Genome editing of the germline', 'Medical students', 'Moral attitudes', 'Somatic genome editing']",2021/05/09 06:00,2021/05/09 06:01,['2021/05/08 12:10'],"['2021/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/09 06:01 [medline]', '2021/05/08 12:10 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12687-021-00528-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12687-021-00528-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Community Genet. 2021 Jul;12(3):397-406. doi: 10.1007/s12687-021-00528-1.

While previous studies have shown that mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sezary syndrome (SS) impair QoL, the effect of other types of CL on QoL has not been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of disease on QoL in all CL patients and to assess how QoL between the CL sub-types varies by demographic and clinical factors. METHODS: The Cutaneous Lymphoma Distress Questionnaire (CL-DQ) was used to assess QoL. All CL patients seen in a multidisciplinary CL clinic were screened for eligibility. Questionnaire responses were collected over a 22-month period between 2017 and 2019. A cross-sectional analysis of CL-DQ scores from an initial visit was performed to determine the effect of disease on QoL across CL sub-types and the potential impact of patient demographics, CL sub-type, and type of treatment. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 151 patients presenting with distinct types of cutaneous B- and T-cell lymphomas. Notable across the study population were the findings of frustration (44%), worry about progress/spread (43%), itching/pruritus (32%), and embarrassment/shame (28%). QoL was found to be most negatively affected in SS patients, females, younger patients, Black patients, and those with advanced stages of MF/SS. CONCLUSIONS: Impairment of QoL due to CL correlates with gender, age, race/ethnicity, and stage of MF/SS. While the negative impact on QoL is most pronounced in SS patients, other CL sub-types also affect QoL and impact psychosocial distress. Our findings highlight the need for QoL assessment in all CL patients and further examination of disparities noted across demographic groups.","['Martinez, Xochiquetzal U', 'Chowdhury, Arnab', 'Stiller, Tracey', 'Palmer, Joycelynne', 'Loscalzo, Matthew', 'Barrios, Estella', 'Abdulla, Farah R', 'Zain, Jasmine', 'Rosen, Steven T', 'Querfeld, Christiane']","['Martinez XU', 'Chowdhury A', 'Stiller T', 'Palmer J', 'Loscalzo M', 'Barrios E', 'Abdulla FR', 'Zain J', 'Rosen ST', 'Querfeld C']",,"['Division of Dermatology, City of Hope, Duarte, USA.', 'Division of Biostatistics, City of Hope, Duarte, USA.', 'Division of Biostatistics, City of Hope, Duarte, USA.', 'Division of Biostatistics, City of Hope, Duarte, USA.', 'Patient & Family Resource Center, City of Hope, Duarte, USA.', 'Patient & Family Resource Center, City of Hope, Duarte, USA.', 'Division of Dermatology, City of Hope, Duarte, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope, Duarte, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope, Duarte, USA.', 'Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, 1500 E.

To elicit the mechanism underlying BCR-ABL stability, we perform a screen against a panel of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and find that the ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) drastically stabilizes the BCR-ABL fusion protein. Further studies show that USP7 interacts with BCR-ABL and blocks its polyubiquitination and degradation. Moreover, USP7 knockdown triggers BCR-ABL degradation and suppresses its downstream signaling transduction. In line with this finding, genetic or chemical inhibition of USP7 leads to BCR-ABL protein degradation, suppresses BCR/ABL signaling, and induces CML cell apoptosis. Furthermore, we find the antimalarial artesunate (ART) significantly inhibits USP7/BCR-ABL interaction, thereby promoting BCR-ABL degradation and inducing CML cell death. This study thus identifies USP7 as a putative Dub of BCR-ABL and provides a rationale in targeting USP7/BCR-ABL for the treatment of CML.","['Jiang, Shuoyi', 'Wang, Xiaoge', 'He, Yuanming', 'Huang, Hongbiao', 'Cao, Biyin', 'Zhang, Zubin', 'Liu, Jinbao', 'Wang, Qi', 'Huang, Zhenqian', 'Mao, Xinliang']","['Jiang S', 'Wang X', 'He Y', 'Huang H', 'Cao B', 'Zhang Z', 'Liu J', 'Wang Q', 'Huang Z', 'Mao X']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9873-0559'],"['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510120, China.', 'Guangdong and Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Degradation, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 511436, P.

Although each TP53 aberration is considered an equal prognosticator, the prognostic value of carrying isolated (single-hit) or multiple (multi-hit) TP53 aberrations remains unclear, particularly in the context of targeted agents. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed deep sequencing of TP53 using baseline samples collected from 51 TP53 aberrant patients treated with ibrutinib in a phase II study (NCT01500733). RESULTS: We identified TP53 mutations in 43 patients (84%) and del(17p) in 47 (92%); 9 and 42 patients carried single-hit and multi-hit TP53, respectively. The multi-hit TP53 subgroup was enriched with younger patients who had prior treatments and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene status. We observed significantly shorter overall survival, progression-free survival (PFS), and time-to-progression (TTP) in patients with multi-hit TP53 compared with those with single-hit TP53. Clinical outcomes were similar in patient subgroups stratified by 2 or >2 TP53 aberrations. In multivariable analyses, multi-hit TP53 CLL was independently associated with inferior PFS and TTP. In sensitivity analyses, excluding mutations below 1% VAF demonstrated similar outcome. Results were validated in an independent population-based cohort of 112 patients with CLL treated with ibrutinib. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, single-hit TP53 defines a distinct subgroup of patients with an excellent long-term response to single-agent ibrutinib, whereas multi-hit TP53 is independently associated with shorter PFS. These results warrant further investigations on prognostication and management of multi-hit TP53 CLL.See related commentary by Bomben et al., p. 4462.","['Brieghel, Christian', 'Aarup, Kathrine', 'Torp, Mathias H', 'Andersen, Michael A', 'Yde, Christina W', 'Tian, Xin', 'Wiestner, Adrian', 'Ahn, Inhye E', 'Niemann, Carsten U']","['Brieghel C', 'Aarup K', 'Torp MH', 'Andersen MA', 'Yde CW', 'Tian X', 'Wiestner A', 'Ahn IE', 'Niemann CU']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1816-8106', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3689-4213', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9729-9974', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3717-287X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9880-5242']","['Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Center for Genomic Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Center for Genomic Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Office of Biostatistics Research, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark. carsten.utoft.niemann@regionh.dk.']",['eng'],['ZIA HL002346/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210507,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,PMC8364879,,,2021/05/09 06:00,2021/05/09 06:00,['2021/05/08 06:22'],"['2020/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/02/15 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/09 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/08 06:22 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-20-4890 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-4890 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2021 Aug 15;27(16):4531-4538. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-4890.

Among 67 patients with AML after allo-HSCT, iEMR and bone marrow relapse occurred in 6% and 20.9%, respectively, with a median time to relapse of 11.5 and 6.5 months, respectively. Here, we presented 4 iEMR-AML cases. Common relapse locations occurred in the central nervous system, skin, and lymph nodes. We also report a rare case of cardiac iEMR that responded to chemoradiotherapy. Two cases responded to local/systemic treatments, which resulted in prolonged survival. Another case had iEMR in the presence of chronic graft-versus-host disease. Bone marrow relapse occurring after iEMR was typical and found in three-fourths of the cases. In conclusion, iEMR-AML occurrence after allo-HSCT is not rare in Thai patients. Its unpredictability and lack of graft-versus-leukemia effect highlight the importance of monitoring EMR carefully and promptly providing treatments once it is detected.","['Khemaphiphat, Photsawee', 'Wudhikarn, Kitsada', 'Bunworasate, Udomsak', 'Chanswangphuwana, Chantiya']","['Khemaphiphat P', 'Wudhikarn K', 'Bunworasate U', 'Chanswangphuwana C']",,"['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand; Research Unit in Translational Hematology, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand; Research Unit in Translational Hematology, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand; Research Unit in Translational Hematology, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand; Research Unit in Translational Hematology, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.

The aim of this study was to classify IHCC according to protein expression levels of somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) and b-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and to elucidate the clinicopathological features of each group. METHODS: Fifty-two IHCC patients who underwent hepatic resection were enrolled in this study. Protein expression levels of SSTR2 and Bcl2 were examined using immunohistochemistry. Clinicopathological factors were compared between the three groups and prognostic factors were investigated. RESULTS: The patients were divided into three groups: SSTR2 positive and Bcl2 negative (p-Group H, n = 21), SSTR2 negative and Bcl2 positive (p-Group P, n = 14), and the indeterminate group (p-Group U, n = 17) for cases where SSTR2 and Bcl2 were both positive or both negative. All p-Group P cases displayed curability A or B. The 5-year survival rates of p-Group H and U patients were worse than those in p-Group P. p-Group H had higher T-factor, clinical stage, and incidence of periductal infiltration than p-Group P. CONCLUSIONS: This method could be used to classify IHCC into peripheral and perihilar type by embryological expression patterns of SSTR2 and Bcl2.","['Yamashita, Shoko', 'Morine, Yuji', 'Imura, Satoru', 'Ikemoto, Tetsuya', 'Saito, Yu', 'Takasu, Chie', 'Yamada, Shinichiro', 'Tokuda, Kazunori', 'Okikawa, Shohei', 'Miyazaki, Katsuki', 'Oya, Takeshi', 'Tsuneyama, Koichi', 'Shimada, Mitsuo']","['Yamashita S', 'Morine Y', 'Imura S', 'Ikemoto T', 'Saito Y', 'Takasu C', 'Yamada S', 'Tokuda K', 'Okikawa S', 'Miyazaki K', 'Oya T', 'Tsuneyama K', 'Shimada M']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5889-9288'],"['Department of Surgery, Tokushima University, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Tokushima University, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Tokushima University, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan. ymorine@tokushima-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Surgery, Tokushima University, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Tokushima University, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Tokushima University, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Tokushima University, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Tokushima University, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Tokushima University, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Tokushima University, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Tokushima University, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, Tokushima University, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Tokushima University, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Tokushima University, Tokushima, 770-8503, Japan.']",['eng'],['JP18K02871/the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI'],['Journal Article'],20210507,England,World J Surg Oncol,World journal of surgical oncology,101170544,PMC8106133,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcl2', 'Clinicopathological characteristics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Prognosis', 'SSTR2']",2021/05/09 06:00,2021/05/13 06:00,['2021/05/08 06:08'],"['2020/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/08 06:08 [entrez]', '2021/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12957-021-02216-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12957-021-02216-3 [pii]']",epublish,World J Surg Oncol. 2021 May 7;19(1):142. doi: 10.1186/s12957-021-02216-3.,20210512,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Somatostatin)', 'D73QL0OMU2 (somatostatin receptor 2)']",IM,"['*Bile Duct Neoplasms/surgery', 'Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic', '*Cholangiocarcinoma/surgery', 'Humans', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Receptors, Somatostatin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Renal allograft recipients are susceptible to opportunistic infections and can acquire human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections even within the allograft. There, HCMV can be found in both the glomerulus and tubular cells, but is mostly restricted to specific and circumscribed sites. Therefore, not all organ infections are identifiable by immunohistology for HCMV proteins in fine needle core biopsies. Thus, we performed a urinalysis study to search for HCMV-specific RNA transcripts in the urine sediment of patients with acute kidney injury. METHODS: Urinary sediment of 90 patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), including 48 renal transplant recipients (RTX) and 42 non-transplant recipients (nRTX), was collected from morning urine for RNA extraction and reverse transcription. The copy number of HCMV transcripts was evaluated using a UL132 HCMV-specific probe set and by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: Of the 48 RTX patients, ten showed HCMV copies in their urine sediment cells. Within this group, three recipients had negative HCMV serology and received an allograft from an HCMV-seropositive donor. In addition, all three RTX patients on a belatacept-based immunosuppressive regimen had HCMV transcripts in their urine. Of the 42 nRTX patients, only two had detectable HCMV transcripts in urine sediment cells and both were under immunosuppression. CONCLUSIONS: Ten immunosuppressed renal allograft recipients and two immunosuppressed non-transplant patients with AKI showed HCMV copies in urine sediment. Thus, HCMV positivity in urinary sediment appears to be associated with immunosuppression. This study describes a novel noninvasive method for detection of HCMV in urinary sediment. Whether all HCMV infections can be detected or only those with viral replication warrants further investigation.","['Pajenda, Sahra', 'Kapps, Sebastian', 'Gerges, Daniela', 'Hoermann, Gregor', 'Wagner, Ludwig', 'Buchtele, Nina', 'Geist, Barbara', 'Strassl, Robert', 'Schmidt, Alice', 'Winnicki, Wolfgang']","['Pajenda S', 'Kapps S', 'Gerges D', 'Hoermann G', 'Wagner L', 'Buchtele N', 'Geist B', 'Strassl R', 'Schmidt A', 'Winnicki W']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, 1090, Vienna, Austria. sahra.pajenda@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, 1090, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, 1090, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, 1090, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image- Guided Therapy, Division of Nuclear Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Clinical Virology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, 1090, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, 1090, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210508,England,BMC Nephrol,BMC nephrology,100967793,PMC8106172,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute kidney injury', '*Cytomegalovirus', '*Immunosuppression', '*Renal transplantation', '*Urinary sediment']",2021/05/09 06:00,2021/05/09 06:00,['2021/05/08 06:07'],"['2021/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/08 06:07 [entrez]', '2021/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12882-021-02377-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12882-021-02377-z [pii]']",epublish,BMC Nephrol. 2021 May 8;22(1):169. doi: 10.1186/s12882-021-02377-z.,,,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the impact of age on remission induction therapy for AML. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 3,011 adult AML patients identified from a nationwide database between January 2007 and December 2011. RESULTS: Three hundred twenty-nine (10.9%) acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and 2,682 (89.1%) non-APL patients were analyzed. The median age was 51 years and 55% of patients were male. Six hundred twenty-three patients (21%) were at favorable risk, 1522 (51%) were at intermediate risk, and 743 (25%) were at poor risk. As the age increased, the proportion of those at favorable risk and who received induction chemotherapy decreased. After induction therapy, complete response (CR) was achieved in 81.5% (243/298) of APL and 62.4% (1,409/2,258) of non-APL patients; these rates decreased as the age increased, with an obvious decrement in those older than 60 years. The median overall survival of non-APL patients was 18.7 months, while that of APL patients was not reached, with a 75% five-year survival rate. CONCLUSIONS: Age impacts both the biology and clinical outcomes of AML patients. Further studies should confirm the role of induction remission chemotherapy by age group.","['Yoo, Kwai Han', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon', 'Min, Yoo Hong', 'Hong, Dae-Sik', 'Lee, Won Sik', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Shin, Ho-Jin', 'Park, Yong', 'Lee, Je-Hwan', 'Kim, Hawk']","['Yoo KH', 'Kim HJ', 'Min YH', 'Hong DS', 'Lee WS', 'Kim HJ', 'Shin HJ', 'Park Y', 'Lee JH', 'Kim H']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3049-9055'],"['Gachon University Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea.', 'Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University College of Medicine, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Soonchunhyang University Hospital, Soonchunhyang University College of Medicine, Bucheon, Korea.', 'Inje University Busan Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', ""Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Pusan National University Hospital, Pusan University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Korea University Anam Hospital, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Gachon University Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210507,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC8104390,,,2021/05/08 06:00,2021/05/08 06:00,['2021/05/07 17:26'],"['2020/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/07 17:26 [entrez]', '2021/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0251011 [doi]', 'PONE-D-20-38695 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2021 May 7;16(5):e0251011. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0251011. eCollection 2021.,20211021,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Remission Induction', 'Republic of Korea', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some genes are repressed, while others are activated. Although many previous studies have analyzed the mechanisms of gene-specific repression and activation, these studies are mainly based on the use of candidate genes, which are either repressed or activated, without simultaneously comparing and contrasting both groups of genes. There is also insufficient consideration of gene locations. Here we describe an integrated machine learning approach, using LASSO-regularized logistic regression, to model gene-specific repression and activation and the underlying contribution of chromatin interactions. LASSO-regularized logistic regression accurately predicted gene-specific transcriptional events and robustly detected the rate-limiting factors that underlie the differences of gene activation and repression. An example was provided by the leukemogenic transcription factor AML1-ETO, which is responsible for 10-15 percent of all acute myeloid leukemia cases. The analysis of AML1-ETO has also revealed novel networks of chromatin interactions and uncovered an unexpected role for E-proteins in AML1-ETO-p300 interactions and a role for the pre-existing gene state in governing the transcriptional response. Our results show that logistic regression-based probabilistic modeling is a promising tool to decipher mechanisms that integrate gene regulation and chromatin interactions in regulated transcription.","['Steinauer, Nickolas', 'Zhang, Kevin', 'Guo, Chun', 'Zhang, Jinsong']","['Steinauer N', 'Zhang K', 'Guo C', 'Zhang J']",,,['eng'],"['R01 HL093195/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA178513/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211208,United States,IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,101196755,PMC8572318,,,2021/05/08 06:00,2021/05/08 06:00,['2021/05/07 17:23'],"['2021/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/08 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/07 17:23 [entrez]']",['10.1109/TCBB.2021.3078128 [doi]'],ppublish,IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform. 2021 Nov-Dec;18(6):2109-2122. doi: 10.1109/TCBB.2021.3078128.

We measured the annual trend in TKI utilization, Medicare gross payment, and patient out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure from 2007 to 2016. METHODS: We used SEER linked to Medicare part-D claims data to identify prevalent CML cases from 2007 to 2016. TKI utilization was measured as the proportion of cases with at least one TKI fill in each year. Average TKI gross payment and median per-member per-month OOP expenditure were calculated from claims data and plotted annually from 2007 to 2016. Year-to-year percent change in gross payment and OOP expenditure was compared with inflation indices. RESULTS: The cohort included 3,189 CML cases with at least one TKI claim. The proportion of prevalent patients with a TKI fill in a year increased from 17.9% in 2007 to 52.8% in 2015. The average annual gross payment per 30-day supply of a TKI increased by an average of 12.8% throughout the period from $9,000 to $10,000 US dollars in 2016. There was no increasing trend in median OOP expenditure per 30-day supply, which varied between $450 and $600 US dollars. CONCLUSION: Rising TKI use and TKI drug prices place considerable financial pressure on Medicare part-D insurers. Although there was no increasing trend in OOP expenditure, it may be burdensome for Medicare patients who are likely retired on a fixed income. Our findings support legislation that mitigates increasing drug prices to protect the Medicare system and its beneficiaries.","['Talon, Brian', 'Calip, Gregory S', 'Lee, Todd A', 'Sharp, Lisa K', 'Patel, Pritesh', 'Touchette, Daniel R']","['Talon B', 'Calip GS', 'Lee TA', 'Sharp LK', 'Patel P', 'Touchette DR']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7660-6549', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7744-3518', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3619-5367', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7809-9042']","['Department of Pharmacy Systems, Outcomes & Policy, University of Illinois at Chicago College of Pharmacy, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Pharmacy Systems, Outcomes & Policy, University of Illinois at Chicago College of Pharmacy, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Pharmacy Systems, Outcomes & Policy, University of Illinois at Chicago College of Pharmacy, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Pharmacy Systems, Outcomes & Policy, University of Illinois at Chicago College of Pharmacy, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Pharmacy Systems, Outcomes & Policy, University of Illinois at Chicago College of Pharmacy, Chicago, IL.']",['eng'],['R21 HL140531/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20210507,United States,JCO Oncol Pract,JCO oncology practice,101758685,,,,2021/05/08 06:00,2021/05/08 06:00,['2021/05/07 17:14'],"['2021/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/08 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/07 17:14 [entrez]']",['10.1200/OP.20.00967 [doi]'],ppublish,JCO Oncol Pract. 2021 Nov;17(11):e1811-e1820. doi: 10.1200/OP.20.00967.

Because they are perceived to be unfit for, unwilling to receive, or unlikely to benefit from conventional chemotherapy they represent an important unmet need. Tosedostat is a selective oral aminopeptidase inhibitor, which in phase I/II trials showed acceptable toxicity and encouraging efficacy. We report the only randomised study of low-dose cytosine arabinoside (LDAC) combined with tosedostat (LDAC-T) versus LDAC in untreated older patients not suitable for intensive treatment. A total of 243 patients were randomised 1:1 as part of the 'Pick-a-Winner' LI-1 trial. There was a statistically non-significant increase in the complete remission (CR) rate with the addition of tosedostat, LDAC-T 19% versus LDAC 12% [odds ratio (OR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-1.23; P = 0.17]. For overall response (CR+CR with incomplete recovery of counts), there was little evidence of a benefit to the addition of tosedostat (25% vs. 18%; OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.37-1.27; P = 0.22). However, overall survival (OS) showed no difference (2-year OS 16% vs. 12%, hazard ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.73-1.28; P = 0.8). Exploratory analyses failed to identify any subgroup benefitting from tosedostat. Despite promising pre-clinical, early non-randomised clinical data with acceptable toxicity and an improvement in response, we did not find evidence that the addition of tosedostat to LDAC produced a survival benefit in this group of patients with AML.

Due to its potent inhibition of Src, Abl, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) family kinases, and other oncogenic kinases, it has been investigated as a targeted therapy for a broad spectrum of cancer types. However, its efficacy has not been significantly extended beyond leukemia. The mechanism of resistance to dasatinib in a wide array of cancers is not clear. In the present study, we investigated the effect of dasatinib on hepatocellular carcinoma cell growth and explored the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that dasatinib potently inhibited the proliferation of SNU-449 cells, but not that of other cell lines, such as SK-Hep-1, even though it inhibited the phosphorylation of Src on both negative and positive regulation sites in all these cells. Dasatinib activated the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase1 (PDK1)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in SK-Hep-1 cells, but not in SNU-449 cells. Blocking the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway strongly promoted the efficacy of dasatinib in SK-Hep-1 cells. In SNU-449 cells, dasatinib promoted apoptosis and the cleavage of caspase-3 and caspase-7, induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, and inhibited the expression of Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK4)/6/CyclinD1 complex. These findings demonstrate that dasatinib exerts its anti-proliferative effect on hepatocellular cell proliferation by blocking the Src family kinases; however, it causes Akt activation, which compromises dasatinib as an anti-cancer drug.","['Liu, Chang', 'Zhu, Xiaoxia', 'Jia, Yuqi', 'Chi, Fenqing', 'Qin, Keru', 'Pei, Jinhong', 'Zhang, Chan', 'Mu, Xiuli', 'Zhang, Hongwei', 'Dong, Xiushan', 'Xu, Jun', 'Yu, Baofeng']","['Liu C', 'Zhu X', 'Jia Y', 'Chi F', 'Qin K', 'Pei J', 'Zhang C', 'Mu X', 'Zhang H', 'Dong X', 'Xu J', 'Yu B']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7865-5419'],"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Changzhi Medical College, Changzhi 046000, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Changzhi Medical College, Changzhi 046000, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030013, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Shanxi Bethune Hospital, Taiyuan 030032, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, The First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.']",['eng'],"['30901821, 82072737/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'No. BS202007/Scientific Research Starting Foundation for Doctor of Changzhi', 'Medical College', '1331KSC/Shanxi ""1331 Project"" Key Subjects Construction, China', '201703D421023/Key R & D Projects in Shanxi Province, China', 'KLMEC/SXMU-202111/Open Fund from Key Laboratory of Cellular Physiology (Shanxi', 'Medical University), Ministry of Education, China', '201701D121165, 201901D111190/Nature science project of Shanxi Province, China', '2020-194/Research Project Supported by Shanxi Scholarship Council of China']",['Journal Article'],,China,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,101206716,,['NOTNLM'],"['Akt-mTOR signaling', 'SK-Hep-1', 'SNU-449', 'dasatinib']",2021/05/08 06:00,2021/08/06 06:00,['2021/05/07 12:48'],"['2020/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/07 12:48 [entrez]']","['6271519 [pii]', '10.1093/abbs/gmab061 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai). 2021 Jul 5;53(7):823-836. doi: 10.1093/abbs/gmab061.,20210805,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Dasatinib/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', '*Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/genetics', '*TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism']","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

Currently, in spite of great advances in radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the prognosis for AML patients with initial treatment failure is still poor. Therefore, the need for novel and efficient therapies to improve AML treatment outcome has become desperately urgent. In this study, we identified the expression of ZEB1 (a transcription factor) and focused on its possible role and mechanisms in the progression of AML. According to the data provided by the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), high expression of ZEB1 closely correlates with poor prognosis in AML patients. Additionally, the overexpression of ZEB1 was observed in both AML patients and cell lines. Further functional experiments showed that ZEB1 depletion can induce AML differentiation and inhibit AML proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, ZEB1 expression was negatively correlated with tumour suppressor P53 expression and ZEB1 can directly bind to P53. Our results also revealed that ZEB1 can regulate PTEN/PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. The inhibitory effect of ZEB1 silencing on PTEN/PI3K/AKT signalling pathway could be significantly reversed by P53 small interfering RNA treatment. Overall, the present data indicated that ZEB1 may be a promising therapeutic target for AML treatment or a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis.","['Li, Lanlan', 'Feng, Yubin', 'Hu, Shuang', 'Du, Yan', 'Xu, Xiaoling', 'Zhang, Meiju', 'Peng, Xiaoqing', 'Chen, Feihu']","['Li L', 'Feng Y', 'Hu S', 'Du Y', 'Xu X', 'Zhang M', 'Peng X', 'Chen F']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7748-8388'],"['The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, China.']",['eng'],"['2017zhyx31/Chen Feihu Central Support for Local-Provincial Translational Medicine', 'Project in 2017', '17030801020/Anhui Science and Technology Major Project']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210507,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,PMC8178252,['NOTNLM'],"['*AKT pathway', '*P53', '*PI3K', '*PTEN', '*ZEB1', '*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*differentiation', '*proliferation']",2021/05/08 06:00,2021/10/01 06:00,['2021/05/07 09:16'],"['2021/03/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/01 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/07 09:16 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.16539 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2021 Jun;25(11):5295-5304. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.16539.

A T8-T9 extramedullary meningioma was diagnosed by MRI, and the patient was referred for excision of the tumour. During the patient's admission, she was noted to have persistent hyperkalaemia which was refractory to treatment. Following a review by an endocrinology team, a diagnosis of pseudohyperkalaemia secondary to thrombocytosis was made. This case demonstrates the importance of promptly identifying patients who are susceptible to pseudohyperkalaemia, in order to prevent its potentially serious consequences. Learning points: Pseudohyperkalaemia should be considered in patients with unexplained or asymptomatic hyperkalaemia. It should also be considered in those patients who are resistant to the classical treatment of hyperkalaemia. A diagnosis of pseudohyperkalaemia is considered when there is a difference of >0.4 mmol/L of potassium between serum and plasma potassium in the absence of symptoms and ECG changes. In patients who are presenting with consistently elevated serum potassium levels, it may be beneficial to take venous blood gas and/ or plasma potassium levels to rule out pseudohyperkalaemia. Pseudohyperkalaemia may subject patients to iatrogenic hypokalaemia which can be potentially fatal. Pseudohyperkalaemia can occur secondary to thrombocytosis, red cell haemolysis due to improper blood letting techniques, leukaemia and lymphoma.","['Mizzi, Jean Marc', 'Rizzo, Christopher', 'Fava, Stephen']","['Mizzi JM', 'Rizzo C', 'Fava S']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1472-8022'],"['Mater Dei Hospital of Malta, Department of Medicine, Msida, Malta.', 'Mater Dei Hospital of Malta, Department of Medicine, Msida, Malta.', 'Mater Dei Hospital of Malta, Department of Medicine, Msida, Malta.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210401,England,Endocrinol Diabetes Metab Case Rep,"Endocrinology, diabetes & metabolism case reports",101618943,PMC8115417,,,2021/05/08 06:00,2021/05/08 06:00,['2021/05/07 09:02'],"['2021/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/08 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/07 09:02 [entrez]']","['10.1530/EDM-21-0013 [doi]', 'EDM210013 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Endocrinol Diabetes Metab Case Rep. 2021 Apr 1;2021. pii: EDM210013. doi: 10.1530/EDM-21-0013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cancer cells, the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway elements have been recognized to protect tumor cells from various stresses and cause tumor progression; targeting these DDR members is an attractive strategy for treatment of cancers. The inhibition of the DDR pathway in cancer cells for the treatment of cancers has recently been introduced. Hence, effective treatment strategies are needed for this purpose. Chemotherapy in combination with radiotherapy is considered a potential therapeutic strategy for acute leukemia. This review aims to assess the synergistic effects of these inhibitors with irradiation for the treatment of leukemia.","['Katoueezadeh, Maryam', 'Pilehvari, Niloofar', 'Fatemi, Ahmad', 'Hassanshahi, Gholamhossein', 'Torabizadeh, Seyedeh Atekeh']","['Katoueezadeh M', 'Pilehvari N', 'Fatemi A', 'Hassanshahi G', 'Torabizadeh SA']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9869-0147', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4829-1586', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1245-984X']","['Department of Hematology & Medical Laboratory Science, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, 7616911333, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology & Medical Laboratory Science, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, 7616911333, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology & Medical Laboratory Science, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, 7616911333, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, 7718796755, Iran.', 'Pharmaceutics Research Center, Institute of Neuropharmacology, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, 7616911319, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210507,England,Future Oncol,"Future oncology (London, England)",101256629,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage', 'DNA damage response', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'radiation', 'response pathway inhibitors']",2021/05/08 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/05/07 08:45'],"['2021/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/07 08:45 [entrez]']",['10.2217/fon-2020-1072 [doi]'],ppublish,Future Oncol. 2021 Jul;17(21):2803-2816. doi: 10.2217/fon-2020-1072.

Here, we report that turning on human CDX2 expression in the hematopoietic lineage of mice induces acute monoblastic leukemia, characterized by the decrease in erythroid and lymphoid cells at the benefit of immature monocytic and granulocytic cells. One of the highly stimulated genes in leukemic bone marrow cells was BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (Bambi), an inhibitor of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling. The CDX2 protein was shown to bind to and activate the transcription of the human BAMBI promoter. Moreover, in a leukemic cell line established from CDX2-expressing mice, reducing the levels of CDX2 or Bambi stimulated the TGF-beta-dependent expression of Cd11b, a marker of monocyte maturation. Taken together, this work demonstrates the strong oncogenic potential of the homeobox gene CDX2 in the hematopoietic lineage, in contrast with its physiological tumor suppressor activity exerted in the gut. It also reveals, through BAMBI and TGF-beta signaling, the involvement of CDX2 in the perturbation of the interactions between leukemia cells and their microenvironment.","['Galland, Ava', 'Gourain, Victor', 'Habbas, Karima', 'Guler, Yonca', 'Martin, Elisabeth', 'Ebel, Claudine', 'Tavian, Manuela', 'Vallat, Laurent', 'Chenard, Marie-Pierre', 'Mauvieux, Laurent', 'Freund, Jean-Noel', 'Duluc, Isabelle', 'Domon-Dell, Claire']","['Galland A', 'Gourain V', 'Habbas K', 'Guler Y', 'Martin E', 'Ebel C', 'Tavian M', 'Vallat L', 'Chenard MP', 'Mauvieux L', 'Freund JN', 'Duluc I', 'Domon-Dell C']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6483-0738', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3764-8164', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4746-3240', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5226-7706', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1912-9739', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9043-1845', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0971-3774', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8396-6385', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8445-9593']","['Universite de Strasbourg, Inserm, IRFAC / UMR-S1113, FHU ARRIMAGE, ITI InnoVec, FMTS, Strasbourg, France.', 'Institute of Biological and Chemical Systems, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany.', 'Universite de Strasbourg, Inserm, IRFAC / UMR-S1113, FHU ARRIMAGE, ITI InnoVec, FMTS, Strasbourg, France.', 'Universite de Strasbourg, Inserm, IRFAC / UMR-S1113, FHU ARRIMAGE, ITI InnoVec, FMTS, Strasbourg, France.', 'Universite de Strasbourg, Inserm, IRFAC / UMR-S1113, FHU ARRIMAGE, ITI InnoVec, FMTS, Strasbourg, France.', 'Inserm, IGBMC, UMR-S 1258, Universite de Strasbourg, Illkirch, France.', 'Universite de Strasbourg, Inserm, IRFAC / UMR-S1113, FHU ARRIMAGE, ITI InnoVec, FMTS, Strasbourg, France.', 'Universite de Strasbourg, Inserm, IRFAC / UMR-S1113, FHU ARRIMAGE, ITI InnoVec, FMTS, Strasbourg, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Strasbourg, France."", 'Departement de Pathologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Strasbourg, France.', 'Universite de Strasbourg, Inserm, IRFAC / UMR-S1113, FHU ARRIMAGE, ITI InnoVec, FMTS, Strasbourg, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Strasbourg, France."", 'Universite de Strasbourg, Inserm, IRFAC / UMR-S1113, FHU ARRIMAGE, ITI InnoVec, FMTS, Strasbourg, France.', 'Universite de Strasbourg, Inserm, IRFAC / UMR-S1113, FHU ARRIMAGE, ITI InnoVec, FMTS, Strasbourg, France.', 'Universite de Strasbourg, Inserm, IRFAC / UMR-S1113, FHU ARRIMAGE, ITI InnoVec, FMTS, Strasbourg, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210626,United States,Mol Oncol,Molecular oncology,101308230,PMC8410536,['NOTNLM'],"['*BAMBI', '*acute monoblastic leukemia', '*ectopic expression', '*oncogene', '*tumor suppressor']",2021/05/08 06:00,2021/05/08 06:00,['2021/05/07 07:41'],"['2021/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/08 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/07 07:41 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1878-0261.12982 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Oncol. 2021 Sep;15(9):2318-2329. doi: 10.1002/1878-0261.12982.

However, mesenchymal elements in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) were poorly investigated. By utilizing a parallel RNA-sequencing method, we investigated the transcriptional profile and functional defects of primary BM MSCs from patients with CMML for the first time. Within a 24-patient cohort, transcriptional and functional analysis reveals a prominent enrichment of WNT/beta-catenin signalling and multiple biology processes. Deregulated expression of WNT/beta-catnin factors CTNNB1, CMYC, LEF1, and FRZB is associated with impaired proliferation, senescence phenotype, and abnormal secretion in CMML MSCs. The impaired ability to support healthy CD34(+) haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) correlates with activation of WNT/beta-catenin signalling in CMML MSCs. Furthermore, we observed an association between WNT/beta-catenin factors and treatment response to hypomethylating agents (HMAs) in a cohort of patients with MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Taken together, our study provides evidence for transcriptional and functional abnormalities in CMML MSCs, and suggests potential prognostic value of evaluating WNT/beta-catenin signalling in patients with CMML.","['Xu, Ruohao', 'Huang, Xin', 'Li, Chao', 'Deng, Chengxin', 'Li, Minming', 'Wu, Ping', 'Geng, Suxia', 'Lai, Peilong', 'Lu, Zesheng', 'Weng, Jianyu', 'Du, Xin']","['Xu R', 'Huang X', 'Li C', 'Deng C', 'Li M', 'Wu P', 'Geng S', 'Lai P', 'Lu Z', 'Weng J', 'Du X']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9961-2549', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2648-9433']","[""Department of Hematology, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510080, P.R.

Asparagine synthetase (ASNS) and the basic region leucine zipper activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) mediate the anti-leukemic effect of ASNase. Only a few reports studied the association between polymorphisms in these genes and treatment-related toxicity and response. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the association of ASNS and ATF5 polymorphisms with the susceptibility to ASNase-related toxicity and disease outcome in a population of childhood ALL Egyptian patients. METHODS: In this study, 88 children with ALL were enrolled and genotyped for ASNS T629A and ATF5 C362T polymorphisms using allelic discrimination assay. RESULTS: The studied polymorphisms did not associate with hypersensitivity or thrombosis, while the ATF5 C362T polymorphism was associated significantly with decreased ASNase-associated pancreatitis (AAP) risk under the dominant model. Patients carrying TT/CT genotypes of ATF5 C362T polymorphism had a significantly better overall survival (OS) and longer event-free survival (EFS) compared to patients with CC genotype. Multivariate analysis confirmed the independent prognostic value of the ATF5 C362T dominant model. CONCLUSION: ATF5 362TT and CT genotypes were associated with decreased risk to develop AAP and better disease outcome demonstrating a low risk for events and superior survival.","['Youssef, Yomna H', 'Makkeyah, Sara M', 'Soliman, Ahmed F', 'Meky, Nefissa H']","['Youssef YH', 'Makkeyah SM', 'Soliman AF', 'Meky NH']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8401-1553'],"['Zoology Department, Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Pediatrics Department, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt. ahmed.fathi@sci.asu.edu.eg.', 'Zoology Department, Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210507,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Asparagine synthetase (ASNS)', '*Basic region leucine zipper activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5)', '*Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (childhood ALL)', '*Polymorphism', '*Toxicity']",2021/05/08 06:00,2021/09/18 06:00,['2021/05/07 07:20'],"['2021/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/18 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/07 07:20 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-021-04290-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-021-04290-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2021 Aug;88(2):313-321. doi: 10.1007/s00280-021-04290-6.

It is unclear when during the neurogenic period Mcl-1 becomes necessary for NPC survival and whether Bax is the sole pro-apoptotic target of Mcl-1. To address these questions, we used the nervous system-specific Nestin-Cre Mcl-1 conditional knockout mouse line (Mcl-1 CKO) to assess the anti-apoptotic role of Mcl-1 in developmental neurogenesis. Loss of Mcl-1 resulted in a wave of apoptosis beginning in the brainstem and cervical spinal cord at embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) and in the forebrain at E10.5. Apoptosis was first observed ventrally in each region and spread dorsally over time. Within the spinal cord, apoptosis also spread in a rostral to caudal direction following the path of differentiation. Breeding the Mcl-1 CKO mouse with the Bax null mouse rescued the majority of NPC from apoptosis except in the dorsomedial brainstem and ventral thoracic spinal cord where only 50% were rescued. This demonstrates that Mcl-1 promotes NPC survival primarily by inhibiting the activation of Bax, but that Bax is not the sole pro-apoptotic target of Mcl-1 during embryonic neurogenesis. Interestingly, although co-deletion of Bax rescued the majority of NPC apoptosis, it resulted in embryonic lethality at E13, whereas conditional deletion of both Mcl-1 and Bax rescued embryonic lethality. In summary, this study demonstrates the widespread dependency on Mcl-1 during nervous system development.","['Flemmer, Robert T', 'Connolly, Sarah P', 'Geizer, Brittany A', 'Opferman, Joseph T', 'Vanderluit, Jacqueline L']","['Flemmer RT', 'Connolly SP', 'Geizer BA', 'Opferman JT', 'Vanderluit JL']",,"[""Division of BioMedical Sciences, Memorial University, St. John's, NL, Canada."", ""Division of BioMedical Sciences, Memorial University, St. John's, NL, Canada."", ""Division of BioMedical Sciences, Memorial University, St. John's, NL, Canada."", ""Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, United States."", ""Division of BioMedical Sciences, Memorial University, St. John's, NL, Canada.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210420,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,PMC8093775,['NOTNLM'],"['Bax', 'Bcl-2', 'cell death', 'development', 'nervous system', 'neurogenesis']",2021/05/08 06:00,2021/05/08 06:01,['2021/05/07 07:15'],"['2021/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/07 07:15 [entrez]', '2021/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.659531 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Apr 20;9:659531. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.659531. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Flemmer, Connolly, Geizer, Opferman and Vanderluit.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, an experimental study was conducted to evaluate the leukocytes' number alteration and oxidative stress in the lung and blood of HTLV-1-infected BALB/c mice, which could be of benefit for the recognition of HTLV-1 mechanism in the induction of pulmonary disorders. Materials and Methods: Twenty female BALB/c mice were divided into two groups of control and HTLV-1-infected animals. The HTLV-1-infected group was inoculated with 10(6) MT-2 HTLV-1-infected cells. Two months later, the infection was confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction, and then lung pathological changes, total and differential inflammatory cell counts in the blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), along with oxidative stress biomarker levels in the BALF and lung tissue were evaluated. Results: In the HTLV-1-infected group, the peribronchitis score (P < 0.01), the number of total leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes (P < 0.05) in the blood and BALF were increased. The number of eosinophils in the blood of the HTLV-1-infected group was higher than in the control group (P < 0.01), whereas the number of basophils of BALF was increased in the HTLV-1-infected group (P < 0.001). The lung and BALF oxidative stress results showed that the MDA level was increased, while the total thiol level and superoxide dismutase activity were decreased in the HTLV-1-infected group (P < 0.01). Conclusion: The HTLV-1 infection seems to induce pulmonary inflammatory reactions by recruiting leukocytes as well as inducing oxidative stress in the lung tissue.","['Hedayati-Moghadam, Mahdiyeh', 'Rezaee, S A Rahim', 'Boskabady, Mohammad Hossein', 'Mohamadian Roshan, Nema', 'Saadat, Saeideh', 'Bavarsad, Kowsar', 'Niazmand, Saeed']","['Hedayati-Moghadam M', 'Rezaee SAR', 'Boskabady MH', 'Mohamadian Roshan N', 'Saadat S', 'Bavarsad K', 'Niazmand S']",,"['Student Research Committee, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Jiroft University of Medical Sciences, Jiroft, Iran.', 'Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Division of Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology, Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210130,India,Adv Biomed Res,Advanced biomedical research,101586897,PMC8095261,['NOTNLM'],"['BALB/c', 'Human T Cell Leukemia Virus I', 'Mice', 'bronchoalveolar', 'oxidative stress']",2021/05/08 06:00,2021/05/08 06:01,['2021/05/07 07:15'],"['2020/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/07 07:15 [entrez]', '2021/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/abr.abr_117_20 [doi]', 'ABR-10-6 [pii]']",epublish,Adv Biomed Res. 2021 Jan 30;10:6. doi: 10.4103/abr.abr_117_20. eCollection 2021.,,,,,['Copyright: (c) 2021 Advanced Biomedical Research.'],,,,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to evaluate neurocognitive and behavioral functioning in a relatively young cohort of survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Hong Kong, and to identify clinical and socio-environmental factors associated with these outcomes. Methods: This analysis included 152 survivors of childhood ALL who were >/=5 years post-diagnosis (52% male, mean [SD] age 23.5[7.2] years at evaluation, 17.2[7.6] years post-diagnosis). Survivors completed performance-based neurocognitive tests, and reported their emotional and behavioral symptoms using the Child/Adult Behavior Checklist. Socio-environmental variables (living space, fatigue, physical activity, family functioning, and academic stress) were self-reported using validated questionnaires. Clinical variables and chronic health conditions were extracted from medical charts. Multivariable linear modeling was conducted to test identify factors associated with neurocognitive/behavioral outcomes, adjusting for current age, sex, age at diagnosis and cranial radiation. An exploratory mediation analysis was performed to examine the mediating effects of risk factors on neurocognitive and behavioral outcomes. Results: As compared to population norms, a minority of survivors developed mild-moderate impairment in motor processing speed (36.2%), memory (9.2%) and attention measures (4.0%-10.5%). Survivors also reported attention problems (12.5%), sluggish cognitive tempo (23.7%) and internalizing (depressive, anxiety and somatic symptoms) problems (17.1%). A minority of survivors developed mild-moderate treatment-related chronic conditions (n=37, 24.3%). As compared to survivors without chronic conditions, survivors with chronic conditions had more executive dysfunction (B=5.09, standard error [SE]=2.05; P=0.014) and reported more attention problems (B=5.73, SE=1.43; P<0.0001). Fatigue and poor family functioning was associated with multiple measures of behavior problems (all P<0.001). A lower level of physical activity was correlated with more self-reported symptoms of inattention (B= -1.12, SE=0.38, P=0.004) and sluggish cognitive tempo (B=-1.22, SE=0.41, P=0.003). Exploratory analysis showed that chronic health conditions were associated with behavioral measures through fatigue as the mediator. Conclusion: The majority of young Chinese survivors of ALL had normal cognitive and behavioral function. Regular monitoring of behavioral function should be performed on survivors who develop treatment-related chronic conditions. Health behavior and socio-environment factors may be potentially modifiable risk factors associated with health outcomes in survivors.","['Peng, Liwen', 'Yang, Lok Sum', 'Yam, Perri', 'Lam, Chun Sing', 'Chan, Agnes Sui-Yin', 'Li, Chi Kong', 'Cheung, Yin Ting']","['Peng L', 'Yang LS', 'Yam P', 'Lam CS', 'Chan AS', 'Li CK', 'Cheung YT']",,"['School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Neuropsychology Laboratory, Department of Psychology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Chanwuyi Research Center for Neuropsychological Well-Being, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Hong Kong Hub of Paediatric Excellence, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', ""Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The Hong Kong Children's Hospital, Hong Kong, China."", 'School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210420,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC8093634,['NOTNLM'],"['behavior', 'childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'childhood cancer', 'cognitive', 'function', 'survivorship']",2021/05/08 06:00,2021/05/08 06:01,['2021/05/07 07:14'],"['2021/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/07 07:14 [entrez]', '2021/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.655669 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Apr 20;11:655669. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.655669. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Peng, Yang, Yam, Lam, Chan, Li and Cheung.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lack of data from Asian patients led us to conduct this study. Methods: We retrospectively studied outcomes of 106 patients in CR1 undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) with reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) based on their exposure to pre-transplant consolidation chemotherapy. There were 35 in the no consolidation group versus 71 in the consolidation group. Results: The median relapse free survival (RFS) was 9 months for the no consolidation group and 51 months for consolidation group (p = 0.023). The median overall survival was 32 months for the no consolidation group and not reached for the consolidation group (p = 0.034). Multivariate analysis recognized consolidation and poor cytogenetics as adverse prognostic factors for RFS. Moreover, RFS was better in patients with a shorter time lapse between last chemotherapy and alloSCT in both the no consolidation group and the consolidation group. Consolidation chemotherapy did not negatively affect neutrophil and platelet engraftment, infection rates, or acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) incidence. On the other hand, patients undergoing consolidation chemotherapy showed trends towards a more severe degree of chronic GVHD. Conclusion: The exposure to consolidation chemotherapy in CR1 prior to alloSCT with RIC conditioning did not negatively impact the outcomes in Korean AML patients, for whom a suitable donor is rarely immediately available. Therefore, post-remission consolidation chemotherapy is a reasonable option if required.","['Byun, Ja Min', 'Shin, Dong-Yeop', 'Koh, Youngil', 'Hong, Junshik', 'Kim, Inho', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo', 'Bang, Soo-Mee', 'Lee, Jeong-Ok']","['Byun JM', 'Shin DY', 'Koh Y', 'Hong J', 'Kim I', 'Yoon SS', 'Bang SM', 'Lee JO']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1780-5553'],"['Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 82 Gumi-ro, 173 Beon-gil, Bundang-gu, Seongnam 463-707, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210420,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,PMC8060779,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'complete remission', 'post-remission chemotherapy', 'reduced intensity']",2021/05/08 06:00,2021/05/08 06:01,['2021/05/07 07:12'],"['2021/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/07 07:12 [entrez]', '2021/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/20406207211001135 [doi]', '10.1177_20406207211001135 [pii]']",epublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2021 Apr 20;12:20406207211001135. doi: 10.1177/20406207211001135. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['(c) The Author(s), 2021.']",,,,,"['Conflict of interest statement: The authors declare that there is no conflict of', 'interest.']",,,,,,['Ther Adv Hematol. 2021 Jun 23;12:20406207211027370.

It was reported that colon cancer carcinoma specimens contain a subset of leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5)-expressing stem cells, these so-called ""tumour-initiating"" cells, reminiscent in their properties of the normal intestinal stem cells (ISCs), may explain the apparent heterogeneity of colon cancer cell lines. Also, colon cancer is initiated by aberrant Wnt signaling in ISCs known to express high levels of LGR5. Furthermore, in vivo reports demonstrate the clonal expansion of intestinal adenomas from a single LGR5-expressing cell. AIM: To investigate whether colon cancer cell lines contain cancer stem cells and to characterize these putative cancer stem cells. METHODS: A portable fluorescent reporter construct based on a conserved fragment of the LGR5 promoter was used to isolate the cell compartments expressing different levels of LGR5 in two widely used colon cancer cell lines (Caco-2 and LoVo). These cells were then characterized according to their proliferation capacity, gene expression signatures of ISC markers, and their tumorigenic properties in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: The data revealed that the LGR5 reporter can be used to identify and isolate a classical intestinal crypt stem cell-like population from the Caco-2, but not from the LoVo, cell lines, in which the cancer stem cell population is more akin to B lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region 1 homolog (+4 crypt) stem cells. This sub-population within Caco-2 cells exhibits an intestinal cancer stem cell gene expression signature and can both self-renew and generate differentiated LGR5 negative progeny. Our data also show that cells expressing high levels of LGR5/enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) from this cell line exhibit tumorigenic-like properties in vivo and in vitro. In contrast, cell compartments of LoVo that are expressing high levels of LGR5/EYFP did not show these stem cell-like properties. Thus, cells that exhibit high levels of LGR5/EYFP expression represent the cancer stem cell compartment of Caco-2 colon cancer cells, but not LoVo cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the presence of a spectrum of different ISC-like compartments in different colon cancer cell lines. Their existence is an important consideration for their screening applications and should be taken into account when interpreting drug screening data. We have generated a portable LGR5-reporter that serves as a valuable tool for the identification and isolation of different colon cancer stem cell populations in colon cancer lines.","['Alharbi, Samah Abdulaali', 'Ovchinnikov, Dmitry A', 'Wolvetang, Ernst']","['Alharbi SA', 'Ovchinnikov DA', 'Wolvetang E']",,"['Physiology Department, College of Medicine, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah 24231, Saudi Arabia.', 'Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, The University of Queensland, Brisbane 4072, QLD, Australia.', 'Department of Stem Cell Engineering Group, Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, The University of Queensland, Brisbane 4072, QLD, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,World J Gastroenterol,World journal of gastroenterology,100883448,PMC8058648,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer stem cell', 'Colon cancer cell lines', 'Colorectal cancer', 'Heterogenicity', 'Intestinal stem cell', 'Leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5']",2021/05/08 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2021/05/07 07:07'],"['2020/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2021/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/07 07:07 [entrez]', '2021/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3748/wjg.v27.i15.1578 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Gastroenterol. 2021 Apr 21;27(15):1578-1594. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v27.i15.1578.,20210514,"['0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Caco-2 Cells', '*Colonic Neoplasms/genetics', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leucine', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/genetics/metabolism']","['(c)The Author(s) 2021.

Here we present an extended-representation bisulfite sequencing (XRBS) method for targeted profiling of DNA methylation. Our design strikes a balance between expanding coverage of regulatory elements and reproducibly enriching informative CpG dinucleotides in promoters, enhancers and CTCF binding sites.

Application of XRBS to single leukemia cells enabled us to evaluate genetic copy number variations and methylation variability across individual cells. Our analysis highlights heterochromatic H3K9me3 regions as having the highest cell-to-cell variability in their methylation, likely reflecting inherent epigenetic instability of these late-replicating regions, compounded by differences in cell cycle stages among sampled cells.","['Shareef, Sarah J', 'Bevill, Samantha M', 'Raman, Ayush T', 'Aryee, Martin J', 'van Galen, Peter', 'Hovestadt, Volker', 'Bernstein, Bradley E']","['Shareef SJ', 'Bevill SM', 'Raman AT', 'Aryee MJ', 'van Galen P', 'Hovestadt V', 'Bernstein BE']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6848-1344', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0735-1570', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3480-6649', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5726-6278']","['Department of Pathology and Center for Cancer Research, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Center for Cancer Research, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Center for Cancer Research, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Center for Cancer Research, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

Suppression of the RNA N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A)-reader enzyme YTH N(6)-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2 (YTHDF2) specifically compromises cancer stem cells in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but promotes hematopoietic stem cell expansion without derailing normal hematopoiesis. However, the relevance of expression between AML1/ETO-HIF1alpha loop and YTHDF2, and its functional relationship with t(8;21) AML have not been documented. Here, we show that YTHDF2 is highly expressed in t(8;21) AML patients and associated with a higher risk of relapse and inferior relapse-free survival. Knockdown of YTHDF2 in leukemia cells causes an impaired cell proliferation rate in vitro and in mice. Mechanistically, HIF1alpha is able to bind to the hypoxia-response elements of the 5'-untranslated region of the YTHDF2 gene and promotes the transactivity of the YTHDF2 promoter. Knockdown and overexpression of either AML1/ETO or HIF1alpha resulted in decreased and increased YTHDF2 protein and mRNA expression in t(8;21) AML cells. In particular, knockdown of YTHDF2 resulted in increased global mRNA m(6)A levels in t(8;21) AML cells, accompanied by increased TNF receptor superfamily member 1b (TNFRSF1b) mRNA and protein expression levels. Last, we demonstrated that the m(6)A methylation and expression levels of the TNFRSF1b gene were both negatively correlated with HIF1alpha expression levels. In conclusion, YTHDF2 is a downstream target of the AML1/ETO-HIF1alpha loop and promotes cell proliferation probably by modulating the global m(6)A methylation in t(8;21) AML.","['Chen, Ze', 'Shao, Yang-Liu', 'Wang, Li-Li', 'Lin, Ji', 'Zhang, Ji-Bin', 'Ding, Yi', 'Gao, Bin-Bin', 'Liu, Dai-Hong', 'Gao, Xiao-Ning']","['Chen Z', 'Shao YL', 'Wang LL', 'Lin J', 'Zhang JB', 'Ding Y', 'Gao BB', 'Liu DH', 'Gao XN']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3334-9113', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2035-7472']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Basic Medicine, Graduate School, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China. daihongrm@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China. gaoxn@263.net.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210506,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,,,2021/05/08 06:00,2022/01/13 06:00,['2021/05/07 07:01'],"['2020/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/07 07:01 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-021-01818-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-021-01818-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2021 Jun;40(22):3786-3798. doi: 10.1038/s41388-021-01818-1.

Here, we have characterized a group of natural sesquiterpene lactones (STLs), previously shown to suppress MYB activity, for their potential to decrease AML cell proliferation. Unlike what was initially thought, these compounds inhibit MYB indirectly via its cooperation partner C/EBPbeta. C/EBPbeta-inhibitory STLs affect the expression of a large number of MYB-regulated genes, suggesting that the cooperation of MYB and C/EBPbeta broadly shapes the transcriptional program of AML cells. We show that expression of GFI1, a direct MYB target gene, is controlled cooperatively by MYB, C/EBPbeta, and co-activator p300, and is down-regulated by C/EBPbeta-inhibitory STLs, exemplifying that they target the activity of composite MYB-C/EBPbeta-p300 transcriptional modules. Ectopic expression of GFI1, a zinc-finger protein that is required for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, partially abrogated STL-induced myelomonocytic differentiation, implicating GFI1 as a relevant target of C/EBPbeta-inhibitory STLs. Overall, our data identify C/EBPbeta as a pro-leukemogenic factor in AML and suggest that targeting of C/EBPbeta may have therapeutic potential against AML.","['Yusenko, Maria V', 'Trentmann, Amke', 'Casolari, Debora A', 'Abdel Ghani, Luca', 'Lenz, Mairin', 'Horn, Melanie', 'Dorner, Wolfgang', 'Klempnauer, Stefan', 'Mootz, Henning D', 'Arteaga, Maria Francisca', 'Mikesch, Jan-Henrik', ""D'Andrea, Richard J"", 'Gonda, Thomas J', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Schmidt, Thomas J', 'Klempnauer, Karl-Heinz']","['Yusenko MV', 'Trentmann A', 'Casolari DA', 'Abdel Ghani L', 'Lenz M', 'Horn M', 'Dorner W', 'Klempnauer S', 'Mootz HD', 'Arteaga MF', 'Mikesch JH', ""D'Andrea RJ"", 'Gonda TJ', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Schmidt TJ', 'Klempnauer KH']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7105-356X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7166-5232', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2634-9705', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5239-7690']","['Institute for Biochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute for Biochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, Munster, Germany.', 'Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology and University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Institute for Biochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute for Pharmaceutical Biology and Phytochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Hematology, Oncology, Rheumatology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute for Biochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Mathematics, Ruhr-Universitat, Bochum, Germany.', 'Institute for Biochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, Munster, Germany.', 'Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology and University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Cancer Research Institute, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Department of Medicine V, Hematology, Oncology, Rheumatology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute for Pharmaceutical Biology and Phytochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute for Biochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, Munster, Germany. klempna@uni-muenster.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210506,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,PMC8298201,,,2021/05/08 06:00,2021/12/24 06:00,['2021/05/07 07:01'],"['2020/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/07 07:01 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-021-01800-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-021-01800-x [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2021 Jul;40(29):4746-4758. doi: 10.1038/s41388-021-01800-x.

More than 95% of patients with this disease belong to typical APL, which express PML-RARA and are sensitive to differentiation induction therapy containing all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO), and they exhibit an excellent clinical outcome. Compared to typical APL, variant APL showed quite different aspects, and how to recognize, diagnose, and treat variant APL remained still challenged at present. Herein, we drew the genetic landscape of variant APL according to recent progresses, then discussed how they contributed to generate APL, and further shared our clinical experiences about variant APL treatment. In practice, when APL phenotype was exhibited but PML-RARA and t(15;17) were negative, variant APL needed to be considered, and fusion gene screen as well as RNA-sequencing should be displayed for making the diagnosis as soon as possible. Strikingly, we found that besides of RARA rearrangements, RARB or RARG rearrangements also generated the phenotype of APL. In addition, some MLL rearrangements, NPM1 rearrangements or others could also drove variant APL in absence of RARA/RARB/RARG rearrangements. These results indicated that one great heterogeneity existed in the genetics of variant APL. Among them, only NPM1-RARA, NUMA-RARA, FIP1L1-RARA, IRF2BP2-RARA, and TFG-RARA have been demonstrated to be sensitive to ATRA, so combined chemotherapy rather than differentiation induction therapy was the standard care for variant APL and these patients would benefit from the quick switch between them. If ATRA-sensitive RARA rearrangement was identified, ATRA could be added back for re-induction of differentiation. Through this review, we hoped to provide one integrated view on the genetic landscape of variant APL and helped to remove the barriers for managing this type of disease.","['Zhang, Xiang', 'Sun, Jiewen', 'Yu, Wenjuan', 'Jin, Jie']","['Zhang X', 'Sun J', 'Yu W', 'Jin J']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8166-9915'],"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University College of Medicine, #79 Qingchun Rd, Zhejiang, 310003, Hangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang University Cancer Center, Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China.', 'Center Laboratory, Affiliated Secondary Hospital, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University College of Medicine, #79 Qingchun Rd, Zhejiang, 310003, Hangzhou, China. drwjyu1977@zju.edu.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China. drwjyu1977@zju.edu.cn.', 'Zhejiang University Cancer Center, Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China. drwjyu1977@zju.edu.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University College of Medicine, #79 Qingchun Rd, Zhejiang, 310003, Hangzhou, China. jiej0503@zju.edu.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China. jiej0503@zju.edu.cn.', 'Zhejiang University Cancer Center, Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China. jiej0503@zju.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['81800199/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81670124/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'LY21H080003/Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province', 'LQ21H160010/Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210506,England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,PMC8101136,['NOTNLM'],"['Genetic landscape', 'Management', 'Variant acute promyelocytic leukemia']",2021/05/08 06:00,2021/05/08 06:01,['2021/05/07 06:21'],"['2021/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/07 06:21 [entrez]', '2021/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40364-021-00284-x [doi]', '10.1186/s40364-021-00284-x [pii]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2021 May 6;9(1):33. doi: 10.1186/s40364-021-00284-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pediatric AML commonly has genetic rearrangements which involve chromosome 11q23 in 15-20% of cases, and these genetic abnormalities have been associated with a poorer prognosis (Grimwade et al. in Blood 92:2322-2333, 1998; Raimondi et al. in Blood 94:3707-3716, 1999; Lie et al. in Br J Haematol 122: 217-225). MLL rearrangements in AML have been shown to have multiple different fusion partners (Meyer et al. in Leukemia 23:1490-1499). Heterogeneity of these cytogenetic abnormalities makes it difficult to determine how to approach patients from a treatment standpoint. This difficulty is further complicated when patients have more than a single MLL rearrangement. CASE PRESENTATION: A 10-year-old Caucasian girl presented with easy bruising and was found to have acute myeloid leukemia. Her cytogenetics showed two different MLL rearrangements, t(9;11)(p22;q23) and t(11;19)(q23;p13.3). At initial presentation she had no other cytogenetic findings. She responded well to initial therapy and achieved remission following the first induction cycle and completed four rounds of chemotherapy. She subsequently had a relapse of her AML, and her cytogenetics were consistent with a single MLL rearrangement, t(9;11)(p22;q23), in addition to monosomy 7. She was treated with reduction therapy and a haplo-identical bone marrow transplant but ultimately succumbed to her disease. CONCLUSION: MLL rearrangements are common in AML, but clinical significance continues to be elusive, and there is conflicting data on the prognostic significance. In the setting of multiple MLL rearrangements, there is concern for reduced survival, although treatment modifications are not currently done in this setting. This report details a case with multiple MLL rearrangements that initially responded to therapy but ultimately had disease progression with a selection of a leukemic clone containing a single MLL rearrangement.","['McGrath, Mary', 'Smink, Gayle']","['McGrath M', 'Smink G']",,"['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Penn State College of Medicine and Penn State Children's Hospital, 500 University Drive, Mail Code H085, Hershey, PA, USA. gsmink@pennstatehealth.psu.edu.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20210507,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,PMC8103755,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Leukemia', 'Mixed-lineage leukemia']",2021/05/08 06:00,2021/05/13 06:00,['2021/05/07 06:19'],"['2020/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/07 06:19 [entrez]', '2021/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13256-021-02841-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s13256-021-02841-2 [pii]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2021 May 7;15(1):228. doi: 10.1186/s13256-021-02841-2.,20210512,"['149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Child', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', '*Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple RBC transfusions cause secondary iron overload and subsequent excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which leads to mutations, cell death, organ failure, and inferior disease outcomes. We hypothesize that iron loading promotes AML development by increasing oxidative stress and disrupting important signaling pathways in the bone marrow cells (BMCs). Conversely, iron chelation therapy (ICT) may reduce AML risk by lowering iron burden in the iron-loaded animals. METHODS: We utilized a radiation-induced acute myeloid leukemia (RI-AML) animal model. Iron overload was introduced via intraperitoneal injection of iron dextran, and iron chelation via oral gavage of deferasirox. A total of 86 irradiated B6D2F1 mice with various levels of iron burden were monitored for leukemia development over a period of 70 weeks. The Kaplan-Meier estimator was utilized to assess AML free survival. In addition, a second cohort of 30 mice was assigned for early analysis at 5 and 7 months post-irradiation. The BMCs of the early cohort were assessed for alterations of signaling pathways, DNA damage response and gene expression. Statistical significance was established using Student's t-test or ANOVA. RESULTS: Iron loading in irradiated B6D2F1 mice accelerated RI-AML development. However, there was a progressive decrease in AML risk for irradiated mice with increase in iron burden from 7.5 to 15 to 30 mg. In addition, ICT decreased AML incidence in the 7.5 mg iron-loaded irradiated mice, while AML onset was earlier for the 30 mg iron-loaded irradiated mice that received ICT. Furthermore, analysis of BMCs from irradiated mice at earlier intervals revealed accelerated dysregulation of signaling pathways upon iron loading, while ICT partially mitigated the effects. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that iron is a promoter of leukemogenesis in vivo up to a peak iron dose, but further iron loading decreases AML risk by increasing cell death. ICT can partially mitigate the adverse effects of iron overload, and to maximize its benefit this intervention should be undertaken prior to the development of extreme iron overload.","['Chan, Lap Shu Alan', 'Gu, Lilly ChunHong', 'Wells, Richard A']","['Chan LSA', 'Gu LC', 'Wells RA']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1409-8638'],"['Biological Sciences, Sunnybrook Research Institute Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada. eertrj.chan@mail.utoronto.ca.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, 101 College St Suite 15-701, Toronto, Ontario, M5G1L7, Canada. eertrj.chan@mail.utoronto.ca.', 'Biological Sciences, Sunnybrook Research Institute Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Biological Sciences, Sunnybrook Research Institute Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, 101 College St Suite 15-701, Toronto, Ontario, M5G1L7, Canada.', 'Odette Cancer Centre, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Current Address: Office of the Chief Coroner for Ontario, 25 Morton Shulman Avenue, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['N/A/Estate of J.

However, penetrance and genotype-phenotype correlations are incompletely understood. Here we report on the clinically diverse features of three siblings affected by GATA2c.1021_1031del over an 18-year period, all initially presenting in childhood and adolescence with MDS and AML with monosomy 7 (-7), and one also with trisomy 8 (+8). The siblings inherited a GATA2c.1021_1031del from their father who remains asymptomatic in his sixth decade. The two younger sisters are well after unrelated haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), while the first boy died of severe chronic lung disease after sibling HSCT from his youngest sister, who subsequently also developed GATA2-deficiency associated MDS. This family illustrates high penetrance with variable genotype/phenotype correlation within one generation with GATA2-deficiency. We surmise that the lung disease post sibling HSCT was also caused by the GATA2-deficiency. The experience with this family underlines the necessity for GATA2 analysis in all apparently sporadic childhood and teenage MDS and AML with -7 also in the absence of a family history or other clinical features, and rigorous genetic testing in siblings. Moreover, our findings support the arguments for pre-emptive HSCT in variant-carrying siblings.","['Ellingford, Jamie M', 'Telford, Nick', 'Urquhart, Jill', 'Will, Andrew M', 'Bonney, Denise', 'Adams, Ben', 'Dixon, Rachel', 'Kerr, Bronwyn', 'Black, Graeme Cm', 'Wynn, Robert F', 'Meyer, Stefan']","['Ellingford JM', 'Telford N', 'Urquhart J', 'Will AM', 'Bonney D', 'Adams B', 'Dixon R', 'Kerr B', 'Black GC', 'Wynn RF', 'Meyer S']",,"['Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, North West Genomic Laboratory Hub, Manchester NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK; Division of Evolution and Genomic Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK; Manchester Academic Health Science Centre.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre; Oncology Cytogenetics, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK.', 'Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, North West Genomic Laboratory Hub, Manchester NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK; Division of Evolution and Genomic Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK; Manchester Academic Health Science Centre.', ""Manchester Academic Health Science Centre; Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Manchester NHS Foundation Trust Manchester, UK."", ""Manchester Academic Health Science Centre; Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Manchester NHS Foundation Trust Manchester, UK."", 'Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, North West Genomic Laboratory Hub, Manchester NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK; Division of Evolution and Genomic Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK; Manchester Academic Health Science Centre.', ""Manchester Academic Health Science Centre; Department of Paediatric Radiology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Manchester, UK."", 'Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, North West Genomic Laboratory Hub, Manchester NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK; Division of Evolution and Genomic Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK; Manchester Academic Health Science Centre.', 'Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, North West Genomic Laboratory Hub, Manchester NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK; Division of Evolution and Genomic Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK; Manchester Academic Health Science Centre.', ""Manchester Academic Health Science Centre; Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Manchester NHS Foundation Trust Manchester, UK."", ""Manchester Academic Health Science Centre; Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Manchester NHS Foundation Trust Manchester, UK; Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, Division of Cancer Studies, University of Manchester, UK; Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Oncology, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK.

However, rasburicase is expensive, especially when used as per the manufacturer's recommended dosage of 0.2 mg/kg/day for up to 5 days. Numerous reports have shown that lower, and even single doses are effective in lowering UA levels but prospective randomized studies comparing low doses have not been performed. OBJECTIVES: To prospectively determine the efficacy and safety of two single low doses of rasburicase in adult patients (pts) with acute leukemia and elevated plasma UA. METHODS: Eligible pts aged >/= 18 years old with acute leukemia and UA >/= 7.5 mg/dL were randomized to receive an initial single dose of rasburicase 1.5 mg (Arm A) or 3 mg (Arm B) on day 1 in an unblinded fashion. All pts received allopurinol 300 mg daily on days 1-6. RESULTS: Twenty-four pts (median age 69 years; 14 males and 10 females) were enrolled in this phase 2 study (12 on each arm). Twenty pts had acute myeloid leukemia while 3 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 1 had acute promyelocytic leukemia. Median initial UA level was 9.8 mg/dL. Eighty-three percent of pts in both arms achieved UA < 7.5 mg/dL by 24 h after therapy. Five pts (21 %; 2 from Arm A and 3 from Arm B) required additional doses of rasburicase. The majority (23/24) of pts achieved UA goals after 1-2 doses of rasburicase. None had worsening renal function. Both doses were well tolerated, and no treatment related adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Single doses of rasburicase (as low as 1.5-3 mg) used in addition to allopurinol were well tolerated and highly efficacious (83 % response rate) in decreasing UA levels within 24 h of administration in adult acute leukemia pts with hyperuricemia.","['Vachhani, Pankit', 'Baron, Jeffrey', 'Freyer, Craig W', 'Miller, Austin', 'Wetzler, Meir', 'Thompson, James E', 'Griffiths, Elizabeth A', 'Wang, Eunice S']","['Vachhani P', 'Baron J', 'Freyer CW', 'Miller A', 'Wetzler M', 'Thompson JE', 'Griffiths EA', 'Wang ES']",,"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), Birmingham, AL, USA.

It was aimed to obtain information about the frequency of ophthalmologic complications and their relationship with treatment. METHODS: This retrospective study includes 104 children who underwent HSCT between February 2019 and June 2020 at the Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplant Unit. Patients' ages, genders, diagnosis, transplant types, chemotherapy regimens, transplantation details, conditioning regimens, supportive cares, graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis, infection episodes, and ophthalmologic findings were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 104 patients included in the study, 38 (36.5%) were female and 66 (63.5%) were male. Average age +/- SD was 8.7 +/- 4.91. Considering the diagnoses, the majority of the patients were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (46 patients-44%). Myeloablative regimen was used in 93 (89%) of the patients, and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) was used in 11 patients (10%). While total body irradiation was applied in 16 (15%) patients, one patient was received cranial radiotherapy. Cyclosporine was used in 96 (92%) patients. CMV reactivation was detected in 54 (51%) of the patients. CMV retinitis was not seen. Ocular pathology was detected in 20 (19%) patients before HSCT and in 12 (11%) patients after HSCT. The most common pathology was dry eye. CONCLUSION: Routine ophthalmologic examinations are important in terms of early diagnosis. In addition, GvHD and CMV prophylaxis is important because of reducing the risk of ocular complications after HSCT.","['Sarbay, Hakan', 'Hagverdiyeva, Samira', 'Turkkan, Emine', 'Akcay, Seyhmus', 'Atay, Avni', 'Malbora, Baris']","['Sarbay H', 'Hagverdiyeva S', 'Turkkan E', 'Akcay S', 'Atay A', 'Malbora B']",,"['Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, TC Istanbul Yeni Yuzyil University Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey. drhakansarbay@hotmail.com.', 'Ophthalmology, TC Istanbul Yeni Yuzyil University Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, University of Health Sciences, Prof. Dr. Cemil Tascioglu City Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Faculty of Medicine, TC Istanbul Yeni Yuzyil University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, TC Istanbul Yeni Yuzyil University Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, TC Istanbul Yeni Yuzyil University Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210506,Netherlands,Int Ophthalmol,International ophthalmology,7904294,,['NOTNLM'],"['Dry eye', 'GvHD', 'HSCT', 'Ophthalmologic findings']",2021/05/07 06:00,2021/07/01 06:00,['2021/05/06 13:09'],"['2020/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/06 13:09 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10792-021-01811-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s10792-021-01811-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Int Ophthalmol. 2021 Jul;41(7):2533-2538. doi: 10.1007/s10792-021-01811-3.

These class-defining mutations frequently synergize with internal tandem duplications in FLT3 (FLT3-ITDs) to drive leukemogenesis. However, approximately 20% of FLT3-ITD-positive AMLs bare no class-defining mutations, and mechanisms of leukemic transformation in these cases are unknown. To identify pathways that drive FLT3-ITD mutant AML in the absence of class-defining mutations, we performed an insertional mutagenesis (IM) screening in Flt3-ITD mice, using Sleeping Beauty transposons. All mice developed acute leukemia (predominantly AML) after a median of 73 days. Analysis of transposon insertions in 38 samples from Flt3-ITD/IM leukemic mice identified recurrent integrations at 22 loci, including Setbp1 (20/38), Ets1 (11/38), Ash1l (8/38), Notch1 (8/38), Erg (7/38), and Runx1 (5/38). Insertions at Setbp1 led exclusively to AML and activated a transcriptional program similar, but not identical, to those of NPM1-mutant and MLL-rearranged AMLs. Guide RNA targeting of Setbp1 was highly detrimental to Flt3ITD/+/Setbp1IM+, but not to Flt3ITD/+/Npm1cA/+, AMLs. Also, analysis of RNA-sequencing data from hundreds of human AMLs revealed that SETBP1 expression is significantly higher in FLT3-ITD AMLs lacking class-defining mutations. These findings propose that SETBP1 overexpression collaborates with FLT3-ITD to drive a subtype of human AML. To identify genetic vulnerabilities of these AMLs, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening in Flt3ITD/+/Setbp1IM+ AMLs and identified potential therapeutic targets, including Kdm1a, Brd3, Ezh2, and Hmgcr. Our study gives new insights into epigenetic pathways that can drive AMLs lacking class-defining mutations and proposes therapeutic approaches against such cases.","['Pacharne, Suruchi', 'Dovey, Oliver M', 'Cooper, Jonathan L', 'Gu, Muxin', 'Friedrich, Mathias J', 'Rajan, Sandeep S', 'Barenboim, Maxim', 'Collord, Grace', 'Vijayabaskar, M S', 'Ponstingl, Hannes', 'De Braekeleer, Etienne', 'Bautista, Ruben', 'Mazan, Milena', 'Rad, Roland', 'Tzelepis, Konstantinos', 'Wright, Penny', 'Gozdecka, Malgorzata', 'Vassiliou, George S']","['Pacharne S', 'Dovey OM', 'Cooper JL', 'Gu M', 'Friedrich MJ', 'Rajan SS', 'Barenboim M', 'Collord G', 'Vijayabaskar MS', 'Ponstingl H', 'De Braekeleer E', 'Bautista R', 'Mazan M', 'Rad R', 'Tzelepis K', 'Wright P', 'Gozdecka M', 'Vassiliou GS']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2992-6854', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4376-795X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3184-0283', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0074-6729', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1924-4411', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7573-1703', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4659-023X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4865-7648', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4337-8022']","['Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome-Medical Research Center (MRC) Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome-Medical Research Center (MRC) Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Medicine II, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'United Kingdom Dementia Research Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', ""Department of Pediatrics and Children's Cancer Research Center, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Munich, Germany."", 'Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome-Medical Research Center (MRC) Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome-Medical Research Center (MRC) Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome-Medical Research Center (MRC) Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Research and Development Department, Selvita S.A., Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Medicine II, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany;

Many important factors participate into the regulation of ALL, including proteins. PAQR3 (also named RKTG) has been proved to take part in many human cancers by acting as a tumor suppressor. PAQR3 has bee n shown to repress human leukemia cells proliferation and induce cell apoptosis, but its role and relevant regulatory mechanism on cell proliferation and ferroptosis in ALL needs more exploration. METHODS: The genes expression was detected through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (mRNA) or western blot (protein). The cell proliferation was assessed through Cell Counting Kit-8 and 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine assays. The levels of MDA, DCF, and intracellular free Fe in ALL cells were tested through the commercial kits. The cell apoptosis was determined through flow cytometry analysis. The binding ability of PAQR3 and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was verified through pull down assay. RESULTS: PAQR3 expression was firstly assessed in ALL patients and cell lines, and discovered to be downregulated. It was verified that PAQR3 suppressed ALL cells proliferation. Further experiments proved that PAQR3 aggravates ferroptosis in ALL. In addition, AQR3 bound with Nrf2, and modulated its expression through ubiquitination in ALL. Finally, through rescue assays, it was demonstrated that Nrf2 overexpression reversed the effects of PAQR3 on cell proliferation and ferroptosis. CONCLUSION: Findings from our work uncovered that PAQR3 inhibited proliferation and aggravated ferroptosis in ALL through modulation Nrf2 stability. This study suggested that PAQR3 may serve as an effective biological marker for ALL treatment.","['Jin, Ling', 'Tong, Laigen']","['Jin L', 'Tong L']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6849-4324'],"[""Department of Hematology, Yixing People's Hospital, Yixing City, Jiangsu Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Yixing People's Hospital, Yixing City, Jiangsu Province, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210506,England,Immun Inflamm Dis,"Immunity, inflammation and disease",101635460,PMC8342237,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*Nrf2', '*PAQR3', '*ferroptosis', '*proliferation']",2021/05/07 06:00,2021/10/16 06:00,['2021/05/06 09:13'],"['2021/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/06 09:13 [entrez]']",['10.1002/iid3.437 [doi]'],ppublish,Immun Inflamm Dis. 2021 Sep;9(3):827-839. doi: 10.1002/iid3.437.

Previous studies have highlighted the downregulation of miRNA miR4865p in patients with mesothelioma and the introduction of miRNA mimics to restore their reduced or absent functionality in cancer cells is considered an important therapeutic strategy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the mechanisms through which miRNAs may influence the functions, proliferation and sensitivity to cisplatin of MPM cells. In the present study, a miR4865p mimic was transfected into the H2052 and H28 MPM cell lines, and cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential were monitored. miR4865p overexpression led to a clear impairment of cell proliferation, targeting CDK4 and attenuating cell cycle progression. In addition, transfection with miR4865p mimic negatively regulated the release of inflammatory factors and the expression of Provirus integration site for Moloney murine leukaemia virus 1 (PIM1). The sensitivity of the cells to cisplatin was enhanced by enhancing the apoptotic effects of the drug and impairing mitochondrial function. On the whole, the present study demonstrates that miR4865p may play an important role in MPM treatment by targeting multiple pathways involved in tumour development and progression. These activities may be mostly related to the downregulation of PIM1, a crucial regulator of cell survival and proliferation. Furthermore, these results provide support for the combined use of miR4865p with chemotherapy as a therapeutic strategy for MPM.","['Pinelli, Silvana', 'Alinovi, Rossella', 'Poli, Diana', 'Corradi, Massimo', 'Pelosi, Giorgio', 'Tiseo, Marcello', 'Goldoni, Matteo', 'Cavallo, Delia', 'Mozzoni, Paola']","['Pinelli S', 'Alinovi R', 'Poli D', 'Corradi M', 'Pelosi G', 'Tiseo M', 'Goldoni M', 'Cavallo D', 'Mozzoni P']",,"['Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, I-43126 Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, I-43126 Parma, Italy.', 'INAIL Research, Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Epidemiology and Hygiene, Monte Porzio Catone, I-00078 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, I-43126 Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Chemistry, Life Sciences and Environmental Sustainability, University of Parma, I-43124 Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, I-43126 Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, I-43126 Parma, Italy.', 'INAIL Research, Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Epidemiology and Hygiene, Monte Porzio Catone, I-00078 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, I-43126 Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210506,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,PMC8083808,['NOTNLM'],"['CDK4', 'PIM1', 'cisplatin sensitivity', 'malignant pleural mesothelioma', 'miRNA4865p']",2021/05/07 06:00,2021/11/19 06:00,['2021/05/06 09:04'],"['2020/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/06 09:04 [entrez]', '2021/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3892/ijmm.2021.4950 [doi]', '117 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2021 Jun;47(6). pii: 117. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.2021.4950.

The most common cause of postmenopausal bleeding is atrophy of the vaginal mucosa or endometrium. Endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial polyps, submucous leiomyomas and endometrial cancers are also known causes of postmenopausal bleeding. Here, we present a patient whose cause of postmenopausal vaginal bleeding was infiltration of the endometrium with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CASE REPORT: A 78-year-old woman, who has been followed up with a diagnosis of CLL for 5 years, presented with a complaint of postmenopausal bleeding. After dilation and curettage, pathology revealed that the cause of the postmenopausal bleeding was CLL infiltration into the endometrium. CONCLUSION: Any involvement of the female genital organs in CLL is rare. Therefore, hematological malignancies should be considered in the differential diagnosis of postmenopausal bleeding.","['Kale, I', 'Topal, Cumhur Selcuk']","['Kale I', 'Topal CS']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7802-7199', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6782-2373']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Umraniye Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pathology, Umraniye Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210506,England,Climacteric,Climacteric : the journal of the International Menopause Society,9810959,,['NOTNLM'],"['Case report', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'postmenopausal bleeding', 'small lymphocytic lymphoma']",2021/05/07 06:00,2021/05/07 06:00,['2021/05/06 08:47'],"['2021/05/06 08:47 [entrez]', '2021/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/13697137.2021.1917540 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Climacteric. 2021 May 6:1-3. doi: 10.1080/13697137.2021.1917540.,,,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This ""Case Study in Physiology"" describes an man with obesity admitted to the hospital for relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, who experienced progressive hypoxemia, shortness of breath, and dyspnea on exertion during his hospitalization. After initial empirical treatment with diuresis and antibiotics failed to improve his symptoms and because an arterial blood gas measurement was not readily available, we applied a novel, recently described physiological method to estimate the arterial partial pressure of oxygen from the peripheral saturation measurement and calculate the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference to discern the source of his hypoxemia and dyspnea. Using basic physiological principles, we describe how hypoventilation, anemia, and the use of a beta blocker and furosemide, collaborated to create a ""perfect storm"" in this patient that impaired oxygen delivery and limited utilization. This case illustrates the application of innovative physiology methodology in medicine and provides a strong rationale for continuing to integrate physiology education in medical education.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Discerning the cause of dyspnea and hypoxemia in complex patients can be difficult. We describe the ""real world"" application of an innovative methodology to untangle the underlying physiology in a patient with multiple comorbidities.

Methods and Results: Using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models of CD19(+) B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), we show that priming leukemia-bearing mice with 5-azacytidine (AZA) enhances CAR T cell therapy. AZA given 1 day prior to CAR T cell infusion delayed leukemia growth and promoted CAR T cell expansion and effector function. Priming leukemia cells with AZA increased CAR T cell/target cell conjugation and target cell killing, promoted CAR T cell divisions and expanded IFNgamma(+) effector T cells in co-cultures with CD19(+) leukemia Nalm-6 and Raji cells. Transcriptome analysis revealed activation of diverse immune pathways in leukemia cells isolated from mice treated with AZA. We propose that epigenetic priming with AZA induces transcriptional changes that sensitize tumor cells to subsequent CAR T cell treatment. Among the candidate genes up-regulated by AZA is TNFSF4 which encodes OX40L, one of the strongest T cell co-stimulatory ligands. OX40L binds OX40, the TNF receptor superfamily member highly specific for activated T cells. TNFSF4 is heterogeneously expressed in a panel of pediatric PDXs, and high TNFSF4 expression correlated with increased CAR T cell numbers identified in co-cultures with individual PDXs. High OX40L expression in Nalm-6 cells increased their susceptibility to CAR T cell killing while OX40L blockade reduced leukemia cell killing. Conclusion: We propose that treatment with AZA activates OX40L/OX40 co-stimulatory signaling in CAR T cells. Our data suggest that the clinical use of AZA before CAR T cells could be considered.","['Xu, Ning', 'Tse, Benjamin', 'Yang, Lu', 'Tang, Tiffany C Y', 'Haber, Michelle', 'Micklethwaite, Kenneth', 'Dolnikov, Alla']","['Xu N', 'Tse B', 'Yang L', 'Tang TCY', 'Haber M', 'Micklethwaite K', 'Dolnikov A']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2036-8817'],"[""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'Blood Transplant and Cell Therapies Program, Department of Hematology, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Sydney Cellular Therapies Laboratory, NSW Health Pathology, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Westmead Institute for Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210428,New Zealand,Immunotargets Ther,ImmunoTargets and therapy,101606565,PMC8091475,['NOTNLM'],"['AZA', 'CAR T cells', 'gene expression', 'leukemia', 'patient-derived xenografts']",2021/05/07 06:00,2021/05/07 06:01,['2021/05/06 07:07'],"['2021/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/06 07:07 [entrez]', '2021/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/ITT.S296161 [doi]', '296161 [pii]']",epublish,Immunotargets Ther. 2021 Apr 28;10:123-140. doi: 10.2147/ITT.S296161. eCollection 2021.,,,,,['(c) 2021 Xu et al.'],,,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis can be established by the presence of two of the seven National Institutes of Health (NIH) diagnostic criteria; several dermatologic manifestations are NIH criteria used to establish the diagnosis: axillary and inguinal freckling, cafe-au-lait macules, and neurofibromas. Mucosal evaluation of the eyes may detect a fourth criteria: pigmented iris hamartomas (Lisch nodules). The remaining NIH criteria include optic path glioma, distinctive osseus lesions, and a positive family history of the condition. A breast cancer 2 (BRCA2) positive woman with NF1 and chronic lymphocytic leukemia is described. Patients with NF1 have an increased lifetime risk to develop breast cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, malignant glioma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia occurring in NF1 patients is rare; including my female patient reported in this paper, chronic lymphocytic leukemia has only been reported in three individuals with NF1--two women and one man. The man and the other woman presented with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia and treatment with antineoplastic therapy at diagnosis; the man achieved clinical remission and the woman passed away from complications associated with therapy-refractory progression of her leukemia. My female patient required treatment 41 months after diagnosis and had a good clinical response; she has been without significant disease progression for 34 months. Similar to NF1, breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and BRCA2 mutations are associated with an increased lifetime risk of developing cancer--particularly breast and ovarian carcinoma. An increased risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia has also been demonstrated in patients with mutations of either BRCA1 or BRCA2. Also, albeit uncommon, either BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation has been detected in women with NF1 who develop breast cancer. In conclusion, the development of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in NF1 patients may be coincidental and not associated with the underlying genodermatosis; however, the occurrence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in my patient with NF1, in part, may be related to her BRCA2 positivity.","['Cohen, Philip R']",['Cohen PR'],,"['Dermatology, San Diego Family Dermatology, National City, USA.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210402,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,PMC8088774,['NOTNLM'],"['axillary', 'cafe-au-lait macule', 'chronic', 'freckling', 'glioma', 'iris', 'leukemia', 'lisch', 'lymphocytic', 'neurofibromatosis']",2021/05/07 06:00,2021/05/07 06:01,['2021/05/06 07:06'],"['2021/05/06 07:06 [entrez]', '2021/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.14258 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Apr 2;13(4):e14258. doi: 10.7759/cureus.14258.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021, Cohen et al.']",,,,,"['The authors have declared financial relationships, which are detailed in the next', 'section.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to test the hypothesis that melatonin could attenuate myocardial injury in a rat CPB model. Methods: Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups, n = 6 for each group: the sham operation (SO) group, CPB group and melatonin group. Rats in the SO group underwent cannulation without CPB, rats in CPB group intraperitoneal injected an equal volume of vehicle daily for 7 days before being subjected to CPB and rats in melatonin group intraperitoneal injected 20 mg/kg of melatonin solution daily for 7 days before being subjected to CPB. After 120 min for CPB, the expression levels of plasma interleukin (IL) -6, IL-1beta, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), malondialdehyde (MDA), creatine kinase (CK) -MB and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) were measured. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by dihydroethidium (DHE). Apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Mitochondrial damage and autophagosomes were detected by electron microscopy. Apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) was detected by immunofluorescence. The expression of B cell lymphoma/leukemia2 associated X (Bax), B cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (Bcl-2), cytochrome C (Cyto-C), cleaved caspase-9, AKT, p-AKT, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), p-STAT3, LC3, P62, mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR), p-mTOR and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were determined using western blotting. Results: Melatonin significantly decreased the levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, MDA, CK-MB and cTnT and increased the levels of SOD and GSH-Px, all of which were altered by CPB. Melatonin reduced cardiomyocyte superoxide production, the apoptosis index and autophagy in cardiomyocytes induced by CPB. The AKT, STAT3 and mTOR signaling pathways were activated by melatonin during CPB. Conclusion: Melatonin may serve as a cardioprotective factor in CPB by inhibiting oxidative damage, apoptosis and autophagy.

Interferons have been previously shown to aid in the clearance of AML cells. Type I interferons are produced primarily by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). However, these cells exist in a quiescent state in AML. Because pDCs express TLR 7-9, we hypothesized that the TLR7/8 agonist R848 would be able to reprogram them toward a more active, IFN-producing phenotype. Consistent with this notion, we found that R848-treated pDCs from patients produced significantly elevated levels of IFNbeta. In addition, they showed increased expression of the immune-stimulatory receptor CD40. We next tested whether IFNbeta would influence antibody-mediated fratricide among AML cells, as our recent work showed that AML cells could undergo cell-to cell killing in the presence of the CD38 antibody daratumumab. We found that IFNbeta treatment led to a significant, IRF9-dependent increase in CD38 expression and a subsequent increase in daratumumab-mediated cytotoxicity and decreased colony formation. These findings suggest that the tolerogenic phenotype of pDCs in AML can be reversed, and also demonstrate a possible means of enhancing endogenous Type I IFN production that would promote daratumumab-mediated clearance of AML cells.","['Fatehchand, Kavin', 'Mehta, Payal', 'Colvin, Christopher B', 'Buteyn, Nathaniel J', 'Santhanam, Ramasamy', 'Merchand-Reyes, Giovanna', 'Inshaar, Hafza', 'Shen, Brenda', 'Mo, Xiaokui', 'Mundy-Bosse, Bethany', 'Tridandapani, Susheela', 'Butchar, Jonathan P']","['Fatehchand K', 'Mehta P', 'Colvin CB', 'Buteyn NJ', 'Santhanam R', 'Merchand-Reyes G', 'Inshaar H', 'Shen B', 'Mo X', 'Mundy-Bosse B', 'Tridandapani S', 'Butchar JP']",,"['Medical Scientist Training Program, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Center for Biostatistics, Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Medical Scientist Training Program, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA203584/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20210427,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC8092344,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'fratricide', 'interferon-beta', 'plasmacytoid dendritic cells']",2021/05/07 06:00,2021/05/07 06:01,['2021/05/06 07:04'],"['2021/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/06 07:04 [entrez]', '2021/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.27949 [doi]', '27949 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2021 Apr 27;12(9):878-890. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.27949. eCollection 2021 Apr 27.,,,,,['Copyright: (c) 2021 Fatehchand et al.'],,,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST All authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest', 'regarding this manuscript.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the development of the Abeta-induced AD mouse model, the amyloid-beta (Abeta 1-42) peptide was stereotaxically injected into the brains of mice. Subsequently, gintonin was administered at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day/per oral (p.o) for four weeks daily, and its effects were evaluated by using western blotting, fluorescence analysis of brain sections, biochemical tests, and memory-related behavioral evaluations. To elucidate the effects of gintonin at the mechanistic level, the activation of endogenous antioxidant mechanisms, as well as the activation of astrocytes, microglia, and proinflammatory mediators such as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF-2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), was evaluated. In addition, microglial cells (BV-2 cells) were used to analyze the effects of gintonin on microglial activation and signaling mechanisms. Collectively, the results suggested that gintonin reduced elevated oxidative stress by improving the expression of NRF-2 and HO-1 and thereby reducing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (LPO). Moreover, gintonin significantly suppressed activated microglial cells and inflammatory mediators in the brains of Abeta-injected mice. Our findings also indicated improved synaptic and memory functions in the brains of Abeta-injected mice after treatment with gintonin. These results suggest that gintonin may be effective for relieving AD symptoms by regulating oxidative stress and inflammatory processes in a mouse model of AD. Collectively, the findings of this preclinical study highlight and endorse the potential, multitargeted protective effects of gintonin against AD-associated oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, cognitive impairment, and neurodegeneration.","['Ikram, Muhammad', 'Jo, Min Gi', 'Park, Tae Ju', 'Kim, Min Woo', 'Khan, Ibrahim', 'Jo, Myeung Hoon', 'Kim, Myeong Ok']","['Ikram M', 'Jo MG', 'Park TJ', 'Kim MW', 'Khan I', 'Jo MH', 'Kim MO']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2863-6989', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4317-1072']","['Division of Life Science and Applied Life Science (BK21 FOUR), College of Natural Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Life Science and Applied Life Science (BK21 FOUR), College of Natural Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Republic of Korea.', ""Haemato-oncology/Systems Medicine Group, Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, MVLS, University of Glasgow, UK."", 'Division of Life Science and Applied Life Science (BK21 FOUR), College of Natural Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Life Science and Applied Life Science (BK21 FOUR), College of Natural Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Life Science and Applied Life Science (BK21 FOUR), College of Natural Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Life Science and Applied Life Science (BK21 FOUR), College of Natural Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210416,United States,Oxid Med Cell Longev,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,101479826,PMC8068536,,,2021/05/07 06:00,2021/05/29 06:00,['2021/05/06 07:04'],"['2020/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/10 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/06 07:04 [entrez]', '2021/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2021/6635552 [doi]'],epublish,Oxid Med Cell Longev. 2021 Apr 16;2021:6635552. doi: 10.1155/2021/6635552. eCollection 2021.,20210528,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (gintonin)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Alzheimer Disease/*drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Glycoproteins/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Muhammad Ikram et al.'],,,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Implementing the latest treatment protocols is currently accompanied by serious and life-threatening side effects. There are worldwide attempts to find new effective and potent therapeutic agents with minimal side effects on CML patients. This in vitro study was carried out to discover the potential antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of naturally produced prodigiosin (PDG) on K562 cells as an accepted model of CML. Experimental approach: The anti-proliferative effect of PDG was measured by MTT assay. To highlight the mechanism of cytotoxicity, the apoptotic cell death pathway was investigated by morphological and biochemical assessments. The dual acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining technique and western blotting method were applied to assess the mechanism of the potential apoptotic impact of PDG on K562 cells. Findings/Results: PDG-induced time- and concentration-dependent anti-proliferative effects were revealed with an estimated IC50 value of 54.06 muM. The highest cell viability reduction (60%) was recorded in cells, which were exposed to 100 muM concentration. Further assays demonstrated that in the dual acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining method the cell population in the late apoptosis phase was increased in a concentration-dependent manner, which was confirmed with remarkable DNA fragmentation. Conclusion and implications: We found that the PDG-induced apoptosis in K562 cells is mediated through the caspase-3 activation both in mRNA and protein levels. Our results suggest that PDG could be a potent compound for further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics studies in the in vivo model of CML.","['Niakani, Maryam', 'Majd, Ahmad', 'Pakzad, Parviz', 'Malekinejad, Hassan']","['Niakani M', 'Majd A', 'Pakzad P', 'Malekinejad H']",,"['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Tehran North Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, I.R.

Our study aims to evaluate the effects of miRNAs on leukocytosis during induction therapy of APL patients and explore its potential mechanisms. During induction treatment, patients with white blood cell count higher than 10 x 10(9)/L were divided into leukocytosis group and others were nonleukocytosis group. Using microarray assays, we found that miR-139-5p was significantly downregulated in the leukocytosis group. Elevated expression of miR-139-5p inhibited the proliferation of NB4 cells by arresting the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis. We further identified that MNT was a target of miR-139-5p. miR-139-5p significantly inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and migration function of NB4 cells through targeting MNT.

Here we describe the first successful case of untreated APL and synchronous endometrial cancer (in an adult Japanese woman) treated with ATO consolidation therapy and the subsequent surgery and chemotherapy for endometrial cancer.","['Sugiura, Hiroyuki', 'Nishimori, Hisakazu', 'Matsuoka, Hirofumi', 'Nakamura, Keiichiro', 'Fujii, Keiko', 'Fujii, Nobuharu', 'Matsuoka, Ken-Ichi', 'Maeda, Yoshinobu']","['Sugiura H', 'Nishimori H', 'Matsuoka H', 'Nakamura K', 'Fujii K', 'Fujii N', 'Matsuoka KI', 'Maeda Y']",,"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],,Japan,Acta Med Okayama,Acta medica Okayama,0417611,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'arsenic trioxide', 'chemotherapy', 'endometrial cancer', 'synchronous multiple primary malignant tumor']",2021/05/07 06:00,2021/05/07 06:00,['2021/05/06 06:58'],"['2021/05/06 06:58 [entrez]', '2021/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.18926/AMO/61904 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Med Okayama. 2021 Apr;75(2):219-224. doi: 10.18926/AMO/61904.,,,IM,,,,,,,['No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dedifferentiated, malignant leukocytes retain the benign leukocytes' capacity for cell motility and survival in the circulation, while acquiring the potential for rapid and uncontrolled cell division. For these reasons, leukaemias, although not traditionally considered as metastatic diseases, are in fact models of highly efficient metastatic spread. Accordingly, they are often aggressive and challenging diseases to treat. In this Perspective, we discuss the key molecular processes that facilitate metastasis in a variety of leukaemic subtypes, the clinical significance of leukaemic invasion into specific tissues and the current pipeline of treatments targeting leukaemia metastasis.","['Whiteley, Andrew E', 'Price, Trevor T', 'Cantelli, Gaia', 'Sipkins, Dorothy A']","['Whiteley AE', 'Price TT', 'Cantelli G', 'Sipkins DA']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0165-8395'],"['Department of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton, UK.', 'Department of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA. dorothy.sipkins@duke.edu.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA. dorothy.sipkins@duke.edu.']",['eng'],['R01 CA234580/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210505,England,Nat Rev Cancer,Nature reviews.

Driven largely by an improved understanding and targeting of these molecular aberrations, AML treatment has rapidly evolved over the last 3-5 years. The stellar successes of immunotherapies that harness the power of T cells to treat solid tumors and an improved understanding of the immune systems of patients with hematologic malignancies have led to major efforts to develop immunotherapies for the treatment of patients with AML. Several immunotherapies that harness T cells against AML are in various stages of preclinical and clinical development. These include bispecific and dual antigen receptor-targeting antibodies (targeted to CD33, CD123, CLL-1, and others), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies, and T-cell immune checkpoint inhibitors (including those targeting PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, and newer targets such as TIM3 and STING). The current and future directions of these T-cell-based immunotherapies in the treatment landscape of AML are discussed in this review.","['Daver, Naval', 'Alotaibi, Ahmad S', 'Bucklein, Veit', 'Subklewe, Marion']","['Daver N', 'Alotaibi AS', 'Bucklein V', 'Subklewe M']",,"['Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. ndaver@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Oncology Center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Translational Cancer Immunology, LMU Gene Center, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany. marion.subklewe@med.uni-muenchen.de.', 'Laboratory for Translational Cancer Immunology, LMU Gene Center, Munich, Germany. marion.subklewe@med.uni-muenchen.de.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. marion.subklewe@med.uni-muenchen.de.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20210505,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC8257483,,,2021/05/07 06:00,2021/08/17 06:00,['2021/05/06 06:46'],"['2020/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/03/09 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/06 06:46 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-021-01253-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-021-01253-x [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Jul;35(7):1843-1863. doi: 10.1038/s41375-021-01253-x.

Aberrant targeting of these mechanisms is implicated in lymphomagenesis, but the mutational processes are poorly understood. By performing whole genome and transcriptome sequencing of 181 germinal center derived B-cell lymphomas (gcBCL) we identified distinct mutational signatures linked to SHM and CSR. We show that not only SHM, but presumably also CSR causes off-target mutations in non-IG genes. Kataegis clusters with high mutational density mainly affected early replicating regions and were enriched for SHM- and CSR-mediated off-target mutations. Moreover, they often co-occurred in loci physically interacting in the nucleus, suggesting that mutation hotspots promote increased mutation targeting of spatially co-localized loci (termed hypermutation by proxy). Only around 1% of somatic small variants were in protein coding sequences, but in about half of the driver genes, a contribution of B-cell specific mutational processes to their mutations was found. The B-cell-specific mutational processes contribute to both lymphoma initiation and intratumoral heterogeneity. Overall, we demonstrate that mutational processes involved in the development of gcBCL are more complex than previously appreciated, and that B cell-specific mutational processes contribute via diverse mechanisms to lymphomagenesis.","['Hubschmann, Daniel', 'Kleinheinz, Kortine', 'Wagener, Rabea', 'Bernhart, Stephan H', 'Lopez, Cristina', 'Toprak, Umut H', 'Sungalee, Stephanie', 'Ishaque,

The present study was to scrutinize the anti-leukemia effect of diosmin against Dalton Ascitic Lymphoma (DAL) induced leukemia in mice. DAL cell was used for induction the solid tumor. Body weight, life spans, tumor volume and mean survival time was estimated. Antioxidant, biochemical and pro-inflammatory cytokines were estimated. Diosmin showed the cell viability effect at dose dependent manner against the both cell lines.

Investigations into poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibition have become ever more relevant due to its approval as a therapeutic option for tumors with BRCA1/2 DNA repair-associated mutation and the seemingly high PARP expression levels in some tumor subtypes. In this study, we aimed to determine PARP1 gene expression of different hematological cancer-derived cell lineages and compare them to that of normal cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PARP1 gene expression in seven different neoplastic lineages, representing three different hematological disorders (chronic myeloid leukemia, Burkitt lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia), was quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: All hematological malignant lineages in this study overexpressed PARP1 when compared to the normal cell line MRC-5, with Burkitt's lymphoma cells having the highest expression values (fold change: 93). CONCLUSION: Overexpression of PARP1 in hematological malignant lineages is a finding of crucial importance to future studies exploring possible cellular oncogenic pathways and supports investigations into the effectiveness of PARP1 inhibitors against hematological disorders.","['Machado, Caio Bezerra', 'DA Silva, Emerson Lucena', 'Dias Nogueira, Beatriz Maria', 'DE Moraes Filho, Manoel Odorico', 'Montenegro, Raquel Carvalho', 'DE Moraes, Maria Elisabete Amaral', 'Moreira-Nunes, Caroline Aquino']","['Machado CB', 'DA Silva EL', 'Dias Nogueira BM', 'DE Moraes Filho MO', 'Montenegro RC', 'DE Moraes MEA', 'Moreira-Nunes CA']",,"['Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Drug Research and Development Center (NPDM), Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Drug Research and Development Center (NPDM), Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Drug Research and Development Center (NPDM), Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Drug Research and Development Center (NPDM), Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Drug Research and Development Center (NPDM), Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Drug Research and Development Center (NPDM), Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Drug Research and Development Center (NPDM), Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cultured cells', 'PARP polymerase', 'hematological malignancies']",2021/05/07 06:00,2021/05/18 06:00,['2021/05/06 05:53'],"['2021/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/06 05:53 [entrez]', '2021/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['41/5/2397 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.15014 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2021 May;41(5):2397-2402. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.15014.,20210517,"['EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Medical Oncology/*methods', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1/*genetics']","['Copyright (c) 2021 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Here, we used the NCBI database, UCSC genome browser gateway and Tandem repeat finder program to investigate the structural characterization of the ABL1 breakpoint region and to identify the variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR). To investigate the relationship between ABL1-MS1 and bladder cancer, a case-controlled study was conducted in 207 controls and 197 bladder cancer patients. We also examined the level of transcription of the reporter gene driven by the ABL1 promoter to determine if the VNTR region affects gene expression. RESULTS: In our study, one VNTR was identified in the breakpoint region, the intron 1 region of ABL1, and was named ABL1-MS1. In the control group, only two common alleles (TR13, TR15) were detected, but an additional two rare alleles (TR14, TR16) were detected in bladder cancer. A statistically significant association was identified between the rare ABL1-MS1 allele and bladder cancer risk: P = 0.013. Investigating the level of transcription of the reporter gene driven by the ABL1 promoter, VNTR showed inhibition of ABL1 expression in non-cancer cells 293 T, but not in bladder cancer cells. In addition, ABL1-MS1 was accurately passed on to offspring according to Mendelian inheritance through meiosis. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, the ABL1-MS1 region can affect ABL1 expression of bladder cancer. This study provides that ABL1-MS1 can be used as a DNA fingerprinting marker. In addition, rare allele detection can predict susceptibility to bladder cancer.","['Kim, Min-Hye', 'Yang, Gi-Eun', 'Jeong, Mi-So', 'Mun, Jeong-Yeon', 'Lee, Sang-Yeop', 'Nam, Jong-Kil', 'Choi, Yung Hyun', 'Kim, Tae Nam', 'Leem, Sun-Hee']","['Kim MH', 'Yang GE', 'Jeong MS', 'Mun JY', 'Lee SY', 'Nam JK', 'Choi YH', 'Kim TN', 'Leem SH']",,"['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Dong-A University, Busan, 49315, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Dong-A University, Busan, 49315, Korea.', 'Department of Health Sciences, The Graduated of Dong-A University, Busan, 49315, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Dong-A University, Busan, 49315, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Dong-A University, Busan, 49315, Korea.', 'Research Center for Bioconvergence Analysis, Korea Basic Science Institute, Ochang, 28119, Korea.', 'Department of Urology, Research Institute for Convergence of Biomedical Science and Technology, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Yangsan, 50612, Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Oriental Medicine, Anti-Aging Research Center, Dong-Eui University, Busan, 47227, Korea.', 'Department of Urology, Medical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital, Busan, 49241, Korea. bigman1995@hanmail.net.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Dong-A University, Busan, 49315, Korea. shleem@dau.ac.kr.', 'Department of Health Sciences, The Graduated of Dong-A University, Busan, 49315, Korea. shleem@dau.ac.kr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210505,England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,PMC8097952,['NOTNLM'],"['*ABL1', '*Bladder cancer', '*Breakpoint cluster region', '*Polymorphism', '*VNTR']",2021/05/07 06:00,2021/05/07 06:00,['2021/05/06 05:44'],"['2021/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/06 05:44 [entrez]', '2021/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12920-021-00968-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12920-021-00968-1 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2021 May 5;14(1):121. doi: 10.1186/s12920-021-00968-1.,,,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The conditioning regimens given before hematopoietic stem cell transplant result in the production of toxic metabolites that trigger the activation, damage, and inflammation of the endothelial cells that line the sinusoids. Although liver transplant has been performed for treatment of sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, reports by various liver transplant centers worldwide have been limited and disappointing. We report our experience of successfully treating a patient with sinusoidal obstructive syndrome with deceased donor liver transplant. A 34-year-old male patient was referred to our department due to refractory ascites and jaundice within 1 month after receiving peripheral blood stem cell transplant for acute lymphocytic leukemia. He was diagnosed with biopsy-proven sinusoidal obstructive syndrome. Despite therapy with defibrotide, his condition continued to deteriorate, which included development of intractable pleural effusion, ascites, and progressive renal failure. After undergoing deceased donor liver transplant, the patient's serum bilirubin levels and prothrombin time began to decrease. The histology of the excised liver was compatible with hepatic sinusoidal obstructive syndrome. After being treated for pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and cytomegalovirus viremia, the patient was discharged 2 months after transplant. At 18 months after liver transplant, although he was treated for fungal pneumonia and is being considered for kidney transplant due to unsuccessful weaning from renal replacement therapy, the patient has shown stable liver function and no signs of either graft-versus-host disease or a relapse of acute lymphocytic leukemia. In conclusion, although severe sinusoidal obstructive syndrome in the setting of stem cell transplant has a poor prognosis, we suggest that deceased donor liver transplant should be considered in the treatment of select patients with life-threatening liver dysfunction after hematopoietic stem cell transplant.","['Yu, Young-Dong', 'Kim, Dong-Sik', 'Yoon, Young-In', 'Park, Yong']","['Yu YD', 'Kim DS', 'Yoon YI', 'Park Y']",,"['From the Department of Surgery, Division of HBP Surgery and Liver Transplantation, Korea University Medical Center, Korea University Medical College, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210506,Turkey,Exp Clin Transplant,Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,101207333,,,,2021/05/07 06:00,2021/05/07 06:00,['2021/05/06 05:40'],"['2021/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/07 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/06 05:40 [entrez]']",['10.6002/ect.2019.0226 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Clin Transplant. 2021 Aug;19(8):880-883. doi: 10.6002/ect.2019.0226.

Here, we investigated whether interleukin 4 (IL4) has antileukemic activity via immune-mediated mechanisms in an in vivo murine model of acute myeloid leukemia driven by the MLL-AF9 fusion gene. Although IL4 strongly inhibited leukemia development in immunocompetent mice, the effect was diminished in immune-deficient recipient mice, demonstrating that the antileukemic effect of IL4 in vivo is dependent on the host immune system. Using flow cytometric analysis and immunohistochemistry, we revealed that the antileukemic effect of IL4 coincided with an expansion of F4/80+ macrophages in the bone marrow and spleen. To elucidate whether this macrophage expansion was responsible of the antileukemic effect, we depleted macrophages in vivo with clodronate liposomes. Macrophage depletion eliminated the antileukemic effect of IL4, showing that macrophages mediated the IL4-induced killing of leukemia cells. In addition, IL4 enhanced murine macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of leukemia cells in vitro. Global transcriptomic analysis of macrophages revealed an enrichment of signatures associated with alternatively activated macrophages and increased phagocytosis upon IL4 stimulation. Notably, IL4 concurrently induced Stat6-dependent upregulation of CD47 on leukemia cells, which suppressed macrophage activity. Consistent with this finding, combining CD47 blockade with IL4 stimulation enhanced macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of leukemia cells. Thus, IL4 has two counteracting roles in regulating phagocytosis in mice; enhancing macrophage-mediated killing of leukemia cells, but also inducing CD47 expression that protects target cells from excessive phagocytosis. Taken together, our data suggests that combined strategies that activate macrophages and block CD47 have therapeutic potential in AML.","['Pena-Martinez, Pablo', 'Ramakrishnan, Ramprasad', 'Hogberg, Carl', 'Jansson, Caroline', 'Nord, David Gisselsson', 'Jaras, Marcus']","['Pena-Martinez P', 'Ramakrishnan R', 'Hogberg C', 'Jansson C', 'Nord DG', 'Jaras M']",,"['Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund. marcus.jaras@med.lu.se.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210506,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,,,2021/05/07 06:00,2021/05/07 06:00,['2021/05/06 03:58'],"['2020/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/06 03:58 [entrez]', '2021/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3324/haematol.2020.270421 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Haematologica. 2021 May 6. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2020.270421.,,,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the clinical and biologic implications of CEBPA-basic leucine zipper (CEBPA-bZip) mutations in children and young adults with newly diagnosed AML. CEBPA-bZip mutation status was determined in 2958 patients with AML enrolled on Children's Oncology Group trials (NCT00003790, NCT0007174, NCT00372593, NCT01379181). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed in 1863 patients (107 with CEBPA mutations) to characterize the co-occurring mutations. CEBPA mutational status was correlated with disease characteristics and clinical outcomes. CEBPA-bZip mutations were identified in 160 (5.4%) of 2958 patients, with 132 (82.5%) harboring a second CEBPA mutation (CEBPA-double-mutated [CEBPA-dm]) and 28 (17.5%) had a single CEBPA-bZip only mutation. The clinical and laboratory features of the 2 CEBPA cohorts were very similar. Patients with CEBPA-dm and CEBPA-bZip experienced identical event-free survival (EFS) of 64% and similar overall survival (OS) of 81% and 89%, respectively (P = .259); this compared favorably to EFS of 46% and OS of 61% in patients with CEBPA-wild-type (CEBPA-WT) (both P < .001). Transcriptome analysis demonstrated similar expression profiles for patients with CEBPA-bZip and CEBPA-dm. Comprehensive NGS of patients with CEBPA mutations identified co-occurring CSF3R mutations in 13.1% of patients and GATA2 mutations in 21.5% of patients. Patients with dual CEBPA and CSF3R mutations had an EFS of 17% vs 63% for patients with CEBPA-mutant or CSF3R-WT (P < .001) with a corresponding relapse rate (RR) of 83% vs 22%, respectively (P < .001); GATA2 co-occurrence did not have an impact on outcome. CEBPA-bZip domain mutations are associated with favorable clinical outcomes, regardless of monoallelic or biallelic status. Co-occurring CSF3R and CEBPA mutations are associated with a high RR that nullifies the favorable prognostic impact of CEBPA mutations.","['Tarlock, Katherine', 'Lamble, Adam J', 'Wang, Yi-Cheng', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Ries, Rhonda E', 'Loken, Michael R', 'Brodersen, Lisa Eidenschink', 'Pardo, Laura', 'Leonti, Amanda', 'Smith, Jenny L', 'Hylkema, Tiffany A', 'Woods, William G', 'Cooper, Todd M', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Meshinchi, Soheil']","['Tarlock K', 'Lamble AJ', 'Wang YC', 'Gerbing RB', 'Ries RE', 'Loken MR', 'Brodersen LE', 'Pardo L', 'Leonti A', 'Smith JL', 'Hylkema TA', 'Woods WG', 'Cooper TM', 'Kolb EA', 'Gamis AS', 'Aplenc R', 'Alonzo TA', 'Meshinchi S']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9717-2973', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1203-2371', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1513-2893', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7482-5644']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington, Seattle, WA."", 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington, Seattle, WA."", ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA."", ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA."", 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Hematologics Inc, Seattle, WA.', 'Hematologics Inc, Seattle, WA.', 'Hematologics Inc, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', ""Aflac Cancer, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University, Atlanta, GA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington, Seattle, WA."", 'Nemours/Alfred I.

Previous prospective studies comparing myeloablative conditioning (MAC) versus reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens in adults with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) have shown mixed results. In many of these studies, patients were not stratified based on measurable residual disease (MRD). We evaluated the effect of conditioning intensity on the outcomes of AML patients in complete remission (CR) with flow cytometry evidence of MRD negativity. A total of 135 patients age 20 to 75 years with AML in CR1 or CR2 and flow cytometry evidence of MRD negativity who underwent allogeneic HSCT at our center between 2011 and 2019 were evaluated. We compared overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse, and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in recipients of MAC (n = 89) and RIC (n = 46). Although the patients receiving RIC were older (62 versus 51 years; P < .0001), there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and European Leukemia Network risk criteria and disease status (CR1 or CR2) at the time of transplantation. At a median follow-up of 24.6 months, no statistically significant differences in OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42 to 1.42, P = .411) or RFS (HR, 1.004; 95% CI, 0.48 to 2.09, P = .99) were identified. The cumulative incidence of NRM (HR, 0.595; 95% CI, 0.24 to 1.48; P = .2644) and relapse (HR, 1.007; 95% CI, 0.45 to 2.23; P = .9872) was not different between the 2 groups. Grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute GVHD were more frequent in the MAC group (39.3% verses 19.9% [P = .018] and 19.3% versus 2.3% [P < .001], respectively), as was moderate/severe chronic GVHD (23.6% versus 15.8%; P = .038). Our data indicate that conditioning intensity did not appear to affect OS, RFS, NRM, and relapse risk in patients with MRD-negative AML as measured by flow cytometry. RIC resulted in less severe acute and chronic GVHD.","['Yu, James', 'Du, Yuan', 'Ahmad, Sarfraz', 'Patel, Rushang D', 'Varela, Juan Carlos', 'Chang, Chung-Che', 'Mori, Shahram']","['Yu J', 'Du Y', 'Ahmad S', 'Patel RD', 'Varela JC', 'Chang CC', 'Mori S']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, AdventHealth Orlando Hospital, Orlando, Florida.', 'Research Institute, AdventHealth Orlando Hospital, Orlando, Florida.', 'Gynecologic Oncology Program, AdventHealth Orlando Hospital, Orlando, Florida.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Center, AdventHealth Orlando Hospital, Orlando, Florida.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Center, AdventHealth Orlando Hospital, Orlando, Florida.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, AdventHealth Orlando Hospital, Orlando, Florida.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Center, AdventHealth Orlando Hospital, Orlando, Florida.

Additionally, CLL patients are at an increased risk of secondary malignancies, most commonly of the skin. Furthermore, a number of commonly utilized treatments for CLL have cutaneous implications which should be considered in the interdisciplinary management of CLL patients.

Despite its rarity, especially in immunocompetent or nondiagnosed immunodeficiency patients, EG can present as the first manifestation of an underlying immunosuppression. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 42-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital with a 3-day history of a painless red macule on his right forearm and fever. DIAGNOSES: Blood culture on admission revealed the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas pus culture of the skin lesion showed Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus positivity. INTERVENTIONS: Additional bone marrow aspirate examination and immunophenotyping were performed to confirm the diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukaemia with PML-retinoic acid alpha receptor. OUTCOMES: The patient was successfully treated with a 14-day course of antibiotics, and no evidence of relapse was noted. The patient achieved complete remission after treatment for acute promyelocytic leukaemia. LESSONS: It should be kept in mind that EG is an important cutaneous infection that is typically associated with P aeruginosa bacteremia and the presence of underlying immunodeficiency, such as acute leukaemia.","['Hadano, Yoshiro', 'Yoshida-Sakai, Nao', 'Imamura, Yutaka', 'Inoue, Tomohiro', 'Koga, Hitoshi']","['Hadano Y', 'Yoshida-Sakai N', 'Imamura Y', 'Inoue T', 'Koga H']",,"[""Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Mary's Hospital."", 'Biostatistics Center, Kurume University School of Medicine.', 'Department of Hematology.', 'Department of Hematology.', ""Department of Emergency Medicine, St. Mary's Hospital, Kurume, Japan."", ""Department of Emergency Medicine, St. Mary's Hospital, Kurume, Japan.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,PMC8104150,,,2021/05/06 06:00,2021/05/21 06:00,['2021/05/05 17:42'],"['2021/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/05 17:42 [entrez]', '2021/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000025867 [doi]', '00005792-202105070-00089 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2021 May 7;100(18):e25867. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000025867.,20210520,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Coinfection/diagnosis/drug therapy/*immunology/microbiology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Forearm', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Male', 'Pseudomonas Infections/diagnosis/drug therapy/*immunology/microbiology', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Pyoderma Gangrenosum/diagnosis/drug therapy/*immunology/microbiology', 'Skin/microbiology', 'Staphylococcal Skin Infections/diagnosis/drug therapy/*immunology/microbiology', 'Staphylococcus aureus/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Treatment Outcome']","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

In the present study, we aimed to identify the key genes and microRNAs based on acute myeloid leukemia with RUNX1 mutation. The newly finding targeted genes and microRNA associated with RUNX1 may benefit to the clinical treatment in acute myeloid leukemia. MATERIAL/METHODS: The gene and miRNA expression data sets relating to RUNX1 mutation and wild-type adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Differentially expressed miRNAs and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by edgeR of R platform. Gene ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses were performed by Metascape and Gene set enrichment analysis. The protein-protein interaction network and miRNA-mRNA regulatory network were performed by Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database and Cytoscape software. RESULTS: A total of 27 differentially expressed miRNAs (25 upregulated and 2 downregulated) and 561 DEGs (429 upregulated and 132 downregulated) were identified. Five miRNAs (miR-151b, miR-151a-5p, let-7a-2-3p, miR-363-3p, miR-20b-5p) had prognostic significance in AML. The gene ontology analysis showed that upregulated DEGs suggested significant enrichment in MHC class II protein complex, extracellular structure organization, blood vessel development, cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation, embryonic morphogenesis, regulation of cell adhesion, and so on. Similarly, the downregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in secretory granule lumen, extracellular structure organization. In the gene set enrichment analysis of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways, the RUNX1 mutation was associated with adherent junction, WNT signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, pathways in cancer, cell adhesion molecules CAMs, MAPK signaling pathway. Eleven genes (PPBP, APP, CCR5, HLA-DRB1, GNAI1, APLNR, P2RY14, C3AR1, HTR1F, CXCL12, GNG11) were simultaneously identified by hub gene analysis and module analysis. MicroRNA-363-3p may promote the development of RUNX1 mutation AML, targeting SPRYD4 and FNDC3B. In addition, the RUNX1 mutation rates in patient were obviously correlated with age, white blood cell, FAB type, risk(cyto), and risk(molecular) (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Our findings have indicated that multiple genes and microRNAs may play a crucial role in RUNX1 mutation AML. MicroRNA-363-3p may promote the development of RUNX1 mutation AML by targeting SPRYD4 and FNDC3B.","['Chen, Yimin', 'Chen, Shuyi', 'Lu, Jielun', 'Yuan, Danyun', 'He, Lang', 'Qin, Pengfei', 'Tan, Huo', 'Xu, Lihua']","['Chen Y', 'Chen S', 'Lu J', 'Yuan D', 'He L', 'Qin P', 'Tan H', 'Xu L']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3437-1286'],"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University.', 'Department of Urology and Minimally Invasive Surgery Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Urology, Guangzhou Institute of Urology.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University.', 'Department of Urology and Minimally Invasive Surgery Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Urology, Guangzhou Institute of Urology.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University.', 'Department of Urology and Minimally Invasive Surgery Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Urology, Guangzhou Institute of Urology.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University.', 'Department of Urology and Minimally Invasive Surgery Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Urology, Guangzhou Institute of Urology.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University.', 'Department of Urology and Minimally Invasive Surgery Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Urology, Guangzhou Institute of Urology.']",['eng'],"['81870113/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '201804010199/Guangzhou Science and Technology Project', '20181A011062/Guangzhou medical and health technology program']",['Journal Article'],,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,PMC8104143,,,2021/05/06 06:00,2021/05/21 06:00,['2021/05/05 17:42'],"['2020/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/05 17:42 [entrez]', '2021/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000025807 [doi]', '00005792-202105070-00071 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2021 May 7;100(18):e25807. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000025807.,20210520,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (FNDC3B protein, human)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (MIRN363 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (SPRYD4 protein, human)']",IM,"['Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Computational Biology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Datasets as Topic', 'Female', 'Fibronectins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Interaction Maps/genetics']","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with Ph+ ALL (B-cell) because of the following items. Complete blood count showed extremely abnormal white blood cell count (26.26x109/l), hemoglobin concentration (65 g/l) and platelet count (14x109/l). And because that Bone marrow aspirate showed 72.5% lymphoblasts and 59.30% lymphoblasts were confirmed by flow cytometry (FCM). At mean time, Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR analysis confirmed that the P190 BCR/ABL fusion gene expression was 5.9%. Karyotype analysis indicated the following: 45, XX, -7, t (922) (q34; q11) [cp3]. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with chemotherapy and different TKIs including imatinib, dasatinib, ponatinib, and bosutinib. OUTCOMES: The patient achieved complete remissions with different TKIs after diagnose but relapsed afterward and died of infection. LESSONS: Multidrug-resistant mutations within the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain are an emerging clinical problem for patients receiving sequential TKIs therapy. Acquisition of E255K/V-inclusive mutations is usually associated with ponatinib resistance, thus it is necessary to screen out new real pan-inhibitor compounds for all BCR/ABL mutations and figure out the potential efficacy of asciminib-based drug combinations in the future.","['Zhao, Miaomiao', 'Gui, Xiya', 'Wu, Qiuling', 'Xia, Linghui', 'Wang, Yadan']","['Zhao M', 'Gui X', 'Wu Q', 'Xia L', 'Wang Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5436-3294'],"['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan.', ""Department of Hematology, People's Hospital of Hanchuan, Wuhan University, Hanchuan, Hubei, China."", 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan.']",['eng'],['81201866/the Natural Science Foundation of China'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,PMC8104221,,,2021/05/06 06:00,2021/05/13 06:00,['2021/05/05 17:42'],"['2021/01/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/05 17:42 [entrez]', '2021/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000025579 [doi]', '00005792-202105070-00023 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2021 May 7;100(18):e25579. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000025579.,20210512,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Karyotyping', '*Mutation Rate', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*genetics', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyridazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use']","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

Although race and economic status have been linked to increased insulin resistance in children, these have not been explored as predictors of hyperglycemia in children with ALL. The objective of this study was to analyze race and income as predictors of hyperglycemia in a diverse sample of children hospitalized with ALL in the United States in the year 2016. Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of 18,077 hospitalizations of White, Black, and Hispanic children under the age of 21 years with ALL contained in a nationally representative database. Multilevel binary logistic regression models were constructed to estimate the relationships between race, median household income, age, sex, and obesity and the odds of hyperglycemia in hospitalized children with ALL. Results: Hyperglycemia occurred during 5.3% of the hospitalizations. Black children were 37% more likely to develop hyperglycemia than White children. The risk for hyperglycemia did not differ between Hispanic and White children. Residing in areas where annual median income was below $54,000 was associated with 1.4-fold increased odds of hyperglycemia, compared to the wealthiest areas. Older children, females, and those diagnosed with obesity were also at increased risk for hyperglycemia. Discussion: An association has been found between treatment-induced hyperglycemia and increased mortality. For this reason, the racial and economic differences in the risk for hyperglycemia identified in this study deserve further consideration.","['Savage, Beth', 'Cole, Peter D', 'Lin, Haiqun']","['Savage B', 'Cole PD', 'Lin H']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6118-4120'],"['Division of Nursing Science, 16118Rutgers School of Nursing, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Newark, NJ, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, 145249Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.', 'Division of Nursing Science, 16118Rutgers School of Nursing, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Newark, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210505,United States,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs,Journal of pediatric oncology nursing : official journal of the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses,8917825,,['NOTNLM'],"['hyperglycemia', 'leukemia', 'lymphoid', 'pediatrics', 'social determinants']",2021/05/06 06:00,2021/10/28 06:00,['2021/05/05 08:46'],"['2021/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/05 08:46 [entrez]']",['10.1177/10434542211011040 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs. 2021 Sep-Oct;38(5):277-284. doi: 10.1177/10434542211011040.

RESULTS: 329 patients were included. Patients classified as CLL ranged from 46% to 73%, depending on the score/diagnostic system used. All eleven scores/diagnostic systems agreed in 184/324 (57%) of patients while in 58/324 (18%) at least two scores/diagnostic systems classified the patient differently (from the majority). Fleiss kappa was 0.74, but pairwise agreement was variable (Cohen's kappa: 0.48 to 0.87). CONCLUSION: This study found a suboptimal agreement between published flow cytometry scores/diagnostic systems for the classification of LPD.","['Sorigue, Marc', 'Raya, Minerva', 'Vergara, Sara', 'Junca, Jordi']","['Sorigue M', 'Raya M', 'Vergara S', 'Junca J']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0587-591X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0142-772X']","['Hematology Laboratory, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol.

The recombination-activating gene RAG1 and RAG2 (collectively, RAG) proteins that assemble a diverse set of antigen receptor genes during lymphocyte development are abnormally expressed in CML-LBC and BCR-ABL1(+) ALL. However, the direct involvement of dysregulated RAG in disease progression remains unclear. Here, we generate human wild-type (WT) RAG and catalytically inactive RAG-expressing BCR-ABL1(+) and BCR-ABL1(-) cell lines, respectively, and demonstrate that BCR-ABL1 specifically collaborates with RAG recombinase to promote cell survival in vitro and in xenograft mice models. WT RAG-expressing BCR-ABL1(+) cell lines and primary CD34(+) bone marrow cells from CML-LBC samples maintain more double-strand breaks (DSB) compared to catalytically inactive RAG-expressing BCR-ABL1(+) cell lines and RAG-deficient CML-CP samples, which are measured by gamma-H2AX. WT RAG-expressing BCR-ABL1(+) cells are biased to repair RAG-mediated DSB by the alternative non-homologous end joining pathway (a-NHEJ), which could contribute genomic instability through increasing the expression of a-NHEJ-related MRE11 and RAD50 proteins. As a result, RAG-expressing BCR-ABL1(+) cells decrease sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) by activating BCR-ABL1 signaling but independent of the levels of BCR-ABL1 expression and mutations in the BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain. These findings identify a surprising and novel role of RAG in the functional specialization of disease progression in BCR-ABL1(+) leukemia through its endonuclease activity.","['Yuan, Meng', 'Wang, Yang', 'Qin, Mengting', 'Zhao, Xiaohui', 'Chen, Xiaodong', 'Li, Dandan', 'Miao, Yinsha', 'Otieno Odhiambo, Wood', 'Liu, Huasheng', 'Ma, Yunfeng', 'Ji, Yanhong']","['Yuan M', 'Wang Y', 'Qin M', 'Zhao X', 'Chen X', 'Li D', 'Miao Y', 'Otieno Odhiambo W', 'Liu H', 'Ma Y', 'Ji Y']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4144-4786'],"[""Department of Pathogenic Biology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Pathogenic Biology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Pathogenic Biology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Pathogenic Biology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Pathogenic Biology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Pathogenic Biology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Pathogenic Biology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Clinical laboratory, Xi'an No. 3 Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Northwest University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Pathogenic Biology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Pathogenic Biology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Pathogenic Biology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, China.""]",['eng'],"['81670157/National Natural Scientific Foundation of China', '81872026/National Natural Scientific Foundation of China']",['Journal Article'],20210518,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,PMC8253288,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1 signaling', 'alternative non-homologous end joining pathway', 'recombination-activating genes RAG1 and RAG2', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors', 'gamma-H2AX']",2021/05/06 06:00,2021/07/09 06:00,['2021/05/05 06:46'],"['2021/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/05 06:46 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.14939 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2021 Jul;112(7):2679-2691. doi: 10.1111/cas.14939.

We sought to understand how environment-induced signaling responses are associated with clinical response to treatment. We previously reported that patients whose AML cells showed low G-CSF-induced STAT3 activation had inferior event-free survival compared to patients with stronger STAT3 responses. Here, we expanded the paradigm to evaluate multiple signaling parameters induced by a more physiological stimulus. We measured STAT3, STAT5 and ERK1/2 responses to G-CSF and to stromal cell-conditioned medium for 113 patients enrolled on COG trials AAML03P1 and AAML0531. Low inducible STAT3 activity was independently associated with inferior event-free survival in multivariate analyses. For inducible STAT5 activity, those with the lowest and highest responses had inferior event-free survival, compared to patients with intermediate STAT5 responses. Using existing RNA-sequencing data, we compared gene expression profiles for patients with low inducible STAT3/5 activation with those for patients with higher inducible STAT3/5 signaling. Genes encoding hematopoietic factors and mitochondrial respiratory chain subunits were overexpressed in the low STAT3/5 response groups, implicating inflammatory and metabolic pathways as potential mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance. We validated the prognostic relevance of individual genes from the low STAT3/5 response signature in a large independent cohort of pediatric AML patients. These findings provide novel insights into interactions between AML cells and the microenvironment that are associated with treatment failure and could be targeted for therapeutic interventions.","['Narayanan, P', 'Man, T-K', 'Gerbing, R B', 'Ries, R', 'Stevens, A M', 'Wang, Y-C', 'Long, X', 'Gamis, A S', 'Cooper, T', 'Meshinchi, S', 'Alonzo, T A', 'Redell, M S']","['Narayanan P', 'Man TK', 'Gerbing RB', 'Ries R', 'Stevens AM', 'Wang YC', 'Long X', 'Gamis AS', 'Cooper T', 'Meshinchi S', 'Alonzo TA', 'Redell MS']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2515-3703'],"[""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", ""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA, USA."", 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', ""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA, USA."", ""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", ""Children's Mercy Hospital and Clinics, Kansas, MO, USA."", ""Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA, USA."", 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA, USA."", 'Division of Biostatistics, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', ""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA. mlredell@texaschildrens.org.""]",['eng'],"['CA196173/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'CA180886/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'CA180899/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'CA17026/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20210504,Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,PMC8390401,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow stroma', 'Inflammation', 'Microenvironment', 'Pediatric AML', 'STAT3', 'STAT5']",2021/05/06 06:00,2021/12/29 06:00,['2021/05/05 06:38'],"['2021/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/29 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/05 06:38 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12094-021-02621-w [doi]', '10.1007/s12094-021-02621-w [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2021 Oct;23(10):2141-2154. doi: 10.1007/s12094-021-02621-w.

While there are multiple documented evidences for the same, the exact mechanism, knowledge of groups at-risk, and mitigation strategies are evolving. We present a case of a young individual who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), was started on appropriate chemotherapy, and subsequently developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia. He was treated for COVID-19 pneumonia and recovered from the illness. However, his recovery from COVID-19 was further complicated by cortical venous sinus thrombosis (CVT). Contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CEMRI) brain and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) revealed the diagnosis of CVT with hemorrhagic parenchymal changes. He was managed with therapeutic anticoagulation and cerebral decongestants and was subsequently shifted to oral anticoagulant therapy. While the case was managed at a tertiary care setting, it opened up the question of identifying the high-risk groups and to formulate guidelines for extended thromboprophylaxis in these patients.","['Manral, Ishita', 'Duddu, Nihar', 'Nayan, Neelabh', 'Kapoor, Rajan', 'Gupta, Preeti', 'Gupta, Anirban']","['Manral I', 'Duddu N', 'Nayan N', 'Kapoor R', 'Gupta P', 'Gupta A']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5937-1215'],"['Department of Medicine, Command Hospital, Kolkata, India.grid.414643.0', 'Department of Medicine, Command Hospital, Kolkata, India.grid.414643.0', 'Department of Medicine, Command Hospital, Kolkata, India.grid.414643.0', 'Department of Medicine, Command Hospital, Kolkata, India.grid.414643.0', 'Department of Radiodiagnosis, Command Hospital, Kolkata, India.grid.414643.0', 'Department of Medicine, Command Hospital, Kolkata, India.grid.414643.0']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210430,Switzerland,SN Compr Clin Med,SN comprehensive clinical medicine,101740833,PMC8084587,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'COVID-19', 'Cortical venous sinus thrombosis', 'Severe COVID-19 pneumonia']",2021/05/06 06:00,2021/05/06 06:00,['2021/05/05 06:28'],"['2021/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/05 06:28 [entrez]', '2021/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s42399-021-00932-1 [doi]', '932 [pii]']",aheadofprint,SN Compr Clin Med. 2021 Apr 30:1-5. doi: 10.1007/s42399-021-00932-1.,,,,,"['(c) The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG', '2021.']",,,,,['Conflict of InterestThe authors declare no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Ecological study with the countries as the unit of analysis. Tobacco Control Scale (TCS) scores from 2010, 2013 and 2016 were used as measures for the level of tobacco control policy implementation in 27 European countries. Mortality rates for leukemia, lymphoma, and MM, were obtained from the WHO Mortality Database and the European Cancer Information System for each country for 2010, 2013, 2015 and 2018. Correlation between yearly TCS scores and mortality rates from the same and prospective years were calculated using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (rsp) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) (2010 TCS scores vs 2010, 2013, 2015, 2018 mortality rates; 2013 TCS scores vs 2013, 2015, 2018 mortality rates; and 2016 TCS scores vs 2018 mortality rates). RESULTS: The 2010 TCS scores were significantly negatively associated with leukemia mortality rates in 2013 (rsp=-0.58; 95% CI: -0.79, -0.24; p=0.002), 2015 (rsp=-0.65; 95% CI: -0.85, -0.30; p=0.001) and 2018 (rsp=-0.44; 95% CI: -0.71, -0.06; p=0.021). TCS scores from 2013 and 2016 had significant negative associations with leukemia mortality in all prospective years. TCS scores did not demonstrate consistent correlations with lymphoma and MM mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The level of tobacco control policies in European countries correlates negatively with leukemia mortality at ecological level, with no correlation seen for lymphoma and MM. This study advocates that increased tobacco control implementation may improve leukemia mortality.","['Mehta, Dipal', 'Dennis, Rory', 'Nallamilli, Susanna', 'Vithayathil, Mathew', 'Martinez-Sanchez, Jose Maria']","['Mehta D', 'Dennis R', 'Nallamilli S', 'Vithayathil M', 'Martinez-Sanchez JM']",,"['Department of Haematology, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Anaesthetics, Mid Essex NHS Foundation Trust, Essex, United Kingdom.', ""Department of Medicine, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom."", 'Department of Gastroenterology, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.

Of the 150 patients underwent anti-leukemia therapy, the complete remission (CR) was similar in MLL t-AML, non-MLL t-AML and MLL de novo AML (P=0.251). 3-years overall survival (OS) was 37.5%, 21.5% and 20.4% (P=0.046), and leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 28.0%, 32.2% and 22.7% (P=0.031), and the incidence of relapse was 30.0%, 50.4% and 53.5% (P=0.382), respectively, in the three groups.

Moreover, whole-exome sequencing (WES) and gene ontology (GO) analysis for one patient in his different phases revealed increased enrichment of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) mono-methylation (GO:0097692) pathway and decreased enrichment of translocation of ZAP-70 to immunological synapse (R-HAS-202430) pathway upon progression from MDS to MDS-LGLL.","['Ai, Kexin', 'Li, Minming', 'Wu, Ping', 'Deng, Chengxin', 'Huang, Xin', 'Ling, Wei', 'Xu, Ruohao', 'Geng, Suxia', 'Sun, Qihui', 'Weng, Jianyu', 'Du, Xin']","['Ai K', 'Li M', 'Wu P', 'Deng C', 'Huang X', 'Ling W', 'Xu R', 'Geng S', 'Sun Q', 'Weng J', 'Du X']",,"['The Second School of Clinical Medicine, Southern Medical University Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, P.

However, the success of targeted therapy using gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), small molecules blocking Notch cleavage and subsequent activation, has been limited due to development of resistance, thus restricting its clinical efficacy. Here, we systematically compare GSI resistant and sensitive cell states by quantitative mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics, using complementary models of resistance, including T-ALL patient-derived xenografts (PDX) models. Our datasets reveal common mechanisms of GSI resistance, including a distinct kinase signature that involves protein kinase C delta. We demonstrate that the PKC inhibitor sotrastaurin enhances the anti-leukemic activity of GSI in PDX models and completely abrogates the development of acquired GSI resistance in vitro. Overall, we highlight the potential of proteomics to dissect alterations in cellular signaling and identify druggable pathways in cancer.","['Franciosa, Giulia', 'Smits, Jos G A', 'Minuzzo, Sonia', 'Martinez-Val, Ana', 'Indraccolo, Stefano', 'Olsen, Jesper V']","['Franciosa G', 'Smits JGA', 'Minuzzo S', 'Martinez-Val A', 'Indraccolo S', 'Olsen JV']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5309-5558', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5858-3905', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8784-3822', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4810-7136', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4747-4938']","['Proteomics Program, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Proteomics Program, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Molecular Developmental Biology, Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Proteomics Program, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV - IRCCS, Padova, Italy.', 'Proteomics Program, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. jesper.olsen@cpr.ku.dk.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210504,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,PMC8097059,,,2021/05/06 06:00,2021/05/25 06:00,['2021/05/05 05:58'],"['2020/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/05 05:58 [entrez]', '2021/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-021-22787-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-021-22787-9 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2021 May 4;12(1):2507. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-22787-9.,20210524,"['0 (Acetophenones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal)', 'E29LP3ZMUH (rottlerin)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,"['Acetophenones/pharmacology', 'Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzopyrans/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Ontology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Oligopeptides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Protein Array Analysis', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteomics', 'Receptor, Notch1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PicPecc is a digital tool used by children aged 5-17 years to self-report symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, who undergo high-dose methotrexate treatments. The design of the digital platform follows the principles of universal design using pictorial support to provide accessibility for all children regardless of communication or language challenges and thus facilitating international comparison. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Both effect and process evaluations will be conducted. A crossover design will be used to measure the effect/outcome, and a mixed-methods design will be used to measure the process/implementation. The primary outcome in the effect evaluation will be self-reported distress. Secondary outcomes will be stress levels monitored via neuropeptides, neurosteroids and peripheral steroids indicated in plasma blood samples; frequency of in-app estimation of high levels of distress by the children; children's use of analgesic medicine and person centeredness evaluated via the questionnaire Visual CARE Measure. For the process evaluation, qualitative interviews will be carried out with children with cancer, their legal guardians and case-related healthcare professionals. These interviews will address experiences with PicPecc in terms of feasibility and frequency of use from the child's perspective and value to the caseworker. Interview transcripts will be analysed using an interpretive description methodology. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (reference 2019-02392; 2020-02601; 2020-06226).

It can lead to severe inflammatory response syndrome and shock if adequate measures are not taken immediately. The radiological features of lung nodules with changes in ground-glass opacity can represent DS. The principal unique feature of the case reported here is that the diagnosis of DS was based on imaging results in the absence of a low total leukocyte count. CASE PRESENTATION: A 14-year-old Indian girl diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukaemia currently undergoing a chemotherapy regimen that included all-trans retinoic acid/arsenic trioxide was sent to the radiology department for investigation of respiratory distress which she had developed soon after the initiation of chemotherapy. Her chest radiograph showed bilateral lower zone lung infiltrates. Computed tomography (CT) revealed changes in ground-glass opacity in the lower lobes with multiple lung nodules. Differential diagnosis included bacterial, viral or fungal infections, leukemic infiltrates, drug toxicity, pulmonary haemorrhage or leukostasis. She was started on dexamethasone immediately after stopping the chemotherapy with all-trans retinoic acid/arsenic trioxide and given ventilatory support. Her condition subsequently improved and her follow-up chest radiograph and CT scan showed a significant reduction of abnormal lung findings. Based on the clinical improvement and the resolution of findings on imaging following the withdrawal of all-trans retinoic acid/arsenic trioxide, we made the diagnosis of DS. CONCLUSIONS: Though a rather unusual possibility, the treatment history of the patient enabled a rather crucial diagnosis in the nick of time and imaging played a pivotal role. This case further iterates the importance of keeping DS in mind when dealing with similar patients in the future.","['Sarkar, Sayan', 'Ghosh, Priya', 'Gehani, Anisha', 'Ghara, Niharendu', 'Bhattacharyya, Parthasarathi']","['Sarkar S', 'Ghosh P', 'Gehani A', 'Ghara N', 'Bhattacharyya P']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8818-0370'],"['Department of Radiology, Tata Medical Center, 14 MAR (E-W), New Town, Rajarhat, Kolkata, 700160, West Bengal, India. sayansarkar08@gmail.com.', 'Department of Radiology, Tata Medical Center, 14 MAR (E-W), New Town, Rajarhat, Kolkata, 700160, West Bengal, India.', 'Department of Radiology, Tata Medical Center, 14 MAR (E-W), New Town, Rajarhat, Kolkata, 700160, West Bengal, India.', 'Department of Pediatric Haematology, Tata Medical Center, 14 MAR (E-W), New Town, Rajarhat, Kolkata, 700160, West Bengal, India.', 'Department of Pediatric ICU, Tata Medical Center, 14 MAR (E-W), New Town, Rajarhat, Kolkata, 700160, West Bengal, India.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20210505,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,PMC8097890,['NOTNLM'],"['ATO', 'ATRA', 'Differentiation', 'Leukaemia', 'Lung', 'Syndrome']",2021/05/06 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2021/05/05 05:45'],"['2020/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/05 05:45 [entrez]', '2021/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13256-021-02790-w [doi]', '10.1186/s13256-021-02790-w [pii]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2021 May 5;15(1):226. doi: 10.1186/s13256-021-02790-w.,20210514,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Arsenic Trioxide/therapeutic use', '*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/drug therapy', 'Syndrome', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNMT3A mutation has been associated with adverse outcomes. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of DNMT3A status on NPM1 MRD predictive value for survival in a retrospective cohort of AML patients aged over 60 years old treated intensively. A total of 138 patients treated for NPM1-mutated AML in two French institutions were analyzed retrospectively. DNMT3A status did not influence the probability of having a >/= 4log MRD1 reduction after induction. Only 20.4% of FLT3-ITD patients reached >/= 4log MRD1 reduction compared to 47.5% in FLT3wt cases. A 4log reduction of NPM1 MRD was associated with a better outcome, even in FLT3-ITD mutated patients, independent of the allelic ratio. DNMT3A negative patients who reached a 4log reduction had a superior outcome to those who did not (HR = 0.23; p < 0.001). However, postinduction NPM1 MRD1 reduction was not predictive of OS and LFS in DNMT3Amut patients. These results confirm that post-induction NPM1 MRD1 is a reliable tool to assess disease outcome in elderly AML patients. However, the presence of DNMT3A also identifies a subgroup of patients at high risk of relapse.","['Heiblig, Mael', 'Duployez, Nicolas', 'Marceau, Alice', 'Lebon, Delphine', 'Goursaud, Laure', 'Plantier, Isabelle', 'Stalnikiewich, Laure', 'Cambier, Nathalie', 'Balsat, Marie', 'Fossard, Gaelle', 'Labussiere-Wallet, Helene', 'Barraco, Fiorenza', 'Ducastelle-Lepretre, Sophie', 'Sujobert, Pierre', 'Huet, Sarah', 'Hayette, Sandrine', 'Ghesquieres, Herve', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Preudhomme, Claude']","['Heiblig M', 'Duployez N', 'Marceau A', 'Lebon D', 'Goursaud L', 'Plantier I', 'Stalnikiewich L', 'Cambier N', 'Balsat M', 'Fossard G', 'Labussiere-Wallet H', 'Barraco F', 'Ducastelle-Lepretre S', 'Sujobert P', 'Huet S', 'Hayette S', 'Ghesquieres H', 'Thomas X', 'Preudhomme C']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3927-1022', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5332-2404']","['Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hematology Department, Lyon-Sud Hospital, 69310 Pierre Benite, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Bat. 1G, 165 chemin du Grand Revoyet, CEDEX, 69310 Pierre Benite, France.', 'University of Lille, CNRS, Inserm, CHU Lille, Institut de Recherche contre le Cancer de Lille, UMR9020-UMR-S 1277-Canther-Cancer Heterogeneity, Plasticity and Resistance to Therapies, 59000 Lille, France.', 'University of Lille, CNRS, Inserm, CHU Lille, Institut de Recherche contre le Cancer de Lille, UMR9020-UMR-S 1277-Canther-Cancer Heterogeneity, Plasticity and Resistance to Therapies, 59000 Lille, France.', 'Hematology Department, CHU Amiens, 80000 Amiens, France.', 'Hematology Department, Center for Infection and Immunity of Lille, 59019 Lille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Roubaix Hospital, 59512 Roubaix, France.', 'Hematology Department, Lens Hospital, 62300 Lens, France.', 'Hematology Department, Valenciennes Hospital, 59300 Valencienne, France.', 'Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hematology Department, Lyon-Sud Hospital, 69310 Pierre Benite, France.', 'Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hematology Department, Lyon-Sud Hospital, 69310 Pierre Benite, France.', 'Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hematology Department, Lyon-Sud Hospital, 69310 Pierre Benite, France.', 'Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hematology Department, Lyon-Sud Hospital, 69310 Pierre Benite, France.', 'Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hematology Department, Lyon-Sud Hospital, 69310 Pierre Benite, France.', 'Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hematology Department, Lyon-Sud Hospital, 69310 Pierre Benite, France.', 'Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hematology Department, Lyon-Sud Hospital, 69310 Pierre Benite, France.', 'Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hematology Department, Lyon-Sud Hospital, 69310 Pierre Benite, France.', 'Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hematology Department, Lyon-Sud Hospital, 69310 Pierre Benite, France.', 'Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hematology Department, Lyon-Sud Hospital, 69310 Pierre Benite, France.', 'University of Lille, CNRS, Inserm, CHU Lille, Institut de Recherche contre le Cancer de Lille, UMR9020-UMR-S 1277-Canther-Cancer Heterogeneity, Plasticity and Resistance to Therapies, 59000 Lille, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210429,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC8124973,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNMT3A', '*NPM1', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*elderly', '*prognosis']",2021/05/06 06:00,2021/05/06 06:01,['2021/05/05 01:03'],"['2021/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/31 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/05 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/06 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13092156 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13092156 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Apr 29;13(9). pii: cancers13092156. doi: 10.3390/cancers13092156.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (CIP2A) protein is an adverse prognostic indicator in many cancers. METHODS: We examined CIP2A protein levels in diagnostic samples from the SPIRIT2 trial in 172 unselected patients, of whom 90 received imatinib and 82 dasatinib as first-line treatment. RESULTS: High CIP2A levels correlated with inferior progression-free survival (p = 0.04) and with worse freedom from progression (p = 0.03), and these effects were confined to dasatinib recipients. High CIP2A levels were associated with a six-fold higher five-year treatment failure rate than low CIP2A levels (41% vs. 7.5%; p = 0.0002), in both imatinib (45% vs. 11%; p = 0.02) and dasatinib recipients (36% vs. 4%; p = 0.007). Imatinib recipients with low CIP2A levels had a greater risk of treatment failure (p = 0.0008). CIP2A levels were independent of Sokal, Hasford, EUTOS (EUropean Treatment and Outcome Study), or EUTOS long-term survival scores (ELTS) or the presence of major route cytogenetic abnormalities. No association was seen between CIP2A levels and time to molecular response or the levels of the CIP2A-related proteins PP2A, SET, SET binding protein 1 (SETBP1), or AKT. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm that high diagnostic CIP2A levels correlate with subsequent disease progression and treatment failure. CIP2A is a simple diagnostic biomarker that may be useful in planning treatment strategies.","['Clark, Richard E', 'Basabrain, Ammar A', 'Austin, Gemma M', 'Holcroft, Alison K', 'Loaiza, Sandra', 'Apperley, Jane F', 'Law, Christopher', 'Scott, Laura', 'Parry, Alexandra D', 'Bonnett, Laura', 'Lucas, Claire M']","['Clark RE', 'Basabrain AA', 'Austin GM', 'Holcroft AK', 'Loaiza S', 'Apperley JF', 'Law C', 'Scott L', 'Parry AD', 'Bonnett L', 'Lucas CM']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6981-9212'],"['Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GA, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GA, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GA, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GA, UK.', 'John Goldman Centre for Cellular Therapy, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London W12 0HS, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Imperial College London at Hammersmith Hospital, London W12 0HS, UK.', 'Technology Directorate, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GA, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GA, UK.', 'Chester Medical School, University of Chester, Bache Hall, Chester CH2 1BR, UK.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GA, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GA, UK.', 'Chester Medical School, University of Chester, Bache Hall, Chester CH2 1BR, UK.']",['eng'],['CA180 659/Bristol-Myers Squibb'],['Journal Article'],20210429,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC8124525,['NOTNLM'],"['CIP2A', 'CML', 'SPIRIT2', 'blast crisis', 'dasatinib', 'disease progression', 'imatinib']",2021/05/06 06:00,2021/05/06 06:01,['2021/05/05 01:03'],"['2021/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/05 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/06 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13092155 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13092155 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Apr 29;13(9). pii: cancers13092155. doi: 10.3390/cancers13092155.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such improvements were made possible by the incorporation of new diagnostic technologies, the effective administration of conventional chemotherapeutic agents, and the provision of better supportive care. With the 5-year survival rates now exceeding 90% in high-income countries, the goal for the next decade is to improve survival further toward 100% and to minimize treatment-related adverse effects. Based on genome-wide analyses, especially RNA-sequencing analyses, ALL can be classified into more than 20 B-lineage subtypes and more than 10 T-lineage subtypes with prognostic and therapeutic implications. Response to treatment is another critical prognostic factor, and detailed analysis of minimal residual disease can detect levels as low as one ALL cell among 1 million total cells. Such detailed analysis can facilitate the rational use of molecular targeted therapy and immunotherapy, which have emerged as new treatment strategies that can replace or reduce the use of conventional chemotherapy.","['Inaba, Hiroto', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Inaba H', 'Pui CH']",,"[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA21765/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'NA/American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210429,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,PMC8124693,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'advances', 'diagnosis', 'pediatric', 'treatment']",2021/05/06 06:00,2021/05/06 06:01,['2021/05/05 01:03'],"['2021/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/20 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/05 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/06 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm10091926 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm10091926 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2021 Apr 29;10(9). pii: jcm10091926. doi: 10.3390/jcm10091926.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Non-randomized studies suggest that the two drugs can stabilize AML and improve normal peripheral blood cell counts. In this context, we used a proteomic/phosphoproteomic strategy to investigate the in vivo effects of ATRA/VP on human AML cells. Before starting the combined treatment, AML responders showed increased levels of several proteins, especially those involved in neutrophil degranulation/differentiation, M phase regulation and the interconversion of nucleotide di- and triphosphates (i.e., DNA synthesis and binding). Several among the differentially regulated phosphorylation sites reflected differences in the regulation of RNA metabolism and apoptotic events at the same time point. These effects were mainly caused by increased cyclin dependent kinase 1 and 2 (CDK1/2), LIM domain kinase 1 and 2 (LIMK1/2), mitogen-activated protein kinase 7 (MAPK7) and protein kinase C delta (PRKCD) activity in responder cells. An extensive effect of in vivo treatment with ATRA/VP was the altered level and phosphorylation of proteins involved in the regulation of transcription/translation/RNA metabolism, especially in non-responders, but the regulation of cell metabolism, immune system and cytoskeletal functions were also affected. Our analysis of serial samples during the first week of treatment suggest that proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling can be used for the early identification of responders to ATRA/VP-based treatment.","['Hernandez-Valladares, Maria', 'Wangen, Rebecca', 'Aasebo, Elise', 'Reikvam, Hakon', 'Berven, Frode S', 'Selheim, Frode', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Hernandez-Valladares M', 'Wangen R', 'Aasebo E', 'Reikvam H', 'Berven FS', 'Selheim F', 'Bruserud O']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9347-7841', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6939-8059', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5439-8411']","['Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Proteomics Facility of the University of Bergen (PROBE), University of Bergen, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Proteomics Facility of the University of Bergen (PROBE), University of Bergen, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Proteomics Facility of the University of Bergen (PROBE), University of Bergen, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Proteomics Facility of the University of Bergen (PROBE), University of Bergen, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],['100933/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],['Journal Article'],20210429,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC8125016,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'all-trans retinoic acid', 'chemosensitivity', 'histone deacetylase', 'mass spectrometry', 'phosphoproteomics', 'proteomics', 'treatment', 'valproic acid']",2021/05/06 06:00,2021/05/06 06:01,['2021/05/05 01:02'],"['2021/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/05 01:02 [entrez]', '2021/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/06 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13092143 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13092143 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Apr 29;13(9). pii: cancers13092143. doi: 10.3390/cancers13092143.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) are molecules that recognise two different antigens and are used to engage effector cells, such as T-cells, to kill malignant B-cells. Several bispecific antibodies have entered early phase clinical development since the approval of the CD19/CD3 bispecific antibody, blinatumomab, for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Novel bsAbs include CD20/CD3 antibodies that are being investigated in both aggressive and indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma with encouraging overall response rates including complete remissions. These results are seen even in heavily pre-treated patient populations such as those who have relapsed after chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. Potential toxicities include cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity and tumour flare, with a number of strategies existing to mitigate these risks. Here, we review the development of bsAbs, their mechanism of action and the different types of bsAbs and how they differ in structure. We will present the currently available data from clinical trials regarding response rates, progression free survival and outcomes across a range of non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes. Finally, we will discuss the key toxicities of bsAbs, their rates and management of these adverse events.","['Salvaris, Ross', 'Ong, Jeremy', 'Gregory, Gareth P']","['Salvaris R', 'Ong J', 'Gregory GP']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1053-5503', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4170-0682']","['Monash Haematology, Monash Health, Clayton, VIC 3168, Australia.', 'School of Clinical Sciences at Monash Health, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3168, Australia.', 'Monash Haematology, Monash Health, Clayton, VIC 3168, Australia.', 'Monash Haematology, Monash Health, Clayton, VIC 3168, Australia.', 'School of Clinical Sciences at Monash Health, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3168, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210429,Switzerland,J Pers Med,Journal of personalized medicine,101602269,PMC8147062,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell lymphoma', 'bispecific antibodies', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)', 'immune cell therapy', 'neurotoxicity', 'tumour flare']",2021/05/06 06:00,2021/05/06 06:01,['2021/05/05 01:02'],"['2021/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/05 01:02 [entrez]', '2021/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/06 06:01 [medline]']","['jpm11050355 [pii]', '10.3390/jpm11050355 [doi]']",epublish,J Pers Med. 2021 Apr 29;11(5). pii: jpm11050355. doi: 10.3390/jpm11050355.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eleven MDS/AML-MRC samples were also available for analysis of selected metabolites, along with 17 additional samples from an independent validation cohort. Except for two patients, the others did not carry isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1/2 mutations. Transcriptional landscapes of the patients' HSPCs were comparable to those published previously, including decreased signatures of active cell cycling and DNA damage response in PD compared to RD and controls. In addition, PD-derived HSPCs revealed repressed markers of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, with IDH2 among the top 50 downregulated genes in PD compared to RD. Decreased citrate plasma levels, downregulated expression of the (ATP)-citrate lyase and other transcriptional/metabolic networks indicate metabolism-driven histone modifications in PD HSPCs. Observed histone deacetylation is consistent with transcription-nonpermissive chromatin configuration and quiescence of PD HSPCs. This study highlights the complexity of the molecular network underlying response/resistance to hypomethylating agents.","['Koralkova, Pavla', 'Belickova, Monika', 'Kundrat, David', 'Dostalova Merkerova, Michaela', 'Krejcik, Zdenek', 'Szikszai, Katarina', 'Kaisrlikova, Monika', 'Vesela, Jitka', 'Vyhlidalova, Pavla', 'Stetka, Jan', 'Hlavackova, Alzbeta', 'Suttnar, Jiri', 'Flodr, Patrik', 'Stritesky, Jan', 'Jonasova, Anna', 'Cermak, Jaroslav', 'Divoky, Vladimir']","['Koralkova P', 'Belickova M', 'Kundrat D', 'Dostalova Merkerova M', 'Krejcik Z', 'Szikszai K', 'Kaisrlikova M', 'Vesela J', 'Vyhlidalova P', 'Stetka J', 'Hlavackova A', 'Suttnar J', 'Flodr P', 'Stritesky J', 'Jonasova A', 'Cermak J', 'Divoky V']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7970-1501', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9158-881X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6345-9180', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2522-6749', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4301-2856', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4305-9718', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0202-245X']","['Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, 775 15 Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, 128 20 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, 128 20 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, 128 20 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, 128 20 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, 128 20 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, 128 20 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, 121 08 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, 128 20 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, 775 15 Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, 775 15 Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, 128 20 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, 128 20 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Clinical and Molecular Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc and University Hospital Olomouc, 775 15 Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Pathology, First Faculty of Medicine Charles University and General University Hospital, 128 08 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'First Department of Medicine, First Faculty of Medicine Charles University and General University Hospital, 128 08 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, 128 20 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, 775 15 Olomouc, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['NV16-33485A/Czech Health Research Council', '00023736/Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic', 'IGA_LF_2020_005/Internal Grant Agency of Palacky University']",['Journal Article'],20210430,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC8125503,['NOTNLM'],"['IDH2', 'azacitidine therapy', 'histone acetylation', 'metabolic signature', 'myelodysplastic syndromes']",2021/05/06 06:00,2021/05/06 06:01,['2021/05/05 01:01'],"['2021/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/22 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/05 01:01 [entrez]', '2021/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/06 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13092161 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13092161 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Apr 30;13(9). pii: cancers13092161. doi: 10.3390/cancers13092161.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, hematopoietic development requires a tight control of protein synthesis. Furthermore, translational deregulation strongly contributes to hematopoietic malignancies. Researchers have recently identified a new layer of gene expression regulation that consists of chemical modification of RNA species, which led to the birth of the epitranscriptomics field. RNA modifications provide an additional level of control in hematopoietic development by acting as post-transcriptional regulators of lineage-specific genetic programs. Other reviews have already described the important role of the N(6)-methylation of adenosine (m(6)A) within mRNA species in regulating hematopoietic differentiation and diseases. The aim of this review is to summarize the current status of the role of RNA modifications in the regulation of ribosome function, beyond m(6)A. In particular, we discuss the importance of RNA modifications in tRNA and rRNA molecules. By balancing translational rate and fidelity, they play an important role in regulating normal and malignant hematopoietic development.","['Fazi, Francesco', 'Fatica, Alessandro']","['Fazi F', 'Fatica A']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2910-7912', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0743-7905']","['Department of Anatomical, Histological, Forensic & Orthopedic Sciences, Section of Histology & Medical Embryology, Sapienza University of Rome, 00165 Rome, Italy.', 'Istituto Pasteur Italia-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, 00161 Rome, Italy.', ""Department of Biology and Biotechnology 'Charles Darwin', Sapienza University of Rome, 00165 Rome, Italy.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210430,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC8125340,['NOTNLM'],"['RNA modifications', 'epitranscriptomics', 'rRNA', 'tRNA']",2021/05/06 06:00,2021/05/27 06:00,['2021/05/05 01:01'],"['2021/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/27 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/05 01:01 [entrez]', '2021/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/27 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22094755 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22094755 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Apr 30;22(9). pii: ijms22094755. doi: 10.3390/ijms22094755.,20210526,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)', 'CLE6G00625 (N-methyladenosine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/genetics', 'Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'RNA/*genetics', '*RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Ribosomal/genetics', 'RNA, Transfer/genetics', 'Ribosomes/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we use over-expression of these MARCH proteins in the M1 myeloid leukaemia cell line and cell surface proteomic analyses to globally analyse other potential targets of these proteins. A large range of cell surface proteins regulated by more than one MARCH protein in addition to several MARCH protein-specific cell surface targets were identified most of which were downregulated by MARCH expression.

Integrin alpha4beta1 (VLA4 or VCAM-1 receptor) was downregulated only by MARCH2 and we showed that in MARCH2 knockout mice, Integrin alpha4 was upregulated specifically in mature B-lymphocytes and this was accompanied by decreased numbers of B-cells in the spleen.","['Sandow, Jarrod J', 'Webb, Andrew I', 'Stockwell, Dina', 'Kershaw, Nadia J', 'Tan, Cyrus', 'Ishido, Satoshi', 'Alexander, Warren S', 'Hilton, Douglas J', 'Babon, Jeffrey J', 'Nicola, Nicos A']","['Sandow JJ', 'Webb AI', 'Stockwell D', 'Kershaw NJ', 'Tan C', 'Ishido S', 'Alexander WS', 'Hilton DJ', 'Babon JJ', 'Nicola NA']",,"['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Microbiology, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Japan.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210519,Germany,Proteomics,Proteomics,101092707,,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cells', '*Integrins', '*MARCH', '*cell surface']",2021/05/05 06:00,2021/10/09 06:00,['2021/05/04 17:37'],"['2021/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/09 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/04 17:37 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pmic.202000244 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteomics. 2021 Jun;21(11-12):e2000244. doi: 10.1002/pmic.202000244.

However, the significance of low-burden TP53 mutations with <10% variant allele frequency (VAF) remains a matter for debate. Herein, we describe clonal evolution scenarios of low-burden TP53 mutations, the clinical impact of which we analyzed in a ""real-world"" CLL cohort. TP53 status was assessed by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) in 511 patients entering first-line treatment with chemo- and/or immunotherapy and 159 patients in relapse before treatment with targeted agents. Within the pretherapy cohort, 16% of patients carried low-burden TP53 mutations (0.1% to 10% VAF). Although their presence did not significantly shorten event-free survival after first-line therapy, it affected overall survival (OS). In a subgroup with TP53 mutations of 1% to 10% VAF, the impact on OS was observed only in patients with unmutated IGHV who had not received targeted therapy, as patients benefited from switching to targeted agents, regardless of initial TP53 mutational status. Analysis of the clonal evolution of low-burden TP53 mutations showed that the highest expansion rates were associated with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab regimen in both first- and second-line treatments (median VAF increase, 14.8x and 11.8x, respectively) in contrast to treatment with less intense treatment regimens (1.6x) and no treatment (0.8x). In the relapse cohort, 33% of patients carried low-burden TP53 mutations, which did not expand significantly upon targeted treatment (median VAF change, 1x). Sporadic cases of TP53 mutations' clonal shifts were connected with the development of resistance-associated mutations. Altogether, our data support the incorporation of low-burden TP53 variants in clinical decision making.","['Malcikova, Jitka', 'Pavlova, Sarka', 'Barbara, Kunt Vonkova', 'Radova, Lenka', 'Plevova, Karla', 'Kotaskova, Jana', 'Pal, Karol', 'Dvorackova, Barbara', 'Zenatova, Marcela', 'Hynst, Jakub', 'Ondrouskova, Eva', 'Panovska, Anna', 'Brychtova, Yvona', 'Zavacka, Kristyna', 'Tichy, Boris', 'Tom, Nikola', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Doubek, Michael', 'Pospisilova, Sarka']","['Malcikova J', 'Pavlova S', 'Barbara KV', 'Radova L', 'Plevova K', 'Kotaskova J', 'Pal K', 'Dvorackova B', 'Zenatova M', 'Hynst J', 'Ondrouskova E', 'Panovska A', 'Brychtova Y', 'Zavacka K', 'Tichy B', 'Tom N', 'Mayer J', 'Doubek M', 'Pospisilova S']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3650-6698', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1528-9743', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9725-3818', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8103-148X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6148-8877', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1672-7346', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7726-4691', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1085-8767', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3855-6085', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0079-845X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0830-0692', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4955-3039', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1038-870X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0753-051X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9252-7974', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7440-0515', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0567-9887', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1269-6282', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7136-2680']","['Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University;

Here, we characterize the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene gamma (GADD45g) as a novel tumor suppressor in AML. We show that GADD45g is preferentially silenced in AML, especially in AML with FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutations and mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearrangements, and reduced expression of GADD45g is correlated with poor prognosis in patients with AML. Upregulation of GADD45g impairs homologous recombination DNA repair, leading to DNA damage accumulation, and dramatically induces apoptosis, differentiation, and growth arrest and increases sensitivity of AML cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, without affecting normal cells. In addition, GADD45g is epigenetically silenced by histone deacetylation in AML, and its expression is further downregulated by oncogenes FLT3-ITD and MLL-AF9 in patients carrying these genetic abnormalities. Combination of the histone deacetylase 1/2 inhibitor romidepsin with the FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor AC220 or the bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 exerts synergistic antileukemic effects on FLT3-ITD+ and MLL-AF9+ AML, respectively, by dually activating GADD45g. These findings uncover hitherto unreported evidence for the selective antileukemic role of GADD45g and provide novel strategies for the treatment of FLT3-ITD+ and MLL-AF9+ AML.","['Guo, Dan', 'Zhao, Yangyang', 'Wang, Nan', 'You, Na', 'Zhu, Wenqi', 'Zhang, Peiwen', 'Ren, Qian', 'Yin, Jing', 'Cheng, Tao', 'Ma, Xiaotong']","['Guo D', 'Zhao Y', 'Wang N', 'You N', 'Zhu W', 'Zhang P', 'Ren Q', 'Yin J', 'Cheng T', 'Ma X']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, China;

Multiple efforts have focused on the determination of the genomic drivers of B-cell lymphoma subtypes. In the meantime, the aggregation of diverse tumors in pan-cancer genomic studies has become a useful tool to detect new driver genes, while enabling the comparison of mutational patterns across tumors. Here we present an integrated analysis of 354 B-cell lymphoid disorders. 112 recurrently mutated genes were discovered, of which KMT2D, CREBBP, IGLL5 and BCL2 were the most frequent, and 31 genes were putative new drivers. Mutations in CREBBP, TNFRSF14 and KMT2D predominated in follicular lymphoma, whereas those in BTG2, HTA-A and PIM1 were more frequent in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Additionally, we discovered 31 significantly mutated protein networks, reinforcing the role of genes such as CREBBP, EEF1A1, STAT6, GNA13 and TP53, but also pointing towards a myriad of infrequent players in lymphomagenesis. Finally, we report aberrant expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressors associated with novel noncoding mutations (DTX1 and S1PR2), and new recurrent copy number aberrations affecting immune check-point regulators (CD83, PVR) and B-cell specific genes (TNFRSF13C). Our analysis expands the number of mutational drivers of B-cell lymphoid neoplasms, and identifies several differential somatic events between disease subtypes.","['Mosquera Orgueira, Adrian',

Among hematopoietic stem cell neoplasms, depending on the criteria used for disease classification, monocytosis may be a consistent and integral component of diseases such as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia with monocytic differentiation, or it may represent an inconsistent finding that often provides a clue to the underlying genetic changes driving the neoplasm. The purpose of this review is to provide the readers with a laboratory-based approach to neoplastic monocytosis. RECENT FINDINGS: In-depth elucidation of the genomic landscape of myeloid neoplasms within the past few years has broadened our understanding of monocytosis and its implications for diagnosis and prognosis. Genetic findings also shed light on potential disease response - or lack thereof - to various therapeutic agents used in the setting of myeloid neoplasms. In this review, we provide our approach to diagnose neoplastic monocytosis in the context of case-based studies while incorporating the most recent literature on this topic.","['El Hussein, Siba', 'Khoury, Joseph D', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Loghavi, Sanam']","['El Hussein S', 'Khoury JD', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Loghavi S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1338-7107', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2621-3584', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6577-8006', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8980-3202']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. sloghavi@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210504,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Leukemia', '*Monocytosis', '*Myelodysplastic', '*Myeloid', '*Myelomonocytic', '*Myeloproliferative']",2021/05/05 06:00,2021/08/31 06:00,['2021/05/04 12:40'],"['2021/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/31 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/04 12:40 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-021-00625-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-021-00625-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2021 Jun;16(3):286-303. doi: 10.1007/s11899-021-00625-5.

Objective: To assess whether health literacy, contextual factors, or sociodemographic characteristics are associated with perception of voluntariness among parents who had consented for their child's participation in a leukemia therapeutic clinical trial. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study prospectively enrolled 97 parents of children diagnosed as having leukemia at Rady Children's Hospital San Diego, a large tertiary academic center in California, from 2014 to 2017. Health literacy, contextual factors (acculturation, decisional regret, and satisfaction with informed consent), sociodemographic characteristics, and perception of voluntariness after consenting for a therapeutic clinical trial were measured. Univariable and multivariable regression were used to determine significant associations. The analyses for the present study were conducted from May 2019 to May 2020. Exposures: Informed consent for a therapeutic leukemia clinical trial. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome of interest was perception of voluntariness and its associations with health literacy and other contextual factors (acculturation, decisional regret, and satisfaction with informed consent) and sociodemographic characteristics, including age, race/ethnicity, parental language, educational level, insurance type, marital status, and socioeconomic status. Results: Of 97 parents included, the majority were women (65 [67%]), married (71 [73%]), and of self-reported Hispanic ethnicity (50 [52%]). Lower perception of voluntariness was significantly associated with lower health literacy (r = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11-0.47; P = .004), Spanish language (x = -4.50, P = .05), lower acculturation if of Hispanic ethnicity (r = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.02-0.54; P = .05), greater decisional regret (r = -0.54; 95% CI, -0.67 to -0.38; P < .001), and lower satisfaction with informed consent (r = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.21-0.54; P < .001) in univariable analysis. Lower health literacy remained significantly associated with lower perception of voluntariness in multivariable analysis after adjustment for contextual factors and sociodemographic characteristics (beta = 4.06; 95% CI, 1.60-6.53; P = .001). Lower health literacy was significantly associated with Hispanic ethnicity (mean, 4.16; 95% CI, 3.75-4.57; P < .001), Spanish language spoken at home (mean, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.94-4.40; P < .001), high school or less educational level (mean, 3.41; 95% CI, 2.83-3.99; P < .001), public insurance (mean, 4.00; 95% CI, 3.55-4.45; P < .001), and unmarried status (mean, 3.71; 95% CI, 2.91-4.51; P = .03). Conclusions and Relevance: Among parents of children with newly diagnosed leukemia who had consented for their child's participation in a therapeutic clinical trial, lower perception of voluntariness was significantly associated with lower health literacy. These results suggest that parents with low health literacy may perceive external influences in their decision for their child's participation in clinical trials. This finding highlights the potential role of recruitment interventions tailored to the participant's health literacy level to improve voluntary informed consent in underserved populations.","['Aristizabal, Paula', 'Ma, Arissa K', 'Kumar, Nikhil V', 'Perdomo, Bianca P', 'Thornburg, Courtney D', 'Martinez, Maria Elena', 'Nodora, Jesse']","['Aristizabal P', 'Ma AK', 'Kumar NV', 'Perdomo BP', 'Thornburg CD', 'Martinez ME', 'Nodora J']",,"['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla.', ""Peckham Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Rady Children's Hospital San Diego, San Diego."", 'Population Sciences, Disparities and Community Engagement, University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla.', 'School of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla.', 'Now with MemorialCare Health System, Fountain Valley, California.', 'School of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla.', ""Peckham Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Rady Children's Hospital San Diego, San Diego."", 'Population Sciences, Disparities and Community Engagement, University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla.', ""Peckham Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Rady Children's Hospital San Diego, San Diego."", 'Population Sciences, Disparities and Community Engagement, University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla.', 'Department of Family Medicine and Public Health, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla.', 'Population Sciences, Disparities and Community Engagement, University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla.', 'Department of Family Medicine and Public Health, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla.']",['eng'],['K08 CA230306/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210503,United States,JAMA Netw Open,JAMA network open,101729235,PMC8097494,,,2021/05/05 06:00,2022/01/01 06:00,['2021/05/04 12:34'],"['2021/05/04 12:34 [entrez]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['2779441 [pii]', '10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.9038 [doi]']",epublish,JAMA Netw Open. 2021 May 3;4(5):e219038. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.9038.,20211231,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'California', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', '*Health Literacy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Informed Consent', '*Leukemia', 'Male', '*Parents', '*Patient Selection', 'Prospective Studies', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) that target the BCR-ABL oncoprotein has led to dramatic improvement in CML management. However, some challenges remain to be addressed in the TKI era, including patient stratification and the selection of frontline TKIs and CML progression. Additionally, with the emerging goal of treatment-free remission (TFR) in CML management, biomarkers that predict the outcomes of stopping TKI remain to be identified. Notably, recent reports have revealed the power of genome screening in understanding the role of genome aberrations other than BCR-ABL1 in CML pathogenesis. These studies have discovered the presence of disease-phase specific mutations and linked certain mutations to inferior responses to TKI treatment and CML progression. A personalized approach that incorporates genetic data in tailoring treatment strategies has been successfully implemented in acute leukemia, and it represents a promising approach for the management of high-risk CML patients. In this article, we will review current knowledge about the mutational profile in different phases of CML as well as patterns of mutational dynamics in patients having different outcomes. We highlight the effects of somatic mutations involving certain genes (e.g. epigenetic modifiers) on the outcomes of TKI treatment. We also discuss the potential value of incorporating genetic data in treatment decisions and the routine care of CML patients as a future direction for optimizing CML management.","['Adnan-Awad, Shady', 'Kankainen, Matti', 'Mustjoki, Satu']","['Adnan-Awad S', 'Kankainen M', 'Mustjoki S']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0816-8241'],"['Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Translational Immunology Research Program and Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Translational Immunology Research Program and Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'iCAN Digital Precision Cancer Medicine Flagship, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Translational Immunology Research Program and Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'iCAN Digital Precision Cancer Medicine Flagship, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210504,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*blast phase', '*personalized medicine', '*risk stratification', '*somatic mutations']",2021/05/05 06:00,2021/05/05 06:00,['2021/05/04 12:24'],"['2021/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/04 12:24 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2021.1894652 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2021 Sep;62(9):2064-2078. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2021.1894652.

Within the multiple de-regulated pathways affecting CLL homeostasis, the CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) grants homing of CLL cells into the LN where protective environments foster tumor progression. To cover the lack of specific therapies targeting the CCR7-dependence of CLL to enter into the LN, and aiming to displace the disease from LN, we generated CAP-100, an antibody that specifically binds to hCCR7 and neutralizes its ligand-binding site and signaling. In various in vitro and in vivo preclinical models CAP-100 strongly inhibited CCR7-induced migration, extravasation, homing, and survival in CLL samples. Moreover, it triggered potent tumor cell killing, mediated by host immune mechanisms, and was effective in xenograft models of high-risk disease. Additionally, CAP-100 showed a favorable toxicity profile on relevant hematopoietic subsets. Our results validated CAP-100 as a novel therapeutic tool to prevent the access of CLL cells, and other neoplasia with nodal-dependence, into the LN niches, thus hitting a central hub in the pathogenesis of cancer. The first-in-human clinical trial (NCT04704323), which will evaluate this novel therapeutic approach in CLL patients, is pending.","['Cuesta-Mateos, Carlos', 'Juarez-Sanchez, Raquel', 'Mateu-Albero, Tamara', 'Loscertales, Javier', 'Mol, Wim', 'Terron, Fernando', 'Munoz-Calleja, Cecilia']","['Cuesta-Mateos C', 'Juarez-Sanchez R', 'Mateu-Albero T', 'Loscertales J', 'Mol W', 'Terron F', 'Munoz-Calleja C']",,"['Immed S.L., Immunological and Medicinal Products, Madrid, Spain.', 'Catapult Therapeutics, Lelystad, The Netherlands.', 'Immunology Department, Hospital Universitario De La Princesa, IIS-IP, Madrid, Spain.', 'Immed S.L., Immunological and Medicinal Products, Madrid, Spain.', 'Immunology Department, Hospital Universitario De La Princesa, IIS-IP, Madrid, Spain.', 'Immunology Department, Hospital Universitario De La Princesa, IIS-IP, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario De La Princesa, IIS-IP, Madrid, Spain.', 'Catapult Therapeutics, Lelystad, The Netherlands.', 'Pepscan, Lelystad, The Netherlands.', 'Immed S.L., Immunological and Medicinal Products, Madrid, Spain.', 'Catapult Therapeutics, Lelystad, The Netherlands.', 'Immunology Department, Hospital Universitario De La Princesa, IIS-IP, Madrid, Spain.', 'Medicine Faculty, Universidad Autonoma De Madrid, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,MAbs,mAbs,101479829,PMC8098074,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAP-100', '*CCR7', '*CLL', '*antibody', '*immunotherapy', '*lymph node']",2021/05/05 06:00,2021/12/29 06:00,['2021/05/04 12:24'],"['2021/05/04 12:24 [entrez]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/19420862.2021.1917484 [doi]'],ppublish,MAbs. 2021 Jan-Dec;13(1):1917484. doi: 10.1080/19420862.2021.1917484.,20211228,"['0 (Antibodies, Blocking)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCR7 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Blocking/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis/*pathology', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'Mice', 'Receptors, CCR7/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We used flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to investigate the direct effect of HTLV-1 on B-cell activating factors produced by established FDC like cells obtained from excised human tonsils. We then measured the serum B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and C-X-C motif ligand (CXCL) 13 concentrations of the HTLV-1-seropositive SS patients and the HTLV-1-seronegative SS patients by ELISA. RESULTS: Among the 31 isolated specimens, 22 showed morphological characteristics of FDCs. Day 2-cultured specimens showed expressions of CD14, CD23, CD40, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. After 2 weeks, 12 of these specimens expressed ICAM-1, FDC, and fibroblast cell marker. Intracellular BAFF and CXCL13 were constitutively expressed regardless of stimulation. After direct coculture with the HTLV-1-infected T-cell line HCT-5 or MT-2, the BAFF and CXCL13 expressions on the FDC-like cells were decreased in accord with the increased number of HCT-5 and MT-2 cells with styliform change and without HTLV-1 Gag protein expression. Interferons upregulated the concentration of BAFF (but not CXCL13) in the culture supernatant, which showed a declining trend under the presence of HCT-5 or MT-2. The serum concentrations of BAFF and CXCL13 in the HTLV-1-seropositive SS patients were lower than those of the HTLV-1 seronegative SS patients. CONCLUSIONS: HTLV-1 partially inhibited the BAFF and CXCL13 expressions of established FDC-like cells.","['Takatani, Ayuko', 'Nakamura, Hideki', 'Furukawa, Kaori', 'Endo, Yushiro', 'Umeda, Masataka', 'Shimizu, Toshimasa', 'Nishihata, Shin-Ya', 'Kitaoka, Kyoko', 'Nakamura, Tatsufumi', 'Kawakami, Atsushi']","['Takatani A', 'Nakamura H', 'Furukawa K', 'Endo Y', 'Umeda M', 'Shimizu T', 'Nishihata SY', 'Kitaoka K', 'Nakamura T', 'Kawakami A']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5837-6348'],"['Division of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Division of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Division of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Division of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Division of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Division of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Division of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Social Work, Faculty of Human and Social Studies, Nagasaki International University, Sasebo, Japan.', 'Division of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210504,England,Immun Inflamm Dis,"Immunity, inflammation and disease",101635460,PMC8342235,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell activating factor', '*FDC', '*HTLV-1', ""*Sjogren's syndrome"", '*follicular dendritic cell']",2021/05/05 06:00,2021/10/16 06:00,['2021/05/04 08:54'],"['2021/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/04 08:54 [entrez]']",['10.1002/iid3.432 [doi]'],ppublish,Immun Inflamm Dis. 2021 Sep;9(3):777-791. doi: 10.1002/iid3.432.

A 68-year-old man was bitten on the forearm by a 3-year-old child. Rapid progression of infection, severe local and systemic poisoning, and diverse clinical manifestations were observed at presentation. Based on the medical history, physical signs, imaging examinations (X-ray films, color Doppler ultrasound, and computed tomography), laboratory examinations, and multidisciplinary consultation, the patient was diagnosed with gas gangrene or gas gangrene-like changes. Twenty-four hours after the injury, an emergency amputation was performed (open amputation with wound closure after 1 week). After the operation, the patient was sent to the intensive care unit for isolation and further anti-infection and anti-shock treatments. His condition gradually improved after treatment and he was discharged without further complications. Bacteriological and pathological examinations indicated Aeromonas hydrophila infection leading to extensive necrotizing fasciitis of the limb and severe systemic poisoning. In addition, pre-existing myelodysplastic syndrome progressing to acute myeloid leukemia was identified as a possible predisposing factor. Human bites can cause serious infections requiring timely treatment, particularly in patients with predisposing comorbidities.","['Zhu, Guozheng', 'Zeng, Canjun', 'Yuan, Song', 'Li, Runguang']","['Zhu G', 'Zeng C', 'Yuan S', 'Li R']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4703-7180'],"['Division of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Department of Orthopedics, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Department of Foot and Ankle Surgery, Center for Orthopaedic Surgery, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510610, China.', 'Orthopaedic Hospital of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou 510610, China.', 'Academy of Orthopaedics, Guangdong Province, Guangzhou 510610, China.', ""Department of Orthopedics, Linzhi People's Hospital, Linzhi 860000, China."", 'Department of Foot and Ankle Surgery, Center for Orthopaedic Surgery, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510610, China.', 'Orthopaedic Hospital of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou 510610, China.', 'Academy of Orthopaedics, Guangdong Province, Guangzhou 510610, China.', ""Department of Orthopedics, Linzhi People's Hospital, Linzhi 860000, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,J Int Med Res,The Journal of international medical research,0346411,PMC8113944,['NOTNLM'],"['Aeromonas hydrophila', 'Human bite', 'amputation', 'case report', 'gas gangrene', 'severe necrotizing fasciitis']",2021/05/05 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2021/05/04 08:39'],"['2021/05/04 08:39 [entrez]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/03000605211012201 [doi]'],ppublish,J Int Med Res. 2021 May;49(5):3000605211012201. doi: 10.1177/03000605211012201.,20210514,,IM,"['Aeromonas hydrophila', 'Aged', 'Amputation', '*Bites, Human', 'Child, Preschool', 'Emergency Service, Hospital', '*Fasciitis, Necrotizing/diagnostic imaging/surgery', 'Humans', 'Male']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously found that a peptide-capped gold cluster (Au25Sv9) can target on the aberrant oxidative stress in CLL cells to specially inhibit thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) activity, resulting in significant apoptosis. However, the required doses of the gold cluster for inducing apoptosis are high, restricting its potential for further applications. Notably, the most recent studies suggested that CLL cells overexpressed antiapoptotic BCL-2 protein to prevent chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, indicating that BCL-2 could be a promising target for CLL therapy. Regrettably, the nonmitochondrial-targeted Au25Sv9 has little effect on BCL-2. In this study, we successfully screened a modified BADBH3 peptide (B1P) that could antagonize BCL-2 protein in CLL cells. We found that B1P could effectively sensitize MEC-1 cells to a subliminal dose of Au25Sv9. To simplify the treatment regimen, we directly fabricated a gold cluster capped with the B1P peptides by one-step synthesis to integrate the BCL-2 antagonistic activity into the gold the cluster, named BGC. We already found that low doses of BGC could significantly induce more apoptosis in MEC-1 cells than equivalent doses of the Au25Sv9 cluster or B1P peptide alone. Mechanistically, in addition to the inherent inhibitory effect of gold clusters on TrxR activity, BGC could bind to BCL-2 on mitochondria and activate the BCL-2 family-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis cascade more effectively. These results demonstrated that antagonizing the overexpressed BCL-2 in CLL cells, together with inhibiting TrxR simultaneously by a single gold cluster, is a promising strategy for the treatment of CLL cells. This study will provide a paradigm and reference for the development of functionalized gold clusters with rationally designed peptides, and opens up a new opportunity for the treatment of CLL in clinical settings.","['Yao, Yawen', 'Lu, Cao', 'Gao, Liang', 'Cao, Kai', 'Yuan, Hui', 'Zhang, Xiangchun', 'Gao, Xueyun', 'Yuan, Qing']","['Yao Y', 'Lu C', 'Gao L', 'Cao K', 'Yuan H', 'Zhang X', 'Gao X', 'Yuan Q']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9337-345X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2267-9945', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4058-5931']","['Department of Chemistry and Biology, Faculty of Environment and Life Science, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China.', 'Center of Excellence for Environmental Safety and Biological Effects, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biology, Faculty of Environment and Life Science, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China.', 'Center of Excellence for Environmental Safety and Biological Effects, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biology, Faculty of Environment and Life Science, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China.', 'Center of Excellence for Environmental Safety and Biological Effects, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biology, Faculty of Environment and Life Science, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China.', 'Center of Excellence for Environmental Safety and Biological Effects, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.', 'Tea Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou 310008, China.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biology, Faculty of Environment and Life Science, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China.', 'Center of Excellence for Environmental Safety and Biological Effects, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biology, Faculty of Environment and Life Science, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China.', 'Center of Excellence for Environmental Safety and Biological Effects, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210504,United States,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,ACS applied materials & interfaces,101504991,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL-2 antagonist peptide', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'gold clusters', 'mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis', 'thioredoxin reductase']",2021/05/05 06:00,2021/08/28 06:00,['2021/05/04 08:38'],"['2021/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/04 08:38 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acsami.1c05550 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces. 2021 May 12;13(18):21108-21118. doi: 10.1021/acsami.1c05550.

It is typically treated with high-dose methotrexate-based regimens. Outcomes are dismal and clinical trials are lacking. It is almost always Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) associated. Two patients (CA1-2) presented with EBV-associated PCNSL after renal transplant. CA1 was on hemodialysis and had prior disseminated cryptococcus and pseudomonas bronchiectasis, precluding treatment with methotrexate. CA2 was refractory to methotrexate. Both were treated off-label with the first-generation Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib for 12 months. Cerebrospinal fluid penetration at therapeutic levels was confirmed in CA1 despite hemodialysis. Both patients entered remission by 2 months. Sequencing confirmed absence of genetic aberrations in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I/II and antigen-presentation/processing genes, indicating retention of the ability to present EBV-antigens. Between Weeks 10 and 13, they received third-party EBV-specific T cells for consolidation with no adverse effects. They remain in remission >/=34 months since therapy began.

Gene mutations have a strong potential for involvement in pathogenesis and may have potential effects on the clinical manifestations. Gene mutations may even be associated with early death (ED) in APL patients. However, there is little published information on mutations in APL patients and whether they are attributed to early death. METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical data and gene mutations of 134 de novo APL patients. We detected the gene mutations by next-generation sequencing (NGS) to investigate the genetic predictors of early death in APL patients. According to the number of gene mutations per patient, the 134 APL patients were divided into three groups. All patients received arsenic trioxide (ATO) alone as induction therapy. The clinical data and gene mutations were compared and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 134 APL patients were involved in the study. The clinical data of sex, WBC, PT, and DD, UA, and LDH level were significantly different between the three groups (P = 0.000, P = 0.000, P = 0.009, P = 0.020, P = 0.030, P = 0.001 and P = 0.014, respectively). Meanwhile, among them, the Sanz risk stratification and early death rate were significantly different (P = 0.001). The early death rate was 10.4%, and the median time to early death was 6.6 days (range 2-15 days). For the next-generation sequencing, a mean of 1.28 +/- 1.06 mutations per patient was detected (range: 0-5). The univariate and the multivariate regression analysis showed that age > 50[HR = 1.666, CI (1.027-2.702), P = 0.039], high WBC count [HR = 4.702, CI (1.026-21.543), P = 0.046] and low ALB levels [HR = 4.547, CI (1.088-18.995), P = 0.038] were independent risk factors for early death in APL patients. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, univariate analysis, and the multivariate regression analysis showed that patients with multiple gene mutations [HR = 2.258, CI (1.115-4.571), P = 0.024], KRAS [HR = 5.136, CI (1.356-19.455), P = 0.016] and/or GATA2 [HR = 4.070, CI (1.287-12.877), P = 0.017] have a significantly higher early death rate. CONCLUSION: The results of this investigation show that both molecular markers and clinical variables should be used as potential predictors for early death in APL patients. Our results suggested that age > 50, high WBC count, low ALB levels, and the presence of multiple gene mutations, KRAS and/or GATA2 at the time of diagnosis were independent risk factors for early death in APL patients. For these patients, clinicians should be more cautious during the course of induction treatment.","['Chen, Xiaotong', 'Fan, Shengjin', 'Zhao, Yanqiu', 'Zhou, Jin']","['Chen X', 'Fan S', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhou J']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4367-0605'],"['The first Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'The first Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'The first Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'The first Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China. zhoujin1111@126.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210503,Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'Early death', 'GATA2', 'Gene mutations', 'KRAS', 'Next-generation sequencing']",2021/05/05 06:00,2021/12/29 06:00,['2021/05/04 07:00'],"['2021/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/29 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/04 07:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12094-021-02625-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s12094-021-02625-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2021 Oct;23(10):2171-2180. doi: 10.1007/s12094-021-02625-6.

This prospective registry aimed to evaluate outcomes of ponatinib treatment in routine practice over 3 years (2016-2019) in Belgium (NCT03678454). Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were treated with ponatinib per current label. Fifty patients (33 CML and 17 Ph+ ALL) were enrolled. Fifty-five percent of CML and 29% of Ph+ ALL patients had received >/=3 prior tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Reasons for starting ponatinib were intolerance (40%), relapse or refractoriness (28%) to previous TKIs, progression (16%), or T315I mutation (16%). Median follow-up was 15 months for CML and 4.5 months for Ph+ ALL patients. Best response was a major molecular response in 58% of CML and 41% of Ph+ ALL patients. Of 20 patients who started ponatinib due to intolerance to previous TKIs, 9 (64%) CML and 4 (67%) Ph+ ALL achieved a major molecular response. Three-year estimates of overall survival were 85.3% and 85.6%, respectively, in CML and Ph+ ALL patients; estimated progression-free survival was 81.6% and 48.9%. Adverse reactions were reported in 34 patients (68%); rash (26%) and dry skin (10%) were most common. Reported cardiovascular adverse reactions included vascular stenosis (3), arterial hypertension (2), chest pain (1), palpitations (1), and vascular occlusion (1). This Belgian registry confirms results from the PACE clinical trial and supports routine ponatinib use in CML and Ph+ ALL patients who are resistant or intolerant to previous TKIs or with the T315I mutation.","['Devos, Timothy', 'Havelange, Violaine', 'Theunissen, Koen', 'Meers, Stef', 'Benghiat, Fleur Samantha', 'Gadisseur, Alain', 'Vanstraelen, Gaetan', 'Vellemans, Helene', 'Bailly, Benjamin', 'Granacher, Nikki', 'Lewalle, Philippe', 'De Becker, Ann', 'Van Eygen, Koen', 'Janssen, Mia', 'Triffet, Agnes', 'Vrelust, Inge', 'Deeren, Dries', 'Mazure, Dominiek', 'Bekaert, Julie', 'Beck, Michael', 'Selleslag, Dominik']","['Devos T', 'Havelange V', 'Theunissen K', 'Meers S', 'Benghiat FS', 'Gadisseur A', 'Vanstraelen G', 'Vellemans H', 'Bailly B', 'Granacher N', 'Lewalle P', 'De Becker A', 'Van Eygen K', 'Janssen M', 'Triffet A', 'Vrelust I', 'Deeren D', 'Mazure D', 'Bekaert J', 'Beck M', 'Selleslag D']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6881-417X'],"['Department of Hematology, University Hospitals Leuven and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Laboratory of Molecular Immunology (Rega Institute), KU Leuven, Campus Gasthuisberg, Herestraat 49, B-3000, Leuven, Belgium. timothy.devos@uzleuven.be.', 'UCL Saint-Luc, Woluwe-Saint-Lambert, Belgium.', 'Jessa Ziekenhuis, Hasselt, Belgium.', 'Algemeen Ziekenhuis Klina, Brasschaat, Belgium.', 'Hopital Erasme, Bruxelles, Belgium.', 'Universitair Ziekenhuis Antwerpen, Edegem, Belgium.', 'CHR Verviers, Verviers, Belgium.', 'CHU UCL Namur, Site Godinne, Yvoir, Belgium.', 'Hopital de Jolimont, Haine-Saint-Paul, Belgium.', 'Ziekenhuis Netwerk Antwerpen Stuivenberg, Antwerpen, Belgium.', 'Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Bruxelles, Belgium.', 'Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel, Jette, Belgium.', 'Algemeen Ziekenhuis Groeninge, Kortrijk, Belgium.', 'Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg, Genk, Belgium.', 'Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Charleroi Vesale, Charleroi, Belgium.', 'Algemeen Ziekenhuis Sint-Elisabeth, Turnhout, Belgium.', 'Algemeen Ziekenhuis Delta, Roeselare, Belgium.', 'Universitair Ziekenhuis Gent, Gent, Belgium.', 'Incyte Biosciences International sarl, Morges, Switzerland.', 'Incyte Biosciences Benelux B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Algemeen Ziekenhuis Sint-Jan Brugge, Brugge, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Not applicable/Incyte Biosciences Benelux BV'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study']",20210504,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,PMC8195783,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Ponatinib', '*Registry', '*Routine clinical practice']",2021/05/05 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2021/05/04 06:57'],"['2020/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/04 06:57 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-021-04507-x [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-021-04507-x [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2021 Jul;100(7):1723-1732. doi: 10.1007/s00277-021-04507-x.

However, the biological function of only a small fraction of DUBs, especially in adaptive immune response regulation, is well-defined. In this study, we identified DUB ubiquitin-specific peptidase 12 (USP12) as a critical regulator of CD4(+) T cell activation. USP12 plays an intrinsic role in promoting the CD4(+) T cell phenotype, including differentiation, activation, and proliferation. Although USP12-deficient CD4(+) T cells protected mice from autoimmune diseases, the immune response against bacterial infection was subdued. USP12 stabilized B cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) by deubiquitinating, and thereby activated the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Interestingly, this USP12 regulatory mechanism was identified in CD4(+) T cells, but not in CD8(+) T cells. Our study results showed that USP12 activated CD4(+) T cell signaling, and targeting USP12 might help develop therapeutic interventions for treating inflammatory diseases or pathogen infections.","['Fu, Yuling', 'Wang, Peng', 'Zhao, Jingjing', 'Tan, Yunke', 'Sheng, Junli', 'He, Shitong', 'Du, Xialin', 'Huang, Yulan', 'Yang, Yalong', 'Li, Jinling', 'Cai, Yuxiong', 'Liu, Yuxuan', 'Hu, Shengfeng']","['Fu Y', 'Wang P', 'Zhao J', 'Tan Y', 'Sheng J', 'He S', 'Du X', 'Huang Y', 'Yang Y', 'Li J', 'Cai Y', 'Liu Y', 'Hu S']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1961-6465', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7901-4410']","['Institute of Molecular Immunology, School of Laboratory Medicine and Biotechnology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Biotherapy, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Immunology, School of Laboratory Medicine and Biotechnology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Immunology, School of Laboratory Medicine and Biotechnology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Immunology, School of Laboratory Medicine and Biotechnology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Immunology, School of Laboratory Medicine and Biotechnology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Immunology, School of Laboratory Medicine and Biotechnology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Immunology, School of Laboratory Medicine and Biotechnology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Immunology, School of Laboratory Medicine and Biotechnology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Immunology, School of Laboratory Medicine and Biotechnology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Immunology, School of Laboratory Medicine and Biotechnology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China. hushengfeng@smu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['81971805, 81501137/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)', '81402560/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)', '81901614, 32070906/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)', '2020A1515010158/Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (Guangdong', 'Natural Science Foundation)', '2019A1515011103/Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (Guangdong', 'Natural Science Foundation)', '201804010061/Guangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Project']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210503,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,PMC8481463,,,2021/05/05 06:00,2021/05/05 06:00,['2021/05/04 06:46'],"['2020/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/04 06:46 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41418-021-00787-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41418-021-00787-y [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2021 Oct;28(10):2857-2870. doi: 10.1038/s41418-021-00787-y.

Paralleling the pathology of other cancers, AML tumorigenesis and propagation can be ascribed to dysregulated cellular processes, including apoptosis. This function and others are regulated by tumor suppressor P53, which plays a pivotal role in leukemogenesis. Opposing P53-mediated activities is the mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), which promotes P53 degradation. Because the TP53 mutation rate is low, and MDM2 frequently overexpressed, in patients with leukemia, targeting the MDM2-P53 axis to restore P53 function has emerged as an attractive AML treatment strategy. APG-115 is a potent MDM2 inhibitor under clinical development for patients with solid tumors. In cellular cultures and animal models of AML, we demonstrate that APG-115 exerted substantial antileukemic activity, as either a single agent or when combined with standard-of-care (SOC) hypomethylating agents azacitidine (AZA) and decitabine (DAC), or the DNA-damaging agent cytarabine (Ara-C). By activating the P53/P21 pathway, APG-115 exhibited potent antiproliferative and apoptogenic activities, and induced cell cycle arrest, in TP53 wild-type AML lines. In vivo, APG-115 significantly reduced tumor burden and prolonged survival. Combinations of APG-115 with SOC treatments elicited synergistic antileukemic activity. To explain these effects, we propose that APG-115 and SOC agents augment AML cell killing by complementarily activating the P53/P21 pathway and upregulating DNA damage. These findings and the emerging mechanism of action afford a sound scientific rationale to evaluate APG-115 (with or without SOC therapies) in patients with AML.","['Fang, Douglas D', 'Tang, Qiuqiong', 'Kong, Yanhui', 'Rong, Tao', 'Wang, Qixin', 'Li, Na', 'Fang, Xu', 'Gu, Jiaxing', 'Xiong, Dengkun', 'Yin, Yan', 'Deng, Jing', 'Yang, Dajun', 'Zhai, Yifan']","['Fang DD', 'Tang Q', 'Kong Y', 'Rong T', 'Wang Q', 'Li N', 'Fang X', 'Gu J', 'Xiong D', 'Yin Y', 'Deng J', 'Yang D', 'Zhai Y']",,"['Ascentage Pharma (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., 218 Xinghu Street, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Ascentage Pharma (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., 218 Xinghu Street, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Ascentage Pharma (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., 218 Xinghu Street, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Ascentage Pharma (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., 218 Xinghu Street, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Ascentage Pharma (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., 218 Xinghu Street, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Ascentage Pharma (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., 218 Xinghu Street, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Ascentage Pharma (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., 218 Xinghu Street, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Ascentage Pharma (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., 218 Xinghu Street, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Ascentage Pharma (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., 218 Xinghu Street, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Ascentage Pharma (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., 218 Xinghu Street, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Ascentage Pharma (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., 218 Xinghu Street, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Ascentage Pharma (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., 218 Xinghu Street, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China. yangdj@sysucc.org.cn.', 'Department of Experimental Research, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China. yangdj@sysucc.org.cn.', 'Ascentage Pharma (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., 218 Xinghu Street, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China. yzhai@ascentage.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210503,United States,Cell Death Discov,Cell death discovery,101665035,PMC8093284,,,2021/05/05 06:00,2021/05/05 06:01,['2021/05/04 06:29'],"['2020/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/04 06:29 [entrez]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41420-021-00465-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41420-021-00465-5 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Discov. 2021 May 3;7(1):90. doi: 10.1038/s41420-021-00465-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow samples from CML patients and normal bone marrow samples from healthy controls were collected. HOTAIR, DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, and PTEN expression was detected. The biological characteristics of CML cells were detected. The relationship among HOTAIR, DNMT1, and PTEN was verified. Tumor volume and weight in mice injected with CML cells were tested. We found that HOTAIR and DNMT1 expression was increased and PTEN expression was decreased in CML. We also investigated whether downregulated HOTAIR or DNMT1 reduced proliferation, colony formation, invasion, and migration and increased the apoptosis rate of CML cells. Moreover, we tested whether low expression of HOTAIR or DNMT1 reduced the volume and weight of tumors in mice with CML. Collectively, the results of this studied showed that depleted HOTAIR demonstrated reduced binding to DNMT1 to suppress CML progression, which may be related to methylation of the PTEN promoter.","['Song, Haiping', 'Chen, Lijuan', 'Liu, Wei', 'Xu, Xiaoli', 'Zhou, Yongming', 'Zhu, Jianhua', 'Chen, Xuexing', 'Li, Ziping', 'Zhou, Hao']","['Song H', 'Chen L', 'Liu W', 'Xu X', 'Zhou Y', 'Zhu J', 'Chen X', 'Li Z', 'Zhou H']",,"['Breast and Thyroid Surgery Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Foshan No.1 People's Hospital, Fosan, China."", 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Tianyou Hospital, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Immunology, Wuhan No. 1 Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. zhouhao@hust.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210503,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,PMC8093289,,,2021/05/05 06:00,2021/10/16 06:00,['2021/05/04 06:29'],"['2020/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/04 06:29 [entrez]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-021-03637-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-021-03637-4 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2021 May 3;12(5):440. doi: 10.1038/s41419-021-03637-4.,20211015,"['0 (HOTAIR long untranslated RNA, human)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNMT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1/*metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Pretreatment patient-reported fatigue was assessed with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue questionnaire in a sample of 463 newly diagnosed patients with AML who were enrolled in a clinical trial. Multivariable linear regression models were used to estimate the adjusted mean differences in fatigue between patients with AML and adults from the general population (n=847) by AML disease risk categories. A clinically meaningful difference in fatigue was defined as >/=3 points. Univariable and multivariable linear regression models were used to identify sociodemographic, clinical and molecular correlates of worse fatigue in patients with AML. RESULTS: Patients with AML reported adjusted mean fatigue scores that were 7.5 points worse than the general population (95% CI -8.6 to -6.4, p<0.001). Across AML disease risk categories, adjusted mean differences in fatigue compared with the general population ranged from 6.7 points worse (patients with favourable risk: 95% CI -8.6 to -4.8, p<0.001) to 8.9 points worse (patients with poor risk, 95% CI -10.5 to -7.2, p<0.001). Overall, 91% of patients with AML reported fatigue that was equal to or worse than the general population's median fatigue score.

CONCLUSIONS: Patients with newly diagnosed AML reported worse fatigue than the general population, and mean differences exceeded twice the threshold for clinical significance.

We aimed to determine the outcomes and prognostic factors of adolescent patients treated at our institution. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2005 and 2017, 335 adolescents with ALL were enrolled; clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes were analyzed and compared between adolescents and younger children (1-9 years old, n = 704). RESULTS: Adolescents were more likely to have high-risk factors such as hyperleukocytosis, a T-cell immunophenotype, BCR-ABL1, and/or poor early treatment responses. Compared with younger children, adolescents had significantly worse 5-year event-free survival (EFS) (73.0% +/- 2.5% vs. 82.6% +/- 1.5%; P < .001) and overall survival (OS) (77.1% +/- 2.3% vs. 87.7% +/- 1.3%; P < .001). Furthermore, younger adolescents (10-14 years) tended to have better outcomes compared with those older than 15 years (5-year OS: 79.3% +/- 2.5% vs. 68.4% +/- 5.7%; P = .042), mainly because of the lower frequencies of toxicities. On multivariate analysis, white blood count >/= 50 x 10(9)/L and extramedullary involvement at diagnosis were the most powerful prognostic factors for both OS and EFS. CONCLUSION: The outcomes among adolescent patients were not as good as that of younger children. Further studies are required to define optimal treatment strategies for adolescents, particularly those aged 15 to 17 years.","['Wang, Yu', 'Xue, Yu-Juan', 'Jia, Yue-Ping', 'Zuo, Ying-Xi', 'Lu, Ai-Dong', 'Zhang, Le-Ping']","['Wang Y', 'Xue YJ', 'Jia YP', 'Zuo YX', 'Lu AD', 'Zhang LP']",,"[""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China.

The treatment and prophylaxis of thrombosis are controversial due to the high risk of bleeding caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and thrombocytopenia. To the best of our knowledge we report the first case of APL in a patient with prosthetic heart valves successfully treated with a combination of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO). We hope this case report helps clinicians to manage different spectra of coagulopathy in APL successfully. CASE PRESENTATION: A 38-year-old Asian man presented with diagnosis of APL confirmed by bone marrow biopsy. He was on warfarin due to prosthetic mitral and aortic valves. He was at risk of both hemorrhagic events due to DIC and life-threatening valve thrombosis. Our management regimen included unfractionated heparin adjusted according to the platelet count to prevent both valve thrombosis and bleeding events. The patient tolerated treatment well without any hemorrhagic or thrombotic events, and complete molecular remission was achieved by ATRA and ATO without the need for chemotherapeutic agents. CONCLUSION: Although this case is exceptional, a precise evaluation may be needed to select the appropriate dose and type of anticoagulant to treat a patient with APL.","['Haghighat, Shirin', 'Rezvani, Alireza', 'Mokhtari, Maral']","['Haghighat S', 'Rezvani A', 'Mokhtari M']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3847-9577'],"['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences-Namazi Hospital, Zand Avenue, Shiraz, Iran. sh.haghighat2010@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Faghihi Hospital-Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20210504,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,PMC8094532,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'Case report', 'DIC', 'Thrombosis', 'Treatment']",2021/05/05 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2021/05/04 05:56'],"['2020/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/04 05:56 [entrez]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13256-021-02825-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s13256-021-02825-2 [pii]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2021 May 4;15(1):260. doi: 10.1186/s13256-021-02825-2.,20210514,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide/therapeutic use', 'Heart Valves', 'Heparin/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The emerging bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), which recruit T cells to tumor cells, exemplified by bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs), have facilitated the development of tumor immunotherapy. Here we discussed the advances and challenges in BiTE therapy developed for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Blinatumomab, the first BiTE approved for the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), is appreciated for its high efficacy and safety. Recent studies have focused on improving the efficacy of BiTEs by optimizing treatment regimens and refining the molecular structures of BiTEs. A considerable number of bispecific T cell-recruiting antibodies which are potentially effective in hematologic malignancies have been derived from BiTEs. The elucidation of mechanisms of BiTE action and neonatal techniques used for the construction of BsAbs can improve the treatment of hematological malignancies. This review summarized the features of bispecific T cell-recruiting antibodies for the treatment of hematologic malignancies with special focus on preclinical experiments and clinical studies.","['Tian, Zheng', 'Liu, Ming', 'Zhang, Ya', 'Wang, Xin']","['Tian Z', 'Liu M', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang X']",,"['School of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated To Shandong University, Shandong First Medical University, No.324, Jingwu Road, Jinan, 250021, Shandong, China.', 'Shandong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Lymphoma, Jinan, 250021, Shandong, China.', 'Branch of National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Jinan, 250021, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250021, Shandong, China. maryzhangya@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated To Shandong University, Shandong First Medical University, No.324, Jingwu Road, Jinan, 250021, Shandong, China. maryzhangya@gmail.com.', 'School of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, China. maryzhangya@gmail.com.', 'Shandong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Lymphoma, Jinan, 250021, Shandong, China. maryzhangya@gmail.com.', 'Branch of National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Jinan, 250021, Shandong, China. maryzhangya@gmail.com.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, 251006, China. maryzhangya@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250021, Shandong, China. xinw007@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated To Shandong University, Shandong First Medical University, No.324, Jingwu Road, Jinan, 250021, Shandong, China. xinw007@126.com.', 'School of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, China. xinw007@126.com.', 'Shandong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Lymphoma, Jinan, 250021, Shandong, China. xinw007@126.com.', 'Branch of National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Jinan, 250021, Shandong, China. xinw007@126.com.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, 251006, China. xinw007@126.com.']",['eng'],"['82000195/National Natural Science Foundation', '82070203/National Natural Science Foundation', '81770210/National Natural Science Foundation', '81473486 /National Natural Science Foundation', '81270598/National Natural Science Foundation']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",20210503,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,PMC8091790,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bispecific T cell engager', '*Bispecific antibody', '*Cancer immunotherapy', '*Hematologic malignancy']",2021/05/05 06:00,2021/09/16 06:00,['2021/05/04 05:54'],"['2020/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/04 05:54 [entrez]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-021-01084-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-021-01084-4 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2021 May 3;14(1):75. doi: 10.1186/s13045-021-01084-4.,20210915,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Bispecific/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Humans', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we compared the allo-HCT outcomes of CBT versus single-allele-mismatched MMUD allo-HCT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in acute myeloid leukemia. METHODS: Patients who underwent a first CBT without PTCy (N = 902) or allo-HCT from a (HLA 9/10) MMUD with PTCy (N = 280) were included in the study. A multivariate regression analysis was performed for the whole population. A matched-pair analysis was carried out by propensity score-based 1:1 matching of patients (177 pairs) with known cytogenetic risk. RESULTS: The incidence of grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at 6 months was 36% versus 32% (p = 0.07) and 15% versus 11% (p = 0.16) for CBT and MMUD cohorts, respectively. CBT was associated with a higher incidence of graft failure (11% vs. 4%, p < 0.01) and higher 2-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) (30% vs. 16%, p < 0.01) compared to MMUD. In the multivariate analysis, CBT was associated with a higher risk of, NRM (HR = 2.09, 95% CI 1.46-2.99, p < 0.0001), and relapse (HR = 1.35, 95% CI 1-1.83, p = 0.05), which resulted in worse leukemia-free survival (LFS) (HR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.34-2.12, p < 0.0001), overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.33-2.17, p < 0.0001), and GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) (HR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.21-1.83, p < 0.0001) compared to MMUD. The risk of grade II-IV acute GVHD (p = 0.052) and chronic GVHD (p = 0.69) did not differ significantly between the cohorts. These results were confirmed in a matched-pair analysis. CONCLUSIONS: CBT was associated with lower LFS, OS, and GRFS due to higher NRM, compared to MMUD allo-HCT with PTCy. In the absence of a fully matched donor, 9/10 MMUD with PTCy may be preferred over CBT.","['Dholaria, Bhagirathbhai', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Sanz, Jaime', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Cornelissen, Jan', 'Labussiere-Wallet, Helene', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Forcade, Edouard', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Grassi, Anna', 'Zubarovskaya, Ludmila', 'Kuball, Jurgen', 'Ceballos, Patrice', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Baron, Frederic', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Dholaria B', 'Labopin M', 'Sanz J', 'Ruggeri A', 'Cornelissen J', 'Labussiere-Wallet H', 'Blaise D', 'Forcade E', 'Chevallier P', 'Grassi A', 'Zubarovskaya L', 'Kuball J', 'Ceballos P', 'Ciceri F', 'Baron F', 'Savani BN', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2371-3655'],"['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 220 Pierce Ave, 777 Preston Research Building, Nashville, TN, 37232, USA.

In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), their incidence and prognostic implications remain poorly reported. Our targeted next-generation sequencing approach allowed comprehensive assessment of genotype across the entire IDH1 and IDH2 locus in 1085 consecutive unselected and newly diagnosed patients with T-ALL and identified 4% of, virtually exclusive (47 of 49 patients), IDH1/2(Mut). Mutational patterns of IDH1/2(Mut) in T-ALL present some specific features compared to AML. Whereas IDH2(R140Q) mutation was frequent in T-ALL (25 of 51 mutations), the IDH2(R172) AML hotspot was absent. IDH2 mutations were associated with older age, an immature phenotype, more frequent RAS gain-of-function mutations and epigenetic regulator loss-of-function alterations (DNMT3A and TET2). IDH2 mutations, contrary to IDH1 mutations, appeared to be an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis with the NOTCH1/FBXW7/RAS/PTEN classifier. IDH2(Mut) were significantly associated with a high cumulative incidence of relapse and very dismal outcome, suggesting that IDH2-mutated T-ALL cases should be identified at diagnosis in order to benefit from therapeutic intensification and/or specific IDH2 inhibitors.","['Simonin, Mathieu', 'Schmidt, Aline', 'Bontoux, Christophe', 'Dourthe, Marie-Emilie', 'Lengline, Etienne', 'Andrieu, Guillaume P', 'Lhermitte, Ludovic', 'Graux, Carlos', 'Grardel, Nathalie', 'Cayuela, Jean-Michel', 'Huguet, Francoise', 'Arnoux, Isabelle', 'Ducassou, Stephane', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth', 'Gandemer, Virginie', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Petit, Arnaud', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Boissel, Nicolas', 'Asnafi, Vahid']","['Simonin M', 'Schmidt A', 'Bontoux C', 'Dourthe ME', 'Lengline E', 'Andrieu GP', 'Lhermitte L', 'Graux C', 'Grardel N', 'Cayuela JM', 'Huguet F', 'Arnoux I', 'Ducassou S', 'Macintyre E', 'Gandemer V', 'Dombret H', 'Petit A', 'Ifrah N', 'Baruchel A', 'Boissel N', 'Asnafi V']",,"['Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Universite de Paris, 149 rue de Sevres, 75015, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Armand Trousseau Hospital, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.', 'Institut Necker-Enfants Malades (INEM), Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm) U1151, Paris, France.', 'PRES LUNAM, CHU Angers service des Maladies du Sang, INSERM U 892, Angers, France.', 'Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Universite de Paris, 149 rue de Sevres, 75015, Paris, France.', 'Institut Necker-Enfants Malades (INEM), Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm) U1151, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Universite de Paris, 149 rue de Sevres, 75015, Paris, France.', 'Institut Necker-Enfants Malades (INEM), Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm) U1151, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Immunology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Robert Debre Hospital, University Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', ""Universite Paris Diderot, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, EA-3518, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, University Hospital Saint-Louis, Paris, France."", 'Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Universite de Paris, 149 rue de Sevres, 75015, Paris, France.', 'Institut Necker-Enfants Malades (INEM), Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm) U1151, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Universite de Paris, 149 rue de Sevres, 75015, Paris, France.', 'Institut Necker-Enfants Malades (INEM), Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm) U1151, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Universite Catholique de Louvain, CHU UCL Namur -

Two-phase stratified sampling is a flexible approach to perform such sub-sampling, but literature on stratification variables to be used in the sampling and power evaluation is lacking especially for survival data. METHODS: We compared the performance of different sampling designs to assess the prognostic value of a new biomarker on a time-to-event endpoint, applying a Cox model weighted by the inverse of the empirical inclusion probability. RESULTS: Our simulation results suggest that case-control stratified (or post stratified) by a surrogate variable of the marker can yield higher performances than simple random, probability proportional to size, and case-control sampling. In the presence of high censoring rate, results showed an advantage of nested case-control and counter-matching designs in term of design effect, although the use of a fixed ratio between cases and controls might be disadvantageous. On real data on childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we found that optimal sampling using pilot data is greatly efficient. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that, in our sample, case-control stratified by surrogate and nested case-control yield estimates and power comparable to estimates obtained in the full cohort while strongly decreasing the number of patients required. We recommend to plan the sample size and using sampling designs for exploration of novel biomarker in clinical cohort data.","['Graziano, Francesca', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'Rebora, Paola']","['Graziano F', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Rebora P']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0606-5852'],"['BICOCCA BIOINFORMATICS BIOSTATISTICS AND BIOIMAGING CENTRE-B4, School of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano - Bicocca, Via Cadore 48, 20900, Monza, Italy.', 'BICOCCA BIOINFORMATICS BIOSTATISTICS AND BIOIMAGING CENTRE-B4, School of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano - Bicocca, Via Cadore 48, 20900, Monza, Italy.', 'BICOCCA BIOINFORMATICS BIOSTATISTICS AND BIOIMAGING CENTRE-B4, School of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano - Bicocca, Via Cadore 48, 20900, Monza, Italy. paola.rebora@unimib.it.']",['eng'],"['SIR-MIUR RBSI14LOVD/Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research', '2017-NAZ-0446/Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210430,England,BMC Med Res Methodol,BMC medical research methodology,100968545,PMC8091513,['NOTNLM'],"['*Case-control design', '*Cohort studies', '*Power', '*Two-phase sampling', '*Weighted cox model']",2021/05/05 06:00,2021/06/29 06:00,['2021/05/04 05:48'],"['2020/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/04 05:48 [entrez]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12874-021-01283-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12874-021-01283-0 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med Res Methodol. 2021 Apr 30;21(1):93. doi: 10.1186/s12874-021-01283-0.,20210628,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Research Design']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Roflumilast, a selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor used for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is effective against B-cell malignancy via phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-activity suppression. We analyzed the effects of roflumilast combined with ESHAP (etoposide, cisplatin, methylprednisolone, and cytarabine) chemotherapy in experimental and clinical settings. Materials and Methods: An in vitro study using lymphoma cell lines and a pilot study on relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients were conducted to investigate the effects and mechanism of the combination of roflumilast and chemotherapy. The complete response (CR), overall response rate (ORR), and 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed. RESULTS: We found that roflumilast is efficient when combined with other chemotherapy drugs, especially cytarabine. Synergistic effects between these two drugs influence the translation of mammalian target of rapamycin and myeloid cell leukemia 1, resulting in apoptosis and inhibition of B-cell lymphoma proliferation. In clinical setting, the roflumilast group showed better rates of CR (46.2% vs. 34.6%), ORR (76.9% vs. 53.8%), and 1-year PFS (50.0% vs. 25.9%) compared with the control group, though not statistically significant. The roflumilast group showed a higher incidence of asthenia and gastrointestinal adverse events. However, grade 3 or 4 adverse events were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: We found that roflumilast, when combined with ESHAP chemotherapy, for relapsed/refractory DLBCL was clinically active and well tolerated. This combined treatment was able to suppress PI3K activity, which is correlated with the degree of clinical response.","['Kim, Do Young', 'Nam, Jehyun', 'Chung, Joo-Seop', 'Kim, Sang-Woo', 'Shin, Ho-Jin']","['Kim DY', 'Nam J', 'Chung JS', 'Kim SW', 'Shin HJ']",,"['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Biochemical Research Institution, Pusan National University Hospital, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Biochemical Research Institution, Pusan National University Hospital, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Biochemical Research Institution, Pusan National University Hospital, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Busan, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210427,Korea (South),Cancer Res Treat,Cancer research and treatment,101155137,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chemotherapy', 'Cytarabine', 'ESHAP', 'Relapsed/refractory DLBCL', 'Roflumilast']",2021/05/05 06:00,2021/05/05 06:00,['2021/05/04 04:00'],"['2020/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/04 04:00 [entrez]']","['crt.2020.1371 [pii]', '10.4143/crt.2020.1371 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res Treat. 2022 Jan;54(1):301-313. doi: 10.4143/crt.2020.1371.

Then, it was verified to be involved in cell progression in neuroblastoma. However, the functional role of NOL4L in tumor proliferation and metastasis and the underlying molecular mechanism(s) are not fully understood. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays were performed in patient tissues to reveal NOL4L expression profiles. Then, we knocked down NOL4L in two ovarian cancer cell lines (Skov3-ip1 and Hey), and cell-based in-vitro and in-vivo assays were subsequently conducted to gain insight into the underlying mechanism of NOL4L in ovarian cancer. We confirmed that the expression of NOL4L was higher in tumor tissues, especially in peritoneal metastatic tissues. Furthermore, we observed that NOL4L was related to prognosis in ovarian cancer patients. Next, we conducted CCK-8 assays, colony formation assays, migration and invasion experiments and wound healing assays and verified that NOL4L could promote proliferation and metastasis in ovarian cancer cells. In addition, NOL4L promoted tumor progression and metastasis in a nude mouse model. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that NOL4L influenced gene expression in the PI3K/AKT pathway. Overall, our study provides genetic and biochemical evidence that NOL4L is critical for tumor progression and metastasis in ovarian cancer cells. Thus, it could serve as a target for antimetastatic therapy in ovarian cancer.","['Lin, Feikai', 'Zhou, Jieru', 'Li, Xiaoduan', 'Wang, Xipeng']","['Lin F', 'Zhou J', 'Li X', 'Wang X']",,"['Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200092, China.', 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200092, China.', 'Department of Gynecology, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 201204, China.', 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200092, China.

The findings can provide information and a method for future studies, particularly those focused on online or social media based interventions. Acute myeloid leukaemia-related Instagram posts were identified by searching specific and relevant hashtags (#). A content analysis systematically classified themes in the data. A convenience sample of 100 posts (138 photos) were manually extracted and coded. Data are described using descriptive statistics and demonstrated by qualitative examples.

While both methodological schemes have their own well-known benefits, little is known about their synergistic potential. Our study introduces their methodological fusion that cross-exploits the strengths of individual approaches via a built-in information-sharing mechanism. This fusion is theoretically based on certain trait-conditioned dependency patterns between two genes depending on their role in the underlying parametric model. Resulting trait-specific co-expression network estimation method 1) serves to enhance the interpretation of biological networks in a parametric sense, and 2) exploits the underlying parametric model itself in the estimation process. To also account for the substantial amount of intrinsic noise and collinearities, often entailed by expression data, a tailored co-expression measure is introduced along with this framework to alleviate related computational problems. A remarkable advance over the reference methods in simulated scenarios substantiate the method's high-efficiency. As proof-of-concept, this synergistic approach is successfully applied in survival analysis, with acute myeloid leukemia data, further highlighting the framework's versatility and broad practical relevance.","['Kontio, Juho A J', 'Pyhajarvi, Tanja', 'Sillanpaa, Mikko J']","['Kontio JAJ', 'Pyhajarvi T', 'Sillanpaa MJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2354-0443', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2808-2768']","['Research Unit of Mathematical Sciences, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.', 'Department of Ecology and Genetics, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.', 'Department of Forest Sciences, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Research Unit of Mathematical Sciences, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210503,United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,PMC8118548,,,2021/05/04 06:00,2021/09/18 06:00,['2021/05/03 17:34'],"['2020/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/18 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/03 17:34 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008960 [doi]', 'PCOMPBIOL-D-20-01509 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2021 May 3;17(5):e1008960. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008960. eCollection 2021 May.,20210917,,IM,"['Algorithms', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Proof of Concept Study', 'Systems Biology']",,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, existing screening tools promoted by cancer care institutions, such as the Distress Thermometer (DT) generate high rates of errors. The aim of this study is to help refining strategies of screening psychological distress in this population by exploring two-step methods combining the DT on step #1 with one question on step #2. PROCEDURE: Data from 255 survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia aged 13-40 years were analyzed (38% 13-18 years, 62% 19+ years, 53% females). We used the DT on step #1 and the individual emotion items from the Pediatric Quality of Life Questionnaire (PedsQL) on step #2, to detect distress, depression and anxiety as measured by standard instruments. We compared sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values, Youden index, and clinical utility indices, in newly developed two-step strategies. RESULTS: The best two-step strategies to screen anxious-depressive distress were DT >/= 2 on step #1, with the item of Sadness on step #2, and DT >/= 2 combined with the item of Concerns. Two-step strategies outperformed the DT alone on the correct identification of distressed survivors. However, two-step strategies did not outperform the DT used alone on the correct detection of no distressed survivors. Results were similar when predicting depression or anxiety alone. CONCLUSION: Completing the DT with one single question on emotions from the PedsQL may minimize the number of participants falsely identified as distressed, which could be particularly pertinent in resource-limited clinics.","['Pepin, Annie-Jade', 'Lippe, Sarah', 'Drouin, Simon', 'Krajinovic, Maja', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Michon, Bruno', 'Robaey, Philippe', 'Rondeau, Emelie', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Sultan, Serge']","['Pepin AJ', 'Lippe S', 'Drouin S', 'Krajinovic M', 'Laverdiere C', 'Michon B', 'Robaey P', 'Rondeau E', 'Sinnett D', 'Sultan S']",,"['Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Laval University Health Center (Laval UHC) Quebec, Quebec, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', ""Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."", 'University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210503,United States,J Psychosoc Oncol,Journal of psychosocial oncology,8309337,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anxiety', 'depression', 'emotional distress', 'pediatric cancer', 'screening', 'survivors']",2021/05/04 06:00,2021/05/04 06:00,['2021/05/03 17:29'],"['2021/05/03 17:29 [entrez]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/07347332.2021.1906377 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Psychosoc Oncol. 2021 May 3:1-16. doi: 10.1080/07347332.2021.1906377.,,,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is postulated that they originate from bone marrow stem cells. Accumulating evidence has established the existence of immunoglobulin gene and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements in these tumors. Cases of transdifferentiation across lineages from follicular lymphoma to histiocytic/dendritic cell tumors have also been reported. Herein, we report 2 adult males with histiocytic neoplasms coexisting with B-cell lymphoma. Laser capture microdissection and capillary electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed comparable immunoglobulin gene rearrangement in both patients. In one case, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), Langerhans cell sarcoma, and histiocytic sarcoma coexisted in the lymph nodes. 11q22 deletion often present in CLL/SLL and expression of the BRAF V600E gene was detected in all the 3 components. In the other case, there diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and histiocytic sarcoma coexisted in the spleen. Forty-seven mutated genes commonly found in B-cell lymphoma were detected by next-generation sequencing. In the same line, DTX1, IRF8, KMT2D, MAP2K1, and TET2 genes were found to have similar mutation sites.

Moreover, we worked towards identifying the most anti-leukaemic derivative of ginger and the mechanism through which it may exert its cytotoxic impact. In vivo experiments were performed using five groups of six C57BL/6 nude mice, and the anti-leukaemic activity of ginger extract alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) was examined. Results showed increased survival rate and reduced damages in mice brain and liver tissues. Subsequently, MTT assay demonstrated synergistic growth inhibitory effect of 6-shogaol (6Sh) and MTX on ALL cell lines and patients primary cells. Eventually, the molecular anti-neoplastic mechanism of 6Sh was evaluated using Bioinformatics. Flow cytometry illustrated 6Sh-mediated apoptosis in Nalm-6 cells confirmed by Western blotting and RT-PCR assays. Further analyses exhibited the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through 6Sh. The current study revealed the in vivo novel anti-leukaemic role of ginger extract, promoted by MTX. Moreover, 6-shogaol was introduced as the major player of ginger cytotoxicity through inducing p53 activity and ROS generation.","['Najafi Dorcheh, Somayeh', 'Rahgozar, Soheila', 'Talei, Daryush']","['Najafi Dorcheh S', 'Rahgozar S', 'Talei D']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1376-255X'],"['University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran.', 'University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Medicinal Plants Research Center, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210503,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,PMC8406487,['NOTNLM'],"['6-shogaol', 'acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'combination therapy', 'drug resistance', 'ginger extract']",2021/05/04 06:00,2021/05/04 06:00,['2021/05/03 12:52'],"['2021/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/03 12:52 [entrez]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jcmm.16528 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Cell Mol Med. 2021 May 3. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.16528.,,,IM,,"['(c) 2021 The Authors.

With limited access to the original native Escherichia coli-derived asparaginase (EcASNase), a variety of EcASNase biogenerics are used in low-middle-income countries (LMICs). The variable quality of these biogenerics potentially influences clinical outcomes. PROCEDURE: Seven biogeneric EcASNases (P1-P7) marketed widely in India were evaluated, with P2 as an exemplar for in vivo monitoring. Therapeutic activity of P2 (10,000 IU/m(2) /dose, intramuscular, every 72 hours) was monitored during induction therapy, and drug-related toxicities recorded. Molecular identity, purity and in vitro drug activity of seven biogenerics were characterised using multimodal analyses, and findings compared with reference EcASNase (R). RESULTS: In patients (N = 62) receiving P2, subtherapeutic asparaginase activity (<100 U/L) was observed in 66% (46/70) of trough timepoints (72 hours postdose) during induction. Twelve patients (19%), 11 with high-risk ALL, developed hypersensitivity. Isoforms of EcASNase were identified in all seven biogenerics. All generic products contained impurities with batch-to-batch variability. These included high levels of protein aggregates and host cell protein contamination. In vitro assays of EcASNase activity and leukaemia cell line cytotoxicity were not discriminatory. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm widespread concerns over the unsatisfactory quality and therapeutic activity of native EcASNase biogenerics marketed in LMICs. Appropriate use of these products requires monitored studies to identify clinical suitability and determine appropriate dosing and schedule. For large parts of the world, assured access to high-quality asparaginases remains an unmet therapeutic need.","['Sidhu, Jasmeet', 'Gogoi, Manash Pratim', 'Agarwal, Praveen', 'Mukherjee, Tathagata', 'Saha, Debparna', 'Bose, Priyanka', 'Roy, Prakriti', 'Phadke, Yogesh', 'Sonawane, Bhatu', 'Paul, Pritha', 'Saha, Vaskar', 'Krishnan, Shekhar']","['Sidhu J', 'Gogoi MP', 'Agarwal P', 'Mukherjee T', 'Saha D', 'Bose P', 'Roy P', 'Phadke Y', 'Sonawane B', 'Paul P', 'Saha V', 'Krishnan S']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5926-5167', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2916-9649', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6769-3847']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Tata Medical Center, Kolkata, India.', 'Tata Translational Cancer Research Centre, Tata Medical Center, Kolkata, India.', 'Tata Translational Cancer Research Centre, Tata Medical Center, Kolkata, India.', 'Gennova Vaccine Formulation and Research Centre, Pune, India.', 'Gennova Vaccine Formulation and Research Centre, Pune, India.', 'Tata Translational Cancer Research Centre, Tata Medical Center, Kolkata, India.', 'Tata Translational Cancer Research Centre, Tata Medical Center, Kolkata, India.', 'Tata Translational Cancer Research Centre, Tata Medical Center, Kolkata, India.', 'Gennova Vaccine Formulation and Research Centre, Pune, India.', 'Gennova Vaccine Formulation and Research Centre, Pune, India.', 'Tata Translational Cancer Research Centre, Tata Medical Center, Kolkata, India.', 'Division of Cancer Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Tata Medical Center, Kolkata, India.', 'Tata Translational Cancer Research Centre, Tata Medical Center, Kolkata, India.', 'Division of Cancer Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Tata Medical Center, Kolkata, India.', 'Tata Translational Cancer Research Centre, Tata Medical Center, Kolkata, India.', 'Division of Cancer Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210503,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,['NOTNLM'],"['*asparaginase', '*biogeneric', '*outcomes', '*quality']",2021/05/04 06:00,2021/05/04 06:00,['2021/05/03 12:51'],"['2021/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/03 12:51 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.29046 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Nov;68(11):e29046. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29046.

Mutations in IDH leads to abnormal epigenetic regulation in AML cells and blocks differentiation. Inhibitors of mutated IDH1 and IDH2, ivosidenib and enasidenib, respectively, were recently approved by the FDA for relapsed/refractory AML; ivosidenib is also approved for newly diagnosed AML patients not fit for standard chemotherapy. Here, we discuss the clinical development of IDH inhibitors, their unique side effects, and outline future combination approaches in AML. RECENT FINDINGS: IDH inhibitors are well-tolerated but can induce differentiation of AML cells, which leads to the on-target side effect of differentiation syndrome in up to 20% of patients. Although IDH inhibitors demonstrate efficacy as monotherapy, recent trials have shown that they have higher response rates in combination with hypomethylating agents (HMAs). Current trials of IDH inhibitors include combination with standard induction chemotherapy, as maintenance therapy, and in combination with venetoclax-based regimens. IDH inhibitors are active and have a favorable toxicity profile in AML therapy. Current clinical trials are evaluating how to best incorporate IDH inhibitors into combination therapy to optimize outcomes and duration of response for AML patients with IDH mutations.","['McMurry, Hannah', 'Fletcher, Luke', 'Traer, Elie']","['McMurry H', 'Fletcher L', 'Traer E']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, 97239, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, 97239, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, 97239, USA. traere@ohsu.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210430,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*Enasidenib', '*IDH inhibitors', '*IDH1', '*IDH2', '*Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)', '*Ivosidenib']",2021/05/04 06:00,2021/08/10 06:00,['2021/05/03 12:44'],"['2021/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/03 12:44 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-021-00619-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-021-00619-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2021 Apr;16(2):207-217. doi: 10.1007/s11899-021-00619-3.

This analysis identified a large cohort of AML-restricted genes with high expression in AML, but low to no expression in normal hematopoiesis. Mesothelin (MSLN), a known therapeutic target in solid tumors, was shown to be highly overexpressed in 36% of the AML cohort (range, 5-1077.6 transcripts per million [TPM]) and virtually absent in normal marrow (range, 0.1-10.7 TPM). We verified MSLN transcript expression by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, confirmed cell surface protein expression on leukemic blasts by multidimensional flow cytometry, and demonstrated that MSLN expression was associated with promoter hypomethylation. MSLN was highly expressed in patients with KMT2A rearrangements (P < .001), core-binding factor fusions [inv(16)/t(16;16), P < .001; t(8;21), P < .001], and extramedullary disease (P = .001). We also demonstrated the presence of soluble MSLN in diagnostic serum specimens using an MSLN-directed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In vitro and in vivo preclinical efficacy of the MSLN-directed antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) anetumab ravtansine and anti-MSLN-DGN462 were evaluated in MSLN+ leukemia cell lines in vitro and in vivo, as well as in patient-derived xenografts. Treatment with ADCs resulted in potent target-dependent cytotoxicity in MSLN+ AML.

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed differences in clinical data among 190 patients with AML-MRC and 667 patients with AML not otherwise specified (AML-NOS). We also compared different therapeutic regimens among patients with AML-MRC aged 60-75 years. Results: Compared with AML-NOS, patients with AML-MRC had significantly different clinical characteristics as well as worse overall survival (OS) (9.2 vs. 13.6 months; p<0.001) and complete remission rates (65.3% vs. 76.2%; p=0.005). Multivariate analysis performed for the whole group (patients with both AML-MRC and AML-NOS) showed that AML-MRC was the independent prognostic factor (p=0.002). Additional multivariate analysis performed for 190 patients with AML-MRC indicated that age (p<0.001) and lactate dehydrogenase (p=0.031) were independent prognostic factors. Compared with the IA/DA regimen [idarubicin and cytarabine (IA) or daunorubicin and cytarabine (DA)], the DAC+CAG regimen [decitabine and half-dose CAG regimen (cytarabine, aclarubicin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor)] was associated with better OS (4.5 vs. 6.2 months; p=0.021) in patients aged 60-75 years and categorized into the unfavorable risk group. Conclusion: AML-MRC cases exhibited worse clinical outcomes compared to AML-NOS. Compared to the IA/DA regimen, the DAC+CAG regimen was the optimal choice for patients with AML-MRC in the unfavorable risk group and aged 60-75 years.","['Wang, Lei', 'Chu, Xiaoxia', 'Wang, Jingyao', 'An, Licai', 'Liu, Yinghui', 'Li, Li', 'Xu, Junqing']","['Wang L', 'Chu X', 'Wang J', 'An L', 'Liu Y', 'Li L', 'Xu J']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2689-8109', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5223-3311', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3470-7891', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5687-6760']","['Qingdao University Medical College, Affiliated Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital, Department of Hematology, Yantai, China', 'Qingdao University Medical College, Affiliated Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital, Department of Hematology, Yantai, China', 'Qingdao University Medical College, Affiliated Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital, Department of Hematology, Yantai, China', 'Qingdao University Medical College, Affiliated Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital, Department of Hematology, Yantai, China', 'Qingdao University Medical College, Affiliated Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital, Department of Hematology, Yantai, China', 'Linyi Central Hospital, Department of Hematology, Linyi, China', 'Qingdao University Medical College, Affiliated Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital, Department of Hematology, Yantai, China']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210503,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,PMC8386305,['NOTNLM'],"['*Therapy', '*Acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes', '*Clinical characteristics']",2021/05/04 06:00,2021/05/04 06:00,['2021/05/03 07:16'],"['2021/05/03 07:16 [entrez]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4274/tjh.galenos.2021.2021.0009 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2021 Aug 25;38(3):188-194. doi: 10.4274/tjh.galenos.2021.2021.0009.

Further, targeted inhibition of HDAC8 can suppress expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-8. While recombinant IL-6 (rIL-6) and rIL-8 can reverse si-HDAC8-resored DNR sensitivity of AML cells. Mechanistical study revealed that HDAC8 increased the expression of p65, one of key components of NF-kappaB complex, to promote the expression of IL-6 and IL-8. It might be due to that HDAC8 can directly bind with the promoter of p65 to increase its transcription and expression.

Low hypodiploid clones can often undergo a chromosomal doubling generating a near-triploid clone (60-78 chromosomes). When cytogenetic techniques detect a near triploid clone, a diagnostic challenge may ensue in differentiating presumed duplicated low hypodiploidy from good risk high hyperdiploid ALL (51-67 chromosomes). We used single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays to analyze low hypodiploid/near triploid (HoTr) (n = 48) and high hyperdiploid (HeH) (n = 40) cases. In addition to standard analysis, we derived log2 ratios for entire chromosomes enabling us to analyze the cohort using machine-learning techniques. Low hypodiploid and near triploid cases clustered together and separately from high hyperdiploid samples. Using these approaches, we also identified three cases with 50-60 chromosomes, originally called as HeH, which were, in fact, HoTr and two cases incorrectly called as HoTr. TP53 mutation analysis supported the new classification of all cases tested. Next, we constructed a classification and regression tree model for predicting ploidy status with chromosomes 1, 7, and 14 being the key discriminators. The classifier correctly identified 47/50 (94%) HoTr cases. We validated the classifier using an independent cohort of 44 cases where it correctly called 7/7 (100%) low hypodiploid cases. The results of this study suggest that HoTr is more frequent among older adults with ALL than previously estimated and that SNP array analysis should accompany cytogenetics where possible. The classifier can assist where SNP array patterns are challenging to interpret.","['Creasey, Thomas', 'Enshaei, Amir', 'Nebral, Karin', 'Schwab, Claire', 'Watts, Kathryn', 'Cuthbert, Gavin', 'Vora, Ajay', 'Moppett, John', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Fielding, Adele K', 'Haas, Oskar A', 'Moorman, Anthony V']","['Creasey T', 'Enshaei A', 'Nebral K', 'Schwab C', 'Watts K', 'Cuthbert G', 'Vora A', 'Moppett J', 'Harrison CJ', 'Fielding AK', 'Haas OA', 'Moorman AV']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8536-5428', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0526-6794']","['Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', ""Department of Clinical Genetics, Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria."", 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Northern Genetics Service, The Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Institute of Genetic Medicine, International Centre for Life, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Northern Genetics Service, The Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Institute of Genetic Medicine, International Centre for Life, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Haematology and Oncology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK.', 'Paediatric Haematology Department, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, Bristol, UK.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK.', ""Department of Clinical Genetics, Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria."", 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['15036/Bloodwise', 'Bright Red', '17-242/CHILDREN with CANCER UK', 'NIHR Newcastle Biomedical Research Centre', 'C27995/A21019/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",['Journal Article'],20210517,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,PMC8600946,['NOTNLM'],"['SNP array', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cytogenetics', 'hypodiploid']",2021/05/04 06:00,2021/05/04 06:00,['2021/05/03 06:40'],"['2021/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/03 06:40 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22956 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2021 Sep;60(9):604-615. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22956.

Recent research studies suggest that PERK, as an important receptor protein of unfolded protein response, is involved in the pathogenesis of many cancers. This study aimed to investigate PERK expression and its relationship with prognosis in pan-cancer and attempted to explore the relevant mechanism of PERK involved in the regulation of cancer pathogenesis. Methods: The Oncomine and TIMER databases were used to analyze the expression of PERK between pan-cancer samples and normal samples. Survival analysis was performed using the PrognoScan, Kaplan-Meier (K-M) plotter, and UALCAN databases. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to perform the functional enrichment analysis of the PERK gene in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), and thyroid carcinoma (THCA). The TIMER database was used to investigate the correlation between PERK expression and tumor-infiltrating immune cells and analyze the relationship of PERK with marker genes of immune cells which were downloaded from the CellMarker database in BRCA, HNSC, and THCA. Results: PERK was differentially expressed in various cancers, such as breast cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, gastric carcinoma, lymphoma, thyroid cancer, leukemia, and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. The high expression of PERK was associated with a poor prognosis in KIRP, LGG, BRCA, and THCA and with a favorable prognosis in HNSC. The results of GSEA indicated that PERK was mainly enriched in immune-related signaling pathways in BRCA, HNSC, and THCA. Moreover, PERK expression was significant positively correlated with infiltrating levels of macrophages and dendritic cells and was strongly associated with a variety of immune markers, especially macrophage mannose receptor 1 (MRC1, also called CD206) and T-helper cells (Th). Conclusion: The high expression of PERK could promote the infiltration of multiple immune cells in the tumor microenvironment and could deteriorate the outcomes of patients with breast and thyroid cancers, suggesting that PERK as well as tumor-infiltrating immune cells could be taken as potential biomarkers of prognosis.","['Wang, Peng', 'Han, Liying', 'Yu, Moxin', 'Cao, Zhengyu', 'Li, Xiaoning', 'Shao, Yunxia', 'Zhu, Guoping']","['Wang P', 'Han L', 'Yu M', 'Cao Z', 'Li X', 'Shao Y', 'Zhu G']",,"['Anhui Provincial Key Laboratory of Molecular Enzymology and Mechanism of Major Diseases, Key Laboratory of Biomedicine in Gene Diseases, Health of Anhui Higher Education Institutes, Anhui Normal University, Wuhu, China.', 'Anhui Provincial Key Laboratory of Molecular Enzymology and Mechanism of Major Diseases, Key Laboratory of Biomedicine in Gene Diseases, Health of Anhui Higher Education Institutes, Anhui Normal University, Wuhu, China.', 'Anhui Provincial Key Laboratory of Molecular Enzymology and Mechanism of Major Diseases, Key Laboratory of Biomedicine in Gene Diseases, Health of Anhui Higher Education Institutes, Anhui Normal University, Wuhu, China.', 'Anhui Provincial Key Laboratory of Molecular Enzymology and Mechanism of Major Diseases, Key Laboratory of Biomedicine in Gene Diseases, Health of Anhui Higher Education Institutes, Anhui Normal University, Wuhu, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China.', 'Department of Nephrology, Wuhu Hospital Affiliated to East China Normal University, Wuhu, China.', 'Anhui Provincial Key Laboratory of Molecular Enzymology and Mechanism of Major Diseases, Key Laboratory of Biomedicine in Gene Diseases, Health of Anhui Higher Education Institutes, Anhui Normal University, Wuhu, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210416,Switzerland,Front Mol Biosci,Frontiers in molecular biosciences,101653173,PMC8085429,['NOTNLM'],"['PERK', 'biomarker', 'cancer', 'immune cell infiltration', 'prognosis']",2021/05/04 06:00,2021/05/04 06:01,['2021/05/03 06:22'],"['2021/01/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/03 06:22 [entrez]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmolb.2021.648752 [doi]'],epublish,Front Mol Biosci. 2021 Apr 16;8:648752. doi: 10.3389/fmolb.2021.648752. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Wang, Han, Yu, Cao, Li, Shao and Zhu.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite recent advances in radiotherapy approaches, the existence of irradiation-resistant cancer cells is still a noteworthy challenge. Therefore, developing novel therapeutic approaches are still warranted in order to increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to radiation. Many types of research rely on the role of mitochondria in radiation protection. Objective: Here, we aimed to target the mitochondria of monocyticleukemia (THP-1) radio-resistant cell line cells by a mitochondrial disrupting peptide, D (KLAKLAK)2, and investigate the synergistic effect of Gamma-irradiation and KLA for tumor cells inhibition in vitro. Material and Methods: In this experimental study, KLA was delivered into THP-1 cells using a Cell-Penetrating Peptide (CPP).The cells were then exposed to gamma-ray radiation both in the presence and absence of KLA conjugated with CPP. The impacts of KLA, ionizing radiation or combination of both were then evaluated on the cell proliferation and apoptosis of THP-1 cells using MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Results: The MTT assay indicated the anti-proliferative effects of combined D (KLAKLAK)2 peptide with ionizing radiation on THP-1cells. Moreover, synergetic effects of KLA and ionizing radiation reduced cell viability and consequently enhanced cell apoptosis. Conclusion: Using KLA peptide in combination with ionizing irradiation increases the anticancer effects of radio-resistant THP-1 cells. Therefore, the combinational therapy of (KLAKLAK)2 and radiation is a promising strategy for cancer treatment the in future.","['Bahmani, Taraneh', 'Sharifzadeh, Sedigheh', 'Tamaddon, Gholamhossein', 'Farzadfard, Ehsan', 'Zare, Farahnaz', 'Fadaie, Milad', 'Alizadeh, Marzieh', 'Hadi, Mahdieh', 'Ranjbaran, Reza', 'Mosleh-Shirazi, Mohammad Amin', 'Behzad-Behbahani, Abbas']","['Bahmani T', 'Sharifzadeh S', 'Tamaddon G', 'Farzadfard E', 'Zare F', 'Fadaie M', 'Alizadeh M', 'Hadi M', 'Ranjbaran R', 'Mosleh-Shirazi MA', 'Behzad-Behbahani A']",,"['MSc, Division of Medical Biotechnology, Department of Laboratory Sciences, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'MSc, Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'PhD, Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'PhD, Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'PhD, Division of Medical Biotechnology, Department of Laboratory Sciences, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'MSc, Division of Medical Biotechnology, Department of Laboratory Sciences, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'MSc, Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'MSc, Division of Medical Biotechnology, Department of Laboratory Sciences, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'MSc, Department of Medical Nanotechnology, School of Advanced Medical Sciences and Technologies, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'MSc, Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'PhD, Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'PhD, Division of Medical Biotechnology, Department of Laboratory Sciences, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'PhD, Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'PhD, Ionizing and Nonionizing Radiation Protection Research Center, and Department of Radiotherapy and Oncology, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'PhD, Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210401,Iran,J Biomed Phys Eng,Journal of biomedical physics & engineering,101589641,PMC8064137,['NOTNLM'],"['Antimicrobial Peptide', 'Cell survival', 'Combination Therapy', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Ionizing Radiation', 'Mitochondria', 'Pro-Apoptotic Peptide', 'Radio-Resistance']",2021/05/04 06:00,2021/05/04 06:01,['2021/05/03 06:21'],"['2018/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/03 06:21 [entrez]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.31661/jbpe.v0i0.905 [doi]', 'JBPE-11-2 [pii]']",epublish,J Biomed Phys Eng. 2021 Apr 1;11(2):229-238. doi: 10.31661/jbpe.v0i0.905. eCollection 2021 Apr.,,,,,['Copyright: (c) Journal of Biomedical Physics and Engineering.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The underlying pathomechanisms of APL-associated coagulopathy are complex. However, two pathways considered to be APL-specific had been identified: 1) annexin A2 (ANXA2)-associated hyperfibrinolysis and 2) podoplanin (PDPN)-mediated platelet activation and aggregation. In contrast, since disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is far less frequent in patients with non-APL acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the pathophysiology of AML-associated hemorrhagic disorders is not well understood. Furthermore, the potential threat of coagulopathy in non-APL AML patients may be underestimated. Herein, we report a patient with non-APL AML presenting with severe coagulopathy with hyperfibrinolysis. Since his clinical course resembled a prototypical APL-associated hemorrhagic disorder, we hypothesized pathophysiological similarities. Performing multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) and immunofluorescence imaging (IF) studies, we found the patient's bone-marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) to express ANXA2 - a biomarker previously thought to be APL-specific. In addition, whole-exome sequencing (WES) on sorted BM-MNC (leukemia-associated immunophenotype (LAIP)1: ANXA(lo), LAIP2: ANXA(hi)) demonstrated high intra-tumor heterogeneity. Since ANXA2 regulation is not well understood, further research to determine the coagulopathy-initiating events in AML and APL is indicated. Moreover, ANXA2 and PDPN MFC assessment as a tool to determine the risk of life-threatening DIC in AML and APL patients should be evaluated.","['Ruhnke, Leo', 'Stolzel, Friedrich', 'Wagenfuhr, Lisa', 'Altmann, Heidi', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Herold, Sylvia', 'Rump, Andreas', 'Schrock, Evelin', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'von Bonin, Malte']","['Ruhnke L', 'Stolzel F', 'Wagenfuhr L', 'Altmann H', 'Platzbecker U', 'Herold S', 'Rump A', 'Schrock E', 'Bornhauser M', 'Schetelig J', 'von Bonin M']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) partner site Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic I, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Leipzig University Hospital, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) partner site Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Genetics, Carl Gustav Carus Faculty of Medicine, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) partner site Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Genetics, Carl Gustav Carus Faculty of Medicine, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) partner site Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) partner site Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210415,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC8082174,['NOTNLM'],"['ANXA2', 'PDPN', 'WES', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'coagulopathy', 'disseminated intravascular coagulation', 'hyperfibrinolysis']",2021/05/04 06:00,2021/05/04 06:01,['2021/05/03 06:20'],"['2021/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/03 06:20 [entrez]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.666014 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Apr 15;11:666014. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.666014. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Ruhnke, Stolzel, Wagenfuhr, Altmann, Platzbecker, Herold,', 'Rump, Schrock, Bornhauser, Schetelig and von Bonin.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the front-line GIMEMA LLC1114 trial (ibrutinib+rituximab for 6 months, followed by ibrutinib maintenance), we investigated the modulation of T-cell cytokine production in 208 peripheral blood paired samples from 71 CLL patients: 71 samples prior to treatment (Day 0, D0) and at day +14 (D14; n=50), at month +8 (M8; 30), +12 (M12; 25), +18 (M18; 22) and +24 (M24; 10) of treatment. We documented a progressive decrease of CD3+CD4+IL-4+ T cells (Th2), that was significant at M8 and at M12 (p=0.019, p=0.002), a relative increase in the CD3+CD4+IFNgamma+ T cells (Th1) and a decrease of CD3+CD4+IL-17+ (Th17) cells that was maintained up to M18 (M8 vs D0 p=0.003, M12 vs D0 p=0.003, M18 vs D0 p=0.004) of ibrutinib treatment. The Th2/Th1 ratio significantly decreased already after 14 days of treatment and was maintained thereafter (D14 vs D0 p=0.037, M8 vs D0 p=0.001, M12 vs D0 p=0.005, M18 vs D0 p=0.002). The Th2/Th1 modulation over time was significant only among patients with unmutated IGHV. The Th2/Th1 ratio below a cut-off of 0.088 at M8 was associated with the achievement of a complete response (CR) (p=0.016). Ibrutinib may shape the CLL T-cell profile, limiting Th2 activation and inducing a shift in the Th2/Th1 ratio. The association between the Th2/Th1 ratio decrease and the CR achievement suggests the in vivo generation of a potential host anti-tumor immune activation induced by ibrutinib.","['Puzzolo, Maria Cristina', 'Del Giudice, Ilaria', 'Peragine, Nadia', 'Mariglia, Paola', 'De Propris, Maria Stefania', 'Cappelli, Luca Vincenzo', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Reda, Gianluigi', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Molica, Stefano', 'Piciocchi, Alfonso', 'Arena, Valentina', 'Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Foa, Robin']","['Puzzolo MC', 'Del Giudice I', 'Peragine N', 'Mariglia P', 'De Propris MS', 'Cappelli LV', 'Trentin L', 'Reda G', 'Cuneo A', 'Molica S', 'Piciocchi A', 'Arena V', 'Mauro FR', 'Guarini A', 'Foa R']",,"['Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Medical Science, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Arcispedale S.

There is an urgent need to identify novel agents to improve survival. Proteasome inhibition has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for several hematological malignancies. The aim of this study was to determine the preclinical efficacy of the selective proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib, for infants with KMT2A-rearranged ALL. Methods: Eight infant ALL cell lines were extensively characterized for immunophenotypic and cytogenetic features. In vitro cytotoxicity to carfilzomib was assessed using a modified Alamar Blue assay with cells in logarithmic growth. The Bliss Independence model was applied to determine synergy between carfilzomib and the nine conventional chemotherapeutic agents used to treat infants with ALL. Established xenograft models were used to identify the maximal tolerated dose of carfilzomib and determine in vivo efficacy. Results: Carfilzomib demonstrated low IC50 concentrations within the nanomolar range (6.0-15.8 nm) across the panel of cell lines. Combination drug testing indicated in vitro synergy between carfilzomib and several conventional chemotherapeutic agents including vincristine, daunorubicin, dexamethasone, L-asparaginase, and 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide. In vivo assessment did not lead to a survival advantage for either carfilzomib monotherapy, when used to treat both low or high disease burden, or for carfilzomib in combination with multi-agent induction chemotherapy comprising of vincristine, dexamethasone, and L-asparaginase. Conclusions: Our study highlights that in vitro efficacy does not necessarily translate to benefit in vivo and emphasizes the importance of in vivo validation prior to suggesting an agent for clinical use. Whilst proteasome inhibitors have an important role to play in several hematological malignancies, our findings guard against prioritization of carfilzomib for treatment of KMT2A-rearranged infant ALL in the clinical setting.","['Cheung, Laurence C', 'de Kraa, Rebecca', 'Oommen, Joyce', 'Chua, Grace-Alyssa', 'Singh, Sajla', 'Hughes, Anastasia M', 'Ferrari, Emanuela', 'Ford, Jette', 'Chiu, Sung K', 'Stam, Ronald W', 'Kees, Ursula R', 'Malinge, Sebastien', 'Kotecha, Rishi S']","['Cheung LC', 'de Kraa R', 'Oommen J', 'Chua GA', 'Singh S', 'Hughes AM', 'Ferrari E', 'Ford J', 'Chiu SK', 'Stam RW', 'Kees UR', 'Malinge S', 'Kotecha RS']",,"[""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Kids Cancer Centre, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia."", 'Curtin Medical School, Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia.', 'PathWest Laboratory Medicine WA, Perth, WA, Australia.', ""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Kids Cancer Centre, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia."", ""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Kids Cancer Centre, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia."", ""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Kids Cancer Centre, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia."", ""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Kids Cancer Centre, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia."", ""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Kids Cancer Centre, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia."", ""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Kids Cancer Centre, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia."", ""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Kids Cancer Centre, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, Netherlands.', ""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Kids Cancer Centre, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia."", ""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Kids Cancer Centre, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia."", ""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Kids Cancer Centre, Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia."", 'Curtin Medical School, Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia.', ""Department of Clinical Haematology, Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Perth Children's Hospital, Perth, WA, Australia.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210415,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC8082024,['NOTNLM'],"['KMT2A', 'MLL', 'PER cell lines', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'carfilzomib', 'infant']",2021/05/04 06:00,2021/05/04 06:01,['2021/05/03 06:20'],"['2020/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/03 06:20 [entrez]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.631594 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Apr 15;11:631594. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.631594. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Cheung, de Kraa, Oommen, Chua, Singh, Hughes, Ferrari, Ford,', 'Chiu, Stam, Kees, Malinge and Kotecha.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, few of the proposed approaches are actually deployed in clinical settings. One reason is that current methods may not be able to generalize on new unseen instances which differ from the training population, thus providing unreliable classifications. Approaches to measure classification reliability could be useful to assess whether to trust prediction on new cases. Here, we propose a new reliability measure based on the similarity of a new instance to the training set. In particular, we evaluate whether this example would be selected as informative by an instance selection method, in comparison with the available training set. We show that this method distinguishes reliable examples, for which we can trust the classifier's prediction, from unreliable ones, both on simulated data and in a real-case scenario, to distinguish tumor and normal cells in Acute Myeloid Leukemia patients.","['Nicora, Giovanna', 'Bellazzi, Riccardo']","['Nicora G', 'Bellazzi R']",,"['Department of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210125,United States,AMIA Annu Symp Proc,AMIA ...

Interestingly, we describe a case of a 67-year-old female who presented with painless jaundice and was found to have a rapidly growing gallbladder wall mass which was determined to be CLL metastatic disease after extensive surgical resection.

Moreover, Bcl-2-associated athanogene (BAG)2 is highly expressed in a various types of tumors and is regarded as an anti-apoptotic gene. In the present study, the roles of miR-325 and BAG2 in a T-ALL cell line (Jurkat cells) were investigated. BAG2 and miR-325 expression levels in clinical blood samples from healthy donors and pediatric patients with T-ALL, as well as in T-ALL cell lines was detected using western blot analysis and/or reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assays and TargetScan were used to evaluate the interaction between BAG2 and miR-325. Small interfering RNA technology was applied to knockdown BAG2 expression in Jurkat cells. The effects of miR-325 mimic and BAG2 downregulation on the proliferation and apoptosis were assessed by an MTT assay, flow cytometry and western blot analysis. The results revealed that the expression of miR-325 was downregulated in blood samples from pediatric patients and in T-ALL cell lines, and its expression was lowest in Jurkat cells. The expression levels of BAG2 exhibited the opposite results. The knockdown of BAG2 markedly induced the apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of Jurkat cells. In addition, the overexpression of miR-325 significantly inhibited the growth and promoted the apoptosis of Jurkat cells, with these effects being eliminated by BAG2 overexpression. In conclusion, the findings of the present study demonstrated that miR-325 directly targets the BAG2 gene and that the introduction of miR-325 can accelerate apoptosis and suppress the proliferation of Jurkat cells by silencing BAG2 expression.","['Wang, Fengyu', 'Wang, Fengli', 'Zhang, Shengyu', 'Xu, Xiaogang']","['Wang F', 'Wang F', 'Zhang S', 'Xu X']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Zibo Central Hospital, Zibo, Shandong 255036, P.R.

In this review, we discuss the bone marrow niches in mice that facilitate the survival, maintenance, and differentiation of cells of hematopoietic origin based on the recent literature. Our review places a special focus on the hematopoietic multipotent progenitors and on plasma cells, corresponding to the last stage of the B-cell lineage, that play a key role in the humoral memory response. We highlight the similarities between the microenvironments necessary for the establishment and the maintenance of these two immune cell subsets, and how the chemokine CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis contributes to these processes.

In the immune system, EVs play a role in antigen presentation as a part of cellular communication. To enable drug discovery and characterization of compounds that affect EV biogenesis, function, and release in immune cells, we developed and characterized a reporter cell line that allows the quantitation of EVs shed into culture media in phenotypic high-throughput screen (HTS) format. Tetraspanins CD63 and CD9 were previously reported to be enriched in EVs; hence, a construct with dual reporters consisting of CD63-Turbo-luciferase (Tluc) and CD9-Emerald green fluorescent protein (EmGFP) was engineered. This construct was transduced into the human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1. Cells expressing the highest EmGFP were sorted by flow cytometry as single cell, and clonal pools were expanded under antibiotic selection pressure. After four passages, the green fluorescence dimmed, and EV biogenesis was then tracked by luciferase activity in culture supernatants. The Tluc activities of EVs shed from CD63Tluc-CD9EmGFP reporter cells in the culture supernatant positively correlated with the concentrations of released EVs measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis. To examine the potential for use in HTS, we first miniaturized the assay into a robotic 384-well plate format. A 2210 commercial compound library (Maybridge) was then screened twice on separate days, for the induction of extracellular luciferase activity. The screening data showed high reproducibility on days 1 and 2 (78.6%), a wide signal window, and an excellent Z' factor (average of 2-day screen, 0.54). One hundred eighty-seven compounds showed a response ratio that was 3SD above the negative controls in both day 1 and 2 screens and were considered as hit candidates (approximately 10%). Twenty-two out of 40 re-tested compounds were validated. These results indicate that the performance of CD63Tluc-CD9EmGFP reporter cells is reliable, reproducible, robust, and feasible for HTS of compounds that regulate EV release by the immune cells.","['Shpigelman, Jonathan', 'Lao, Fitzgerald S', 'Yao, Shiyin', 'Li, Chenyang', 'Saito, Tetsuya', 'Sato-Kaneko, Fumi', 'Nolan, John P', 'Shukla, Nikunj M', 'Pu, Minya', 'Messer, Karen', 'Cottam, Howard B', 'Carson, Dennis A', 'Corr, Maripat', 'Hayashi, Tomoko']","['Shpigelman J', 'Lao FS', 'Yao S', 'Li C', 'Saito T', 'Sato-Kaneko F', 'Nolan JP', 'Shukla NM', 'Pu M', 'Messer K', 'Cottam HB', 'Carson DA', 'Corr M', 'Hayashi T']",,"['Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States.', 'Scintillon Institute, San Diego, CA, United States.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States.', 'Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Department of Family Medicine and Public Health, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States.', 'Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Department of Family Medicine and Public Health, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210416,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,PMC8085554,['NOTNLM'],"['CD63', 'CD9', 'THP-1', 'antigen-presenting cells', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicle', 'luciferase']",2021/05/04 06:00,2021/05/04 06:01,['2021/05/03 06:10'],"['2021/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/03 06:10 [entrez]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2021.668609 [doi]', '668609 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2021 Apr 16;12:668609. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2021.668609. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Shpigelman, Lao, Yao, Li, Saito, Sato-Kaneko, Nolan, Shukla,', 'Pu, Messer, Cottam, Carson, Corr and Hayashi.']",,,,,"['JN is the chief executive officer of Cellarcus Biosciences.

The aim of this study was to explore whether leonurine is able to inhibit chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) malignancy. Here, we found that leonurine dose dependently inhibited the proliferation, migration, colony formation and promoted apoptosis of CML cells. Furthermore, leonurine markedly reduced CML xenograft growth in vivo. Mechanically, leonurine upregulated SOCS5 expression, thus leading JAK2/STAT3 signaling suppression. Silencing of SOCS5 by its siRNA abrogated the effect of leonurine on CML cells, demonstrating that SOCS5 mediates the anti-leukemia effect of leonurine. Notably, we observed that miR-18a-5p was remarkably increased in CML cells. Treating CML cells with leonurine significantly decreased miR-18a-5p expression. Moreover, we found miR-18a-5p repressed SOCS5 by directly targeting its 3'-UTR. miR-18a-5p downregulation induced by leonurine reduced the biological activity of CML cells by relieving miR-18a-5p repression of SOCS5 expression. Taken together, leonurine exerts significant anti-leukemia efficacy in CML by regulating miR-18a-5p/SOCS5/JAK2/STAT3 axis.","['Liu, Hui-Min', 'Guo, Chun-Ling', 'Zhang, Yao-Fang', 'Chen, Jian-Fang', 'Liang, Zhi-Peng', 'Yang, Lin-Hua', 'Ma, Yan-Ping']","['Liu HM', 'Guo CL', 'Zhang YF', 'Chen JF', 'Liang ZP', 'Yang LH', 'Ma YP']",,"['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Basic Laboratory of Internal Medicine, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210416,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,PMC8087248,['NOTNLM'],"['SOCS5', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'leonurine', 'miR-18a-5p', 'stat3']",2021/05/04 06:00,2021/05/04 06:01,['2021/05/03 06:10'],"['2021/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/03 06:10 [entrez]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2021.657724 [doi]', '657724 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2021 Apr 16;12:657724. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2021.657724. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Liu, Guo, Zhang, Chen, Liang, Yang and Ma.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three years after complete remission of DLBCL, she experienced DLBCL recurrence in her small bowel and was hospitalized. MDS had been stationary, but during the treatment of DLBCL, her laboratory findings suggested signs of leukemia. Bone marrow biopsy was done, and acute monoblastic leukemia (AMoL) was diagnosed. After 1 cycle of chemotherapy for AMoL, skin lesions developed, and her skin biopsy showed cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase staining and CD123 staining were negative, and bone marrow re-biopsy conducted after the skin lesion developed still showed monoblastic proliferation. Whether the CTCL represented with an AMoL lineage switch could not be completely proved due to the absence of molecular or clonal marker evaluations, but the possibility of coexistence of three different malignancies was higher. During treatment, a neutropenic fever developed, and the patient died due to sepsis.

Here we focused on the influence of an immunomodulatory cell type, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and their lineage-related subtypes on autologous T lymphocytes. Although MDSCs as a group correlated with an immunosuppressive Th repertoire and worse clinical course, MDSC subtypes (polymorphonuclear, PMN-MDSC, and monocytic, M-MDSCs) were often functionally discordant. In vivo, PMN-MDSCs existed in higher numbers, correlated with different Th-subsets, and more strongly associated with poor clinical course than M-MDSCs. In vitro, PMN-MDSCs were more efficient at blocking T-cell growth and promoted Th17 differentiation. Conversely, in vitro M-MDSCs varied in their ability to suppress T-cell proliferation, due to the action of TNFalpha, and promoted a more immunostimulatory Th compartment. Ibrutinib therapy impacted MDSCs differentially as well, since after initiating therapy, PMN-MDSC numbers progressively declined, whereas M-MDSC numbers were unaffected, leading to a set of less immunosuppressive Th cells.

METHODS: This exploratory cross-sectional observational study examined 12 participants, six ALL CCS and six age- and sex-matched peers (7-16 years). During a countermovement jump, rates of muscle activation of lower leg muscles were measured with electromyography, and joint torques and peak jump height with force plates and a motion capture system. Clinical measures included muscle extensibility, balance, and mobility measured by active ankle dorsiflexion, Bruininks-Oseretsky Motor Proficiency (BOT-2), and Timed Up and Go (TUG) tests. RESULTS: Compared to peers, ALL CCS demonstrated reduced gastrocnemius muscle extensibility and tibialis anterior rate of muscle activation, decreased jump height, and poorer performance on the BOT-2 and TUG. Jump height was significantly correlated with clinical measures of the BOT-2 and TUG. CONCLUSION: These ALL CCS demonstrated neuromuscular impairments that may impact jump performance, an essential childhood physical activity. Further research is needed to explore intervention strategies to improve the neuromuscular mechanisms that contribute to high-level gross motor skills in ALL CCS.","['Marchese, Victoria', 'Rock, Kelly', 'York, Teresa', 'Creath, Robert', 'Gray, Vicki']","['Marchese V', 'Rock K', 'York T', 'Creath R', 'Gray V']",,"['Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Exercise Science, Lebanon Valley College, Annville, PA, USA.', 'Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",,Netherlands,J Pediatr Rehabil Med,Journal of pediatric rehabilitation medicine,101490944,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'biomechanics', 'jumping', 'motor skills']",2021/05/04 06:00,2021/10/29 06:00,['2021/05/03 06:01'],"['2021/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/03 06:01 [entrez]']","['PRM200784 [pii]', '10.3233/PRM-200784 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Rehabil Med. 2021;14(3):415-423. doi: 10.3233/PRM-200784.,20211028,,IM,"['Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Electromyography', 'Humans', 'Muscle, Skeletal', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Survivors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, compared to MS4A1 (CD20), a Ca(2+) channel and ideal target for successful leukaemia immunotherapy, MS4A12 has rarely been studied. In this study, we investigated the involvement of MS4A12 in Ca(2+) influx and expression changes in MS4A12 in human colonic malignancy. Fluorescence of GCaMP-fused MS4A12 (GCaMP-M12) was evaluated to analyse MS4A12 activity in Ca(2+) influx. Plasma membrane expression of GCaMP-M12 was achieved by homo- or hetero-complex formation with no-tagged MS4A12 (nt-M12) or Orai1, respectively. GCaMP-M12 fluorescence in plasma membrane increased only after thapsigargin-induced depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores, and this fluorescence was inhibited by typical SOCE inhibitors and siRNA for Orai1. Furthermore, GCaMP-MS4A12 and Orai1 co-transfection elicited greater plasma membrane fluorescence than GCaMP-M12 co-transfected with nt-M12. Interestingly, the fluorescence of GCaMP-M12 was decreased by STIM1 over-expression, while increased by siRNA for STIM1 in the presence of thapsigargin and extracellular Ca(2+). Moreover, immunoprecipitation assay revealed that Orai1 co-expression decreased protein interactions between MS4A12 and STIM1. In human colon tissue, MS4A12 was expressed in the apical region of the colonic epithelium, although its expression was dramatically decreased in colon cancer tissues. In conclusion, we propose that MS4A12 contributes to SOCE through complex formation with Orai1, but does not cooperate with STIM1. Additionally, we discovered that MS4A12 is expressed in the apical membrane of the colonic epithelium and that its expression is decreased with cancer progression.","['Han, Jung Woo', 'Heo, Woon', 'Lee, Donghyuk', 'Kang, Choeun', 'Kim, Hye-Yeon', 'Jun, Ikhyun', 'So, Insuk', 'Hur, Hyuk', 'Lee, Min Goo', 'Jung, Minkyu', 'Kim, Joo Young']","['Han JW', 'Heo W', 'Lee D', 'Kang C', 'Kim HY', 'Jun I', 'So I', 'Hur H', 'Lee MG', 'Jung M', 'Kim JY']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8279-593X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8208-484X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0045-5027', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7800-187X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9095-0736', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2160-1679', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2294-2050', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9864-7229', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7436-012X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8281-3387', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2623-1491']","['Department of Pharmacology and Brain Korea 21 Plus Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'These authors contributed equally to this work.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Brain Korea 21 Plus Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'These authors contributed equally to this work.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Brain Korea 21 Plus Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Brain Korea 21 Plus Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Brain Korea 21 Plus Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'The Institute of Vision Research, Department of Ophthalmology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03722, Korea.', 'Department of Physiology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Department of Surgery, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Brain Korea 21 Plus Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Brain Korea 21 Plus Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,PMC8112172,['NOTNLM'],"['GCaMP', 'MS4A12', 'Orai1', 'STIM1', 'colon cancer', 'store-operated Ca2+ entry']",2021/05/04 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/05/03 06:01'],"['2020/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/03 06:01 [entrez]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['molcells.2021.2031 [pii]', '10.14348/molcells.2021.2031 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cells. 2021 Apr 30;44(4):223-232. doi: 10.14348/molcells.2021.2031.,20211203,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (ORAI1 Protein)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'ORAI1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Thapsigargin/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has led to the therapeutic use of novel targeted treatments, such as JAK2 inhibitors. More recently, with the development of next-generation sequencing, additional somatic mutations, which are not restricted to MPNs, have been elucidated. Treatment decisions for MPN patients are influenced by the MPN subtype, symptom burden, and risk classification. Although prevention of vascular events is the main objective of therapy for essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) patients, disease-modifying drugs are needed to eradicate clonal hematopoiesis and prevent progression to more aggressive myeloid neoplasms. JAK inhibitors are a valuable therapeutic strategy for patients with myelofibrosis (MF) who have splenomegaly and/or disease-related symptoms, but intolerance, refractory, resistance, and disease progression still present challenges. Currently, allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only curative treatment for MF, but it is typically limited by age-related comorbidities and high treatment-related mortality. Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis and potential new therapies with the aim of modifying the natural history of the disease is important.

Recently, the identification of monocyte subtypes in peripheral blood using multiparameter flow cytometry has been actively studied. Chromosomal abnormalities are the basis of CMML risk stratification, and mutations in several genes including ASXL1 are known to be important not only for the diagnosis and treatment of this disease but also for predicting its prognosis. The standard treatment principles for CMML have not yet been clearly defined; however, hypomethylating agents are mainly considered the frontline therapy in most cases. Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has limited applications owing to its toxicity, it still plays an important role as the only curative treatment option.

Currently, no effective vaccines are available for pathogens with a highly variable antigenic load, such as the human immunodeficiency virus or to induce cellular T-cell immunity in the fight against cancer. The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has reinforced the relevance of designing smart therapeutic vaccine modalities to ensure public health. Indeed, academic and private companies have ongoing joint efforts to develop novel vaccine prototypes for this virus. Many pathogens are covered by a dense glycan-coat, which form an attractive target for vaccine development. Moreover, many tumor types are characterized by altered glycosylation profiles that are known as ""tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens"". Unfortunately, glycans do not provoke a vigorous immune response and generally serve as T-cell-independent antigens, not eliciting protective immunoglobulin G responses nor inducing immunological memory. A close and continuous crosstalk between glycochemists and glycoimmunologists is essential for the successful development of efficient immune modulators. It is clear that this is a key point for the discovery of novel approaches, which could significantly improve our understanding of the immune system.

These cancer-associated POT1 (caPOT1) mutations are generally heterozygous, missense, or nonsense mutations occurring throughout the POT1 reading frame. Cancers with caPOT1 mutations have elongated telomeres and show increased genomic instability, but which of the two phenotypes promotes tumorigenesis is unclear. We tested the effects of CAS9-engineered caPOT1 mutations in human embryonic and hematopoietic stem cells (hESCs and HSCs, respectively). HSCs with caPOT1 mutations did not show overt telomere damage. In vitro and in vivo competition experiments showed the caPOT1 mutations did not confer a selective disadvantage. Since DNA damage signaling is known to affect the fitness of HSCs, the data argue that caPOT1 mutations do not cause significant telomere damage. Furthermore, hESC lines with caPOT1 mutations showed no detectable telomere damage response while showing consistent telomere elongation. Thus, caPOT1 mutations are likely selected for during cancer progression because of their ability to elongate telomeres and extend the proliferative capacity of the incipient cancer cells.","['Kim, Won-Tae', 'Hennick, Kelsey', 'Johnson, Joshua', 'Finnerty, Brendan', 'Choo, Seunga', 'Short, Sarah B', 'Drubin, Casey', 'Forster, Ryan', 'McMaster, Mary L', 'Hockemeyer, Dirk']","['Kim WT', 'Hennick K', 'Johnson J', 'Finnerty B', 'Choo S', 'Short SB', 'Drubin C', 'Forster R', 'McMaster ML', 'Hockemeyer D']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9359-3073', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6127-2400', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0995-9894', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5598-5092']","['Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Clinical Genetics Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA196884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20210502,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,PMC8204863,['NOTNLM'],"['*POT1', '*cancer', '*genome editing', '*human stem cells', '*humanized mouse models', '*telomeres']",2021/05/03 06:00,2021/11/11 06:00,['2021/05/02 21:14'],"['2021/03/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/11 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/02 21:14 [entrez]']",['10.15252/embj.2020107346 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2021 Jun 15;40(12):e107346. doi: 10.15252/embj.2020107346.

Inhibition of bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins, epigenetic readers that play pivotal roles in the regulation of genes relevant to cancer pathogenesis, constitutes a novel AML treatment approach. METHODS: In this first-in-human study of the pan-BET inhibitor mivebresib as monotherapy (MIV-mono) or in combination with venetoclax (MIV-Ven), the safety profile, efficacy, and pharmacodynamics of mivebresib were determined in patients with relapsed/refractory AML (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02391480). Mivebresib was administered at 3 monotherapy dose levels (1.5, 2.0, or 2.5 mg) or in combination with venetoclax (400 or 800 mg). RESULTS: Forty-four patients started treatment: of 19 who started MIV-mono, 5 went on to receive MIV-Ven combination therapy after disease progression and a washout period. Twenty-five patients started MIV-Ven, resulting in a total of 30 patients treated with the combination. The most common mivebresib-related treatment-emergent adverse events were dysgeusia (74%), decreased appetite (42%), and diarrhea (42%) in the MIV-mono group and decreased appetite (44%), vomiting (44%), and nausea (40%) in the MIV-Ven group. Serious adverse events occurred in 14 patients (74%) who received MIV-mono and in 22 patients (88%) who received MIV-Ven. In the MIV-mono group, responses were complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery in 1 patient and resistant disease in 15 patients. In the MIV-Ven group, responses were complete remission in 2 patients, partial remission in 2 patients, morphologic leukemia-free state in 2 patients, resistant disease in 12 patients, and aplasia in 1 patient. The pharmacodynamic effects of mivebresib were proportional to dose and drug exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Mivebresib was tolerated and showed antileukemic effects as monotherapy and in combination with venetoclax in patients with relapsed/refractory AML. LAY SUMMARY: Mivebresib is a novel drug that influences the way cancer cells read genetic information. Mivebresib was tested together with venetoclax in patients with acute myeloid leukemia after standard medicines failed and the disease returned, or when standard medicine was unavailable. Adverse effects were described for different drug doses, and the dose that is tolerable was determined. In some patients, their leukemia improved for some time. More studies are necessary to determine whether mivebresib can be used to treat acute myeloid leukemia.","['Borthakur, Gautam', 'Odenike, Olatoyosi', 'Aldoss, Ibrahim', 'Rizzieri, David A', 'Prebet, Thomas', 'Chen, Chris', 'Popovic, Relja', 'Modi, Dimple A', 'Joshi, Rujuta H', 'Wolff, Johannes E', 'Jonas, Brian A']","['Borthakur G', 'Odenike O', 'Aldoss I', 'Rizzieri DA', 'Prebet T', 'Chen C', 'Popovic R', 'Modi DA', 'Joshi RH', 'Wolff JE', 'Jonas BA']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6872-625X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4921-5809']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, The University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope, Duarte, California.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine and Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'AbbVie Inc, North Chicago, Illinois.', 'AbbVie Inc, North Chicago, Illinois.', 'AbbVie Inc, North Chicago, Illinois.', 'AbbVie Inc, North Chicago, Illinois.', 'AbbVie Inc, North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of California-Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, California.']",['eng'],['AbbVie'],['Journal Article'],20210502,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,PMC8360206,['NOTNLM'],"['ABBV-075', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'bromodomain and extraterminal domain protein', 'mivebresib', 'phase 1 clinical trial']",2021/05/03 06:00,2021/05/03 06:00,['2021/05/02 21:11'],"['2021/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/03 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/02 21:11 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33590 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2021 Aug 15;127(16):2943-2953. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33590.

We investigated the correlation of MYC protein expression by immunohistochemistry (MYC-IHC) with MYC abnormalities and prognosis in adult de novo AML. MYC-IHC in bone marrow of patients with untreated AML (n = 58) was assessed and scored as MYC(low) (0-40 % of blasts) or MYC(high) (> 40 % of blasts). This was correlated with MYC abnormalities by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and prognosis in the context of cytogenetic risk stratification. Residual myeloid disease at the end of induction was assessed by flow cytometry. MYC(low) and MYC(high) were detected in 24 (41 %) and 34 cases (59 %), respectively. Extra copies of MYC were present in 12 % of cases and were not correlated with level of MYC-IHC. No cases had MYC translocation or amplification. Compared to MYC(low) patients, MYC(high) patients had a shorter overall survival in all cytogenetic risk groups (68 vs. 21 months, p = 0.006) and in the intermediate risk group (61 vs. 21 months, p = 0.046). MYC(high) patients had a tendency towards detected residual disease at the end of induction in all cytogenetic risk and intermediate risk groups. Regardless of the underlying mechanisms of MYC dysregulation, high level of MYC protein is expressed in the majority of AML and correlated to worse prognosis. Further studies on MYC dysregulation in leukemogenesis and therapy targeting MYC aberration are warranted.","['Chen, Pu', 'Redd, Lucas', 'Schmidt, Yao', 'Koduru, Prasad', 'Fuda, Franklin', 'Montgomery-Goecker, Crystal', 'Kumar, Kirthi', 'Xu-Monette, Zijun', 'Young, Ken', 'Collins, Robert', 'Chen, Weina']","['Chen P', 'Redd L', 'Schmidt Y', 'Koduru P', 'Fuda F', 'Montgomery-Goecker C', 'Kumar K', 'Xu-Monette Z', 'Young K', 'Collins R', 'Chen W']",,"['Departments of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Departments of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.

Previous work has characterized hematologist perspectives, but less is known about palliative care physician views of this phenomenon. OBJECTIVES: To examine palliative care physician attitudes and beliefs regarding hematologic diseases, patient care, and collaboration. METHODS: A 44-item survey containing Likert and free-response items was mailed to 1000 AAHPM physician members. Sections explored respondent comfort with specific diagnoses, palliative care integration, relationships with hematologists, and hematology-specific patient care. Logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations were used to compare parallel Likert responses. Free responses were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The response rate was 55.5%. Respondents reported comfort managing symptoms in leukemia (84.0%), lymphoma (92.1%), multiple myeloma (92.9%), and following hematopoietic stem cell transplant (51.6%). Fewer expressed comfort with understanding disease trajectory (64.9%, 75.7%, 78.5%, and 35.4%) and discussing prognosis (71.0%, 82.6%, 81.6%, and 40.6%). 97.6% of respondents disagreed that palliative care and hematology are incompatible. 50.6% felt that palliative care physicians' limited hematology-specific knowledge hinders collaboration. 89.4% felt that relapse should trigger referral. 80.0% felt that hospice referrals occurred late. In exploring perceptions of hematology-palliative care relationships, three themes were identified: misperceptions of palliative care, desire for integration, and lacking a shared model of understanding.

The presence of unilateral or bilateral serous retinal detachment (SRD) as a sign of choroidal infiltration can be one of the manifestations of acute leukemia, both as a primary sign or in a relapse. We consolidated the literature on SRD as a sign of leukemic choroidopathy regarding its epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and main imaging diagnostic tools. Well-documented cases regarding acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), relapsed ALL and relapsed AML published until September, 2020, in peer reviewed journals were included. The literature shows an interesting range of choroidal infiltration cases assessed by modern imaging techniques, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) with and without enhanced depth imaging (EDI) and fluorescein angiography (FA). These tools allow choroidal assessment and better understanding and characterization of this rare condition. Complete ophthalmological workup should be performed in these patients using both FA and EDI-OCT to assess the choroidal anatomy and integrity. An increase in choroidal thickness measured with EDI-OCT can reveal active disease and potentially diagnose a leukemic relapse promptly.","['Adaniya, Agustina', 'Luciano, Andreas Di', 'Alvarado-Villacorta, Rosa', 'Saravia, Mario J', 'Morales-Canton, Virgilio', 'Bazterrechea, Pablo', 'Schlaen, Bernardo Ariel']","['Adaniya A', 'Luciano AD', 'Alvarado-Villacorta R', 'Saravia MJ', 'Morales-Canton V', 'Bazterrechea P', 'Schlaen BA']",,"['Retina and Vitreous Department at Asociacion Para Evitar la Ceguera (APEC), CDMX, Mexico, I.A.P.; Latin American Network for Research in Eye Diseases-LANRED.

Our objective was to estimate the budget impact of TKI discontinuation in CML patients in long-term DMR from the perspective of the French healthcare system. METHODS: This analysis was conducted over a 5-year time horizon using a Markov model with cycles of 6 months. Transition probabilities were estimated through systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Costs were estimated from the French National Claims Database. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to take into account the uncertainty surrounding model parameters. Sensitivity analyses were carried out by varying the size of the target population and the cost of TKIs. RESULTS: Over a 5-year period and for a target population of 100 patients each year eligible and agreeing to stop TKI, the TKI discontinuation strategy would save euro25.5 million (95% confidence interval -39.3 to 70.0). In this model, the probability that TKI discontinuation would be more expensive than TKI continuation was 12.0%. In sensitivity analyses, mean savings ranged from euro14.9 million to euro62.9 million. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides transparent, reproducible, and interpretable results for healthcare professionals and policy makers. Our results clearly show that innovative healthcare strategies can benefit both the healthcare system and patients. Savings from generalizing TKI discontinuation in CML patients in sustained DMR should yield health gains for other patients.","['Astrugue, Cyril', 'Benard, Antoine', 'Bosco-Levy, Pauline', 'Dulucq, Stephanie', 'Rouyer, Magali', 'Lassalle, Regis', 'Hayes, Nathalie', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier']","['Astrugue C', 'Benard A', 'Bosco-Levy P', 'Dulucq S', 'Rouyer M', 'Lassalle R', 'Hayes N', 'Mahon FX']",,"['University of Bordeaux, Inserm, Bordeaux Population Health Research Center, team EMOS, Bordeaux, France.', ""University of Bordeaux, Inserm, Bordeaux Population Health Research Center, team EMOS, Bordeaux, France; CHU de Bordeaux, Pole de sante publique, Service d'information medicale, Bordeaux, France."", 'Bordeaux PharmacoEpi, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', ""CHU de Bordeaux, Laboratoire d'hematologie, Bordeaux, France."", 'Bordeaux PharmacoEpi, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Bordeaux PharmacoEpi, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', ""CHU de Bordeaux, Direction de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation, Bordeaux, France."", ""CHU de Bordeaux, Laboratoire d'hematologie, Bordeaux, France; Institut Bergonie, Cancer Center Bordeaux, University of Bordeaux, France.

However, the 3-year survival rate of these patients is < 40% due to relapse caused by acquired VEN resistance, and this remains the greatest obstacle for the maintenance of long-term remission in VEN-sensitive patients. The underlying mechanism of acquired VEN resistance in AML remains largely unknown. Therefore, in the current study, nine AML patients with acquired VEN resistance were retrospectively analyzed. Our results showed that the known VEN resistance-associated BCL2 mutation was not present in our cohort, indicating that, in contrast to chronic lymphocytic leukemia, this BCL2 mutation is dispensable for acquired VEN resistance in AML. Instead, we found that reconstructed existing mutations, especially dominant mutation conversion (e.g., expanded FLT3-ITD), rather than newly emerged mutations (e.g., TP53 mutation), mainly contributed to VEN resistance in AML. According to our results, the combination of precise mutational monitoring and advanced interventions with targeted therapy or chemotherapy are potential strategies to prevent and even overcome acquired VEN resistance in AML.","['Zhang, Xiang', 'Qian, Jiejing', 'Wang, Huafeng', 'Wang, Yungui', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Qian, Pengxu', 'Lou, Yinjun', 'Jin, Jie', 'Zhu, Honghu']","['Zhang X', 'Qian J', 'Wang H', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Qian P', 'Lou Y', 'Jin J', 'Zhu H']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2343-0436'],"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, #79 Qingchun Rd, Hangzhou, 310003, Zhejiang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Zhejiang University Cancer Center, Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China.', ""Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", 'Zhejiang Laboratory for Systems & Precision Medicine, Zhejiang University Medical Center, 1369 West Wenyi Road, Hangzhou, 311121, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, #79 Qingchun Rd, Hangzhou, 310003, Zhejiang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, #79 Qingchun Rd, Hangzhou, 310003, Zhejiang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Zhejiang University Cancer Center, Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China.', ""Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", 'Zhejiang Laboratory for Systems & Precision Medicine, Zhejiang University Medical Center, 1369 West Wenyi Road, Hangzhou, 311121, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, #79 Qingchun Rd, Hangzhou, 310003, Zhejiang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, #79 Qingchun Rd, Hangzhou, 310003, Zhejiang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Zhejiang University Cancer Center, Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China.', ""Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", 'Zhejiang Laboratory for Systems & Precision Medicine, Zhejiang University Medical Center, 1369 West Wenyi Road, Hangzhou, 311121, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, #79 Qingchun Rd, Hangzhou, 310003, Zhejiang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, #79 Qingchun Rd, Hangzhou, 310003, Zhejiang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Zhejiang University Cancer Center, Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China.', ""Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, #79 Qingchun Rd, Hangzhou, 310003, Zhejiang, China. zhuhhdoc@163.com.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. zhuhhdoc@163.com.', 'Zhejiang University Cancer Center, Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China. zhuhhdoc@163.com.', ""Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China. zhuhhdoc@163.com."", 'Zhejiang Laboratory for Systems & Precision Medicine, Zhejiang University Medical Center, 1369 West Wenyi Road, Hangzhou, 311121, China. zhuhhdoc@163.com.']",['eng'],"['81800199/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'LY21H080003/Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province']",['Letter'],20210501,England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,PMC8088697,['NOTNLM'],"['Acquired resistance', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Venetoclax']",2021/05/03 06:00,2021/05/03 06:01,['2021/05/02 20:31'],"['2021/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/02 20:31 [entrez]', '2021/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40364-021-00288-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s40364-021-00288-7 [pii]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2021 May 1;9(1):30. doi: 10.1186/s40364-021-00288-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Materials and methods: All AML patients who were admitted to Hacettepe University hospital between 2000 and 2021 were evaluated. The medical records of 548 AML cases were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The frequency of CNS involvement was 2.4% (n = 13) at diagnosis and 4.6% (n = 25) at diagnosis or during follow-up. Parenchymal involvement was seen in 5 patients, leptomeningeal involvement was seen in 11 patients. Three patients had both leptomeningeal and parenchymal involvements, and 6 patients had optic nerve or ocular involvement. In univariate analysis, younger age and extramedullary involvement at diagnosis were associated with CNS disease at diagnosis, and extramedullary involvement at diagnosis was associated with CNS disease during follow-up. In multivariate analysis; younger age and extramedullary involvement at diagnosis were associated with CNS disease at diagnosis and during follow-up respectively. Median overall survival was 5.4 months in patients with CNS disease at diagnosis and 16.9 months in patients with CNS disease during follow-up and 16.2 months in patients with no CNS disease. Conclusion: CNS disease is a rare complication of AML. Younger age and extramedullary involvement at diagnosis are risk factors for CNS involvement.","['Yasar, Hatime Arzu', 'Cinar, Olgu Erkin', 'Yazdali Koylu, Nur', 'Barista, Ibrahim', 'Goker, Hakan', 'Buyukasik, Yahya']","['Yasar HA', 'Cinar OE', 'Yazdali Koylu N', 'Barista I', 'Goker H', 'Buyukasik Y']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0545-1383', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1226-5797', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3368-3464', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5733-439X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1039-7756', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4764-2348']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211021,Turkey,Turk J Med Sci,Turkish journal of medical sciences,9441758,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*central nervous system involvement', '*risk factors']",2021/05/03 06:00,2022/01/01 06:00,['2021/05/02 17:26'],"['2021/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/02 17:26 [entrez]', '2021/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3906/sag-2103-127 [doi]'],epublish,Turk J Med Sci. 2021 Oct 21;51(5):2351-2356. doi: 10.3906/sag-2103-127.,20211231,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Central Nervous System', '*Central Nervous System Diseases/complications', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']","['This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International', 'License.']",,,,,['The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

L-asparaginase toxicity is either related to hypersensitivity to the foreign protein or to a secondary L-glutaminase activity that causes inhibition of protein synthesis. PEGylated versions have been incorporated into the treatment protocols to reduce immunogenicity and an alternative L-asparaginase derived from Dickeya chrysanthemi is used in patients with anaphylactic reactions to the E. coli L-asparaginase. Alternative approaches commonly explore new sources of the enzyme as well as the use of protein engineering techniques to create less immunogenic, more stable variants with lower L-glutaminase activity. This article reviews the main strategies used to overcome L-asparaginase shortcomings and introduces recent tools that can be used to create therapeutic enzymes with improved features.","['Fonseca, Marcela Helena Gambim', 'Fiuza, Tayna da Silva', 'Morais, Stephanie Bath de', 'Souza, Tatiana de Arruda Campos Brasil de', 'Trevizani, Raphael']","['Fonseca MHG', 'Fiuza TDS', 'Morais SB', 'Souza TACB', 'Trevizani R']",,"['Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Fiocruz-Ceara, Eusebio, CE 61760-000, Brazil.', 'Bioinformatics Multidisciplinary Environment, BioME, Natal, RN 59078-400, Brazil.', 'Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Instituto Carlos Chagas, Curitiba, PR 81350010, Brazil.', 'Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Instituto Carlos Chagas, Curitiba, PR 81350010, Brazil.', 'Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Fiocruz-Ceara, Eusebio, CE 61760-000, Brazil.

The potential causes of coagulopathy are inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, and stasis. The thrombotic events including pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis as well as intracatheter thrombosis are more likely to develop in patients infected with severe form of SARS-CoV-2 who are admitted to ICU. Furthermore, these events contribute to multi-organ failure. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we report a case of an immunocompromised COVID-19 elderly patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia who developed myocardial infarction with ST elevation in the setting of acute pulmonary thromboembolism in the presence of zero platelet count. Despite successful urgent coronary revascularization and platelet transfusion, the patient eventually died after failed resuscitation efforts. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 infection are at a greater risk of developing cardiovascular complications, but their appropriate management can decrease the risk of fatal events. Coronary thrombosis associated with pulmonary thromboembolism in the setting of thrombocytopenia is a rare and a complex to manage condition. Significance of single antiplatelet agent in STEMI with thrombocytopenia merits further studies. According to expert opinions and literature reviews, we must avoid dual antiplatelet therapy in these patients and keep platelet transfusion as a standard therapy to avoid drastic bleeding complications.","['Hashemi, Arash', 'Gerges, Fady', 'Naqvi, Haseeb Raza', 'Kotlar, Irina', 'Moscatelli, Sara', 'Hashemi, Ashkan', 'Rustamova, Yasmin', 'Almaghraby, Abdallah']","['Hashemi A', 'Gerges F', 'Naqvi HR', 'Kotlar I', 'Moscatelli S', 'Hashemi A', 'Rustamova Y', 'Almaghraby A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8813-119X'],"['Department of Cardiology, Erfan General Hospital, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Science, Mediclinic Al Jowhara Hospital, P.O. box 84142, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates. dr_fadyaziz@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Cardiac Electrophysiology, Mukhtar A.

Our series of 280 patients depicted an older age at diagnosis (median 72 years old), 26% of aberrant karyotypes, and a prevalence of myelodysplastic (60%) and CMML-0 subtypes (56%). The median overall survival (OS) was 48.2 months for patients in CMML-0 (Ref.), 24.7 months for those in CMML-1 (HR = 2.0, p = 0.001), and 8.8 months for patients in CMML-2 (HR = 4.6, p < 0.001). In the CMML-0 category, median OS were different between myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative subtypes (63.7 vs 21.2 months, p < 0.001); however, no differences were observed within CMML-1 and CMML-2 subtypes (24.7 vs 23.7 months, p = 0.540, and 9.1 vs 8.2 months, p = 0.160).

We aimed to characterize the prevalence and factors associated with the use of cannabis for the treatment of cancer and management of cancer-related symptoms in children during or after cancer treatment. METHODS: An anonymous 40 question paper survey was offered to patients/caregivers of children with cancer attending a pediatric oncology clinic in a provincially mandated cancer agency between October 2019 and March 2020. RESULTS: There were 64 respondents included in the analysis. Fourteen participants (N=14/64; 22%) reported use of cannabis, of which half used cannabis for either cancer treatment or symptom management, or both. Leukemia (n=9/14; 64%) was the most frequent diagnosis in children whose caregivers reported using cannabis and the majority of them were still receiving active cancer treatment (N= 5/9; 56%). All of the respondents using cannabis (14/14, 100%) experienced symptom improvement. Most of the caregivers procured cannabis from their friends (N=5/14; 36%), and oil was the most commonly used formulation (N=12/14; 86%). Cannabis-related information was received from another parent (N=4/14; 29%) or from a doctor (N=4/14; 29%). The reported monthly expenditure on cannabis varied widely from less than $50 CAD (N=4/14; 29%) to more than $500 CAD (N=3/14; 21%). CONCLUSIONS: Our survey shows that cannabis, mostly oil products, was used by one-fifth of children with cancer during or after the completion of cancer treatment. These findings require validation in a larger nationwide survey.","['Chapman, Stacy', 'Protudjer, Jennifer', 'Bourne, Cathy', 'Kelly, Lauren E', 'Oberoi, Sapna', 'Vanan, Magimairajan Issai']","['Chapman S', 'Protudjer J', 'Bourne C', 'Kelly LE', 'Oberoi S', 'Vanan MI']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4825-6780'],"['Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Section of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, CancerCare Manitoba, ON-2038, 675 McDermot Ave, Winnipeg, MB, R3E 0V9, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', ""The Children's Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada."", 'Section of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, CancerCare Manitoba, ON-2038, 675 McDermot Ave, Winnipeg, MB, R3E 0V9, Canada.', 'Section of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, CancerCare Manitoba, ON-2038, 675 McDermot Ave, Winnipeg, MB, R3E 0V9, Canada.', ""The Children's Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada."", 'Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Section of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, CancerCare Manitoba, ON-2038, 675 McDermot Ave, Winnipeg, MB, R3E 0V9, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. mivanan@cancercare.mb.ca.', 'Section of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, CancerCare Manitoba, ON-2038, 675 McDermot Ave, Winnipeg, MB, R3E 0V9, Canada. mivanan@cancercare.mb.ca.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210501,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cannabis', 'Medical marijuana', 'Pediatric oncology', 'Symptom management']",2021/05/02 06:00,2021/10/16 06:00,['2021/05/01 12:03'],"['2020/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/01 12:03 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-021-06202-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-021-06202-z [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2021 Nov;29(11):6589-6594. doi: 10.1007/s00520-021-06202-z.

MSCs from AML patients (AML-MSCs) display enhanced adipogenesis compared with bone marrow MSCs from healthy donors. However, the precise molecular mechanism by which adipogenesis of MSCs from AML marrow differs from normal counterparts remains obscure. We found that METTL3 significantly inhibits MSC adipogenesis. Here, we aimed to identify the molecular mechanism linking METTL3 and MSC adipogenesis. Analysis of m(6) A epigenetic changes in MSCs determined via RIP-qPCR and MeRIP-qPCR indicated that METTL3 affects AKT protein expression in MSCs by mediating m(6) A modification of AKT1-mRNA. Downregulated METTL3 expression in AML-MSCs induced an increase in AKT protein, resulting in enhanced MSC adipogenesis, thereby contributing to chemoresistance in AML cells. Therefore, targeting AKT regulation by mRNA modification in MSC adipogenesis might provide a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome AML chemoresistance.","['Pan, Zhi-Peng', 'Wang, Bin', 'Hou, Di-Yu', 'You, Ruo-Lan', 'Wang, Xiao-Ting', 'Xie, Wen-Hui', 'Huang, Hui-Fang']","['Pan ZP', 'Wang B', 'Hou DY', 'You RL', 'Wang XT', 'Xie WH', 'Huang HF']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2691-1147'],"['Central Laboratory, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, China.', ""Clinical Laboratory, Fujian Maternal and Child Health Hospital, Fujian Children's Hospital, China."", 'Central Laboratory, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, China.', 'Graduate School, Fujian Medical University, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210520,England,FEBS Open Bio,FEBS open bio,101580716,PMC8167861,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*MSCs', '*adipogenesis', '*chemoresistance', '*m6A']",2021/05/02 06:00,2021/05/02 06:00,['2021/05/01 08:44'],"['2021/03/13 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/02 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/01 08:44 [entrez]']",['10.1002/2211-5463.13165 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS Open Bio. 2021 Jun;11(6):1659-1672. doi: 10.1002/2211-5463.13165.

There is no consensus on the indication of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) for prophylaxis of relapse after allo-HSCT. To evaluate the tolerance and efficacy of prophylactic DLI in patients with unfavourable gene mutations such as FLT3-ITD, TP53, ASXL1, DNMT3A or TET2, we performed a prospective, single-arm study. Prophylactic use of decitabine followed by DLI was planned in patients with TP53 or epigenetic modifier gene mutations. The prophylaxis was planned in 46 recipients: it was administered in 28 patients and it was not administered in 18 patients due to contraindications. No DLI-associated pancytopenia was observed. The cumulative incidences of grade II-IV and III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at 100 days post-DLI were 25.8% and 11.0%, respectively. The rates of chronic GVHD, non-relapse mortality and relapse at 3 years post-DLI were 21.6%, 25.0% and 26.1%, respectively.

In our study, 3 patients with refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and 4 patients with refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) reached stable disease (SD), partial remission (PR), or progression of disease (PD) after first-time humanized anti-CD19-CAR T-cell therapy. They received ibrutinib as a salvage treatment and kept an SD in the following 7-16 mo, but their disease progressed again during ibrutinib salvage treatment. All 7 patients received a second-time humanized anti-CD19-CAR T-cell therapy, which was the same as their first-time anti-CD19-CAR T-cell therapy. In total, 3 MCL patients and 3 FL patients reached complete response (CR) with the second-time anti-CD19-CAR T-cell therapy combined with ibrutinib, whereas 1 FL patient reached PR. There were no differences in the transduction efficiency and proliferation between the 2 instances of anti-CD19-CAR T-cell therapy. However, the second-time anti-CD19-CAR T-cell therapy led to higher peaks of anti-CD19-CAR T cells and anti-CD19-CAR gene copies, but also to higher grades of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and more serious hematological toxicity. The successful outcome of the second-time anti-CD19-CAR T-cell therapy might suggest that the previous ibrutinib treatment improved the activities of anti-CD19-CAR T cells.","['Liu, Meijing', 'Deng, Haobin', 'Mu, Juan', 'Li, Qing', 'Pu, Yedi', 'Jiang, Yili', 'Deng, Qi', 'Qian, Zhengzi']","['Liu M', 'Deng H', 'Mu J', 'Li Q', 'Pu Y', 'Jiang Y', 'Deng Q', 'Qian Z']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2339-0892'],"['The First Central Clinical College of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'The First Central Clinical College of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', ""Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China.""]",['eng'],['15KG135/Tianjin Municipal Health Bureau of Science and Technology'],['Journal Article'],20210510,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,PMC8253282,['NOTNLM'],"['chimeric antigen receptor', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'ibrutinib', 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'programmed death-1']",2021/05/02 06:00,2021/07/09 06:00,['2021/05/01 08:39'],"['2021/04/01 00:00 [revised]', '2021/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [medline]', '2021/05/01 08:39 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.14915 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2021 Jul;112(7):2642-2651. doi: 10.1111/cas.14915.

We compared outcomes using HLA-matched unrelated donors (MUD) versus haploidentical donors in this population. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). The MUD allo-HCT group comprised 104 patients (male = 56, 54%), median age 36 years, mostly (76%) with B-cell phenotype in complete remission (CR) (CR2/CR3 + = 76, 73%). The 61 patients (male = 38, 62%) in the haploidentical group were younger, median age 30 years (p = 0.002), had mostly (79%) a B-cell phenotype and the majority were also in CR at time of the second allo-HCT (CR2/CR3 + = 40, 66%). Peripheral blood stem cells was the most common cell source in both, but a significantly higher number in the haploidentical group received bone marrow cells (26% vs. 4%, p < 0.0001). A haploidentical donor second allo-HCT had a 1.5-fold higher 2-year OS (49% vs. 31%), albeit not statistically significant (p = 0.13). A longer time from first allo-HCT to relapse was associated with improved OS, leukemia-free survival, graft-versus-host disease-free-relapse-free survival, and lower cumulative incidences of relapse and non-relapse mortality. Results suggest no major OS difference when choosing either a MUD or haploidentical donor for ALL patients needing a second allo-HCT.","['Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Bruno, Benedetto', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Gedde-Dahl, Tobias', 'Labussiere-Wallet, Helene', 'Niittyvuopio, Riitta', 'Valerius, Thomas', 'Angelucci, Emanuele', 'Brecht, Arne', 'Caballero, Dolores', 'Kuball, Jurgen', 'Potter, Victoria', 'Schmid, Christoph', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Zuckerman, Tsila', 'Benedetti, Fabio', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Diez-Martin, Jose Luis', 'Sanz, Jaime', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Brissot, Eolia', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Kharfan-Dabaja MA', 'Labopin M', 'Bazarbachi A', 'Ciceri F', 'Finke J', 'Bruno B', 'Bornhauser M', 'Gedde-Dahl T', 'Labussiere-Wallet H', 'Niittyvuopio R', 'Valerius T', 'Angelucci E', 'Brecht A', 'Caballero D', 'Kuball J', 'Potter V', 'Schmid C', 'Tischer J', 'Zuckerman T', 'Benedetti F', 'Blaise D', 'Diez-Martin JL', 'Sanz J', 'Ruggeri A', 'Brissot E', 'Savani BN', 'Giebel S', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7394-5185', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4514-4748', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7171-4997', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0873-0123', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3914-7806', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6204-977X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5684-9447', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6934-4619', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7261-2765', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3304-9965', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4827-4401', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0763-1265', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7264-808X']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Hopital Saint Antoine, Sorbonne University and INSERM UMRs 938, Paris, France.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Ospedale San Raffaele s.r.l.

Thus, eradication of LSCs may be a promising strategy for curing CML. In this study, we found that protein lysine methyltransferase G9A was overexpressed in CML LSCs. The upregulation of G9A by BCR-ABL was independent on its tyrosine kinase activity. Knockdown of G9A by shRNAs or pharmacological inhibition of G9A by UNC0642 significantly suppressed survival and impaired self-renewal capacity of CML LSCs. Inhibition of G9a eradicated LSCs in CML mice driven by BCR-ABL gene and dramatically prolonged survival of the mice. Ex vivo treatment with G9A inhibitor inhibited long-term engraftment of CML CD34(+) cells in immunodeficient mice. Mechanically, tumor suppressor SOX6 was identified as a direct target of G9A in CML LSCs by RNA-seq analysis. Silencing Sox6 at least partially rescued G9a knockdown-mediated LSCs elimination in vivo.

However, their mechanisms are poorly understood, in particular with regard to differences between ITP phases, patient age, and therapy. We investigated platelet function and bleeding in children with either persistent or chronic ITP, with or without romiplostim therapy. The study included 151 children with ITP, of whom 56 had disease duration less than 12 months (grouped together as acute/persistent) and 95 were chronic. Samples of 57 healthy children were used as controls, while 5 patients with leukemia, 5 with aplastic anemia, 4 with MYH9-associated thrombocytopenia, and 7 with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome were used as non-ITP thrombocytopenia controls. Whole blood flow cytometry revealed that platelets in both acute/persistent and chronic ITP were increased in size compared with healthy donors. They were also pre-activated as assessed by PAC1, CD62p, cytosolic calcium, and procoagulant platelet levels. This pattern was not observed in other childhood thrombocytopenias. Pre-activation by CD62p was higher in the bleeding group in the chronic ITP cohort only. Romiplostim treatment decreased size and pre-activation of the patient platelets, but not calcium. Our data suggest that increased size, pre-activation, and cytosolic calcium are common for all ITP platelets, but their association with bleeding could depend on the disease phase.","['Ignatova,

Here, we develop and validate a clinical transcriptome-based assay for stratification of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Comparison of ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-Seq) to whole genome and exome sequencing reveals that a standalone RNA-Seq assay offers the greatest diagnostic return, enabling identification of expressed gene fusions, single nucleotide and short insertion/deletion variants, and whole-transcriptome expression information. Expression data from 154 AML patients are used to develop a novel AML prognostic score, which is strongly associated with patient outcomes across 620 patients from three independent cohorts, and 42 patients from a prospective cohort. When combined with molecular risk guidelines, the risk score allows for the re-stratification of 22.1 to 25.3% of AML patients from three independent cohorts into correct risk groups. Within the adverse-risk subgroup, we identify a subset of patients characterized by dysregulated integrin signaling and RUNX1 or TP53 mutation. We show that these patients may benefit from therapy with inhibitors of focal adhesion kinase, encoded by PTK2, demonstrating additional utility of transcriptome-based testing for therapy selection in myeloid malignancy.","['Docking, T Roderick', 'Parker, Jeremy D K', 'Jadersten, Martin', 'Duns, Gerben', 'Chang, Linda', 'Jiang, Jihong', 'Pilsworth, Jessica A', 'Swanson, Lucas A', 'Chan, Simon K',

Whether tumor suppressor gene haploinsufficiency leads to such phenomena and their mechanistic basis is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that elevated levels of the anti-apoptotic factor, CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator (CFLAR), promotes apoptosis evasion in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells haploinsufficient for the cut-like homeobox 1 (CUX1) transcription factor, whose loss is associated with dismal clinical prognosis. Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening identifies CFLAR as a selective, acquired vulnerability in CUX1-deficient AML, which can be mimicked therapeutically using inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) antagonists in murine and human AML cells. Mechanistically, CUX1 deficiency directly alleviates CUX1 repression of the CFLAR promoter to drive CFLAR expression and leukemia survival. These data establish how haploinsufficiency of a tumor suppressor is sufficient to induce advantageous anti-apoptosis cell survival pathways and concurrently nominate CFLAR as potential therapeutic target in these poor-prognosis leukemias.","['Supper, Emmanuelle', 'Rudat, Saskia', 'Iyer, Vivek', 'Droop, Alastair', 'Wong, Kim', 'Spinella, Jean-Francois', 'Thomas, Patrick', 'Sauvageau, Guy', 'Adams, David J', 'Wong, Chi C']","['Supper E', 'Rudat S', 'Iyer V', 'Droop A', 'Wong K', 'Spinella JF', 'Thomas P', 'Sauvageau G', 'Adams DJ', 'Wong CC']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0984-1477', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4333-7266', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9490-0306', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4520-2688']","['Experimental Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.', 'Experimental Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.', 'Experimental Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.', 'Experimental Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.', 'Experimental Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.', 'The Leucegene Project at Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, 2950 Chemin de Polytechnique Pavillon, Marcelle-Coutu, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Experimental Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.', 'The Leucegene Project at Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, 2950 Chemin de Polytechnique Pavillon, Marcelle-Coutu, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Experimental Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.', 'Experimental Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK. cw6@sanger.ac.uk.', ""Department of Haematology, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK. cw6@sanger.ac.uk.""]",['eng'],"['105914/Z/14/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'CIHR/Canada']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210430,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,PMC8087769,,,2021/05/02 06:00,2021/05/13 06:00,['2021/05/01 06:04'],"['2020/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/01 06:04 [entrez]', '2021/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-021-22750-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-021-22750-8 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2021 Apr 30;12(1):2482. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-22750-8.,20210512,"['0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (Cux1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '6O4Z07B57R (birinapant)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Dipeptides/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Gene Ontology', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', '*Haploinsufficiency', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Array Analysis', 'Repressor Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because KRAS itself is a challenging therapeutic target, we focused on understanding key signaling pathways driven by KRAS as a way to reveal dependencies that are amenable to therapeutic intervention. Analyses in primary human pancreatic cancers and model systems revealed that the receptor for the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is downregulated by mutant KRAS. Furthermore, downregulation of the LIF receptor (LIFR) is necessary for KRAS-mediated neoplastic transformation. We found LIFR exerts inhibitory effects on KRAS-mediated transformation by inhibiting expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1, a key mediator of the enhanced glycolysis found in KRAS-driven malignancies. Decreased LIFR expression leads to increased GLUT1 as well as increases in glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. The repression of GLUT1 by LIFR is mediated by the transcription factor STAT3, indicating a tumor-suppressive role for STAT3 within cancer cells with mutated KRAS. Finally, reflecting a clinically important tumor-suppressive role of LIFR, decreased LIFR expression correlates with shorter survival in pancreatic cancer patients with mutated KRAS. Similar findings were found in non-small cell lung cancers driven by mutated KRAS, suggesting that silencing LIFR is a generalized mechanism of KRAS-mediated cellular transformation. These results indicate that the LIFR/STAT3 pathway may mediate either tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressive signaling pathways depending on the genetic background of tumor cells, and may play diverse roles within other cells in the tumor microenvironment. IMPLICATIONS: Mutant KRAS drives downregulation of the receptor for LIF, thereby allowing an increase in expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 and increases in glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration.","['Liu, Suhu', 'Gandler, Helen I', 'Tosic, Isidora', 'Ye, Darwin Q', 'Giaccone, Zachary T', 'Frank, David A']","['Liu S', 'Gandler HI', 'Tosic I', 'Ye DQ', 'Giaccone ZT', 'Frank DA']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8489-7668', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7698-8364']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Departments of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Departments of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Departments of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Departments of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.

Similarly, upregulation of co-inhibitory receptors has been reported in T cells in hematological cancers such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, the role of CD160, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, as one of these co-inhibitory receptors has been contradictory in T cell function. Therefore, we decided to elucidate how CD160 expression and/or co-expression with other co-inhibitory receptors influence T cell effector functions in patients with CLL. METHODS: We studied 56 patients with CLL and 25 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls in this study. The expression of different co-inhibitory receptors was analyzed in T cells obtained from the peripheral blood or the bone marrow. Also, we quantified the properties of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the plasma of patients with CLL versus healthy controls. Finally, we measured 29 different cytokines, chemokines or other biomarkers in the plasma specimens of patients with CLL and healthy controls. RESULTS: We found that CD160 was the most upregulated co-inhibitory receptor in patients with CLL. Its expression was associated with an exhausted T cell phenotype. CD160(+)CD8(+) T cells were highly antigen-experienced/effector T cells, while CD160(+)CD4(+) T cells were more heterogeneous. In particular, we identified EVs as a source of CD160 in the plasma of patients with CLL that can be taken up by T cells. Moreover, we observed a dominantly proinflammatory cytokine profile in the plasma of patients with CLL. In particular, interleukin-16 (IL-16) was highly elevated and correlated with the advanced clinical stage (Rai). Furthermore, we observed that the incubation of T cells with IL-16 results in the upregulation of CD160. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a novel insight into the influence of CD160 expression/co-expression with other co-inhibitory receptors in T cell effector functions in patients with CLL. Besides, IL-16-mediated upregulation of CD160 expression in T cells highlights the importance of IL-16/CD160 as potential immunotherapy targets in patients with CLL. Therefore, our findings propose a significant role for CD160 in T cell exhaustion in patients with CLL.","['Bozorgmehr, Najmeh', 'Okoye, Isobel', 'Oyegbami, Olaide', 'Xu, Lai', 'Fontaine, Amelie', 'Cox-Kennett, Nanette', 'Larratt, Loree M', 'Hnatiuk, Mark', 'Fagarasanu, Andrei', 'Brandwein, Joseph', 'Peters, Anthea C', 'Elahi, Shokrollah']","['Bozorgmehr N', 'Okoye I', 'Oyegbami O', 'Xu L', 'Fontaine A', 'Cox-Kennett N', 'Larratt LM', 'Hnatiuk M', 'Fagarasanu A', 'Brandwein J', 'Peters AC', 'Elahi S']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7215-2009'],"['School of Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'School of Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'School of Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'School of Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'School of Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada elahi@ualberta.ca.', 'Department of Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,PMC8098955,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-lymphocytes', '*T-lymphocytes', '*cellular', '*costimulatory and inhibitory T-cell receptors', '*cytokines', '*immunity']",2021/05/02 06:00,2021/12/18 06:00,['2021/05/01 05:56'],"['2021/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/01 05:56 [entrez]', '2021/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['jitc-2020-002189 [pii]', '10.1136/jitc-2020-002189 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2021 Apr;9(4). pii: jitc-2020-002189. doi: 10.1136/jitc-2020-002189.,20211217,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD160 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Extracellular Vesicles/immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism']","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Emerging data suggest that CLL-cells efficiently evade immunosurveillance. T-cell deficiencies in CLL include immuno(metabolic) exhaustion that is achieved by inhibitory molecules, with programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) signaling emerging as a major underlying mechanism. Moreover, CLL-cells are characterized by a close and recurrent interaction with their stromal niches in the bone marrow and lymph nodes. Here, they receive nurturing signals within a well-protected environment. We could previously show that the interaction of CLL-cells with stroma leads to c-Myc activation that is followed by metabolic adaptations. Recent data indicate that c-Myc also controls expression of the immune checkpoint molecule PD-L1. Therefore, we sought out to determine the role of stromal contact for the CLL-cells' PD-L1 expression and thus their immuno-evasive phenotype.To do so, we analyzed PD-L1 expression on CLL cell (subsets) in untreated patients and on healthy donor-derived B-cells. Impact of stromal contact on PD-L1 expression on CLL-cells and the underlying signaling pathways were assessed in well-established in vitro niche models. Ex vivo and in vitro findings were validated in the Emicro-TCL1 transgenic CLL mouse model.We found increased PD-L1 expression on CLL-cells as compared with B-cells that was further enhanced in a cell-to-cell contact-dependent manner by stromal cells. In fact, circulating recent stromal-niche emigrants displayed higher PD-L1 levels than long-time circulating CLL-cells. Using our in vitro niche model, we show that a novel Notch-c-Myc-enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) signaling axis controls PD-L1 upregulation. Ultimately, elevated PD-L1 levels conferred increased resistance towards activated autologous T-cells.In summary, our findings support the notion that the CLL microenvironment contributes to immune escape variants. In addition, several targetable molecules (eg, Notch or EZH2) could be exploited in view of improving immune responses in patients with CLL, which warrants further in-depth investigation.","['Bottcher, Martin', 'Bruns, Heiko', 'Volkl, Simon', 'Lu, Junyan', 'Chartomatsidou, Elisavet', 'Papakonstantinou, Nikos', 'Mentz, Kristin', 'Buttner-Herold, Maike', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Herling, Marco', 'Huber, Wolfgang', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Mackensen, Andreas', 'Mougiakakos, Dimitrios']","['Bottcher M', 'Bruns H', 'Volkl S', 'Lu J', 'Chartomatsidou E', 'Papakonstantinou N', 'Mentz K', 'Buttner-Herold M', 'Zenz T', 'Herling M', 'Huber W', 'Ghia P', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Mackensen A', 'Mougiakakos D']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2911-8830'],"['Department of Internal Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Bayern, Germany martin.boettcher@uk-erlangen.de.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Bayern, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Bayern, Germany.', 'Genome Biology Unit, EMBL, Heidelberg, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology and Department of Onco-Hematology, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milano, Lombardia, Italy.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology-Hellas, Thessaloniki, Central Macedonia, Greece.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Bayern, Germany.', 'Department of Nephropathology, Institute of Pathology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Bayern, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, UniversitatsSpital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, CMMC, CECAD, CIO-ABCD, University of Cologne, Koln, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany.', 'Genome Biology Unit, EMBL, Heidelberg, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology and Department of Onco-Hematology, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milano, Lombardia, Italy.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology-Hellas, Thessaloniki, Central Macedonia, Greece.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Bayern, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 for Hematology and Oncology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Bayern, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,PMC8098943,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-lymphocytes', '*hematologic neoplasms', '*immunomodulation', '*programmed cell death 1 receptor', '*tumor microenvironment']",2021/05/02 06:00,2021/12/18 06:00,['2021/05/01 05:56'],"['2021/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/01 05:56 [entrez]', '2021/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['jitc-2020-001889 [pii]', '10.1136/jitc-2020-001889 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2021 Apr;9(4). pii: jitc-2020-001889. doi: 10.1136/jitc-2020-001889.,20211217,"['0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B7-H1 Antigen/genetics/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Escape', 'Tumor Microenvironment']","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

We investigated the clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes of adult AML patients in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively included 3851 patients with AML in the Taiwan Cancer Registry Database from 2011 to 2015. We excluded patients younger than 20 years, with acute promyelocytic leukemia, and with no pathological confirmation. RESULTS: Among the 3292 patients included, 2179 received induction chemotherapy and 1113 did not, because of older age and higher Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score. Among the 2179 treated patients, 162 received high-dose cytarabine-based chemotherapy, 1535 received standard-dose cytarabine with anthracyclines, 209 received low-dose cytarabine-based chemotherapy, and 273 received chemotherapy without cytarabine. Patients in the low-dose cytarabine group had the oldest age and highest CCI scores compared with the other groups. In the analysis of overall survival (OS), the median OS of the overall study population was 6.27 months. Treated patients with AML had a longer OS than untreated ones (12.43 months treated vs. 2.03 months not treated; P < .0001).

The LSC frequency at diagnosis was significantly higher compared with that postinduction (P < .001). Patients were categorized into high LSC expressers (>/= median) and low expressers (< median). Patients with AML with high number of LSCs at diagnosis had significantly lower induction of remission response (P = .0104), shorter disease-free survival, and shorter overall survival (P < .001 for both) compared with those with lower LSC count. Cox regression analysis revealed that LSC frequency at diagnosis is an independent prognostic factor in AML.

Here, we use atomically detailed simulations within the Milestoning framework to study the molecular dissociation mechanism of Gleevec from Abl kinase. We compute the dissociation free energy profile, the mean first passage time for unbinding, and explore the transition state ensemble of conformations. The milestones form a multidimensional network with average connectivity of about 2.93, which is significantly higher than the connectivity for a one-dimensional reaction coordinate. The free energy barrier for Gleevec dissociation is estimated to be approximately 10 kcal/mol, and the exit time is approximately 55 ms. We examined the transition state conformations using both, the committor and transition function. We show that near the transition state the highly conserved salt bridge K217 and E286 is transiently broken. Together with the calculated free energy profile, these calculations can advance the understanding of the molecular interaction mechanisms between Gleevec and Abl kinase and play a role in future drug design and optimization studies.","['Narayan, Brajesh', 'Buchete, Nicolae-Viorel', 'Elber, Ron']","['Narayan B', 'Buchete NV', 'Elber R']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9861-1157', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7849-415X']","['School of Physics, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland.', 'Institute for Discovery, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland.', 'School of Physics, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland.', 'Institute for Discovery, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland.', 'Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Science, Department of Chemistry, University of Texas at Austin, Austin Texas 78712, United States.']",['eng'],['R01 GM059796/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210430,United States,J Phys Chem B,The journal of physical chemistry.

To this end, we determined the relationship between the particular MTHFR1298 genotype (AA, AC or CC) of 31 adult childhood-leukemia survivors, and (1) their CSF Tau and phosphorylated Tau (pTau) levels at the time of treatment, (2) their adult performance intelligence quotient (PIQ), and (3) their regional brain connectivity using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI). We confirmed that neuropathology markers Tau and pTau significantly increased in CSF of children after intrathecal methotrexate administration. Highest concentrations of these toxicity markers were found during the induction phase of the therapy. Moreover, CSF concentrations of Tau and pTau during treatment were influenced by the children's particular MTHFR1298 genotype. CSF Tau (but not pTau) levels significantly dropped after folinic acid supplementation. At adult age (on average 13.1 years since the end of their treatment), their particular MTHFR1298 genotype (AA, AC or CC) influenced the changes in PIQ and cortical connectivity that we found to be related to their childhood exposure to chemotherapeutics. In summary, we suggest that homozygous MTHFR1298CC individuals are more vulnerable to the adult sequelae of antifolate chemotherapy.","['Elens, Iris', 'Deprez, Sabine', 'Billiet, Thibo', 'Sleurs, Charlotte', 'Labarque, Veerle', 'Uyttebroeck, Anne', 'Van Gool, Stefaan', 'Lemiere, Jurgen', ""D'Hooge, Rudi""]","['Elens I', 'Deprez S', 'Billiet T', 'Sleurs C', 'Labarque V', 'Uyttebroeck A', 'Van Gool S', 'Lemiere J', ""D'Hooge R""]","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9264-2593', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4480-8330']","['Laboratory of Biological Psychology, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, KU Leuven, University Psychiatric Centre Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Psychiatry, AZ Delta, Roeselare, Belgium.', 'Department of Imaging and Pathology, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Radiology, University Hospital Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Radiology, University Hospital Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Icometrix, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Radiology, University Hospital Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Immunologisch Onkologisches Zentrum Koln, Koln, Germany.', 'Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, KU Leuven, University Psychiatric Centre Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Biological Psychology, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210430,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC8087097,,,2021/05/01 06:00,2021/10/13 06:00,['2021/04/30 17:37'],"['2019/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 17:37 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0250228 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-35942 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2021 Apr 30;16(4):e0250228. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0250228. eCollection 2021.,20211012,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (tau Proteins)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brain/pathology', 'Cancer Survivors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition/*drug effects', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Therapy/methods', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/genetics', 'Female', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/therapeutic use', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Intelligence Tests', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Rest/physiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult', 'tau Proteins/analysis/cerebrospinal fluid']",,,,,,"[""The authors have read the journal's policy and have the following competing"", 'interests: TB is an employee of Icometrix.

This is primarily attributed to the efficacy of venetoclax as a time-limited, chemo-free, therapy in a field dominated by targeted agents given on a continuous schedule. Furthermore, compelling clinical data support the use of venetoclax in combination with other targeted agents in the hope of preventing drug resistance due to the emergence of acquired mutations.Areas covered: This paper provides an overview of clinical results of newly approved or investigational venetoclax-based therapies for CLL. In view of current and potential roles in CLL care, the strengths and disadvantages of venetoclax-combinations are discussed. The MEDLINE database, ClinicalTrials.gov and conference proceedings were all reviewed to select the relevant literature.Expert opinion: While the advent of venetoclax-based combinations has significantly expanded the therapeutic options for patients with CLL, further research with longer follow-up is required to address remaining open questions such as (I) the role of venetoclax as fixed duration therapy(II) timing and threshold of minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment for therapy discontinuation, (III) the efficacy of novel triplet combinations with venetoclax as backbone therapy, (IV) indications for the re-initiation of therapy with venetoclax.","['Molica, Stefano', 'Allsup, David', 'Gianfelici, Valentina', 'Levato, Luciano', 'Aiello, Vincenzo', 'Bailey, James', 'Polliack, Aaron']","['Molica S', 'Allsup D', 'Gianfelici V', 'Levato L', 'Aiello V', 'Bailey J', 'Polliack A']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6159-6109'],"['Department Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro,Italy.', 'Centre for Atherothrombosis and Metabolic Disease, Hull York Medical School, Hull, UK.', 'Department Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro,Italy.', 'Department Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro,Italy.', 'Rheumatology, Universita Degli Studi Della Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli, Napoli, Italy.', 'Department of Haematology, Hull Royal Infirmary, Hull, UK.', 'Department Hematology, Hadassah University Hospital and Hebrew University Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210515,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'MRD', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'combination therapy', 'minimal residual disease', 'venetoclax', 'venetoclax-based therapies']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/07/08 06:00,['2021/04/30 17:29'],"['2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/30 17:29 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13543784.2021.1924669 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2021 Jun;30(6):621-633. doi: 10.1080/13543784.2021.1924669.

In addition to their classical canonical antagonistic transcriptional functions, noncanonical synergistic and nontranscriptional functions of PcG and TrxG are emerging. Here, we review the biochemical properties of major mammalian PcG and TrxG complexes and their roles in AML disease biology, including disease maintenance as well as drug resistance.

For example, it is shown that a 1000-day Mars exploration mission with a hypothetical mission effective dose of 1.07 Sv at typical astronaut ages around 40 years old, will result in the probability of surviving free of all types of solid cancer and leukemia until retirement age (65 years) being reduced by 4.2% (95% CI 3.2; 5.3) for males and 5.8% (95% CI 4.8; 7.0) for females. RADS dose-responses are given, for the outcomes for incidence of all solid cancer, leukemia, lung and female breast cancer. Results showing how RADS varies with age at exposure, attained age and other factors are also presented. The advantages of this alternative approach, over currently applied methodologies for the long-term radiation protection of astronauts after mission exposures, are presented with example calculations applicable to European astronaut occupational HRA. Some tentative suggestions for new types of occupational risk limits for space missions are given while acknowledging that the setting of astronaut radiation-related risk limits will ultimately be decided by the Space Agencies. Suggestions are provided for further work which builds on and extends this new HRA approach, e.g., by eventually including non-cancer effects and detailed space dosimetry.","['Walsh, Linda', 'Hafner, Luana', 'Straube, Ulrich', 'Ulanowski, Alexander', 'Fogtman, Anna', 'Durante, Marco', 'Weerts, Guillaume', 'Schneider, Uwe']","['Walsh L', 'Hafner L', 'Straube U', 'Ulanowski A', 'Fogtman A', 'Durante M', 'Weerts G', 'Schneider U']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7399-9191', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5218-9293', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4863-4128']","['Department of Physics, Science Faculty, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 190, 8057, Zurich, Switzerland. linda.walsh@uzh.ch.', 'Department of Physics, ETH Zurich, Otto-Stern-Weg 1, 8092, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Medical Operations and Space Medicine, HRE-OM, European Space Agency, ESA, European Astronaut Centre, EAC, Cologne, Germany.', 'Environment Laboratories, International Atomic Energy Agency, 2444, Seibersdorf, Austria.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen- German Research Center for Environmental Health, 85764, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Medical Operations and Space Medicine, HRE-OM, European Space Agency, ESA, European Astronaut Centre, EAC, Cologne, Germany.', 'Biophysics Department, GSI Helmholtzzentrum fur Schwerionenforschung, Darmstadt, Germany.', 'Technische Universitat Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany.', 'Medical Operations and Space Medicine, HRE-OM, European Space Agency, ESA, European Astronaut Centre, EAC, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Physics, Science Faculty, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 190, 8057, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Radiotherapy Hirslanden, Witellikerstrasse 40, 8032, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210430,Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,PMC8116305,['NOTNLM'],"['*Radiation attributed decrease of survival', '*Radiation risk model', '*Radiation-related cancer', '*Space flight', '*Space radiation protection']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/08/27 06:00,['2021/04/30 12:24'],"['2021/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/27 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/30 12:24 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00411-021-00910-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00411-021-00910-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2021 May;60(2):213-231. doi: 10.1007/s00411-021-00910-0.

METHODS: We identified DDX41 mutations from a cohort of known or suspected hematologic disorders and reviewed the corresponding clinical, genetic, phenotypic, and morphologic findings. RESULTS: DDX41 mutations were identified in 20 (1.4%) of 1,371 cases, including 8 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 5 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 2 cases of therapy-related MDS/AML, 1 case of primary myelofibrosis, 1 case of chronic myeloid leukemia, 1 case of clonal cytopenia of uncertain significance (CCUS), 1 case of T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGL), and 1 case of multiple myeloma. DDX41-mutated neoplasms were morphologically heterogeneous with a median cellularity of 20% (range, 10%-100%). Megakaryocyte dysplasia occurred in 7 (35%) of 20 cases and trilineage dysplasia in 1 (5%). Frequently comutated genes include a second, somatic DDX41 mutation (8/19, 42%) followed by mutations in TET2 (20%), DNMT3A (20%), ASXL1 (20%), and CUX1 (20%). Karyotypes were noncomplex in 17 (89%) of 19. CONCLUSIONS: This report extends the spectrum of DDX41-mutated disorders to include CCUS, T-LGL, and plasma cell disorders. The morphologic features are heterogeneous and nonspecific, highlighting the importance of DDX41 testing during routine workup of hematolymphoid neoplasms.","['Goyal, Tanu', 'Tu, Zheng Jin', 'Wang, Zhen', 'Cook, James R']","['Goyal T', 'Tu ZJ', 'Wang Z', 'Cook JR']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0456-8085'],"['Robert J.

As with other neoplasms, AML cells have well-known aerobic glycolysis, but metabolic variations depending on cellular lineages also exist. Lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1) has been reported to be crucial for human leukemogenesis, which is currently one of the emerging therapeutic targets. However, metabolic roles of LSD1 and lineage-dependent factors remain to be elucidated in AML cells. Here, we show that LSD1 directs a hematopoietic lineage-specific metabolic program in AML subtypes. Erythroid leukemia (EL) cells particularly showed activated glycolysis and high expression of LSD1 in both AML cell lines and clinical samples. Transcriptome, chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing, and metabolomic analyses revealed that LSD1 was essential not only for glycolysis but also for heme synthesis, the most characteristic metabolic pathway of erythroid origin. Notably, LSD1 stabilized the erythroid transcription factor GATA1, which directly enhanced the expression of glycolysis and heme synthesis genes. In contrast, LSD1 epigenetically downregulated the granulo-monocytic transcription factor C/EBPalpha. Thus, the use of LSD1 knockdown or chemical inhibitor dominated C/EBPalpha instead of GATA1 in EL cells, resulting in metabolic shifts and growth arrest. Furthermore, GATA1 suppressed the gene encoding C/EBPalpha that then acted as a repressor of GATA1 target genes. Collectively, we conclude that LSD1 shapes metabolic phenotypes in EL cells by balancing these lineage-specific transcription factors and that LSD1 inhibitors pharmacologically cause lineage-dependent metabolic remodeling.","['Kohrogi, Kensaku', 'Hino, Shinjiro', 'Sakamoto, Akihisa', 'Anan, Kotaro', 'Takase, Ryuta', 'Araki, Hirotaka', 'Hino, Yuko', 'Araki, Kazutaka', 'Sato, Tetsuya', 'Nakamura, Kimitoshi', 'Nakao, Mitsuyoshi']","['Kohrogi K', 'Hino S', 'Sakamoto A', 'Anan K', 'Takase R', 'Araki H', 'Hino Y', 'Araki K', 'Sato T', 'Nakamura K', 'Nakao M']",,"['Department of Medical Cell Biology, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Cell Biology, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, and.', 'Department of Medical Cell Biology, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, and.', 'Department of Medical Cell Biology, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Cell Biology, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, and.', 'Department of Medical Cell Biology, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, and.', 'Department of Medical Cell Biology, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, and.', 'Biological Data Science Research Group, Cellular and Molecular Biotechnology Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tokyo, Japan; and.', 'Division of Bioinformatics, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Cell Biology, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, and.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC8114557,,,2021/05/01 06:00,2021/06/01 06:00,['2021/04/30 12:22'],"['2020/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 12:22 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(21)00292-5 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020003521 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2021 May 11;5(9):2305-2318. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020003521.,20210531,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Histone Demethylases/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription Factors']",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the prognostic role of clonal hematopoiesis-associated DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 (DTA) and non-DTA mutations for MRD monitoring post-alloHCT to refine MRD marker selection. Of 154 patients with AML, 138 (90%) had at least one mutation at diagnosis, which were retrospectively monitored by amplicon-based error-corrected NGS on day 90 and/or day 180 post-alloHCT. MRD was detected in 34 patients on day 90 and/or day 180 (25%). The rate of MRD positivity was similar when DTA and non-DTA mutations were considered separately (17.6% vs 19.8%). DTA mutations had no prognostic impact on cumulative incidence of relapse, relapse-free survival, or overall survival in our study and were removed from further analysis. In the remaining 131 patients with at least 1 non-DTA mutation, clinical and transplantation-associated characteristics were similarly distributed between MRD-positive and MRD-negative patients. In multivariate analysis, MRD positivity was an independent adverse predictor of cumulative incidence of relapse, relapse-free survival, and overall survival but not of nonrelapse mortality. The prognostic effect was independent of different cutoffs (above limit of detection, 0.1% and 1% variant allele frequency). MRD log-reduction between diagnosis and post-alloHCT assessment had no prognostic value. MRD status post-alloHCT had the strongest impact in patients who were MRD positive prior to alloHCT. In conclusion, non-DTA mutations are prognostic NGS-MRD markers post-alloHCT, whereas the prognostic role of DTA mutations in the posttransplant setting remains open.","['Heuser, Michael', 'Heida, Bennet', 'Buttner, Konstantin', 'Wienecke, Clara Philine', 'Teich, Katrin', 'Funke, Carolin', 'Brandes, Maximilian', 'Klement, Piroska', 'Liebich, Alessandro', 'Wichmann, Martin', 'Neziri, Blerina', 'Chaturvedi, Anuhar', 'Kloos, Arnold', 'Mintzas, Konstantinos', 'Gaidzik, Verena I', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Fiedler, Walter', 'Heim, Albert', 'Puppe, Wolfram', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Stadler, Michael', 'Hambach, Lothar', 'Gabdoulline, Razif', 'Thol, Felicitas']","['Heuser M', 'Heida B', 'Buttner K', 'Wienecke CP', 'Teich K', 'Funke C', 'Brandes M', 'Klement P', 'Liebich A', 'Wichmann M', 'Neziri B', 'Chaturvedi A', 'Kloos A', 'Mintzas K', 'Gaidzik VI', 'Paschka P', 'Bullinger L', 'Fiedler W', 'Heim A', 'Puppe W', 'Krauter J', 'Dohner K', 'Dohner H', 'Ganser A', 'Stadler M', 'Hambach L', 'Gabdoulline R', 'Thol F']",,"['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Charite University Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Oncological Center, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Virology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany;

We have previously demonstrated that combined treatment with dissolved hydrogen molecule (H2) and platinum nanocolloid (Pt-nc) has carcinostatic effects and that increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were closely associated with carcinostatic effects in Ehrlich mouse ascites tumor cells. However, it is unknown whether combined treatment-induced ROS generation can occur in human cancer cells. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the carcinostatic effect of the combined treatment in human cells and investigate the relationship between treatment efficacy and ROS generation. H2 and Pt-nc treatment could exert cytostatic action by inhibiting the growth of human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 and human gastric adenocarcinoma-derived NUGC-4 cells; however, no effect was observed in normal human embryo fibroblast OUMS-36 cells by the temporary exposure. These findings indicate that combined treatment with H2 and Pt-nc may act selectively in tumor cells compared with normal cells. Additionally, combined treatment with H2 and Pt-nc resulted in an approximately 200-fold increase in intracellular ROS levels compared with the control, whereas the suppressive effect of tumor cell growth was abrogated entirely by catalase treatment in NUGC-4 cells. Furthermore, combined treatment with H2 and Pt-nc induced hydrogen peroxide generation, cellular morphological changes, cell death, and a decline in DNA synthesis-positive cells. In conclusion, combined treatment with H2 and Pt-nc can induce carcinostatic/carcinocidal effects through intracellular ROS increase, morphological changes, cell death, and DNA synthesis suppression in the human tumor cell line.","['Saitoh, Yasukazu', 'Kawasaki, Naho', 'Eguchi, Natsumi', 'Ikeshima, Minoru']","['Saitoh Y', 'Kawasaki N', 'Eguchi N', 'Ikeshima M']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6288-7634'],"['Laboratory of Bioscience and Biotechnology for Cell Function Control, Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences, Prefectural University of Hiroshima, Shobara, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Bioscience and Biotechnology for Cell Function Control, Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences, Prefectural University of Hiroshima, Shobara, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Bioscience and Biotechnology for Cell Function Control, Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences, Prefectural University of Hiroshima, Shobara, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Bioscience and Biotechnology for Cell Function Control, Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences, Prefectural University of Hiroshima, Shobara, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210430,England,Free Radic Res,Free radical research,9423872,,['NOTNLM'],"['Dissolved hydrogen molecule', 'human gastric adenocarcinoma cells', 'nanomedicine', 'platinum nanocolloid', 'reactive oxygen species']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/12/24 06:00,['2021/04/30 12:13'],"['2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/30 12:13 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10715762.2021.1902514 [doi]'],ppublish,Free Radic Res. 2021 Mar;55(3):211-220. doi: 10.1080/10715762.2021.1902514.

There are hypotheses related to panel reactive antibody formation, but there is no knowledge about its formation in acute leukemia at diagnosis and during the chemotherapy period, in which there is a strong myelosuppression and immunosuppression. We aimed to determine the panel reactive antibodies positivity in acute leukemia patients at diagnosis and during the entire therapy period, including stem cell transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single-center prospective study, we enrolled 35 patients with acute leukemia (8 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 27 with acute myeloid leukemia). Serum samples were obtained before induction therapy and every 3 months thereafter until the last follow-up or death, for a median of 369 days (minimum-maximum, 9-725 days). Panel reactive antibodies were defined with single-antigen bead assays on a Luminex platform. RESULTS: A total of 10 patients (29%) were found to have panel reactive antibodies at any time point. At diagnosis, 5 patients (14.3%) had antibodies of either class I (n = 2) or II (n = 1) or both (n = 2), and in 4 patients these persisted during median follow-up of 168 days (minimum-maximum, 9-322 days). Among the remaining 30 patients, an additional 5 (17%) developed de novo antibodies. Incidence rate of development of de novo antibodies was 5.5 per 10 000 person-days. There was no effect of transfusion load on the development of panel reactive antibodies. Differences in percentages in males versus females, blood type mismatch, and graftversus-host disease were higher in patients who had de novo antibodies after transplantation. Positivity at any time had no statistically significant effect on overall survival (P = .71). CONCLUSIONS: Panel reactive antibodies do not occur frequently in the acute leukemia setting despite intensive transfusions.","['Sahin Eroglu, Didem', 'Dalva, Klara', 'Kalaci, Ender', 'Toprak, Selami Kocak', 'Civriz Bozdag, Sinem', 'Topcuoglu, Pervin', 'Demirer, Taner', 'Gurman, Gunhan', 'Yuksel, Meltem Kurt']","['Sahin Eroglu D', 'Dalva K', 'Kalaci E', 'Toprak SK', 'Civriz Bozdag S', 'Topcuoglu P', 'Demirer T', 'Gurman G', 'Yuksel MK']",,"['From the Department of Internal Medicine, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210429,Turkey,Exp Clin Transplant,Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,101207333,,,,2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:00,['2021/04/30 08:44'],"['2021/04/30 08:44 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.6002/ect.2020.0524 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Exp Clin Transplant. 2021 Apr 29. doi: 10.6002/ect.2020.0524.,,,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is associated with impressive disease responses in relapsed or refractory high-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) with durable remissions in a subset of patients. Historically, haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has been the standard consolidation strategy for many of these patients who are now being treated with CAR T. Relapses are frequent after CD19 CAR T therapy in B-ALL and consolidation with allogeneic HCT (allo-HCT) may improve survival of patients with high-risk disease. There appears to be a clear difference in B-ALL outcomes between paediatric and adult patients, with the latter having a much higher risk of relapse after CAR T therapy. Late relapses are infrequent in patients with B-NHL and consolidation with allo-HCT may not be needed in patients who achieve a complete remission after CAR T therapy. Future registry-based and prospective studies will hopefully provide the needed data in the future to risk-stratify the recipients of CAR T therapy. Meanwhile, we provide guidance on patient selection and practical issues with performing allo-HCT after CAR T therapy.","['Dholaria, Bhagirathbhai', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Perales, Miguel-Angel', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Dholaria B', 'Savani BN', 'Huang XJ', 'Nagler A', 'Perales MA', 'Mohty M']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2371-3655', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5910-4571', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8536-7781']","['Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China.', 'Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel, ALWP Office Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'EBMT ALWP Office Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'EBMT ALWP Office Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Antoine, AP-HP, Sorbonne University, INSERM, UMRs 938, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210429,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*acute leukemia', '*allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*chimeric antigen receptor T-cell', '*diffuse large B cell lymphoma', '*multiple myeloma', '*relapse', '*survival', '*toxicity']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/09/28 06:00,['2021/04/30 07:09'],"['2021/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/30 07:09 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.17460 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2021 Jun;193(6):1060-1075. doi: 10.1111/bjh.17460.

This study was designed to explore the prognosis of PIM3 in colon cancer. METHODS: In this study, we downloaded RNA-seq and clinical information of colon cancer from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Kaplan-Meier method was used for analyzing the impact of PIM3 on the survival of patients with colon cancer. Single-factor and multi-factor cox regression analysis were used for verifying the prognostic value of PIM3. Spearman correlation analysis was used for screening PIM3 related genes. Functional enrichment analysis was used for analyzing the biological functions and pathways in which PIM3 related genes may be involved. STRING online tools were used for building a co-expression network. Cytoscape was used for co-expression network visualization. RESULTS: Compared with the low expression group, the patients in the PIM3 high expression group lived longer time. Single-factor and multi-factor cox regression analysis indicated that PIM3 was an independent prognostic factor for colon cancer. Sixty-two PIM3 related genes were screened, and GO and KEGG enrichment analyses suggested that PIM3 related genes might be involved in the MAPK and WNT pathways. The co-expression network showed a strong correlation between PIM3 and MLKL, MYL5, PPP3R1 and other genes. CONCLUSIONS: PIM3 is an independent prognostic factor of colon cancer and may be a target for the diagnosis and treatment of colon cancer.","['Zhou, Y', 'Zhou, Y N', 'Liu, S X', 'Wang, J', 'Ji, R', 'Yan, X']","['Zhou Y', 'Zhou YN', 'Liu SX', 'Wang J', 'Ji R', 'Yan X']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2488-6128'],"[""Department of Geriatrics (II), The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Gastroenterology, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, No.1 Donggangxi Road, Chengguan District, Lanzhou, 730000, People's Republic of China. v259gx@163.com."", ""Department of Geriatrics (II), The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Geriatrics (II), The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Gastroenterology, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, No.1 Donggangxi Road, Chengguan District, Lanzhou, 730000, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Geriatrics (II), The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210429,Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,,['NOTNLM'],"['Colon cancer', 'Enrichment analysis', 'PIM3', 'Prognosis']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/12/29 06:00,['2021/04/30 07:07'],"['2021/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/29 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/30 07:07 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12094-021-02624-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12094-021-02624-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2021 Oct;23(10):2163-2170. doi: 10.1007/s12094-021-02624-7.

Common germline variants in TPMT cause low activity of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and higher 6MP metabolite (TGN) levels. Higher levels of TGNs incorporated into DNA (DNA-TG) and low TPMT activity have previously been associated with a lower relapse risk. We explored if TPMT geno- or phenotype was associated with DNA-TG levels and relapse rate in NOPHO ALL2008. METHODS: TPMT genotype, repeated phenotyping, and DNA-TG measurements were collected in 918 children with non-high risk ALL (NOPHO ALL2008 maintenance therapy study). Maintenance therapy started with 6MP at 50 and 75 mg/m(2) for TPMT heterozygous and wildtype patients and was adjusted to a target WBC of 1.5 - 3.0 x 10(9)/L. RESULTS: Of 918 patients, 78 (8.5%) were TPMT heterozygous and 903 had at least one TPMT measurement (total 3063). Mean TPMT activities were higher with wildtype than heterozygous TPMT (N = 752, 16.6 versus 9.6 U/mL ery., p < 0.001). The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 6.4% and 6.0% for TPMT heterozygous and wildtype patients, and there was no association between genotype and relapse rate (N = 918, hazard ratio = 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40 - 2.54, p = 0.98). Although TPMT heterozygous patients had higher DNA-TG (N = 548, median 760.9 [interquartile range (IQR) 568.7 - 890.3] versus 492.7 [IQR 382.1 - 634.6] fmol/microg, p < 0.001), TPMT activity was not associated with relapse rate (N = 813; hazard ratio = 0.98 per one U/mL ery. increase in TPMT activity, 95% CI 0.91 - 1.06, p = 0.67).

Although traditionally seen as a genetic disease, breast cancer is now also known to involve epigenetic abnormalities. Epigenetic regulators, such as DNA methyltransferases and histone-modifying enzymes, play essential roles in gene regulation and cancer development. Dysregulation of epigenetic regulator activity has been causally linked with breast cancer pathogenesis. Hairless (HR) encodes a 130-kDa transcription factor that is essential for development and tissue homeostasis. Its role in transcription regulation is partly mediated by its interaction with multiple nuclear receptors, including thyroid hormone receptor, retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors, and vitamin D receptor. HR has been studied primarily in epidermal development and homeostasis. Hr-mutant mice are highly susceptible to ultraviolet- or carcinogen-induced skin tumors. Besides its putative tumor suppressor function in skin, loss of HR function has also been implicated in increased leukemia susceptibility and promotes the growth of melanoma and brain cancer cells. HR has also been demonstrated to function as a histone H3 lysine 9 demethylase. Recent genomics studies have identified HR mutations in a variety of human cancers, including breast cancer. The anticancer function and mechanism of action by HR in mammary tissue remains to be investigated. Here, we review the emerging role of HR, its histone demethylase activity and histone methylation in breast cancer development, and potential for epigenetic therapy.","['Trager, Megan H', 'Sah, Bindeshwar', 'Chen, Zhongming', 'Liu, Liang']","['Trager MH', 'Sah B', 'Chen Z', 'Liu L']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7330-1627', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7245-355X']","['Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, USA.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, Minnesota 55912, USA.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, Minnesota 55912, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55912, USA.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, Minnesota 55912, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55912, USA.']",['eng'],"['K01 AR064315/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA196639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,PMC8237996,['NOTNLM'],"['*breast cancer', '*hairless', '*histone demethylase', '*histone methylation', '*oncogenesis']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2021/04/30 07:01'],"['2021/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/30 07:01 [entrez]']","['6259332 [pii]', '10.1210/endocr/bqab088 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2021 Aug 1;162(8). pii: 6259332. doi: 10.1210/endocr/bqab088.,20211018,"['0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (hr protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/*etiology/therapy', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Histone Demethylases/*metabolism', 'Histone Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

With an expanding pool of post CAR T-cell therapy survivors, prevention and management of late toxicities is emerging as an important component of survivorship care. This review summarizes the current state of evidence on late toxicities after CAR T-cell therapy in lymphoid malignancies. Late effects that are well described in clinical trials and observational studies include hypogammaglobulinemia, prolonged cytopenias, late infections, neurologic and neuropsychiatric effects, immune-related late effects, and subsequent malignancies. Hypogammaglobulinemia is the most common late effect in the setting of CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy, which necessitates immunoglobulin replacement. Common determinants of late toxicities are age, underlying tumor type, prior therapy, CAR construct, and acute toxicities. Among currently approved indications, the incidence of hypogammaglobulinemia and prolonged cytopenia is higher in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared to aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Patient-reported physical and mental quality of life in long-term survivors is comparable to general population, albeit, with limited data thus far. This review provides an overview of the incidence, known risk-factors, and strategies for prevention and management of late toxicities in this population. Further research is needed to characterize the trajectory of late effects from population-based registries and long-term follow-up of ongoing clinical trials.","['Chakraborty, Rajshekhar', 'Hill, Brian T', 'Majeed, Aneela', 'Majhail, Navneet S']","['Chakraborty R', 'Hill BT', 'Majeed A', 'Majhail NS']",,"['Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.']",['eng'],['R01 CA215134/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20201221,United States,Transplant Cell Ther,Transplantation and cellular therapy,101774629,PMC8078596,,,2021/05/01 06:00,2021/07/03 06:00,['2021/04/30 06:59'],"['2022/03/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/04/30 06:59 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1016/j.jtct.2020.10.002 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplant Cell Ther. 2021 Mar;27(3):222-229. doi: 10.1016/j.jtct.2020.10.002.

Although cytogenetic changes and gene mutations are associated with AML prognosis, there is a need to identify further factors. CD56 is considered a prognostic factor for AML, which is abnormally expressed in leukemia cells. However, a clear consensus for this surface molecule is lacking, which has prompted us to investigate its prognostic significance. Bone marrow samples of de novo non-M3 AML were collected to detect CD56 expression using multiparameter flow cytometry (FCM). As a result, the CD56 expression in de novo non-M3 AML was found to be significantly higher than that in acute lymphoma leukemia (ALL, P = 0.017) and healthy controls (P = 0.02). The X-Tile program produced a CD56 cutoff point at a relative expression level of 24.62%. Based on this cutoff point, high CD56 expression was observed in 29.21% of de novo non-M3 AML patients. CD56-high patients had a poor overall survival (OS, P = 0.015) compared to CD56-low patients. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) improved OS (P = 0.004), but a poor genetic risk was associated with an inferior OS (P = 0.002). Compared with CD56-low patients, CD56-high patients had lower peripheral blood platelet (PLT) counts (P = 0.010). Our research confirmed that high CD56 expression is associated with adverse clinical outcomes in de novo non-M3 AML patients, indicating that CD56 could be used as a prognostic marker for a more precise stratification of de novo non-M3 AML patients.","['Sun, Yanni', 'Wan, Jia', 'Song, Qiuyue', 'Luo, Chengxin', 'Li, Xi', 'Luo, Yanrong', 'Huang, Xiangtao', 'Ding, Ruiheng', 'Li, Hui', 'Hou, Yu', 'Huang, Yongxiu', 'Xie, Mingling', 'Huang, Zhen', 'Zhang, Yali', 'Ma, Yanni', 'Wu, Guixian', 'Xu, Shuangnian', 'Chen, Jieping']","['Sun Y', 'Wan J', 'Song Q', 'Luo C', 'Li X', 'Luo Y', 'Huang X', 'Ding R', 'Li H', 'Hou Y', 'Huang Y', 'Xie M', 'Huang Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Ma Y', 'Wu G', 'Xu S', 'Chen J']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4041-9039', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9666-2911']","['Center for Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, 400038, China.', 'Center for Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, 400038, China.', 'College of Military Preventive Medicine, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Center for Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, 400038, China.', 'Center for Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, 400038, China.', 'Center for Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, 400038, China.', 'Center for Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, 400038, China.', 'College of Military Preventive Medicine, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', 'Center for Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, 400038, China.', 'Center for Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, 400038, China.', 'Center for Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, 400038, China.', 'Center for Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, 400038, China.', 'Center for Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, 400038, China.', 'Center for Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, 400038, China.', 'Center for Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, 400038, China.', 'Center for Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, 400038, China.', 'Center for Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, 400038, China.', 'Center for Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, 400038, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210408,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,PMC8049794,,,2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/26 06:00,['2021/04/30 06:56'],"['2020/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/02 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 06:56 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2021/1929357 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2021 Apr 8;2021:1929357. doi: 10.1155/2021/1929357. eCollection 2021.,20210525,['0 (CD56 Antigen)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'CD56 Antigen/*genetics/metabolism', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Yanni Sun et al.'],,,,,['The authors have no conflicts of interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, up to half of blinatumomab treated patients do not respond completely or relapse after therapy. As a result, there is a need to identify potential strategies to improve the efficacy of BiTE therapy. The anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab has been shown to successfully activate T cells against a wide range of cancer types. Here, we tested the ability of umbilical cord blood (UCB) reconstituted mice to respond to blinatumomab therapy with or without concurrent pembrolizumab treatment. Humanized mice were engrafted with patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells derived from pediatric and adolescent/young adult (AYA) B-ALL patients who had either failed to achieve remission with negative minimum residual disease (MRD negative) or experienced a relapse. Mock-treated humanized mice engrafted with PDX cells efficiently developed overt disease within 30 days of engraftment of B-ALL. However, single agent therapy with either blinatumomab or pembrolizumab reduced disease burden in engrafted mice, with some mice observed to be MRD negative after the 28-day treatment course. Combination therapy significantly improved the percentage of MRD negative mice and improved long-term survival and cure rates as compared to mice that were given blinatumomab alone. Importantly, no benefits were observed in treated mice that lacked human immune cell reconstitution. These results indicate that UCB-humanized NRGS mice develop activatable immune function, and UCB-humanized PDX leukemia models can be used in preclinical studies to evaluate specificity, efficacy, and cooperativity of immune therapies in B-ALL.","['Wunderlich, Mark', 'Manning, Nicole', 'Sexton, Christina', ""O'Brien, Eric"", 'Byerly, Luke', 'Stillwell, Cody', 'Perentesis, John P', 'Mulloy, James C', 'Mizukawa, Benjamin']","['Wunderlich M', 'Manning N', 'Sexton C', ""O'Brien E"", 'Byerly L', 'Stillwell C', 'Perentesis JP', 'Mulloy JC', 'Mizukawa B']",,"[""Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States."", ""Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States."", ""Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States."", ""Oncology, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States."", ""Oncology, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States."", ""Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States."", ""Oncology, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, United States.', ""Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, United States.', ""Oncology, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, United States.']",['eng'],['R50 CA211404/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20210413,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC8076590,['NOTNLM'],"['B-ALL', 'PD-1', 'bispecific T-cell engager', 'blinatumomab', 'humanized mice', 'immune checkpoint inhibition', 'patient derived xenograft', 'pembrolizumab']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 06:55'],"['2020/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 06:55 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.642466 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Apr 13;11:642466. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.642466. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"[""Copyright (c) 2021 Wunderlich, Manning, Sexton, O'Brien, Byerly, Stillwell,"", 'Perentesis, Mulloy and Mizukawa.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it is important to understand how cohesin mutations contribute to leukemogenesis. However, the fundamental understanding of cohesin mutation in clonal expansion and myeloid transformation in hematopoietic cells remains ambiguous. Previous studies briefly introduced the cohesin mutation in AML; however, an in-depth summary of mutations in AML was not provided, and the correlation between cohesin and AML1-ETO in t (8;21) AML was also not analyzed. By summarizing the major findings regarding the cohesin mutation in AML, this review aims to define the characteristics of the cohesin complex mutation, identify its relationships with co-occurring gene mutations, assess its roles in clonal evolution, and discuss its potential for the prognosis of AML. In particular, we focus on the function of cohesin mutations in RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion.","['Han, Caixia', 'Gao, Xuefeng', 'Li, Yonghui', 'Zhang, Juan', 'Yang, Erna', 'Zhang, Li', 'Yu, Li']","['Han C', 'Gao X', 'Li Y', 'Zhang J', 'Yang E', 'Zhang L', 'Yu L']",,"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, International Cancer Center, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Precision Medicine for Hematological Malignancies, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Clinical Medical Academy, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, International Cancer Center, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Precision Medicine for Hematological Malignancies, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Clinical Medical Academy, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, International Cancer Center, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Precision Medicine for Hematological Malignancies, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Clinical Medical Academy, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, International Cancer Center, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Precision Medicine for Hematological Malignancies, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Clinical Medical Academy, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, International Cancer Center, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Precision Medicine for Hematological Malignancies, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Clinical Medical Academy, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, International Cancer Center, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Precision Medicine for Hematological Malignancies, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Clinical Medical Academy, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, International Cancer Center, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Precision Medicine for Hematological Malignancies, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Clinical Medical Academy, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210413,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC8076553,['NOTNLM'],"['AML1-ETO', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cohesin mutation', 'hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells', 'leukemogenesis']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 06:55'],"['2020/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 06:55 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.579881 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Apr 13;11:579881. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.579881. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Han, Gao, Li, Zhang, Yang, Zhang and Yu.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human myelogenous leukemia cells, we apply CRISPR-sciATAC to target 105 chromatin-related genes, generating chromatin accessibility data for ~30,000 single cells. We correlate the loss of specific chromatin remodelers with changes in accessibility globally and at the binding sites of individual transcription factors (TFs). For example, we show that loss of the H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2 increases accessibility at heterochromatic regions involved in embryonic development and triggers expression of genes in the HOXA and HOXD clusters. At a subset of regulatory sites, we also analyze changes in nucleosome spacing following the loss of chromatin remodelers.

General lipase inhibitors such as Palmostatin M (Palm M) block N-Ras depalmitoylation, but lack specificity and target several enzymes displaying depalmitoylase activity. Here, we describe ABD957, a potent and selective covalent inhibitor of the ABHD17 family of depalmitoylases, and show that this compound impairs N-Ras depalmitoylation in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. ABD957 produced partial effects on N-Ras palmitoylation compared with Palm M, but was much more selective across the proteome, reflecting a plasma membrane-delineated action on dynamically palmitoylated proteins. Finally, ABD957 impaired N-Ras signaling and the growth of NRAS-mutant AML cells in a manner that synergizes with MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibition. Our findings uncover a surprisingly restricted role for ABHD17 enzymes as regulators of the N-Ras palmitoylation cycle and suggest that ABHD17 inhibitors may have value as targeted therapies for NRAS-mutant cancers.","['Remsberg, Jarrett R', 'Suciu, Radu M', 'Zambetti, Noemi A', 'Hanigan, Thomas W', 'Firestone, Ari J', 'Inguva, Anagha', 'Long, Amanda', 'Ngo, Nhi', 'Lum, Kenneth M', 'Henry, Cassandra L', 'Richardson, Stewart K', 'Predovic, Marina', 'Huang, Ben', 'Dix, Melissa M', 'Howell, Amy R', 'Niphakis, Micah J', 'Shannon, Kevin', 'Cravatt, Benjamin F']","['Remsberg JR', 'Suciu RM', 'Zambetti NA', 'Hanigan TW', 'Firestone AJ', 'Inguva A', 'Long A', 'Ngo N', 'Lum KM', 'Henry CL', 'Richardson SK', 'Predovic M', 'Huang B', 'Dix MM', 'Howell AR', 'Niphakis MJ', 'Shannon K', 'Cravatt BF']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5234-0168', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9902-443X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6996-0833', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9091-3679', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4299-1773', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5330-3492']","['Department of Chemistry, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Lundbeck La Jolla Research Center, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Lundbeck La Jolla Research Center, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Lundbeck La Jolla Research Center, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA.', 'Lundbeck La Jolla Research Center, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA.

We developed a comprehensive prognostic scoring system consisting of patient and comorbidity factors with 470 patients as a training cohort out of 940; these patients underwent salvage SCT for GF. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that older age, poorer performance status, a continuation of antimicrobial treatment, and severe organ dysfunction were independently associated with worse overall survival (OS) and non-relapse mortality (NRM). Based on each factor's hazard ratio, weighted scores of 1-3 were assigned to these factors. Using the summed scores (0-8), a prognostic scoring system successfully stratified outcomes after salvage SCT in the cohort. For patients in the low (0-2, n = 122), intermediate (3-4, n = 209), and high score (5-8, n = 110) groups, the 1-year OS was 62.8%, 40.8%, and 14.2%, respectively (P < 0.001), whereas the 1-year NRM was 24.1%, 43.9%, and 72.7%, respectively (P < 0.001). The prognostic value of the scoring system was confirmed in the validation cohort (n = 470).

This drug irreversibly inhibits Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) by covalently binding to the C481 residue in the BTK kinase domain. BTK is a pivotal protein for B cell receptor signaling and tissue homing of CLL cells. Preclinical investigations have established the importance of the B cell receptor pathway in the maintenance and survival of normal and malignant B cells, underscoring the importance of targeting this axis for CLL. Clinical trials demonstrated overall and progression-free survival benefit with ibrutinib in multiple CLL subgroups, including patients with relapsed or refractory disease, patients with 17p deletion, elderly patients, and treatment-naive patients. Consequently, ibrutinib was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for newly diagnosed and relapsed disease. Ibrutinib has transformed the treatment of CLL; however, several limitations have been identified, including low complete remission rates, development of resistance, and uncommon substantial toxicities. Further, ibrutinib must be used until disease progression, which imposes a financial burden on patients and society. These limitations were the impetus for the development of ibrutinib combinations. Four strategies have been tested in recent years: combinations of ibrutinib with immunotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, cell therapy, and other targeted therapy. Here, we review the scientific rationale for and clinical outcome of each strategy. Among these strategies, ibrutinib with targeted agent venetoclax results in high complete response rates and, importantly, high rates of undetectable minimal residual disease. Although we concentrate here on ibrutinib, similar combinations are expected or ongoing with acalabrutinib, tirabrutinib, and zanubrutinib, second-generation BTK inhibitors. Future investigations will focus on the feasibility of discontinuing ibrutinib combinations after a defined time; the therapeutic benefit of adding a third agent to ibrutinib-containing combinations; and profiling of resistant clones that develop after combination treatment. A new standard of care for CLL is expected to emerge from these investigations.","['Timofeeva, Natalia', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Timofeeva N', 'Gandhi V']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6985-3509', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3172-9166']","['Departments of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Departments of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. vgandhi@mdanderson.org.', 'Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. vgandhi@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20210429,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,PMC8085243,,,2021/05/01 06:00,2022/01/06 06:00,['2021/04/30 06:14'],"['2020/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/30 06:14 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41408-021-00467-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41408-021-00467-7 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2021 Apr 29;11(4):79. doi: 10.1038/s41408-021-00467-7.,20220105,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Piperidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thai data on its characteristics and outcomes have never been systematically reported, to our knowledge. The objective of this study was to determine the clinical features and outcomes of Thai patients with AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective observational study of nine academic hospitals. Patients with newly diagnosed AML were invited to register online. RESULTS: A total of 679 patients with AML were included. The presence of circulating peripheral blood blasts was correlated with a high white blood cell count. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) had predominantly lower white blood cell counts and higher proportions without peripheral blood blasts compared with non-APL AML. Disseminated intravascular coagulation was commonly presented in APL (37.7%). Splenomegaly and normal platelet count were more frequently seen in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive AML. The median follow-up time for those who survived more than 1 year was 28.0 months. One-year overall survival rates for non-APL AML and APL were 31.9% and 88.2%, respectively; 2-year overall survival rates were 29.6% and 88.2%, respectively. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation could improve survival in non-APL AML. CONCLUSION: APL should be considered despite absence of peripheral blood blast. This study demonstrates poor outcome of Thai AML and more research to improve outcomes are underway. Expanding access to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation should be considered in Thailand.","['Wanitpongpun, Chinadol', 'Utchariyaprasit, Eakkapol', 'Owattanapanich, Weerapat', 'Tantiworawit, Adisak', 'Rattarittamrong, Ekarat', 'Niparuck, Pimjai', 'Puavilai, Teeraya', 'Julamanee, Jakrawadee', 'Saelue, Pirun', 'Chanswangphuwana, Chantiya', 'Polprasert, Chantana', 'Nakhakes, Chajchawan', 'Limvorapitak, Wasithep', 'Kanitsap, Nonglak', 'Prayongratana, Kannadit', 'Sriswasdi, Chantrapa']","['Wanitpongpun C', 'Utchariyaprasit E', 'Owattanapanich W', 'Tantiworawit A', 'Rattarittamrong E', 'Niparuck P', 'Puavilai T', 'Julamanee J', 'Saelue P', 'Chanswangphuwana C', 'Polprasert C', 'Nakhakes C', 'Limvorapitak W', 'Kanitsap N', 'Prayongratana K', 'Sriswasdi C']",,"['Hematology Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.

The authors' aim was to present the clinical features of oral MS and review the literature. CASE DESCRIPTION: Case 1 was an 82-year-old woman with an asymptomatic erythematous swelling on the maxillary gingiva and no history of hematologic malignancy. Case 2, a 65-year-old man, and case 3, a 58-year-old woman, each had a history of acute myeloid leukemia and a painful ulcer on the palatal mucosa and an asymptomatic ulcer on the lower lip mucosa, respectively. Case 1 was treated with focal radiation then chemotherapy and achieved complete remission initially, but died of relapse 2 years after diagnosis. Case 2 received radiotherapy and immunotherapy and had a complete response. Case 3 received chemotherapy and achieved remission initially, but relapsed and is undergoing investigational targeted therapies. CONCLUSIONS AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Oral MS can manifest as gingival or mucosal swelling or ulceration and can indicate onset or relapse of associated hematologic malignancies, which often have a poor prognosis. Because patients with oral findings are likely to seek treatment from their dentists first, oral clinicians should maintain a broad differential diagnosis list when evaluating oral lesions, especially if treatment prescribed for a more common diagnosis fails to resolve the lesion.","['Wang, Diana', 'He, Karen', 'Sroussi, Herve', 'Treister, Nathaniel', 'Luskin, Marlise', 'Villa, Alessandro', 'Woo, Sook-Bin', 'Shazib, Muhammad Ali']","['Wang D', 'He K', 'Sroussi H', 'Treister N', 'Luskin M', 'Villa A', 'Woo SB', 'Shazib MA']",,,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,J Am Dent Assoc,Journal of the American Dental Association (1939),7503060,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'oral medicine', 'oral pathology', 'oropharyngeal neoplasms']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2021/04/30 05:49'],"['2020/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 05:49 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0002-8177(21)00076-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.adaj.2021.01.017 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Dent Assoc. 2021 May;152(5):393-400.e8. doi: 10.1016/j.adaj.2021.01.017.,20210514,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Mucosa', 'Recurrence', '*Sarcoma, Myeloid/diagnosis']",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Frequent somatic mutations and deregulated expression of epigenetic regulators in MB highlight the substantial role of epigenetic alterations. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is a highly abundant cytosine modification in the developing cerebellum and is regulated by ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes. RESULTS: We investigate the alterations of 5hmC and TET enzymes in MB and their significance to cerebellar cancer formation. We show total abundance of 5hmC is reduced in MB, but identify significant enrichment of MB-specific 5hmC marks at regulatory regions of genes implicated in stem-like properties and Nanog-binding motifs. While TET1 and TET2 levels are high in MBs, only knockout of Tet1 in the smoothened (SmoA1) mouse model attenuates uncontrolled proliferation, leading to a favorable prognosis. The pharmacological Tet1 inhibition reduces cell viability and platelet-derived growth factor signaling pathway-associated genes. CONCLUSIONS: These results together suggest a potential key role of 5hmC and indicate an oncogenic nature for TET1 in MB tumorigenesis, suggesting it as a potential therapeutic target for MBs.","['Kim, Hyerim', 'Kang, Yunhee', 'Li, Yujing', 'Chen, Li', 'Lin, Li', 'Johnson, Nicholas D', 'Zhu, Dan', 'Robinson, M Hope', 'McSwain, Leon', 'Barwick, Benjamin G', 'Yuan, Xianrui', 'Liao,

Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a(CPT1a), a rate-limiting enzyme of the essential step of FAO, can facilitate cancer metabolic adaptation. Previous reports demonstrated that CPT1a acts as a potential molecular target in solid tumors and hematologic disease. However, no systematic study was conducted to explore the prognostic value of CPT1a expression and possible treatment strategies with CPT1a inhibitor on acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: The expression of CPT1a in 325 cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) patients was evaluated using RT-PCR. The combination effects of ST1326 and ABT199 were studied in AML cells and primary patients. MTS was used to measure the cell proliferation rate. Annexin V/propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry analysis was used to measure the apoptosis rate. Western blot was used to measure the expression of Mcl-1. RNAseq and GC-TOFMS were used for genomic and metabolic analysis. RESULTS: In this study, we found AML patients with high CPT1a expression (n = 245) had a relatively short overall survival (P = 0.01) compared to patients in low expression group (n = 80). In parallel, downregulation of CPT1a inhibits proliferation of AML cells. We also conducted genomic and metabolic interactive analysis in AML patients, and found several essential genes and pathways related to aberrant expression of CPT1a. Moreover, we found downregulation of CPT1a sentitized BCL-2 inhibitor ABT199 and CPT1a-selective inhibitor ST1326 combined with ABT199 had a strong synergistic effect to induce apoptosis in AML cells and primary patient blasts for the first time. The underlying synergistic mechanism might be that ST1326 inhibits pGSK3beta and pERK expression, leading to downregulation of Mcl-1. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that overexpression of CPT1a predicts poor clinical outcome in AML. CPT1a-selective inhibitor ST1326 combined with Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT199 showed strong synergistic inhibitory effects on AML.","['Mao, Shihui', 'Ling, Qing', 'Pan, Jiajia', 'Li, Fenglin', 'Huang,

However, little is known about long-term risks of TKIs in children. Exposure-based survivorship guidelines do not include TKIs, thus surveillance practices may be variable. METHODS: We retrospectively examined surveillance for cardiac and endocrine late effects in children receiving TKIs for Ph + leukemias, diagnosed at < 21 years between 2000 and 2018. Frequency of echocardiogram (ECHO), electrocardiogram (EKG), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and bone age testing were abstracted. Descriptive statistics were stratified by leukemia type. RESULTS: 66 patients (CML n = 44; Ph + ALL n = 22) met inclusion criteria. Among patients with CML, >/=1 evaluation was done: ECHO (50.0%), EKG (48.8%), TSH (43.9%), DXA (2.6%), bone age (7.4%). Among patients with Ph + ALL, >/=1 evaluation was done: ECHO (86.4%), EKG (68.2%), TSH (59.1%), DXA (63.6%), bone age (44.4%). Over a median 6.3 and 5.7 years of observation, respectively, 2% of patients with CML and 57% with Ph + ALL attended a survivorship clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Despite common exposure to TKIs in survivors of Ph + leukemias, patterns of surveillance for late effects differed in CML and Ph + ALL, with the latter receiving more surveillance likely due to concomitant chemotherapy exposures. Targeted therapies such as TKIs are revolutionizing cancer treatment, but surveillance for late effects and referral to survivorship clinics are variable despite the chronicity of exposure. Evidence based guidelines and longer follow-up are needed.","['Smith, Stephanie M', 'Sabnis, Himalee S', 'Lewis, Rebecca Williamson', 'Effinger, Karen E', 'Bergsagel, John', 'Patterson, Briana', 'Mertens, Ann', 'Sakamoto, Kathleen M', 'Schapira, Lidia', 'Castellino, Sharon M']","['Smith SM', 'Sabnis HS', 'Lewis RW', 'Effinger KE', 'Bergsagel J', 'Patterson B', 'Mertens A', 'Sakamoto KM', 'Schapira L', 'Castellino SM']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3763-3253'],"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA. hsabnis@emory.edu.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA. hsabnis@emory.edu."", ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Endocrinology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA."", 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.', 'Stanford Cancer Institute and Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['CA180-640/Bristol-Myers Squibb', 'Rosa A.

HSPA8 is a chaperone protein that facilitates proper protein folding. It contributes to various activities of cell function and also is associated with various types of cancers. To date, the role of HSPA8 in AML is still undetermined. METHODS: In this study, public datasets available from the TCGA (Cancer Genome Atlas) and GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) were mined to discover the association between the expression of HSPA8 and clinical phenotypes of CN-AML. A series of bioinformatics analysis methods, including functional annotation and miRNA-mRNA regulation network analysis, were employed to investigate the role of HSPA8 in CN-AML. RESULTS: HSPA8 was highly expressed in the AML patients compared to the healthy controls. The high HSPA8 expression had lower overall survival (OS) rate than those with low HSPA8 expression. High expression of HSPA8 was also an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) of CN-AML patients by multivariate analysis. The differential expressed genes (DEGs) associated with HSPA8 high expression were identified, and they were enriched PI3k-Akt signaling, cAMP signaling, calcium signaling pathway. HSPA8 high expression was also positively associated with micro-RNAs (hsa-mir-1269a, hsa-mir-508-3p, hsa-mir-203a), the micro-RNAs targeted genes (VSTM4, RHOB, HOBX7) and key known oncogenes (KLF5, RAN, and IDH1), and negatively associated with tumor suppressors (KLF12, PRKG1, TRPS1, NOTCH1, RORA). CONCLUSIONS: Our research revealed HSPA8 as a novel potential prognostic factor to predict the survival of CN-AML patients. Our data also revealed the possible carcinogenic mechanism and the complicated microRNA-mRNA network associated with the HSPA8 high expression in AML.","['Li, Jun', 'Ge, Zheng']","['Li J', 'Ge Z']",,"['Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospita, Medical School of Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospita, Medical School of Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing, 210009, China.

The benefits and harms of transfusions near the end of life (EOL), however, are poorly characterized and patients' preferences are unknown. We sought to characterize the recollections of bereaved caregivers about the relationships between transfusions and hospice enrollment decisions. METHODS: We recruited 18 bereaved caregivers of 15 decedents who died within 6-18 months of the interview. Interviews focused on caregivers' recollections of transfusion and hospice enrollment decisions. Transcripts were analyzed for themes. RESULTS: We identified 2 themes. First, caregivers described that transfusions were necessary and the decisions to receive transfusions or not were deferred to the clinicians. Second, only 1 caregiver recalled transfusions as relevant to hospice decisions. In that instance there was a delay. Caregivers identified difficulties recognizing death was imminent, hope for miracles, and the necessity of accepting life was ending as more relevant barriers. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate clinicians' beliefs in transfusion at EOL may be a more relevant barrier to hospice enrollment than patients' preferences. Strategies to evaluate accurately and discuss the actual benefits and harms of transfusions at the EOL are necessary to advise patients and integrate their preferences into decisions.","['Cripe, Larry D', 'Cottingham, Ann H', 'Martin, Caroline E', 'Hoffmann, Mary Lynn', 'Sargent, Katherine', 'Baker, Layla B']","['Cripe LD', 'Cottingham AH', 'Martin CE', 'Hoffmann ML', 'Sargent K', 'Baker LB']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2827-0101', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2453-1514']","['Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, 14686Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', '50826The Regenstrief Institute, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, 14686Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, 14686Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, 14686Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', '50826The Regenstrief Institute, Indianapolis, IN, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210429,United States,Am J Hosp Palliat Care,The American journal of hospice & palliative care,9008229,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'bereaved caregivers', ""bereaved caregivers' recall"", 'blood cancer', 'blood cancer transfusions', 'hospice enrollment']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/04/30 05:34'],"['2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/30 05:34 [entrez]']",['10.1177/10499091211013290 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hosp Palliat Care. 2022 Jan;39(1):68-71. doi: 10.1177/10499091211013290.

Using T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines Jurkat and Molt-4 as model system, we found that HD suppressed T-ALL proliferation in vitro, via induction of cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis. Furthermore, HD increased the LC3-II levels and the formation of autophagolysosome vacuoles, both of which are markers for autophagy. The inhibition of autophagy by either knockdown of ATG5/7 or pre-treatment of 3-MA partially rescued HD-induced apoptosis, thus suggesting that autophagy enhanced the efficacy of HD. Interestingly, this cytotoxic autophagy triggered ferroptosis, as evidenced by the accumulation of lipid ROS and decrease of GSH and GPX4, while inhibition of autophagy impeded ferroptotic cell death. Our study suggests that HD triggers multiple cell death processes and is an interesting compound that should be evaluated in future preclinical studies.","['Lou, Siyue', 'Hong, Huanwu', 'Maihesuti, Liwaliding', 'Gao, Hang', 'Zhu, Zhihui', 'Xu, Lili', 'Tian, Shasha', 'Kai, Guoyin', 'Huang, Guozheng', 'Zhao, Huajun']","['Lou S', 'Hong H', 'Maihesuti L', 'Gao H', 'Zhu Z', 'Xu L', 'Tian S', 'Kai G', 'Huang G', 'Zhao H']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5730-9549', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8643-4261']","['College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry of Arid Zone, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi 830011, China.', 'School of Chemical Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China.', ""College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Anhui University of Technology, Ma'anshan 243002, China."", 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210429,England,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",100973463,PMC8283251,['NOTNLM'],"['*Hydnocarpin D', '*T-ALL', '*apoptosis', '*autophagy', '*ferroptosis']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/11/18 06:00,['2021/04/30 05:33'],"['2022/07/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/18 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/30 05:33 [entrez]']",['10.1177/15353702211004870 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2021 Jul;246(13):1541-1553. doi: 10.1177/15353702211004870.

The BCL6 corepressor (BCOR) and its homolog, the BCL6 corepressor-like 1 (BCORL1), have been reported to be rare but recurrent mutations in AML. Previously, smaller studies have reported conflicting results regarding impacts on outcomes. Here, we retrospectively analyzed a large cohort of 1529 patients with newly diagnosed and intensively treated AML. BCOR and BCORL1 mutations were found in 71 (4.6%) and 53 patients (3.5%), respectively. Frequently co-mutated genes were DNTM3A, TET2 and RUNX1. Mutated BCORL1 and loss-of-function mutations of BCOR were significantly more common in the ELN2017 intermediate-risk group. Patients harboring loss-of-function mutations of BCOR had a significantly reduced median event-free survival (HR = 1.464 (95%-Confidence Interval (CI): 1.005-2.134), p = 0.047), relapse-free survival (HR = 1.904 (95%-CI: 1.163-3.117), p = 0.01), and trend for reduced overall survival (HR = 1.495 (95%-CI: 0.990-2.258), p = 0.056) in multivariable analysis. Our study establishes a novel role for loss-of-function mutations of BCOR regarding risk stratification in AML, which may influence treatment allocation.","['Eckardt, Jan-Niklas', 'Stasik, Sebastian',

The T-ALL event-free survival rate (EFS) is 85%. The evaluation of structural and numerical chromosomal changes is important for a comprehensive biological characterization of T-ALL, but there are currently no genetic prognostic markers. Despite chemotherapy regimens, steroids, and allogeneic transplantation, relapse is the main problem in children with T-ALL. Due to the development of high-throughput molecular methods, the ability to define subgroups of T-ALL has significantly improved in the last few years. The profiling of the gene expression of T-ALL has led to the identification of T-ALL subgroups, and it is important in determining prognostic factors and choosing an appropriate treatment. Novel therapies targeting molecular aberrations offer promise in achieving better first remission with the hope of preventing relapse. The employment of precisely targeted therapeutic approaches is expected to improve the cure of the disease and quality of life of patients. These include therapies that inhibit Notch1 activation (bortezomib), JAK inhibitors in ETP-ALL (ruxolitinib), BCL inhibitors (venetoclax), and anti-CD38 therapy (daratumumab). Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T) is under investigation, but it requires further development and trials. Nelarabine-based regimens remain the standard for treating the relapse of T-ALL.","['Lato, Marta Weronika', 'Przysucha, Anna', 'Grosman, Sylwia', 'Zawitkowska, Joanna', 'Lejman, Monika']","['Lato MW', 'Przysucha A', 'Grosman S', 'Zawitkowska J', 'Lejman M']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4121-3400', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8760-0775']","['Student Scientific Society, Laboratory of Genetic Diagnostics, Medical University of Lublin, 20-093 Lublin, Poland.', 'Student Scientific Society, Laboratory of Genetic Diagnostics, Medical University of Lublin, 20-093 Lublin, Poland.', 'Student Scientific Society, Laboratory of Genetic Diagnostics, Medical University of Lublin, 20-093 Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, Medical University of Lublin, 20-093 Lublin, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Genetic Diagnostics, Medical University of Lublin, 20-093 Lublin, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210426,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC8123476,['NOTNLM'],"['T-ALL', 'novel therapies', 'pediatrics']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/20 06:00,['2021/04/30 01:33'],"['2021/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/21 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:33 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22094502 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22094502 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Apr 26;22(9). pii: ijms22094502. doi: 10.3390/ijms22094502.,20210519,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '4Z63YK6E0E (daratumumab)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib/therapeutic use', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Nitriles', 'Pediatrics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Pyrazoles/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines', 'Quality of Life', 'Recurrence', 'Sulfonamides/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JAK inhibitors are the only approved therapy for myelofibrosis and have been successful in reducing spleen and symptom burden. However, they do not significantly impact disease progression and many patients are ineligible due to coexisting cytopenias. Patients who are refractory to JAK inhibition also have a dismal survival. Therefore, non-JAK inhibitor-based therapies are being explored in pre-clinical and clinical settings. In this review, we discuss novel treatments in development for myelofibrosis with targets outside of the JAK-STAT pathway. We focus on the mechanism, preclinical rationale, and available clinical efficacy and safety information of relevant agents including those that target apoptosis (navitoclax, KRT-232, LCL-161, imetelstat), epigenetic modulation (CPI-0610, bomedemstat), the bone marrow microenvironment (PRM-151, AVID-200, alisertib), signal transduction pathways (parsaclisib), and miscellaneous agents (tagraxofusp. luspatercept).

However, PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade failed to achieve clinical benefit in CLL, thus attention has been focused on emerging checkpoints in this malignancy. LAG-3 is an immune checkpoint receptor that negatively regulates T cell-mediated responses by inducing an hyporesponsive state, thus promoting tumor escape. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) develop a profound immune suppression that leads to lessened immunosurveillance and increased risk of developing a secondary neoplasia. In the study herein, we report the profound dysregulation of LAG-3 on leukemic cells in CLL. Likewise, natural killer (NK) and T cells showed increased LAG-3 expression, hence suggesting a role for this checkpoint in CLL-associated immunosuppression. High LAG-3 expression, as well as high levels of soluble LAG-3 (sLAG-3), correlated with adverse cytogenetics and poor outcome in patients with CLL, highlighting the clinical relevance of this immune checkpoint. Treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with CLL with relatlimab, a new anti-LAG-3 blocking antibody currently evaluated in numerous clinical trials, depleted leukemic cells and restored NK cell- and T cell-mediated responses. Moreover, combination of LAG-3 with the immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) lenalidomide significantly increased IL-2 production by T cells and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by NK cells. Altogether, these data provide new insights into the potential anti-leukemic effects of relatlimab, currently in clinical trials in CLL, and provides the rationale to further investigate its combination with IMiDs for the management of hematological malignancies.","['Sordo-Bahamonde, Christian', 'Lorenzo-Herrero, Seila', 'Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Ana P', 'Payer, Angel R', 'Gonzalez-Garcia, Esther', 'Lopez-Soto, Alejandro', 'Gonzalez, Segundo']","['Sordo-Bahamonde C', 'Lorenzo-Herrero S', 'Gonzalez-Rodriguez AP', 'Payer AR', 'Gonzalez-Garcia E', 'Lopez-Soto A', 'Gonzalez S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9755-6149', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9729-3871', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0565-9133', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7171-4973', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6360-5205', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4631-9255']","['Department of Functional Biology, Immunology, Universidad de Oviedo, 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias (IUOPA), 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias (ISPA), 33011 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Functional Biology, Immunology, Universidad de Oviedo, 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias (IUOPA), 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias (ISPA), 33011 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias (IUOPA), 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias (ISPA), 33011 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias (HUCA), 33011 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias (IUOPA), 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias (ISPA), 33011 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias (HUCA), 33011 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital de Cabuenes, 33203 Gijon, Spain.', 'Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias (IUOPA), 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias (ISPA), 33011 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Oviedo, 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Functional Biology, Immunology, Universidad de Oviedo, 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias (IUOPA), 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias (ISPA), 33011 Oviedo, Spain.']",['eng'],['PI19/01353/Instituto de Salud Carlos III'],['Journal Article'],20210427,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC8123840,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'ICB', 'LAG3', 'NK cell', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'immune checkpoint', 'immunosurveillance', 'immunotherapy', 'relatlimab']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:32'],"['2021/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:32 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13092112 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13092112 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Apr 27;13(9). pii: cancers13092112. doi: 10.3390/cancers13092112.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antimetabolite-methotrexate (MTX) has been used for many years in the treatment of leukemia and in lymphoma patients. However, the lack of MTX specificity causes a significant risk of morbidity, mortality, and severe side effects that impairs the quality of patients' life. Therefore, novel targeted therapies based on the malignant cells' common traits have become an essential treatment strategy. Glucose transporters have been found to be overexpressed in neoplastic cells, including hematologic malignancies. In this study, we biologically evaluated a novel glucose-methotrexate conjugate (Glu-MTX) in comparison to a free MTX. The research aimed to assess the effectiveness of Glu-MTX on chosen human lymphoma and leukemia cell lines. Cell cytotoxicity was verified by MTT viability test and flow cytometry. Moreover, the cell cycle and cellular uptake of Glu-MTX were evaluated. Our study reveals that conjugation of methotrexate with glucose significantly increases drug uptake and results in similar cytotoxicity of the synthesized compound. Although the finding has been confined to in vitro studies, our observations shed light on a potential therapeutic approach that increases the selectivity of chemotherapeutics and can improve leukemia and lymphoma patients' outcomes.","['Wozniak, Marta', 'Makuch, Sebastian', 'Pastuch-Gawolek, Gabriela', 'Wisniewski, Jerzy', 'Szeja, Wieslaw', 'Nowak, Martyna', 'Krawczyk, Monika', 'Agrawal, Siddarth']","['Wozniak M', 'Makuch S', 'Pastuch-Gawolek G', 'Wisniewski J', 'Szeja W', 'Nowak M', 'Krawczyk M', 'Agrawal S']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7978-6330', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9904-1181', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8753-1143', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2831-7643', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7400-3488', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1118-5090']","['Department of Pathology, Wroclaw Medical University, 50-367 Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pathology, Wroclaw Medical University, 50-367 Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Bioorganic Chemistry and Biotechnology, Faculty of Chemistry, Silesian University of Technology, 44-100 Gliwice, Poland.', 'Biotechnology Centre, Silesian University of Technology, 44-100 Gliwice, Poland.', 'Central Laboratory of Instrumental Analysis, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, 50-370 Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Bioorganic Chemistry and Biotechnology, Faculty of Chemistry, Silesian University of Technology, 44-100 Gliwice, Poland.', 'Department of Pathology, Wroclaw Medical University, 50-367 Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Bioorganic Chemistry and Biotechnology, Faculty of Chemistry, Silesian University of Technology, 44-100 Gliwice, Poland.', 'Biotechnology Centre, Silesian University of Technology, 44-100 Gliwice, Poland.', 'Department of Pathology, Wroclaw Medical University, 50-367 Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department and Clinic of Internal Medicine, Occupational Diseases, Hypertension and Clinical Oncology, Wroclaw Medical University, 50-556 Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['TANGO3/426098/NCBR/2019/Narodowe Centrum Badan i Rozwoju', 'STM.A010.20.135/Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Here we discuss how the recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS)-based (phospho) proteomics and multiparametric analysis accompanied by emerging computational approaches offer a platform to obtain and systematically analyze cell-specific signaling networks and to identify new potential therapeutic targets.","['Pugliese, Giusj Monia', 'Latini, Sara', 'Massacci, Giorgia', 'Perfetto, Livia', 'Sacco, Francesca']","['Pugliese GM', 'Latini S', 'Massacci G', 'Perfetto L', 'Sacco F']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9473-4982', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2353-3155', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4392-8725', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5586-9529']","['Department of Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Via delle Ricerca Scientifica 1, 00133 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Via delle Ricerca Scientifica 1, 00133 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Via delle Ricerca Scientifica 1, 00133 Rome, Italy.', 'Fondazione Human Technopole, Department of Biology, Via Cristina Belgioioso 171, 20157 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Via delle Ricerca Scientifica 1, 00133 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['21815/AIRC'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210427,Switzerland,Proteomes,Proteomes,101621966,PMC8167576,['NOTNLM'],"['(phospho)proteomic', 'AML', 'FLT3', 'drug-resistance', 'logic-model', 'signaling-network']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:32'],"['2021/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/22 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:32 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['proteomes9020019 [pii]', '10.3390/proteomes9020019 [doi]']",epublish,Proteomes. 2021 Apr 27;9(2). pii: proteomes9020019. doi: 10.3390/proteomes9020019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The AYA group was defined in most studies by an age range of 18-40 years, with some exceptions (up to 45 years). The experience collected in pediatric ALL with the study of post-induction minimal residual disease (MRD) was rapidly duplicated in AYA ALL, making MRD a widely accepted key factor for risk stratification and risk-oriented therapy with or without allogeneic stem cell transplantation and experimental new drugs for patients with MRD detectable after highly intensive chemotherapy. This combined strategy has resulted in long-term survival rates of AYA patients of 60-80%. The present review examines the evidence for MRD-guided therapies in AYA's Ph- ALL, provides a critical appraisal of current treatment pitfalls and illustrates the ways of achieving further therapeutic improvement according to the massive knowledge recently generated in the field of ALL biology and MRD/risk/subset-specific therapy.","['Tosi, Manuela', 'Spinelli, Orietta', 'Leoncin, Matteo', 'Cavagna, Roberta', 'Pavoni, Chiara', 'Lussana, Federico', 'Intermesoli, Tamara', 'Frison, Luca', 'Perali, Giulia', 'Carobolante, Francesca', 'Viero, Piera', 'Skert, Cristina', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Bassan, Renato']","['Tosi M', 'Spinelli O', 'Leoncin M', 'Cavagna R', 'Pavoni C', 'Lussana F', 'Intermesoli T', 'Frison L', 'Perali G', 'Carobolante F', 'Viero P', 'Skert C', 'Rambaldi A', 'Bassan R']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0374-1536', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9677-1250', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4353-2210', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6510-8616', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3739-7502', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8214-2894']","['Hematology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale (ASST), Ospedale Papa Giovanni XXIII, 24127 Bergamo, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale (ASST), Ospedale Papa Giovanni XXIII, 24127 Bergamo, Italy.', ""Hematology Unit, Azienda Ulss3 Serenissima, Ospedale dell'Angelo, 30174 Venezia-Mestre, Italy."", 'Hematology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale (ASST), Ospedale Papa Giovanni XXIII, 24127 Bergamo, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale (ASST), Ospedale Papa Giovanni XXIII, 24127 Bergamo, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale (ASST), Ospedale Papa Giovanni XXIII, 24127 Bergamo, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale (ASST), Ospedale Papa Giovanni XXIII, 24127 Bergamo, Italy.', ""Hematology Unit, Azienda Ulss3 Serenissima, Ospedale dell'Angelo, 30174 Venezia-Mestre, Italy."", ""Hematology Unit, Azienda Ulss3 Serenissima, Ospedale dell'Angelo, 30174 Venezia-Mestre, Italy."", ""Hematology Unit, Azienda Ulss3 Serenissima, Ospedale dell'Angelo, 30174 Venezia-Mestre, Italy."", ""Hematology Unit, Azienda Ulss3 Serenissima, Ospedale dell'Angelo, 30174 Venezia-Mestre, Italy."", ""Hematology Unit, Azienda Ulss3 Serenissima, Ospedale dell'Angelo, 30174 Venezia-Mestre, Italy."", 'Hematology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale (ASST), Ospedale Papa Giovanni XXIII, 24127 Bergamo, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology-Hematology, University of Milan, 20122 Milan, Italy.', ""Hematology Unit, Azienda Ulss3 Serenissima, Ospedale dell'Angelo, 30174 Venezia-Mestre, Italy.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210427,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC8123823,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'adolescents and young adults', 'minimal residual disease', 'risk stratification', 'risk-oriented therapy']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:32'],"['2021/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/21 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:32 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13092108 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13092108 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Apr 27;13(9). pii: cancers13092108. doi: 10.3390/cancers13092108.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of cases are classified as Primary Induction Response (PIR); unfortunately, 15% of children do not achieve remission and are defined Primary Induction Failure (PIF). This study aims to characterize the gene expression profile of PIF in children with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), in order to detect molecular pathways dysfunctions and identify potential biomarkers. Given that NUP98-rearrangements are enriched in PIF-AML patients, we investigated the association of NUP98-driven genes in primary chemoresistance. Therefore, 85 expression arrays, deposited on GEO database, and 358 RNAseq AML samples, from TARGET program, were analyzed for ""Differentially Expressed Genes"" (DEGs) between NUP98+ and NUP98-, identifying 110 highly confident NUP98/PIF-associated DEGs. We confirmed, by qRT-PCR, the overexpression of nine DEGs, selected on the bases of the diagnostic accuracy, in a local cohort of PIF patients: SPINK2, TMA7, SPCS2, CDCP1, CAPZA1, FGFR1OP2, MAN1A2, NT5C3A and SRP54.

However, the precise mechanisms of myocardial remodeling (MR) in the settings of CKD remain elusive. We hypothesized that TRPC6, calcineurin/NFAT, and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways are involved in the development of MR in the background of CKD and AH. METHODS: Early CKD was induced by performing a 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6NE) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-NE). Sham-operated (SO) SHR (SHR-SO) and Wistar Kyoto (WKY-SO) rats served as controls. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate, myocardial mass index (MMI), serum creatinine, cardiomyocyte diameter (dCM), myocardial fibrosis (MF), serum and kidney alpha-Klotho levels, myocardial expression of calcineurin (CaN), TRPC6, and beta-catenin were measured two months after 5/6NE or SO. RESULTS: NE-induced kidney dysfunction corresponded to mild-to-moderate human CKD and was associated with an increase in FGF23 and a decrease in renal alpha-Klotho. The levels of SBP, MMI, dCM, and MF were higher in SHRs compared to WKY-SO as well as in SHR-NE vs. SHR-SO. The MR was associated with increased cardiomyocyte expression of CaN/NFAT and beta-catenin along with its intracellular re-distribution. TRPC6 protein levels were substantially elevated in both SHR groups with higher Trpc6 mRNA expression in SHR-NE. CONCLUSIONS: The Wnt/beta-catenin and TRPC6/CaN/NFAT hypertrophic signaling pathways seem to be involved in myocardial remodeling in the settings of AH and CKD and might be mediated by FGF23 and alpha-Klotho axis.","['Bogdanova, Evdokia', 'Beresneva, Olga', 'Galkina, Olga', 'Zubina, Irina', 'Ivanova, Galina', 'Parastaeva, Marina', 'Semenova, Natalia', 'Dobronravov, Vladimir']","['Bogdanova E', 'Beresneva O', 'Galkina O', 'Zubina I', 'Ivanova G', 'Parastaeva M', 'Semenova N', 'Dobronravov V']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1969-1959', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4069-0678']","['Research Institute of Nephrology, Pavlov University, Saint Petersburg 197022, Russia.', 'Research Institute of Nephrology, Pavlov University, Saint Petersburg 197022, Russia.', 'Research Institute of Nephrology, Pavlov University, Saint Petersburg 197022, Russia.', 'Research Institute of Nephrology, Pavlov University, Saint Petersburg 197022, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Cardiovascular and Lymphatic Systems Physiology, Pavlov Institute of Physiology, Saint Petersburg 199034, Russia.', 'Research Institute of Nephrology, Pavlov University, Saint Petersburg 197022, Russia.', 'Research Department of Pathomorphology, Almazov National Medical Research Center, Saint Petersburg 197341, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Leukemia Research, Russian Research Institute of Hematology and Transfusiology of FMBA of Russia, Saint Petersburg 191024, Russia.', 'Research Institute of Nephrology, Pavlov University, Saint Petersburg 197022, Russia.']",['eng'],['18-315-00342; 18-015-00425/Russian Foundation for Basic Research'],['Journal Article'],20210428,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC8124394,['NOTNLM'],"['Klotho', 'NFAT', 'TRPC6', 'arterial hypertension', 'calcineurin A', 'calcineurin B', 'cardiac remodeling', 'chronic kidney disease', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'parathyroid hormone', 'beta-catenin']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/27 06:00,['2021/04/30 01:30'],"['2021/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/26 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:30 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/27 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22094645 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22094645 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Apr 28;22(9). pii: ijms22094645. doi: 10.3390/ijms22094645.,20210526,"['0 (FGF23 protein, human)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (TRPC Cation Channels)', '0 (Trpc6 protein, rat)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '7Q7P4S7RRE (Fibroblast Growth Factor-23)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Calcineurin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcineurin/metabolism', 'Cardiomegaly/etiology/*metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor-23', 'Hypertension/complications', 'Male', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*metabolism', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Nephrectomy', 'Rats, Inbred SHR', 'Rats, Inbred WKY', 'Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/complications', 'TRPC Cation Channels/*metabolism', 'Ventricular Remodeling', '*Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CMMRD is underdiagnosed and often debuts with pediatric malignant brain tumors. A high degree of clinical awareness of the CMMRD phenotype is needed to identify new cases. Immunohistochemical (IHC) assessment of MMR protein expression and analysis of microsatellite instability (MSI) are the first tools with which to initiate the study of this syndrome in solid malignancies. MMR IHC shows a hallmark pattern with absence of staining in both neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells for the biallelic mutated gene. However, MSI often fails in brain malignancies. The aim of this report is to draw attention to the peculiar IHC profile that characterizes CMMRD syndrome and to review the difficulties in reaching an accurate diagnosis by describing the case of two siblings with biallelic MSH6 germline mutations and brain tumors. Given the difficulties involved in early diagnosis of CMMRD we propose the use of the IHC of MMR proteins in all malignant brain tumors diagnosed in individuals younger than 25 years-old to facilitate the diagnosis of CMMRD and to select those neoplasms that will benefit from immunotherapy treatment.","['Carrato, Cristina', 'Sanz, Carolina', 'Munoz-Marmol, Ana Maria', 'Blanco, Ignacio', 'Pineda, Marta', 'Del Valle, Jesus', 'Damaso, Estela', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Musulen, Eva']","['Carrato C', 'Sanz C', 'Munoz-Marmol AM', 'Blanco I', 'Pineda M', 'Del Valle J', 'Damaso E', 'Esteller M', 'Musulen E']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3607-7045', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9650-7791']","['Department of Pathology, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, 08916 Badalona, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, 08916 Badalona, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, 08916 Badalona, Spain.', 'Program on Clinical Genetics and Genetic Counseling, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, 08916 Badalona, Spain.', ""Hereditary Cancer Program, ONCOBELL Program, Hospitalet de Llobregat, Catalan Institute of Oncology, Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL), 08908 L'Hospitaled de Liobregat, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), 28040 Madrid, Spain.', ""Hereditary Cancer Program, ONCOBELL Program, Hospitalet de Llobregat, Catalan Institute of Oncology, Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL), 08908 L'Hospitaled de Liobregat, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), 28040 Madrid, Spain.', ""Hereditary Cancer Program, ONCOBELL Program, Hospitalet de Llobregat, Catalan Institute of Oncology, Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL), 08908 L'Hospitaled de Liobregat, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), 08916 Badalona, Spain.', 'Physiological Sciences Department, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Barcelona (UB), 08007 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), 08010 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, 08916 Badalona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), 08916 Badalona, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital Universitari General de Catalunya-Grupo QuironSalud, 08195 Sant Cugat del Valles, Spain.']",['eng'],"[""2017SGR1080 373 and 2017SGR1282/Conselleria d'Empresa i Coneixement de la"", 'Generalitat de Catalunya', 'SAF2015-68016-R and PID2019-111254RB-I00/Ministerio de Espana de Economia y', 'Competitividad y FEDER', 'LCF/PR/GN18/51140001/la Caixa"" Banking Foundation', 'RTI2018-094049-B-I00 and SAF2014-55000/CIBERONC, MCIU/AEI/FEDER, UE']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20210428,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC8124255,['NOTNLM'],"['MMR gene expression', 'MSH6 gene', 'constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome', 'immunohistochemistry']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/27 06:00,['2021/04/30 01:30'],"['2021/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/22 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:30 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/27 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22094629 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22094629 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Apr 28;22(9). pii: ijms22094629. doi: 10.3390/ijms22094629.,20210526,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (G-T mismatch-binding protein)', 'Turcot syndrome']",IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Neurofibromatoses/diagnosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This rearrangement leads to the synthesis of the MLL-AF4 chimera, which exerts its oncogenic activity by upregulating transcription of genes involved in hematopoietic differentiation. Crucial for chimera's aberrant activity is the recruitment of the AF4/ENL/P-TEFb protein complex. Interestingly, a molecular interactor of AF4 is fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). We herein analyze the role of FGFR2 in the context of leukemia using t(4;11) leukemia cell lines. We revealed the interaction between MLL-AF4 and FGFR2 by immunoprecipitation, western blot, and immunofluorescence experiments; we also tested the effects of FGFR2 knockdown, FGFR2 inhibition, and FGFR2 stimulation on the expression of the main MLL-AF4 target genes, i.e., HOXA9 and MEIS1. Our results show that FGFR2 and MLL-AF4 interact in the nucleus of leukemia cells and that FGFR2 knockdown, which is associated with decreased expression of HOXA9 and MEIS1, impairs the binding of MLL-AF4 to the HOXA9 promoter. We also show that stimulation of leukemia cells with FGF2 increases nuclear level of FGFR2 in its phosphorylated form, as well as HOXA9 and MEIS1 expression. In contrast, preincubation with the ATP-mimetic inhibitor PD173074, before FGF2 stimulation, reduced FGFR2 nuclear amount and HOXA9 and MEIS1 transcript level, thereby indicating that MLL-AF4 aberrant activity depends on the nuclear availability of FGFR2. Overall, our study identifies FGFR2 as a new and promising therapeutic target in t(4;11) leukemia.","['Fioretti, Tiziana', 'Cevenini, Armando', 'Zanobio, Mariateresa', 'Raia, Maddalena', 'Sarnataro, Daniela', 'Cattaneo, Fabio', 'Ammendola, Rosario', 'Esposito, Gabriella']","['Fioretti T', 'Cevenini A', 'Zanobio M', 'Raia M', 'Sarnataro D', 'Cattaneo F', 'Ammendola R', 'Esposito G']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1858-2833', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3750-1592', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6094-8384', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5833-8333', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1655-8028', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4255-7312']","['CEINGE Advanced Biotechnologies s.c. a r.l., via G.

A French population of 9453 AML patients aged >/=15 years diagnosed from 1995 to 2015 was studied to quantify the proportion cured (P), time to cure (TTC) and median survival of patients who are not cured (MedS). Net survival (NS) was estimated using a flexible model adjusted for age and sex in sixteen AML subtypes. When cure assumption was acceptable, the flexible cure model was used to estimate P, TTC and MedS for the uncured patients. The 5-year NS varied from 68% to 9% in men and from 77% to 11% in women in acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML-APL) and in therapy-related AML (t-AML), respectively. Major age-differenced survival was observed for patients with a diagnosis of AML with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities. A poorer survival in younger patients was found in t-AML and AML with minimal differentiation. An atypical survival profile was found for acute myelomonocytic leukemia and AML without maturation in both sexes and for AML not otherwise specified (only for men) according to age, with a better prognosis for middle-aged compared to younger patients. Sex disparity regarding survival was observed in younger patients with t-AML diagnosed at 25 years of age (+28% at 5 years in men compared to women) and in AML with minimal differentiation (+23% at 5 years in women compared to men). All AML subtypes included an age group for which the assumption of cure was acceptable, although P varied from 90% in younger women with AML-APL to 3% in older men with acute monoblastic and monocytic leukemia. Increased P was associated with shorter TTC. A sizeable proportion of AML patients do not achieve cure, and MedS for these did not exceed 23 months. We identify AML subsets where cure assumption is negative, thus pointing to priority areas for future research efforts.","['Mounier, Morgane', 'Romain, Gaelle', 'Callanan, Mary', 'Alla, Akoua Denise', 'Boussari, Olayide', 'Maynadie, Marc', 'Colonna, Marc', 'Jooste, Valerie']","['Mounier M', 'Romain G', 'Callanan M', 'Alla AD', 'Boussari O', 'Maynadie M', 'Colonna M', 'Jooste V']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4294-5507'],"[""Dijon-Bourgogne University Hospital, Registre des Hemopathies Malignes de Cote d'Or, F-21000 Dijon, France."", 'UMR 1231, SAPHIHR Team, INSERM, Universite Bourgogne-Franche_Comte, F-21000 Dijon, France.', 'LabEX LipSTIC, ANR-11-LABX-0021, F-21000 Dijon, France.', 'Dijon-Bourgogne University Hospital, Registre Bourguignon des Cancers Digestifs, F-21000 Dijon, France.', 'UMR 1231, EPICAD Team, INSERM, Universite Bourgogne-Franche_Comte, F-21000 Dijon, France.', ""Dijon-Bourgogne University Hospital, Registre des Hemopathies Malignes de Cote d'Or, F-21000 Dijon, France."", 'UMR 1231, SAPHIHR Team, INSERM, Universite Bourgogne-Franche_Comte, F-21000 Dijon, France.', 'LabEX LipSTIC, ANR-11-LABX-0021, F-21000 Dijon, France.', ""Dijon-Bourgogne University Hospital, Registre des Hemopathies Malignes de Cote d'Or, F-21000 Dijon, France."", 'UMR 1231, SAPHIHR Team, INSERM, Universite Bourgogne-Franche_Comte, F-21000 Dijon, France.', 'LabEX LipSTIC, ANR-11-LABX-0021, F-21000 Dijon, France.', 'LabEX LipSTIC, ANR-11-LABX-0021, F-21000 Dijon, France.', 'UMR 1231, EPICAD Team, INSERM, Universite Bourgogne-Franche_Comte, F-21000 Dijon, France.', 'Federation Francophone de Cancerologie Digestive, Departement de Methodologie, F-21000 Dijon, France.', ""Dijon-Bourgogne University Hospital, Registre des Hemopathies Malignes de Cote d'Or, F-21000 Dijon, France."", 'UMR 1231, SAPHIHR Team, INSERM, Universite Bourgogne-Franche_Comte, F-21000 Dijon, France.', 'LabEX LipSTIC, ANR-11-LABX-0021, F-21000 Dijon, France.', ""Grenoble University Hospital, Registre du Cancer de l'Isere, F-38000 Grenoble, France."", 'Dijon-Bourgogne University Hospital, Registre Bourguignon des Cancers Digestifs, F-21000 Dijon, France.', 'UMR 1231, EPICAD Team, INSERM, Universite Bourgogne-Franche_Comte, F-21000 Dijon, France.']",['eng'],['2015-235/Institut National Du Cancer'],['Journal Article'],20210413,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,PMC8069423,['NOTNLM'],"['France', 'acute myeloid leukemia subtype', 'age disparity', 'cure', 'excess mortality', 'flexible model', 'net survival', 'population-based study']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:28'],"['2021/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/25 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:28 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm10081657 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm10081657 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2021 Apr 13;10(8). pii: jcm10081657. doi: 10.3390/jcm10081657.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment outcome has improved steadily with over 90% of patients surviving 5 years from initial diagnosis. This success can be attributed in part to the development of a risk stratification approach to identify those subsets of patients with an outstanding outcome that might qualify for a reduction in therapy associated with fewer short and long term side effects. Likewise, recognition of patients with an inferior prognosis allows for augmentation of therapy, which has been shown to improve outcome. Among the clinical and biological variables known to impact prognosis, the kinetics of the reduction in tumor burden during initial therapy has emerged as the most important prognostic variable. Specifically, various methods have been used to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) with flow cytometric and molecular detection of antigen receptor gene rearrangements being the most common. However, many questions remain as to the optimal timing of these assays, their sensitivity, integration with other variables and role in treatment allocation of various ALL subgroups. Importantly, the emergence of next generation sequencing assays is likely to broaden the use of these assays to track disease evolution. This review will discuss the biological basis for utilizing MRD in risk assessment, the technical approaches and limitations of MRD detection and its emerging applications.","['Contreras Yametti, Gloria Paz', 'Ostrow, Talia H', 'Jasinski, Sylwia', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Carroll, William L', 'Evensen, Nikki A']","['Contreras Yametti GP', 'Ostrow TH', 'Jasinski S', 'Raetz EA', 'Carroll WL', 'Evensen NA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8464-035X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8090-0986']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric and Pathology, Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health, Smillow 1211, 560 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric and Pathology, Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health, Smillow 1211, 560 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric and Pathology, Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health, Smillow 1211, 560 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric and Pathology, Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health, Smillow 1211, 560 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric and Pathology, Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health, Smillow 1211, 560 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric and Pathology, Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health, Smillow 1211, 560 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210413,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC8069391,['NOTNLM'],"['PCR', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'clinical significance', 'ddPCR', 'flow cytometry', 'minimal residual disease', 'next generation sequencing']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:28'],"['2021/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/31 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:28 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13081847 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13081847 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Apr 13;13(8). pii: cancers13081847. doi: 10.3390/cancers13081847.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CML eradication is a challenge due to developing resistance to TKIs. BCR-ABL1 induces endogenous oxidative stress leading to genomic instability and development of TKI resistance. Model CML cells susceptible or resistant to IM, as well as wild-type, non-cancer cells without the BCR-ABL1 protein were treated with IM, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a model trigger of external oxidative stress, or with IM+H2O2. Accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage, activity of selected antioxidant enzymes and glutathione (GSH), and mitochondrial potential (MMP) were assessed. We observed increase in ROS accumulation in BCR-ABL1 positive cells and distinct levels of ROS accumulation in IM-susceptible cells when compared to IM-resistant ones, as well as increased DNA damage caused by IM action in sensitive cells. Depletion of GSH levels and a decreased activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the presence of IM was higher in the cells susceptible to IM. IM-resistant cells showed an increase of catalase activity and a depletion of MMP. BCR-ABL1 kinase alters ROS metabolism, and IM resistance is accompanied by the changes in activity of GPx, catalase, and alterations in MMP.","['Glowacki, Sylwester', 'Synowiec, Ewelina', 'Szwed, Marzena', 'Toma, Monika', 'Skorski, Tomasz', 'Sliwinski, Tomasz']","['Glowacki S', 'Synowiec E', 'Szwed M', 'Toma M', 'Skorski T', 'Sliwinski T']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2102-3741', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8385-7744']","['Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143 Street, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143 Street, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143 Street, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143 Street, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.', 'Fels Cancer Institute for Personalized Medicine, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.', 'Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143 Street, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['DEC-2012/05/N/NZ3/01014/Narodowe Centrum Nauki', 'R01 CA186238/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210420,Switzerland,Biomolecules,Biomolecules,101596414,PMC8074285,['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*imatinib', '*reactive oxygen species']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/09/21 06:00,['2021/04/30 01:27'],"['2021/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:27 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['biom11040610 [pii]', '10.3390/biom11040610 [doi]']",epublish,Biomolecules. 2021 Apr 20;11(4). pii: biom11040610. doi: 10.3390/biom11040610.,20210920,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Mice', '*Oxidative Stress']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, there is evidence suggesting the involvement of YAP in the control of the hematopoietic system, in physiological conditions rather than in hematological diseases. Nevertheless, several reports have proposed that the effects of YAP in tumor cells are cell-dependent and cell-type-determined, even if YAP usually interrelates with extracellular signaling to stimulate the onset and progression of tumors. In the present review, we report the most recent findings in the literature on the relationship between the YAP system and hematological neoplasms. Moreover, we evaluate the possible therapeutic use of the modulation of the YAP system in the treatment of malignancies.

Currently, several treatment options, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and bone marrow transplantation, are used to treat leukemia, but the morbidity and mortality rates of patients with leukemia are still high. Therefore, there is still a need to develop more selective and less toxic drugs for the effective treatment of leukemia. Ampelopsin, also known as dihydromyricetin, is a plant-derived flavonoid that possesses multiple pharmacological functions, including antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antiangiogenic, and anticancer activities. However, the anticancer effect and mechanism of action of ampelopsin in leukemia remain unclear. In this study, we evaluated the antileukemic effect of ampelopsin against acute promyelocytic HL60 and chronic myelogenous K562 leukemia cells. Ampelopsin significantly inhibited the proliferation of both leukemia cell lines at concentrations that did not affect normal cell viability. Ampelopsin induced cell cycle arrest at the sub-G1 phase in HL60 cells but the S phase in K562 cells. In addition, ampelopsin regulated the expression of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and CDK inhibitors differently in each leukemia cell. Ampelopsin also induced apoptosis in both leukemia cell lines through nuclear condensation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, activation of caspase-9, caspase-3, and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), and regulation of Bcl-2 family members. Furthermore, the antileukemic effect of ampelopsin was associated with the downregulation of AKT and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Moreover, ampelopsin suppressed the expression levels of leukemia stemness markers, such as Oct4, Sox2, CD44, and CD133. Taken together, our findings suggest that ampelopsin may be an attractive chemotherapeutic agent against leukemia.","['Han, Jang Mi', 'Kim, Hong Lae', 'Jung, Hye Jin']","['Han JM', 'Kim HL', 'Jung HJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1773-9018', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3145-9300']","['Department of Life Science and Biochemical Engineering, Sun Moon University, Asan 31460, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering and Biotechnology, Sun Moon University, Asan 31460, Korea.', 'Department of Life Science and Biochemical Engineering, Sun Moon University, Asan 31460, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering and Biotechnology, Sun Moon University, Asan 31460, Korea.', 'Genome-Based BioIT Convergence Institute, Asan 31460, Korea.']",['eng'],"['NRF-2019R1A2C1009033/National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by', 'the Ministry of Science and ICT']",['Journal Article'],20210420,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC8073078,['NOTNLM'],"['ampelopsin', 'apoptosis', 'cancer stemness', 'leukemia', 'proliferation']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/25 06:00,['2021/04/30 01:27'],"['2021/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:27 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22084265 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22084265 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Apr 20;22(8). pii: ijms22084265. doi: 10.3390/ijms22084265.,20210524,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '27200-12-0 (ampelopsin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This systematic review and meta-analysis is aimed at evaluating the cancer risk in petroleum-exposed workers and in residents living near petroleum facilities. Relevant studies were identified and retrieved through PubMed and Web of Science databases. Summary effect size (ES) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were analysed using random effect models, and heterogeneity across studies was assessed (I(2)). Overall, petroleum industry work was associated with an increased risk of mesothelioma (ES = 2.09, CI: 1.58-2.76), skin melanoma (ES = 1.34, CI: 1.06-1.70 multiple myeloma (ES =1.81, CI: 1.28-2.55), and cancers of the prostate (ES = 1.13, Cl: 1.05-1.22) and urinary bladder (ES = 1.25, CI: 1.09-1.43) and a decreased risk of cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, and pancreas. Offshore petroleum work was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (ES = 1.20; 95% CI: 1.03-1.39) and leukemia (ES = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.12-1.92) in stratified analysis. Residential proximity to petroleum facilities was associated with childhood leukemia (ES = 1.90, CI: 1.34-2.70). Very few studies examined specific exposures among petroleum industry workers or residents living in oil producing communities. The present review warrants further studies on specific exposure levels and pathways among petroleum-exposed workers and residents living near petroleum facilities.","['Onyije, Felix M', 'Hosseini, Bayan', 'Togawa, Kayo', 'Schuz, Joachim', 'Olsson, Ann']","['Onyije FM', 'Hosseini B', 'Togawa K', 'Schuz J', 'Olsson A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4953-4949', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2670-9133', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6470-7775', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6498-2259']","['Environment and Lifestyle Epidemiology Branch, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC/WHO), 150 Cours Albert Thomas, CEDEX 08, 69372 Lyon, France.', 'Environment and Lifestyle Epidemiology Branch, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC/WHO), 150 Cours Albert Thomas, CEDEX 08, 69372 Lyon, France.', 'Environment and Lifestyle Epidemiology Branch, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC/WHO), 150 Cours Albert Thomas, CEDEX 08, 69372 Lyon, France.', 'Environment and Lifestyle Epidemiology Branch, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC/WHO), 150 Cours Albert Thomas, CEDEX 08, 69372 Lyon, France.', 'Environment and Lifestyle Epidemiology Branch, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC/WHO), 150 Cours Albert Thomas, CEDEX 08, 69372 Lyon, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20210420,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,PMC8073871,['NOTNLM'],"['*environmental pollution', '*meta-analysis', '*neoplasms', '*occupational exposure', '*petroleum industry', '*systematic review']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/21 06:00,['2021/04/30 01:26'],"['2021/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:26 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph18084343 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph18084343 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2021 Apr 20;18(8). pii: ijerph18084343. doi: 10.3390/ijerph18084343.,20210520,['0 (Petroleum)'],IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', '*Mesothelioma', '*Neoplasms/chemically induced/epidemiology', '*Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/epidemiology', '*Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', 'Oil and Gas Industry', '*Petroleum']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the high cure rates, drug resistance still remains a significant clinical problem, which stimulates the development of new therapeutic strategies and drugs to improve the disease outcome. Antipsychotic phenothiazines have emerged as potential candidates to be repositioned as antitumor drugs. It was previously shown that the anti-histaminic phenothiazine derivative promethazine induced autophagy-associated cell death in chronic myeloid leukemia cells, although autophagy can act as a ""double-edged sword"" contributing to cell survival or cell death. Here we evaluated the role of autophagy in thioridazine (TR)-induced cell death in the human ALL model. TR induced apoptosis in ALL Jurkat cells and it was not cytotoxic to normal peripheral mononuclear blood cells. TR promoted the activation of caspase-8 and -3, which was associated with increased NOXA/MCL-1 ratio and autophagy triggering. AMPK/PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways are involved in TR-induced cell death. The inhibition of the autophagic process enhanced the cytotoxicity of TR in Jurkat cells, highlighting autophagy as a targetable process for drug development purposes in ALL.","['Colturato-Kido, Carina', 'Lopes, Rayssa M', 'Medeiros, Hyllana C D', 'Costa, Claudia A', 'Prado-Souza, Laura F L', 'Ferraz, Leticia S', 'Rodrigues, Tiago']","['Colturato-Kido C', 'Lopes RM', 'Medeiros HCD', 'Costa CA', 'Prado-Souza LFL', 'Ferraz LS', 'Rodrigues T']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3700-3670', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5307-0251', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1304-1453', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7915-0081', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1277-0224']","['Centro de Ciencias Naturais e Humanas (CCNH), Universidade Federal do ABC (UFABC), Santo Andre 09210-580, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Centro de Ciencias Naturais e Humanas (CCNH), Universidade Federal do ABC (UFABC), Santo Andre 09210-580, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Centro de Ciencias Naturais e Humanas (CCNH), Universidade Federal do ABC (UFABC), Santo Andre 09210-580, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Centro Interdisciplinar de Investigacao Bioquimica (CIIB), Universidade de Mogi das Cruzes (UMC), Mogi das Cruzes 08780-911, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Centro de Ciencias Naturais e Humanas (CCNH), Universidade Federal do ABC (UFABC), Santo Andre 09210-580, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Centro de Ciencias Naturais e Humanas (CCNH), Universidade Federal do ABC (UFABC), Santo Andre 09210-580, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Centro de Ciencias Naturais e Humanas (CCNH), Universidade Federal do ABC (UFABC), Santo Andre 09210-580, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['2006/00995-5/Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo', '2012/12247-8/Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo', '2016/07367-5/Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo', '2018/25747-5/Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo', '312020/2019-8/Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico', '001/Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior']",['Journal Article'],20210420,Switzerland,Life (Basel),"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",101580444,PMC8073363,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'thioridazine', 'viability']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:26'],"['2021/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:26 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['life11040365 [pii]', '10.3390/life11040365 [doi]']",epublish,Life (Basel). 2021 Apr 20;11(4). pii: life11040365. doi: 10.3390/life11040365.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, large-scale studies with systematic MR acquisition and quantitative volumetric lesion information remain limited. Hence, the prevalence of lesion burdens and the potential risk factors of LE in this population are still inconclusive. FLAIR-MRI scans were acquired at the end of treatment in children who were treated for ALL/LBL, which were quantitatively analyzed for LE. Voxels were assigned to the lesion segmentation if indicated by two raters. Logistic and linear regression models were used to test whether lesion presence and size were predicted by risk factors such as age at diagnosis, gender, intrathecal (IT-) or intravenous (IV-)MTX dose, CNS invasion, and acute neurological events. Patients with a pre-existing neurological condition or low-quality MR scan were excluded from the analyses. Of the 129 patients, ten (8%) suffered from CNS invasion. Chemotherapy-associated neurological events were observed in 13 patients (10%) during therapy, and 68 patients (53%) showed LE post-treatment. LE was more frequent in cases of lower age and higher cumulative IV-MTX doses, while the extent of LE and neurological symptoms were associated only with IV-MTX doses. Neurological events were not significantly associated with LE, even though symptomatic patients demonstrated a higher ratio of LE (n = 9/13) than asymptomatic patients (n = 59/116). This study suggests leukoencephalopathy frequently occurs in both symptomatic and asymptomatic leukemia patients. Younger children and patients treated with higher cumulative IV-MTX doses might need more regular screening for early detection and follow-up of associated sequelae.","['Rijmenams, Ilona', 'Moechars, Daan', 'Uyttebroeck, Anne', 'Radwan, Ahmed', 'Blommaert, Jeroen', 'Deprez, Sabine', 'Sunaert, Stefan', 'Segers, Heidi', 'Gillebert, Celine R', 'Lemiere, Jurgen', 'Sleurs, Charlotte']","['Rijmenams I', 'Moechars D', 'Uyttebroeck A', 'Radwan A', 'Blommaert J', 'Deprez S', 'Sunaert S', 'Segers H', 'Gillebert CR', 'Lemiere J', 'Sleurs C']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0079-9778', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4746-9688', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1177-4680', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3604-7850', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6686-7262', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1575-0889', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4480-8330']","['Department of Brain and Cognition, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Brain and Cognition, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuven Cancer Institute, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuven Cancer Institute, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuven Brain Institute, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Imaging and Pathology, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuven Cancer Institute, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuven Brain Institute, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Gynaecological Oncology, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuven Cancer Institute, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuven Brain Institute, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Imaging and Pathology, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuven Cancer Institute, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuven Brain Institute, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Imaging and Pathology, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuven Cancer Institute, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Brain and Cognition, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuven Brain Institute, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuven Cancer Institute, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuven Brain Institute, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuven Cancer Institute, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leuven Brain Institute, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],['01/Kinderkankerfonds Leuven'],['Journal Article'],20210416,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC8073318,['NOTNLM'],"['chemotherapy', 'childhood hematology', 'leukoencephalopathy', 'neurotoxicity', 'risk classification']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:26'],"['2021/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:26 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13081939 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13081939 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Apr 16;13(8). pii: cancers13081939. doi: 10.3390/cancers13081939.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mass spectrometry (MS)-based techniques are at the forefront of PTM analysis due to their ability to detect large numbers of modified proteins with a high level of sensitivity and specificity. The low stoichiometry of modified peptides means fractionation and enrichment techniques are often performed prior to MS to improve detection yields. Immuno-based techniques remain popular, with improvements in the quality of commercially available modification-specific antibodies facilitating the detection of modified proteins with high affinity. PTM-focused studies on blood cancers have provided information on altered cellular processes, including cell signaling, apoptosis and transcriptional regulation, that contribute to the malignant phenotype. Furthermore, the mechanism of action of many blood cancer therapies, such as kinase inhibitors, involves inhibiting or modulating protein modifications. Continued optimization of protocols and techniques for PTM analysis in blood cancer will undoubtedly lead to novel insights into mechanisms of malignant transformation, proliferation, and survival, in addition to the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

One of the most popular natural products that have been studied for anticancer properties is thymoquinone (TQ). As a bioactive compound of Nigella sativa, TQ has shown anticancer activities through the inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The anticancer efficacy of TQ is being investigated in several human cancers such as pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, hepatic cancer, cervical cancer, and leukemia. Even though TQ induces apoptosis by regulating the expression of pro- apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes in many cancers, the TQ effect mechanism on such cancers is not yet fully understood. Therefore, the present review has highlighted the TQ effect mechanisms on several signaling pathways and expression of tumor suppressor genes (TSG). Data from relevant published experimental articles on TQ from 2015 to June 2020 were selected by using Google Scholar and PubMed search engines. The present study investigated the effectiveness of TQ alone or in combination with other anticancer therapeutic agents, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors on cancers, as a future anticancer therapy nominee by using nanotechnology.","['Almajali, Belal', 'Al-Jamal, Hamid Ali Nagi', 'Taib, Wan Rohani Wan', 'Ismail, Imilia', 'Johan, Muhammad Farid', 'Doolaanea, Abd Almonem', 'Ibrahim, Wisam Nabeel']","['Almajali B', 'Al-Jamal HAN', 'Taib WRW', 'Ismail I', 'Johan MF', 'Doolaanea AA', 'Ibrahim WN']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6194-2729', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3701-4006', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6344-0220', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8839-5048', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6008-1947']","['School of Biomedicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA), Terengganu 21300, Malaysia.', 'School of Biomedicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA), Terengganu 21300, Malaysia.', 'School of Biomedicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA), Terengganu 21300, Malaysia.', 'School of Biomedicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA), Terengganu 21300, Malaysia.', 'Department of Haematology, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kubang Kerian, Kelantan 16150, Malaysia.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Faculty of Pharmacy, International Islamic University Malaysia, Kuantan 25594, Malaysia.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Health sciences, QU Health, Qatar University, Doha 2713, Qatar.']",['eng'],"['FRGS/1/2019/SKK08/UNISZA/02/3 (RR330)/Fundamental Research Grant Scheme of the', 'Ministry of Education, Malaysia']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210416,Switzerland,Pharmaceuticals (Basel),"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",101238453,PMC8074212,['NOTNLM'],"['angiogenesis', 'apoptosis', 'cancers', 'nanoparticle', 'proliferation', 'thymoquinone']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:25'],"['2021/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/06 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:25 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['ph14040369 [pii]', '10.3390/ph14040369 [doi]']",epublish,Pharmaceuticals (Basel). 2021 Apr 16;14(4). pii: ph14040369. doi: 10.3390/ph14040369.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although serum anti-HTLV-1 antibody positivity is required for ATLL diagnosis, this information is often not available at the time of pathological diagnosis. Therefore, we examined whether the expression of SOX4 and p16 would be helpful for differentiating the two disease entities. We immunohistochemically examined SOX4 and p16 expression (which have been implicated in ATLL carcinogenesis) in 11 ATLL patients and 20 PTCL-NOS patients and classified them into four stages according to the percentage of positive cells. Among the ATLL cases, 8/11 (73%) were SOX4-positive, while only 2/20 (10%) PTCL-NOS cases expressed SOX4. The mean total score was 4.2 (standard deviation (SD): 0.61) in the ATLL group and 0.50 (SD: 0.46) in the PTCL-NOS group (p < 0.001). Positive expression of p16 was noted in 4/11 (36%) patients with ATLL and 3/20 (15%) patients with PTCL-NOS, with mean total scores of 1.9 (SD: 0.64) and 0.70 (SD: 0.48) in the ATLL and PTCL-NOS groups, respectively (p = 0.141). These results suggest that SOX4 may be strongly expressed in ATLL compared to PTCL-NOS cases. Therefore, it may be helpful to perform immunohistochemical staining of SOX4 when pathologists face challenges discriminating between ATLL and PTCL-NOS.","['Nasu, Atsuko', 'Gion, Yuka', 'Nishimura, Yoshito', 'Nishikori, Asami', 'Sakamoto, Misa', 'Egusa, Yuria', 'Fujita, Azusa', 'Yoshino, Tadashi', 'Sato, Yasuharu']","['Nasu A', 'Gion Y', 'Nishimura Y', 'Nishikori A', 'Sakamoto M', 'Egusa Y', 'Fujita A', 'Yoshino T', 'Sato Y']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3220-7914', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0224-7501', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1485-0527', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5234-6861']","['Division of Pathophysiology, Okayama University Graduate School of Health Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Division of Anatomic Pathology, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Division of Pathophysiology, Okayama University Graduate School of Health Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', ""Department of Medicine, John A.

Young cells are abnormally produced, replacing normal blood cells. Consequently, the person suffers problems in transporting oxygen and in fighting infections. This article proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) named LeukNet that was inspired on convolutional blocks of VGG-16, but with smaller dense layers. To define the LeukNet parameters, we evaluated different CNNs models and fine-tuning methods using 18 image datasets, with different resolution, contrast, colour and texture characteristics. We applied data augmentation operations to expand the training dataset, and the 5-fold cross-validation led to an accuracy of 98.61%. To evaluate the CNNs generalisation ability, we applied a cross-dataset validation technique. The obtained accuracies using cross-dataset experiments on three datasets were 97.04, 82.46 and 70.24%, which overcome the accuracies obtained by current state-of-the-art methods. We conclude that using the most common and deepest CNNs may not be the best choice for applications where the images to be classified differ from those used in pre-training. Additionally, the adopted cross-dataset validation approach proved to be an excellent choice to evaluate the generalisation capability of a model, as it considers the model performance on unseen data, which is paramount for CAD systems.","['Vogado, Luis', 'Veras, Rodrigo', 'Aires, Kelson', 'Araujo, Flavio', 'Silva, Romuere', 'Ponti, Moacir', 'Tavares, Joao Manuel R S']","['Vogado L', 'Veras R', 'Aires K', 'Araujo F', 'Silva R', 'Ponti M', 'Tavares JMRS']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4690-3921', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8180-4032', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3938-5089', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2824-2645', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7163-7469', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2059-9463', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7603-6526']","['Departamento de Computacao, Universidade Federal do Piaui, Teresina 64049-550, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Computacao, Universidade Federal do Piaui, Teresina 64049-550, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Computacao, Universidade Federal do Piaui, Teresina 64049-550, Brazil.', 'Curso de Bacharelado em Sistemas de Informacao, Universidade Federal do Piaui, Picos 64607-670, Brazil.', 'Curso de Bacharelado em Sistemas de Informacao, Universidade Federal do Piaui, Picos 64607-670, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Ciencias Matematicas de de Computacao, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Carlos 13566-590, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Engenharia Mecanica, Faculdade de Engenharia, Instituto de Ciencia e Inovacao em Engenharia Mecanica e Engenharia Industrial, Universidade do Porto, 4200-465 Porto, Portugal.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210424,Switzerland,Sensors (Basel),"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",101204366,PMC8123151,['NOTNLM'],"['CNN', 'blood smear images', 'fine-tuning', 'leukaemia classification']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/04 06:00,['2021/04/30 01:24'],"['2021/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:24 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['s21092989 [pii]', '10.3390/s21092989 [doi]']",epublish,Sensors (Basel). 2021 Apr 24;21(9). pii: s21092989. doi: 10.3390/s21092989.,20210503,,IM,"['*Deep Learning', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/diagnosis', 'Neural Networks, Computer']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current project aimed to collect international experience on the re-induction treatment of r/r NHL, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), risk factors associated with outcome, and to suggest treatment recommendations. Inclusion criteria were (i) refractory disease, disease progression or relapse of any NHL subtype except anaplastic large cell lymphoma, (ii) age < 18 years at initial diagnosis, (iii) diagnosis in/after January 2000. Data from 639 eligible patients were evaluable. The eight-year probability of overall survival was 34 +/- 2% with highly significant differences according to NHL subtypes: 28 +/- 3% for 254 Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia, 50 +/- 6% for 98 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, 57 +/- 8% for 41 primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphomas, 27 +/- 3% for 177 T-lymphoblastic lymphomas, 52 +/- 10% for 34 precursor-B-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas and 30 +/- 9% for 35 patients with rare NHL subtypes. Subtype-specific factors associated with survival and treatment recommendations are suggested. There were no survivors without HSCT, except in few very small subgroups. Conclusions: There is an urgent need to further improve survival in r/r NHL. The current study provides the largest real-world series, which underlines the role of HSCT and suggests treatment recommendations.","['Burkhardt, Birgit', 'Taj, Mary', 'Garnier, Nathalie',

We here reviewed the role of the surrounding bone marrow (BM) microenvironment in the persistence and transformation of pre-leukemic clones into fully leukemic cells. In this context, inflammation has been highlighted as a crucial microenvironmental stimulus able to promote genetic instability, leading to the disease manifestation. Moreover, we focused on the cross-talk between the bulk of leukemic cells with the surrounding microenvironment, which creates a ""corrupted"" BM malignant niche, unfavorable for healthy hematopoietic precursors. In detail, several cell subsets, including stromal, endothelial cells, osteoblasts and immune cells, composing the peculiar leukemic niche, can actively interact with B-ALL blasts. Through deregulated molecular pathways they are able to influence leukemia development, survival, chemoresistance, migratory and invasive properties. The concept that the pre-leukemic and leukemic cell survival and evolution are strictly dependent both on genetic lesions and on the external signals coming from the microenvironment paves the way to a new idea of dual targeting therapeutic strategy.","['Dander, Erica', 'Palmi, Chiara', ""D'Amico, Giovanna"", 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni']","['Dander E', 'Palmi C', ""D'Amico G"", 'Cazzaniga G']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2810-1263', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6163-1012', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2955-4528']","['Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Pediatric Department, University of Milano-Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, 20900 Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Pediatric Department, University of Milano-Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, 20900 Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Pediatric Department, University of Milano-Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, 20900 Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Pediatric Department, University of Milano-Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, 20900 Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['IG 2019 Id.23354/Associazione Italiana Ricerca sul Cancro', 'IG 2018 Id. 21999/Associazione Italiana Ricerca sul Cancro', '2018-0339/Fondazione Cariplo']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210423,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC8122951,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL)', 'bone marrow (BM) niche', 'microenvironment', 'pre-leukemia']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/29 06:00,['2021/04/30 01:22'],"['2021/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:22 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/29 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22094426 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22094426 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Apr 23;22(9). pii: ijms22094426. doi: 10.3390/ijms22094426.,20210528,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', '*Stem Cell Niche', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current methods for the detection of biologically active SEB rely upon its ability to cause emesis when administered to live kittens or monkeys. This technique suffers from poor reproducibility and low sensitivity and is ethically disfavored over concerns for the welfare of laboratory animals. The data presented here show the first successful implementation of an alternative method to live animal testing that utilizes SEB super-antigenic activity to induce cytokine production for specific novel cell-based assays for quantifiable detection of active SEB. Rather than using or sacrificing live animals, we found that SEB can bind to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules on Raji B-cells. We presented this SEB-MHC class II complex to specific Vbeta5.3 regions of the human T-cell line HPB-ALL, which led to a dose-dependent secretion of IL-2 that is capable of being quantified and can further detect 10 pg/mL of SEB. This new assay is 100,000 times more sensitive than the ex vivo murine splenocyte method that achieved a detection limit of 1 microg/mL. The data presented here also demonstrate that SEB induced proliferation in a dose-dependent manner for cells obtained by three different selection methods: by splenocyte cells containing 22% of CD4(+) T-cells, by CD4(+) T-cells enriched to >90% purity by negative selection methods, and by CD4(+) T-cells enriched to >95% purity by positive selection methods. The highly enriched and positively isolated CD4(+) T-cells with the lowest concentration of antigen-presenting cells (APC) (below 5%) provided higher cell proliferation than the splenocyte cells containing the highest concentration of APC cells.","['Rasooly, Reuven', 'Do, Paula', 'He, Xiaohua', 'Hernlem, Bradley']","['Rasooly R', 'Do P', 'He X', 'Hernlem B']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7865-0295'],"['Foodborne Toxin Detection & Prevention Research Unit, Western Regional Research Center, Agricultural Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Albany, CA 94710, USA.', 'Foodborne Toxin Detection & Prevention Research Unit, Western Regional Research Center, Agricultural Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Albany, CA 94710, USA.', 'Foodborne Toxin Detection & Prevention Research Unit, Western Regional Research Center, Agricultural Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Albany, CA 94710, USA.', 'Foodborne Toxin Detection & Prevention Research Unit, Western Regional Research Center, Agricultural Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Albany, CA 94710, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210423,Switzerland,Toxins (Basel),Toxins,101530765,PMC8145393,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell line', '*T-cell line', '*splenocyte', '*staphylococcal enterotoxin type B']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/07/03 06:00,['2021/04/30 01:22'],"['2021/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:22 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['toxins13050300 [pii]', '10.3390/toxins13050300 [doi]']",epublish,Toxins (Basel). 2021 Apr 23;13(5). pii: toxins13050300. doi: 10.3390/toxins13050300.,20210702,"['0 (Enterotoxins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '39424-53-8 (enterotoxin B, staphylococcal)']",IM,"['Animal Testing Alternatives/*methods', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic/*methods', 'Enterotoxins/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/drug effects', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Limit of Detection', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latter was achieved by applying both the Localization of Compact Invariant Sets and Lyapunov's stability theory. Combination of these two approaches allows us to establish sufficient conditions on the immunotherapy treatment parameter to ensure the complete eradication of the leukemia cancer cells. These conditions are given in terms of the system parameters and by performing several in silico experimentations, we formulated a protocol for the therapy application that completely eradicates the leukemia cancer cells population for different initial tumour concentrations. The formulated protocol does not dangerously increase the effector T cells population. Further, complete eradication is considered when solutions go below a finite critical value below which cancer cells cannot longer persist; i.e., one cancer cell. Numerical simulations are consistent with our analytical results.","['Valle, Paul A', 'Coria, Luis N', 'Plata, Corina']","['Valle PA', 'Coria LN', 'Plata C']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6567-1065', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1219-0433']","['Postgraduate Program in Engineering Sciences, BioMath Research Group, Tecnologico Nacional de Mexico/IT Tijuana, Blvd. Alberto Limon Padilla s/n, Mesa de Otay, Tijuana 22500, Mexico.', 'Postgraduate Program in Engineering Sciences, BioMath Research Group, Tecnologico Nacional de Mexico/IT Tijuana, Blvd. Alberto Limon Padilla s/n, Mesa de Otay, Tijuana 22500, Mexico.', 'Postgraduate Program in Engineering Sciences, BioMath Research Group, Tecnologico Nacional de Mexico/IT Tijuana, Blvd. Alberto Limon Padilla s/n, Mesa de Otay, Tijuana 22500, Mexico.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210422,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC8122842,['NOTNLM'],"['adaptive T-cell therapy', 'asymptotic stability', 'in silico', 'leukemia', 'localizing domain']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:21'],"['2021/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/20 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:21 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13092030 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13092030 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Apr 22;13(9). pii: cancers13092030. doi: 10.3390/cancers13092030.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After development of DN, patients will progress to end-stage renal disease, which is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Here, we developed early-stage diagnostic biomarkers to detect DN as a strategy for DN intervention. For the DN model, Zucker diabetic fatty rats were used for DN phenotyping. The results revealed that DN rats showed significantly increased blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine levels, accompanied by severe kidney injury, fibrosis and microstructural changes. In addition, DN rats showed significantly increased urinary excretion of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). Transcriptome analysis revealed that new DN biomarkers, such as complementary component 4b (C4b), complementary factor D (CFD), C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were identified. Furthermore, they were found in the urine of patients with DN. Since these biomarkers were detected in the urine and kidney of DN rats and urine of diabetic patients, the selected markers could be used as early diagnosis biomarkers for chronic diabetic nephropathy.","['Kim, Kyeong-Seok', 'Lee, Jin-Sol', 'Park, Jae-Hyeon', 'Lee, Eun-Young', 'Moon, Jong-Seok', 'Lee, Sang-Kyu', 'Lee, Jong-Sil', 'Kim, Jung-Hwan', 'Kim, Hyung-Sik']","['Kim KS', 'Lee JS', 'Park JH', 'Lee EY', 'Moon JS', 'Lee SK', 'Lee JS', 'Kim JH', 'Kim HS']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4513-9888', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2537-7854', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5343-701X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3942-4807', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7657-3970']","['School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Health Sciences, College of Medicine, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52727, Korea.', 'School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea.', 'School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Soonchunhyang University Cheonan Hospital, Cheonan 31151, Korea.', 'BK21 Four Project, College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University, Cheonan 31151, Korea.', 'Institute of Tissue Regeneration, College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University, Cheonan 31151, Korea.', 'Department of Integrated Biomedical Science, Soonchunhyang Institute of Medi-Bio Science, Soonchunhyang University, Cheonan 31151, Korea.', 'BK21 Plus KNU Multi-Omics Based Creative Drug Research Team, College of Pharmacy, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Institute of Health Sciences, College of Medicine, Gyeongsang National University Hospital, Jinju 52727, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Health Sciences, College of Medicine, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52727, Korea.', 'Department of Convergence Medical Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52727, Korea.', 'School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210422,Switzerland,Biomedicines,Biomedicines,101691304,PMC8146473,['NOTNLM'],"['C4b', 'CFD', 'CXCR6', 'LIF', 'RNA-sequencing', 'biomarker', 'diabetic nephropathy', 'urine']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:21'],"['2021/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:21 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['biomedicines9050457 [pii]', '10.3390/biomedicines9050457 [doi]']",epublish,Biomedicines. 2021 Apr 22;9(5). pii: biomedicines9050457. doi: 10.3390/biomedicines9050457.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the Holstein breed, we previously identified BLV resistant and susceptible bovine leukocyte antigen (BoLA)-DRB3 alleles, including BoLA-DRB3*009:02 and *014:01:01 with a low BLV proviral load (PVL), and *015:01 and *012:01 with a high PVL. Here, we evaluated the perinatal BLV transmission risk in dams with different BoLA-DRB3 alleles. BoLA-DRB3 alleles of 120 dam-calf pairs from five dairy farms in Japan were identified; their PVL was quantified using the BLV-Coordination of Common Motifs (CoCoMo)-qPCR-2 assay. Ninety-six dams were BLV-positive, and 29 gave birth to BLV-infected calves. Perinatal transmission frequency was 19% in dams with resistant alleles suppressed to a low PVL level, and 38% and 25% in dams with susceptible and neutral alleles that maintained high PVL levels, respectively. Notably, all calves with resistant alleles were BLV free, whereas 30% of calves with susceptible genes were infected. Thus, vertical transmission risk was extremely lower for dams and calves with resistant alleles compared to those with susceptible alleles. Our results can inform the development of effective BLV eradication programs under field conditions by providing necessary data to allow for optimal selection of dams for breeding.","['Borjigin, Liushiqi', 'Lo, Chieh-Wen', 'Bai, Lanlan', 'Hamada, Rania', 'Sato, Hirotaka', 'Yoneyama, Shuji', 'Yasui, Anna', 'Yasuda, Sohei', 'Yamanaka, Risa', 'Mimura, Munehito', 'Inokuma, Michihito', 'Shinozaki, Yasuo', 'Tanaka, Naoko', 'Takeshima, Shin-Nosuke', 'Aida, Yoko']","['Borjigin L', 'Lo CW', 'Bai L', 'Hamada R', 'Sato H', 'Yoneyama S', 'Yasui A', 'Yasuda S', 'Yamanaka R', 'Mimura M', 'Inokuma M', 'Shinozaki Y', 'Tanaka N', 'Takeshima SN', 'Aida Y']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2414-3247', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8321-9731', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9648-0480']","['Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Baton Zone Program, Nakamura Laboratory, RIKEN Cluster for Science, Technology and Innovation Hub, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Photonics Control Technology Team, RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Global Infectious Diseases Control Science, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Photonics Control Technology Team, RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Photonics Control Technology Team, RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Department of Animal Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, South Valley University, Qena 83523, Egypt.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Baton Zone Program, Nakamura Laboratory, RIKEN Cluster for Science, Technology and Innovation Hub, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Kenou Livestock Hygiene Service Center, Utsunomiya, Tochigi 321-0905, Japan.', 'Kumagaya Livestock Hygiene Service Center, Kumagaya, Saitama 360-0813, Japan.', 'Kumagaya Livestock Hygiene Service Center, Kumagaya, Saitama 360-0813, Japan.', 'Kumagaya Livestock Hygiene Service Center, Kumagaya, Saitama 360-0813, Japan.', 'Kumagaya Livestock Hygiene Service Center, Kumagaya, Saitama 360-0813, Japan.', 'Chuo Livestock Hygiene Service Center, Chiba 262-0011, Japan.', 'Nanbu Livestock Hygiene Service Center, Kamogawa, Chiba 296-0033, Japan.', 'Nanbu Livestock Hygiene Service Center, Kamogawa, Chiba 296-0033, Japan.', 'Department of Food and Nutrition, Jumonji University, Niiza, Saitama 352-8510, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Baton Zone Program, Nakamura Laboratory, RIKEN Cluster for Science, Technology and Innovation Hub, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Global Infectious Diseases Control Science, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.']",['eng'],['16817983/NARO Bio-oriented Technology Research Advancement Institution'],['Journal Article'],20210422,Switzerland,Pathogens,"Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",101596317,PMC8143451,['NOTNLM'],"['BoLA-DRB3 polymorphism', 'bovine leukemia virus', 'calf', 'dam', 'disease resistance', 'disease suitability', 'perinatal infection', 'proviral load']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:21'],"['2021/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:21 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['pathogens10050502 [pii]', '10.3390/pathogens10050502 [doi]']",epublish,Pathogens. 2021 Apr 22;10(5). pii: pathogens10050502. doi: 10.3390/pathogens10050502.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although these compounds are effective chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of different tumors, they are associated with high toxicity and numerous side effects. Several studies have shown that the range of platinum complexes with antitumor activity is not limited to structural analogs of cisplatin. Therefore, the development of convenient anticancer drugs that can be effectively used for the treatment of human tumors has become the main goal of most research groups in this field. In this sense, active platinum complexes without NH groups, transplatinum complexes, multinuclear complexes, cationic complexes, and several classes of palladium(II) complexes have emerged.

The association between arsenic exposure and lung diseases has been established, but underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly defined. Here we investigated the toxicology of arsenic in airway epithelium. Arsenic rapidly induced the activating transcription factor ATF3 expression through the JNK and p38 pathways. The ATF3-deficient BEAS-2B cells were relatively resistant to apoptosis upon arsenic exposure, indicating a facilitatory role of ATF3 in arsenic-induced apoptosis. We further showed that ATF3 oppositely regulated the transcription of death receptor (DR5) and Bcl2-like 1 (Bcl-xL) by directly binding to the promoter DR5 and Bcl-xL. Altogether, our findings establish ATF3 as a pro-apoptotic protein in arsenic-induced airway epithelial apoptosis through transcriptionally regulating DR5 and Bcl-xL, highlighting the potential of ATF3 as an early and sensitive biomarker for arsenic-caused lung injury.","['Shi, Qiwen', 'Hu, Bei', 'Yang, Chen', 'Zhao, Lan', 'Wu, Jing', 'Qi, Nan']","['Shi Q', 'Hu B', 'Yang C', 'Zhao L', 'Wu J', 'Qi N']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8692-1374', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1423-7709']","['Collaborative Innovation Center of Yangtze River Delta Region Green Pharmaceuticals, Institute of Engineering Biology and Health, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310014, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Yangtze River Delta Region Green Pharmaceuticals, Institute of Engineering Biology and Health, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310014, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Yangtze River Delta Region Green Pharmaceuticals, Institute of Engineering Biology and Health, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310014, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Yangtze River Delta Region Green Pharmaceuticals, Institute of Engineering Biology and Health, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310014, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Yangtze River Delta Region Green Pharmaceuticals, Institute of Engineering Biology and Health, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310014, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Yangtze River Delta Region Green Pharmaceuticals, Institute of Engineering Biology and Health, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310014, China.']",['eng'],"['81703181/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '31870864/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'LY20C080003/Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province']",['Journal Article'],20210419,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC8072958,['NOTNLM'],"['ATF3', 'Bcl-xL', 'DR5', 'apoptosis', 'arsenic']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/25 06:00,['2021/04/30 01:19'],"['2021/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:19 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22084223 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22084223 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Apr 19;22(8). pii: ijms22084223. doi: 10.3390/ijms22084223.,20210524,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factor 3)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Arsenic/*toxicity', 'Bronchi/*cytology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Epithelial Cells/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, the aberrant overexpression of NKL-code-members or the ectopical activation of non-code members have been frequently reported in lymphoid and myeloid leukemia/lymphoma, revealing the oncogenic potential of these genes in the hematopoietic compartment. Here, I provide an overview of the NKL-code in normal hematopoiesis and instance mechanisms of deregulation and oncogenic functions of selected NKL genes in hematologic cancers.

In this study, a method for intracellular thiol quantification using HPLC-fluorescence detection was developed. Thiols were derivatized with a thiol-specific fluorescence derivatization reagent, viz. ammonium 7-fluoro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole-4-sulfonate (SBD-F), followed by reversed-phase separation on an InertSustain AQ-C18 column. Six different SBD-thiols (homocysteine, cysteine, cysteinylglycine, gamma-glutamylcysteine, glutathione, and N-acetylcysteine as an internal standard) were separated within 30 min using a citric buffer (pH 3.0)/MeOH mobile phase. The calibration curves of all the SBD-thiols had strong linearity (R(2) > 0.999). Using this developed method, the thiol concentrations of human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cell samples were found to be 5.5-153 pmol/1 x 10(6) cells. The time-dependent effect of a thiol scavenger, viz. N-ethyl maleimide, on intracellular thiol concentrations was also quantified. This method is useful for elucidating the role of intracellular sulfur metabolism.","['Yamamoto, Hiroki', 'Fujiwara, Takuya', 'Funatsu, Takashi', 'Tsunoda, Makoto']","['Yamamoto H', 'Fujiwara T', 'Funatsu T', 'Tsunoda M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9656-8308', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9596-5988']","['Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.']",['eng'],"['17K08234/the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', 'JPMJCE1305/the Japan Science and Technology Agency']",['Journal Article'],20210419,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,PMC8072558,['NOTNLM'],"['cysteine', 'derivatization', 'glutathione', 'oxidative stress']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/25 06:00,['2021/04/30 01:19'],"['2021/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:19 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules26082365 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules26082365 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2021 Apr 19;26(8). pii: molecules26082365. doi: 10.3390/molecules26082365.,20210524,"['0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fluorescence', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Oxidative Stress/physiology', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The thyroid hormones, T3 and T4, bind the alphavbeta3 integrin and activate phosphorylates ERK (pERK). These tumor-promoting actions were reported in a number of malignancies, but not in CLL. METHODS: Primary cells from 22 CLL patients were verified for disease markers (CD5/CD19/CD23) and analyzed for alphavbeta3 by flow cytometry (FC), ImageStream, Western blots (WB), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in archival bone marrow (BM, n = 6) and lymph node (LN, n = 5) tissues. Selected samples (n = 8) were incubated with T3 (1-100 nM) or T4 (0.1-10 microM) for 30 min, and the expression levels of alphavbeta3, pERK and PCNA (cell proliferation marker) were determined (WB). RESULTS: alphavbeta3 was detected on the membrane of circulating CLL cells and in the BM but not in the LN. T3 and T4 enhanced alphavbeta3 protein levels in primary CLL cells. Similarly, pERK and PCNA were rapidly induced in response to T3 and T4 exposure. CONCLUSIONS: alphavbeta3 integrin is expressed on primary CLL cells and is induced by thyroid hormones. We further suggest that the hormones are mitogenic in these cells, presumably via alphavbeta3-mediated signaling.","['Abadi, Uri', 'Weisz, Avivit', 'Kidron, Dvora', 'Katzav, Aviva', 'Hercbergs, Aleck', 'Davis, Paul J', 'Ellis, Martin H', 'Ashur-Fabian, Osnat']","['Abadi U', 'Weisz A', 'Kidron D', 'Katzav A', 'Hercbergs A', 'Davis PJ', 'Ellis MH', 'Ashur-Fabian O']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6794-4917', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8624-3182']","['Translational Hemato-Oncology Laboratory, Hematology Institute and Blood Bank Meir Medical Center, Kfar-Saba 44821, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel.', 'Translational Hemato-Oncology Laboratory, Hematology Institute and Blood Bank Meir Medical Center, Kfar-Saba 44821, Israel.', 'Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology, Meir Medical Center, Kfar Saba 44821, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology, Meir Medical Center, Kfar Saba 44821, Israel.', 'Radiation Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Albany Medical College, Albany, NY 12208, USA.', 'Translational Hemato-Oncology Laboratory, Hematology Institute and Blood Bank Meir Medical Center, Kfar-Saba 44821, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel.', 'Translational Hemato-Oncology Laboratory, Hematology Institute and Blood Bank Meir Medical Center, Kfar-Saba 44821, Israel.', 'Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210419,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,PMC8073405,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'thyroid hormone', 'alphavbeta3 integrin']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:19'],"['2021/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:19 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm10081766 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm10081766 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2021 Apr 19;10(8). pii: jcm10081766. doi: 10.3390/jcm10081766.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we investigated the effect of metformin, a medication that also acts as an inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and MCL-1 inhibitor S63845 in AML cell lines NB4, KG1 and chemoresistant KG1A cells. The impact of compounds was evaluated using fluorescence-based metabolic flux analysis, assessment of mitochondrial Deltapsi and cellular ROS, trypan blue exclusion, Annexin V-PI and XTT tests for cell death and cytotoxicity estimations, also RT-qPCR and Western blot for gene and protein expression. Treatment with metformin resulted in significant downregulation of OXPHOS; however, increase in glycolysis was observed in NB4 and KG1A cells. In contrast, treatment with S63845 slightly increased the rate of OXPHOS in KG1 and KG1A cells, although it profoundly diminished the rate of glycolysis. Generally, combined treatment had stronger inhibitory effects on cellular metabolism and ATP levels. Furthermore, results revealed that treatment with metformin, S63845 and their combinations induced apoptosis in AML cells. In addition, level of apoptotic cell death correlated with cellular ROS induction, as well as with downregulation of tumor suppressor protein MYC. In summary, we show that modulation of redox-stress could have a potential anticancer activity in AML cells.","['Valiuliene, Giedre', 'Vitkeviciene, Aida', 'Skliute, Giedre', 'Borutinskaite, Veronika', 'Navakauskiene, Ruta']","['Valiuliene G', 'Vitkeviciene A', 'Skliute G', 'Borutinskaite V', 'Navakauskiene R']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9347-5333', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1077-9439']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Sauletekio av. 7, LT-01257 Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Sauletekio av. 7, LT-01257 Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Sauletekio av. 7, LT-01257 Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Sauletekio av. 7, LT-01257 Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Sauletekio av. 7, LT-01257 Vilnius, Lithuania.']",['eng'],['S-SEN-20-2/Research Council of Lithuania'],['Journal Article'],20210415,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,PMC8071510,['NOTNLM'],"['MCL-1 inhibitor S63845', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'metformin', 'reactive oxygen species (ROS)']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/25 06:00,['2021/04/30 01:18'],"['2021/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:18 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules26082303 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules26082303 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2021 Apr 15;26(8). pii: molecules26082303. doi: 10.3390/molecules26082303.,20210524,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (S63845)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '9100L32L2N (Metformin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Metformin/*therapeutic use', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Thiophenes/therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Glomerular diseases, in the form of paraneoplastic glomerulopathies and acute kidney injury with various degrees of proteinuria due to specific lymphomatous interstitial and/or glomerular infiltration, are two major renal complications observed in the lymphoid disorder setting. However, other hematologic neoplasms, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, thymoma, myeloproliferative disorders, Castleman disease and hemophagocytic syndrome, have also been associated with the development of kidney lesions. These renal disorders require prompt recognition by the clinician, due to the need to implement specific treatment, depending on the chemotherapy regimen, to decrease the risk of subsequent chronic kidney disease. In the context of renal disease related to hematologic malignancies, renal biopsy remains crucial for accurate pathological diagnosis, with the aim of optimizing medical care for these patients.

The prognostic value of T-LBL immunological subtypes is still a matter of controversy. (2) Methods: We re-evaluated 49 subsequent adult T-LBL patients treated according to the German Multicenter Study Group for Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GMALL) protocols, 05/93 (n = 20) and T-LBL 1/2004 (n = 29), 85.7% of which achieved complete remission (CR). (3) Results: The 5/10-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 62%/59% and 48%/43%, respectively. In 96% of patients, flow cytometry analyses defining the WHO 2008 immunophenotypes were available. Cortical, early/pro-T/CD2(-), early/pre-T/CD2(+), and mature subtypes were identified in 59.5%, 19%, 15%, and 6.5% of patients, respectively. Overall, 20% of patients had the early T-cell precursor (ETP)-LBL immunophenotype, as proposed by the WHO 2017 classification. For the early/pro-T/CD2(-) subtype, the five-year OS and EFS were 13% and 13%, while for all the other, non-pro-T subtypes, they were 69% and 67%. By multivariate analysis, only CD2(-) status and age > 35 years emerged as strong, independent factors influencing OS and EFS, while the risk of CR failure was influenced by age only (>35 years). (4) Conclusions: ETP was non-significant for OS, unless an ultra-high-risk pro-T/CD2(-) subtype was concerned.","['Ostrowska, Beata', 'Rymkiewicz, Grzegorz', 'Chechlinska, Magdalena', 'Blachnio, Katarzyna', 'Domanska-Czyz, Katarzyna', 'Bystydzienski, Zbigniew', 'Romejko-Jarosinska, Joanna', 'Borysiuk, Anita', 'Rybski, Sebastian', 'Michalski, Wojciech', 'Walewski, Jan']","['Ostrowska B', 'Rymkiewicz G', 'Chechlinska M', 'Blachnio K', 'Domanska-Czyz K', 'Bystydzienski Z', 'Romejko-Jarosinska J', 'Borysiuk A', 'Rybski S', 'Michalski W', 'Walewski J']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7318-1031', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3478-8014', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6139-1234', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4247-2674']","['Department of Lymphoid Malignancies, Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, 02-781 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Flow Cytometry Laboratory, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Diagnostics, Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, 02-781 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, 02-781 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Flow Cytometry Laboratory, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Diagnostics, Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, 02-781 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Lymphoid Malignancies, Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, 02-781 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Flow Cytometry Laboratory, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Diagnostics, Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, 02-781 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Lymphoid Malignancies, Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, 02-781 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Flow Cytometry Laboratory, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Diagnostics, Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, 02-781 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department, of Mathematical Oncology, Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, 02-781 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department, of Mathematical Oncology, Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, 02-781 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Lymphoid Malignancies, Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, 02-781 Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210415,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC8071379,['NOTNLM'],"['CD2', 'T-ALL/LBL', 'T-LBL', 'flow cytometry', 'lymphoblastic lymphoma']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:17'],"['2021/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:17 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13081911 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13081911 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Apr 15;13(8). pii: cancers13081911. doi: 10.3390/cancers13081911.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Minimal disease studies in childhood non-Hodgkin lymphomas are challenged by stratified treatment in different subtypes, high cure rates, low patient numbers, limited initial tumor material, and early progression. Current clinical applications differ between the subtypes. A prognostic value of minimal disseminated disease (MDD) could not yet be clearly established for lymphoblastic lymphoma using flow cytometry and PCR-based methods for T-cell receptor (TCR) or immunoglobulin (IG) rearrangements. MYC-IGH fusion sequences or IG rearrangements enable minimal disease detection in Burkitt lymphoma and -leukemia. An additional prognostic value of MDD in Burkitt lymphoma and early MRD in Burkitt leukemia is implicated by single studies with risk-adapted therapy. MDD and MRD determined by PCR for ALK-fusion transcripts are independent prognostic parameters for patients with ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). They are introduced in routine clinical practice and used for patient stratification in clinical studies. Early MRD might serve as an endpoint for clinical trials and for guiding individual therapy. Validation of MDD and MRD as prognostic parameters is required for all subtypes but ALCL.

This study developed and subsequently applied a simulation program based on clinical reasoning for AML to improve the learning outcomes and describe the learning experience for nursing students. Following a mixed-methods framework, the program's effects on students' knowledge were quantitatively measured, while their learning experience was qualitatively measured using self-reflection through journal writing. Differences in the pre- and post-scores between the experimental and control groups were statistically significant for theoretical knowledge and clinical performance. In addition, content analysis of both groups' journals revealed three themes: (1) transformation into a self-directed learner for understanding the clinical situation, (2) increased awareness of clinical reasoning ability, and (3) embodiment of the clinical reasoning process. Standardizing the developed program's scenarios prompted the participants' compliance and engagement, and effectively achieved the learning outcomes. This simulation program aided the assessment of nursing intervention's effectiveness and suggested objective criteria according to clinical reasoning. Similar programs involving other clinical cases, not exclusive to leukemia, should be developed and evaluated.","['Jang, Aeri', 'Song, Miok', 'Kim, Suhyun']","['Jang A', 'Song M', 'Kim S']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2193-4980', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9170-7081', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3272-114X']","['Department of Nursing, Nambu University, Gwangju 62271, Korea.', 'Department of Nursing, Nambu University, Gwangju 62271, Korea.', 'Department of Nursing, Nambu University, Gwangju 62271, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210415,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,PMC8071219,['NOTNLM'],"['*clinical reasoning', '*high fidelity simulation training', '*leukemia', '*nursing education']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/22 06:00,['2021/04/30 01:17'],"['2021/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:17 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/22 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph18084190 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph18084190 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2021 Apr 15;18(8). pii: ijerph18084190. doi: 10.3390/ijerph18084190.,20210521,,IM,"['Clinical Competence', 'Clinical Reasoning', '*Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', '*Students, Nursing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IDO1-expressing monocytic MDSCs were shown to accumulate in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and to suppress T cell activity and induce suppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) in vitro. In the Emicro-TCL1 mouse model of CLL, we observed a strong upregulation of IDO1 in monocytic and granulocytic MDSCs, and a significantly increased Kyn to Trp serum ratio. To explore the potential of IDO1 as a therapeutic target for CLL, we treated mice after adoptive transfer of Emicro-TCL1 leukemia cells with the IDO1 modulator 1-methyl-D-tryptophan (1-MT) which resulted in a minor reduction in leukemia development which disappeared over time. 1-MT treatment further led to a partial rescue of the immune cell changes that are induced with CLL development. Similarly, treatment of leukemic mice with the clinically investigated IDO1 inhibitor epacadostat reduced the frequency of Tregs and initially delayed CLL development slightly, an effect that was, however, lost at later time points. In sum, despite the observed upregulation of IDO1 in CLL, its inhibition is not sufficient to control leukemia development in the Emicro-TCL1 adoptive transfer model.","['Ozturk, Selcen', 'Kalter, Verena', 'Roessner, Philipp M', 'Sunbul, Murat', 'Seiffert, Martina']","['Ozturk S', 'Kalter V', 'Roessner PM', 'Sunbul M', 'Seiffert M']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3826-0871', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7061-5690', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5155-663X']","['Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg University, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Eurostars project E!10865 - LeukeMab (01QE1716)/Horizon 2020 Framework Programme', '13R/2018/German Jose Carreras Foundation']",['Journal Article'],20210415,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC8071295,['NOTNLM'],"['Emicro-TCL1', 'IDO1', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'epacadostat', 'immunotherapy']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:17'],"['2021/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/01 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:17 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13081899 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13081899 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Apr 15;13(8). pii: cancers13081899. doi: 10.3390/cancers13081899.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary objective of this study was to develop a questionnaire for screening patients with these blood disorders who might benefit from a specialized consultation for possible recognition of the disease as an occupational disease. The study included 205 subjects (male gender, 67.3%; mean age, 60 years; NHL, 78.5%). The questionnaire performed very satisfactorily in identifying the exposures most frequently retained by experts for their potential involvement in the occurrence of NHL. Its sensitivity and specificity in relation to the final expertise were 96% and 96% for trichloroethylene, 85% and 82% for benzene, 78% and 87% for solvents other than trichloroethylene and dichloromethane, 87% and 95% for pesticides, respectively. Overall, 15% of the subjects were invited to ask National Social Insurance for compensation as occupational disease. These declarations concerned exposure to pesticides (64%), solvents (trichloroethylene: 29%; benzene: 18%; other than chlorinated solvents: 18%) and sometimes multiple exposures.

With energy drinks becoming a worldwide phenomenon, the biological effects of these beverages must be evaluated in order to fully comprehend the potential impact of these products on the health due to the fact nutrition is closely related to science since the population consumes food to prevent certain diseases. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the biological effects of taurine, glucose, classic Red Bull((R)) and sugar-free Red Bull((R)) in order to check the food safety and the nutraceutical potential of these compounds, characterising different endpoints: (i) Toxicology, antitoxicology, genotoxicology and life expectancy assays were performed in the Drosophila melanogaster model organism; (ii) The in vitro chemopreventive activity of testing compounds was determined by assessing their cytotoxicity, the proapoptotic DNA-damage capability to induce internucleosomal fragmentation, the strand breaks activity and the modulator role on the methylation status of genomic repetitive sequences of HL-60 promyelocytic cells. Whereas none tested compounds showed toxic or genotoxic effect, all tested compounds exerted antitoxic and antigenotoxic activity in Drosophila.

The only curative option for R/R AML patients is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) which is only applicable in a fraction of patients due to the scarce efficacy and high toxicity of salvage regimens. Recently, a number of targeted agents with relatively favorable toxicity profiles have been explored in clinical trials for R/R AML patients. The Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax, in combination with hypomethylating agents or low dose cytarabine, has produced impressive results for newly diagnosed AML, while its role in R/R disease is not well defined yet. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical outcomes of 47 R/R AML patients treated with venetoclax-based regimens between March 2018 and December 2020 at our institution. Overall, we report a composite complete response rate of 55% with an overall acceptable toxicity profile. Outcomes were particularly favorable for NPM1 mutated patients, unlike for FLT3-ITD positive patients irrespective of NPM1 status. For patients treated with intention to transplant, the procedure could be finally performed in 54%. These findings suggest a role for venetoclax-based regimens in R/R AML patients and support the design of prospective studies.","['Piccini, Matteo', 'Pilerci, Sofia', 'Merlini, Marta', 'Grieco, Pietro', 'Scappini, Barbara', 'Bencini, Sara', 'Peruzzi, Benedetta', 'Caporale, Roberto', 'Signori, Leonardo', 'Pancani, Fabiana', 'Vannucchi, Alessandro Maria', 'Gianfaldoni, Giacomo']","['Piccini M', 'Pilerci S', 'Merlini M', 'Grieco P', 'Scappini B', 'Bencini S', 'Peruzzi B', 'Caporale R', 'Signori L', 'Pancani F', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Gianfaldoni G']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9653-4976', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3360-572X']","['SOD Ematologia, Universita degli Studi di Firenze e Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, 50139 Firenze, Italy.', 'Scuola di Specializzazione in Ematologia, Universita degli Studi di Firenze, 50139 Firenze, Italy.', 'Scuola di Specializzazione in Ematologia, Universita degli Studi di Firenze, 50139 Firenze, Italy.', 'SOD Ematologia, Ospedale San Donato, Azienda Usl Toscana Sud-Est, 20121 Milano, Italy.', 'SOD Ematologia, Universita degli Studi di Firenze e Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, 50139 Firenze, Italy.', 'SOD Centro Diagnostico di Citofluorimetria e Immunoterapia, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, 50139 Firenze, Italy.', 'SOD Centro Diagnostico di Citofluorimetria e Immunoterapia, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, 50139 Firenze, Italy.', 'SOD Centro Diagnostico di Citofluorimetria e Immunoterapia, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, 50139 Firenze, Italy.', 'Centro di Ricerca e Innovazione per le Malattie Mieloproliferative (CRIMM), Universita degli Studi e Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, 50139 Firenze, Italy.', 'Centro di Ricerca e Innovazione per le Malattie Mieloproliferative (CRIMM), Universita degli Studi e Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, 50139 Firenze, Italy.', 'SOD Ematologia, Universita degli Studi di Firenze e Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, 50139 Firenze, Italy.', 'Centro di Ricerca e Innovazione per le Malattie Mieloproliferative (CRIMM), Universita degli Studi e Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, 50139 Firenze, Italy.', 'SOD Ematologia, Universita degli Studi di Firenze e Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, 50139 Firenze, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210414,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,PMC8070927,['NOTNLM'],"['chemoresistant', 'leukemia', 'venetoclax']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:14'],"['2021/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/31 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:14 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm10081684 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm10081684 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2021 Apr 14;10(8). pii: jcm10081684. doi: 10.3390/jcm10081684.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PMPs inherit a myriad of proteins and small RNAs from the parental platelets, which in turn can be transferred to cancer cells following internalization. However, the exact effect this may have in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is unknown. In this study, we sought to investigate whether PMPs could transfer their contents to the THP-1 cell line and if this could change the biological behavior of the recipient cells. Using acridine orange stained PMPs, we demonstrated that PMPs were internalized by THP-1 cells, which resulted in increased levels of miR-125a, miR-125b, and miR-199. In addition, co-incubation with PMPs protected THP-1 and primary AML cells against daunorubicin-induced cell death. We also showed that PMPs impaired cell growth, partially inhibited cell cycle progression, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and induced differentiation toward macrophages in THP-1 cells. Our results suggest that this altering of cell phenotype, in combination with decrease in cell activity may offer resistance to daunorubicin-induced apoptosis, as serum starvation also yielded a lower frequency of dead and apoptotic cells when treated with daunorubicin.","['Cacic, Daniel', 'Reikvam, Hakon', 'Nordgard, Oddmund', 'Meyer, Peter', 'Hervig, Tor']","['Cacic D', 'Reikvam H', 'Nordgard O', 'Meyer P', 'Hervig T']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3298-2101', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5439-8411', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9441-253X']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Stavanger University Hospital, 4068 Stavanger, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Stavanger University Hospital, 4068 Stavanger, Norway.', 'Department of Chemistry, Bioscience and Environmental Engineering, University of Stavanger, 4036 Stavanger, Norway.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Stavanger University Hospital, 4068 Stavanger, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Laboratory of Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Haugesund Hospital, 5528 Haugesund, Norway.']",['eng'],"['na/Helse Vest Regionalt Helseforetak', 'na/Bergen Stem Cell Consortium']",['Journal Article'],20210414,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC8070730,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myelogenous leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'microparticles', 'platelets']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:13'],"['2021/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:13 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13081870 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13081870 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Apr 14;13(8). pii: cancers13081870. doi: 10.3390/cancers13081870.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If these changes affect key RNA molecules for mRNA translation, such as transfer RNA, they can have important consequences for cell transformation. TRIT1 is the enzyme responsible for the hypermodification of adenosine 37 in the anticodon region of human tRNAs containing serine and selenocysteine. Herein, we show that TRIT1 undergoes gene amplification-associated overexpression in cancer cell lines and primary samples of small-cell lung cancer. From growth and functional standpoints, the induced depletion of TRIT1 expression in amplified cells reduces their tumorigenic potential and downregulates the selenoprotein transcripts. We observed that TRIT1-amplified cells are sensitive to arsenic trioxide, a compound that regulates selenoproteins, whereas reduction of TRIT1 levels confers loss of sensitivity to the drug. Overall, our results indicate a role for TRIT1 as a small-cell lung cancer-relevant gene that, when undergoing gene amplification-associated activation, can be targeted with the differentiation agent arsenic trioxide.","['Coll-SanMartin, Laia', 'Davalos, Veronica', 'Pineyro, David', 'Rossello-Tortella, Margalida', 'Bueno-Costa, Alberto', 'Setien, Fernando', 'Villanueva, Alberto', 'Granada, Isabel', 'Ruiz-Xiviller, Neus', 'Kotter, Annika', 'Helm, Mark', 'Yokota, Jun', 'Kawabata-Iwakawa, Reika', 'Kohno, Takashi', 'Esteller, Manel']","['Coll-SanMartin L', 'Davalos V', 'Pineyro D', 'Rossello-Tortella M', 'Bueno-Costa A', 'Setien F', 'Villanueva A', 'Granada I', 'Ruiz-Xiviller N', 'Kotter A', 'Helm M', 'Yokota J', 'Kawabata-Iwakawa R', 'Kohno T', 'Esteller M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3109-9432', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4077-5137', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5633-3339', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8700-2540', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0154-0928', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3504-1393']","['Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), 08916 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), 08916 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), 08916 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), 08916 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Germans Trias i Pujol Health Science Research Institute (IGTP), 08916 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), 08916 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), 08916 Barcelona, Spain.', ""Group of Chemoresistance and Predictive Factors, Subprogram Against Cancer Therapeutic Resistance (ProCURE), Oncobell Program, IDIBELL, Institut Catala d'Oncologia (ICO), L'Hospitalet del Llobregat, 08908 Barcelona, Spain."", 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), 08916 Barcelona, Spain.', ""Cytogenetics Platform, Hematology Laboratory Service, Institut Catala d'Oncologia (ICO)-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), 08916 Barcelona, Spain."", 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), 08916 Barcelona, Spain.', ""Cytogenetics Platform, Hematology Laboratory Service, Institut Catala d'Oncologia (ICO)-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), 08916 Barcelona, Spain."", 'Institute of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, Johannes Gutenberg-Universitat Mainz, 55128 Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, Johannes Gutenberg-Universitat Mainz, 55128 Mainz, Germany.', 'Division of Genome Biology, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.', 'Division of Genome Biology, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.', 'Division of Integrated Oncology Research, Gunma University Initiative for Advanced Research, Gunma 371-8511, Japan.', 'Division of Genome Biology, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.', 'Division of Translational Genomics, Exploratory Oncology Research and Clinical Trial Center, National Cancer Center, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), 08916 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), 08010 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Physiological Sciences Department, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Barcelona (UB), 08036 Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['RTI2018-094049-B-I00/Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades']",['Journal Article'],20210414,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC8070726,['NOTNLM'],"['RNA modifications', 'TRIT1', 'gene amplification', 'selenoproteins', 'small-cell lung cancer', 'transfer RNA']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:13'],"['2021/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/06 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:13 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13081869 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13081869 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Apr 14;13(8). pii: cancers13081869. doi: 10.3390/cancers13081869.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resulting imides were functionalized with alkanolamine or alkylamine side chains and subsequently converted to their hydrochlorides. The structures of the obtained compounds were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR and by ESI MS spectral analysis. Their cytotoxicity was evaluated in human leukemia (K562, MOLT4), cervical cancer (HeLa), and normal endothelial cells (HUVEC). The majority of derivatives exhibited high to moderate cytotoxicity and induced apoptosis in K562 cells. Microarray gene profiling demonstrated upregulation of proapoptotic genes involved in receptor-mediated and mitochondrial cell death pathways as well as antiapoptotic genes involved in NF-kB signaling.

Indeed, the overall survival accounts for ~70% but still ~30% of pediatric patients experience relapse, with poor response to conventional chemotherapy. Thus, there is an urgent need to improve diagnosis and treatment efficacy prediction in the context of this disease. Nowadays, in the era of high throughput techniques, AML has emerged as an extremely heterogeneous disease from a genetic point of view. Different subclones characterized by specific molecular profiles display different degrees of susceptibility to conventional treatments. In this review, we describe in detail this genetic heterogeneity of pediatric AML and how it is linked to relapse in terms of clonal evolution. We highlight some innovative tools to characterize minor subclones that could help to enhance diagnosis and a preclinical model suitable for drugs screening. The final ambition of research is represented by targeted therapy, which could improve the prognosis of pediatric AML patients, as well as to limit the side toxicity of current treatments.","['Bertuccio, Salvatore Nicola', 'Anselmi, Laura', 'Masetti, Riccardo', 'Lonetti, Annalisa', 'Cerasi, Sara', 'Polidori, Sara', 'Serravalle, Salvatore', 'Pession, Andrea']","['Bertuccio SN', 'Anselmi L', 'Masetti R', 'Lonetti A', 'Cerasi S', 'Polidori S', 'Serravalle S', 'Pession A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1264-057X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3944-3090', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0379-9562']","['Pediatric Oncology and Hematology ""Lalla Seragnoli"", Pediatric Unit-Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences (DIMEC), University of Bologna, 40126 Bologna, Italy.', 'Pediatric Oncology and Hematology ""Lalla Seragnoli"", Pediatric Unit-Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences (DIMEC), University of Bologna, 40126 Bologna, Italy.', 'Pediatric Oncology and Hematology ""Lalla Seragnoli"", Pediatric Unit-IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, 40126 Bologna, Italy.', 'Pediatric Oncology and Hematology ""Lalla Seragnoli"", Pediatric Unit-IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Pediatric Oncology and Hematology ""Lalla Seragnoli"", Pediatric Unit-IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Pediatric Oncology and Hematology ""Lalla Seragnoli"", Pediatric Unit-IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Pediatric Oncology and Hematology ""Lalla Seragnoli"", Pediatric Unit-IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, 40138 Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210421,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC8122278,['NOTNLM'],"['NGS', 'clonal evolution', 'pediatric AML', 'target therapy']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:11'],"['2021/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:11 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13091995 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13091995 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Apr 21;13(9). pii: cancers13091995. doi: 10.3390/cancers13091995.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent comprehensive genomic analyses have revealed the genomic landscape. One of the important findings of genomic alterations in ATLL is that almost all alterations are subclonal, suggesting that therapeutic strategies targeting a genomic alteration will result in partial effects. Among the identified alterations, genes involved in T-cell receptor signaling and immune escape mechanisms, such as PLCG1, CARD11, and PD-L1 (also known as CD274), are characteristic of ATLL alterations. From a geographic perspective, ATLL patients in Caribbean islands tend to be younger than those in Japan and the landscape differs between the two areas. Additionally, young Japanese ATLL patients frequently have CD28 fusions, compared with unselected Japanese cases. From a clinical perspective, PD-L1 amplification is an independent prognostic factor among every subtype of ATLL case. Recently, genomic analysis using deep sequencing identified a pre-ATLL clone with ATLL-common mutations in HTLV-1 carriers before development, indicating that genomic analysis can stratify cases based on the risks of development and mortality. In addition to genomic alterations, targetable super-enhancers have been identified in ATLL. These data can be leveraged to improve the prognosis of ATLL.","['Yoshida, Noriaki', 'Miyoshi, Hiroaki', 'Ohshima, Koichi']","['Yoshida N', 'Miyoshi H', 'Ohshima K']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7001-0106'],"['Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume 830-0011, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Studies, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima 732-0815, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume 830-0011, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume 830-0011, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210409,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC8068906,['NOTNLM'],"['adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'genomic alterations', 'predictive markers', 'therapeutic targets']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:10'],"['2021/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/01 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:10 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13081801 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13081801 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Apr 9;13(8). pii: cancers13081801. doi: 10.3390/cancers13081801.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike the well-known sulphonamides, esters are mainly used as convenient intermediates in a synthesis. Here, we present the first in-depth investigation of quinazoline sulfonates. A small series of derivatives were synthesized and tested for their anticancer activity. Based on their structural similarity, these compounds resemble tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the p53 reactivator CP-31398. Their biological activity profile, however, was more related to sulphonamides because there was a strong cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Further investigation revealed a multitargeted mechanism of the action that corresponded to the p53 protein status in the cell. Although the compounds expressed a high submicromolar activity against leukemia and colon cancers, pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma were also susceptible. Apoptosis and autophagy were confirmed as the cell death modes that corresponded with the inhibition of metabolic activity and the activation of the p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways. Namely, there was a strong activation of the p62 protein and GADD44. Other proteins such as cdc2 were also expressed at a higher level. Moreover, the classical caspase-dependent pathway in leukemia was observed at a lower concentration, which again confirmed a multitargeted mechanism. It can therefore be concluded that the sulfonates of quinazolines can be regarded as promising scaffolds for developing anticancer agents.","['Malarz, Katarzyna', 'Mularski, Jacek', 'Kuczak, Michal', 'Mrozek-Wilczkiewicz, Anna', 'Musiol, Robert']","['Malarz K', 'Mularski J', 'Kuczak M', 'Mrozek-Wilczkiewicz A', 'Musiol R']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4283-3126', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1502-0421', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7577-3011', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6219-7369']","['A.

Because targeting protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) was demonstrated to eliminate cancer stem cells (CSCs) in solid tumors, we evaluated the efficacy of PKCdelta inhibition in combination with TKIs for CML cells. We observed that inhibition of PKCdelta by a pharmacological inhibitor, by gene silencing, or by using K562 CML cells expressing dominant-negative (DN) or constitutively active (CA) PKCdelta isoforms clearly points to PKCdelta as a regulator of the expression of the stemness regulator BMI1. As a consequence, inhibition of PKCdelta impaired clonogenicity and cell proliferation for leukemic cells. PKCdelta targeting in K562 and LAMA-84 CML cell lines clearly enhanced the apoptotic response triggered by any TKI. A strong synergism was observed for apoptosis induction through an increase in caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation and significantly decreased expression of the Bcl-xL Bcl-2 family member. Inhibition of PKCdelta did not modify BCR-ABL phosphorylation but acted downstream of the oncogene by downregulating BMI1 expression, decreasing clonogenicity. PKCdelta inhibition interfered with the clonogenicity of primary CML CD34(+) and BCR-ABL-transduced healthy CD34(+) cells as efficiently as any TKI while it did not affect differentiation of healthy CD34(+) cells. LTC-IC experiments pinpointed that PKCdelta inhibition strongly decreased the progenitors/LSCs frequency. All together, these results demonstrate that targeting of PKCdelta in combination with a conventional TKI could be a new therapeutic opportunity to affect for CML cells.","['Muselli, Fabien', 'Mourgues, Lucas', 'Morcos, Rita', 'Rochet, Nathalie', 'Nebout, Marielle', 'Guerci-Bresler, Agnes', 'Faller, Douglas V', 'William, Robert M', 'Mhaidly, Rana', 'Verhoeyen, Els', 'Legros, Laurence', 'Peyron, Jean-Francois', 'Mary, Didier']","['Muselli F', 'Mourgues L', 'Morcos R', 'Rochet N', 'Nebout M', 'Guerci-Bresler A', 'Faller DV', 'William RM', 'Mhaidly R', 'Verhoeyen E', 'Legros L', 'Peyron JF', 'Mary D']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6654-9472', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2454-3478', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9224-5491', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4136-3556']","[""Universite Cote d'Azur, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm) U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), 06204 Nice, France."", ""Universite Cote d'Azur, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm) U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), 06204 Nice, France."", ""Universite Cote d'Azur, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm) U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), 06204 Nice, France."", ""Institut de Biologie Valrose, Universite Cote d'Azur, CNRS UMR 7277, Inserm U1091, CEDEX 02, 06107 Nice, France."", ""Universite Cote d'Azur, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm) U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), 06204 Nice, France."", 'Hematology Department, University Hospital, 54035 Nancy, France.', 'Oncology Clinical Research, Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc., 40 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm) U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), 06204 Nice, France."", 'Equipe labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, 06204 Nice, France.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm) U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), 06204 Nice, France."", 'Equipe labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, 06204 Nice, France.', 'CIRI-International Center for Infectiology Research, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR5308, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, 69007 Lyon, France.', 'Department of Hematology, AP-HP Paul Brousse, 94800 Villejuif, France.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm) U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), 06204 Nice, France."", ""Universite Cote d'Azur, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm) U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), 06204 Nice, France.""]",['eng'],['2018-00085/FiLMC'],['Journal Article'],20210402,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC8038300,['NOTNLM'],"['BMI1', 'PKCdelta', 'apoptosis', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'leukemic stem cells', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:09'],"['2021/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/25 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:09 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13071693 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13071693 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Apr 2;13(7). pii: cancers13071693. doi: 10.3390/cancers13071693.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, infections-related either due to lymphodepletion or the CAR-T cell therapy itself-can result in severe and potentially life-threatening complications, while side effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) might complicate differential diagnosis. Sixty-seven dosings of CAR-T cells in sixty adult patients with NHL (85%) and ALL (15%) receiving CAR-T cell therapy were assessed for infectious complications. Almost two-thirds of patients (61%) developed fever following lymphodepletion and CAR-T cell dosing. Microbiological or radiological findings were observed in 25% of all cases (bacterial 12%, viral 5%, fungal 8%). Inpatient infections were associated with more lines of therapy and more severe CRS. However, overall serious complications were rare after CAR-T therapy, with one patient dying of infection.

Fast and suitable identification and treatment are crucial in these heavily pretreated and immunocompromised patients. In most cases infectious complications are manageable.

In myeloid neoplasms, CD9 is involved in the altered interactions between leukemic and stromal cells. However, apart from its role in CD34(+) progenitors and myeloid and megakaryocytic differentiation, its function in normal and leukemic pluripotent cells has not yet been determined. Very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) are promising pluripotent stem cells found in adult tissues that can be developed for safe and efficient regenerative medicine. VSELs express different surface receptors of the highest importance in cell functioning, including CD9, and can be effectively mobilized after organ injury or in leukemic patients. In the present study, we observed that CD9 is among the most expressed receptors in VSELs under steady-state conditions; however, once the VSELs are expanded, CD9(+) VSELs decrease and are more apoptotic. CD9(-) VSELs had no proliferative improvement in vitro compared to those that were CD9(+). Interestingly, the addition of SDF-1 induced CD9 expression on the surface of VSELs, as observed by flow cytometry, and improved their migration. In addition, we observed, in the phenotypically identical VSELs present in the peripheral blood of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, compared to healthy subjects, a significantly higher number of CD9(+) cells. However, in their hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) counterparts, the expression remained comparable. These results indicate that, likewise, in progenitors and mature cells, CD9 may play an important function in normal and malignant VSELs. This could explain the refractoriness observed by some groups of expanded stem cells to repairing efficiently damaged tissue when used as a source in cell therapies. Understanding the function of the CD9 receptor in normal and malignant CD34(+) and VSELs, along with its relationship with the CXCR4/SDF-1 pathway, will enable advances in the field of adult pluripotent cell usage in regenerative medicine and in their role in leukemia.","['Lahlil, Rachid', 'Scrofani, Maurice', 'Aries, Anne', 'Henon, Philippe', 'Drenou, Bernard']","['Lahlil R', 'Scrofani M', 'Aries A', 'Henon P', 'Drenou B']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2966-6386', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2175-6785']","[""Institut de Recherche en Hematologie et Transplantation (IRHT), Hopital du Hasenrain, 87 Avenue d'Altkirch, 68100 Mulhouse, France."", ""Institut de Recherche en Hematologie et Transplantation (IRHT), Hopital du Hasenrain, 87 Avenue d'Altkirch, 68100 Mulhouse, France."", ""Institut de Recherche en Hematologie et Transplantation (IRHT), Hopital du Hasenrain, 87 Avenue d'Altkirch, 68100 Mulhouse, France."", 'CellProthera, 12, rue du Parc, 68100 Mulhouse, France.', ""Institut de Recherche en Hematologie et Transplantation (IRHT), Hopital du Hasenrain, 87 Avenue d'Altkirch, 68100 Mulhouse, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Groupe Hospitalier de la Region de Mulhouse Sud-Alsace, Hopital E.

Conventional cytotoxic anticancer agents induce apoptosis primarily through activation of tumor suppressor p53 by causing DNA damage and the resulting regulation of B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family proteins. Therefore, the effects of these agents are limited in cancers where p53 loss-of-function mutations are common, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Here, we demonstrate that ultraviolet (UV) light-induced p53-independent transcriptional activation of NOXA, a proapoptotic factor in the BCL-2 family, results in apoptosis induction. This UV light-induced NOXA expression was triggered by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity. Moreover, we identified the specific UV light-inducible DNA element of the NOXA promoter and found that this sequence is responsible for transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4)-mediated induction. In p53-mutated TNBC cells, inhibition of KLF4 by RNA interference reduced NOXA expression. Furthermore, treatment of TNBC cells with a KLF4-inducing small compound, APTO-253, resulted in the induction of NOXA expression and NOXA-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, our results help to clarify the molecular mechanism of DNA damage-induced apoptosis and provide support for a possible treatment method for p53-mutated cancers.","['Nakajima, Wataru', 'Miyazaki, Kai', 'Asano, Yumi', 'Kubota, Satoshi', 'Tanaka, Nobuyuki']","['Nakajima W', 'Miyazaki K', 'Asano Y', 'Kubota S', 'Tanaka N']",,"['Department of Molecular Oncology, Institute for Advanced Medical Sciences, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Institute for Advanced Medical Sciences, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Institute for Advanced Medical Sciences, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Institute for Advanced Medical Sciences, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Institute for Advanced Medical Sciences, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210408,Switzerland,Genes (Basel),Genes,101551097,PMC8068402,['NOTNLM'],"['*APTO-253', '*KLF4', '*NOXA', '*TNBC', '*apoptosis', '*p53', '*transcriptional activation']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/08/17 06:00,['2021/04/30 01:08'],"['2021/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/02 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:08 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['genes12040539 [pii]', '10.3390/genes12040539 [doi]']",epublish,Genes (Basel). 2021 Apr 8;12(4). pii: genes12040539. doi: 10.3390/genes12040539.,20210816,"['0 (APTO-253)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Phenanthrolines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phenanthrolines/*pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, a critical point of view about predictive biomarkers with special emphasis on 11q deletion, novel resistance mutations, TP53 abnormalities, IGHV mutational status, complex karyotype and NOTCH1 mutations is stated. We also go over prognostic models in early stage CLL such as IPS-E.

Adipocyte (A-FABP) and epidermal (E-FABP) fatty acid-binding proteins are expressed in adipocytes and are assumed to play an important role in the development of lipid disturbances leading to the onset of metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between serum A-FABP and E-FABP levels, overweight, and components of the metabolic syndrome in acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors. Sixty-two acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors (34 females) were included in the study. The mean age at the time of the study was 12.41 +/- 4.98 years (range 4.71-23.43). Serum levels of A-FABP and E-FABP were analyzed using a commercially available ELISA kit. The ALL survivors presented statistically higher A-FABP levels in comparison with the healthy controls (25.57 +/- 14.46 vs. 15.13 +/- 7.61 ng/mL, p < 0.001). The subjects with body mass index (BMI) above the normal range (18 overweight, 10 obese) had a greater level of A-FABP compared to the ALL group with normal BMI (32.02 +/- 17.10 vs. 20.33 +/- 9.24 ng/mL, p = 0.006). Of all participants, 53.23% had at least one risk factor of metabolic syndrome; in this group, only the A-FABP level showed a statistically significant difference compared to the healthy control group (30.63 +/- 15.91 vs. 15.13 +/- 7.61 ng/mL, p < 0.001). The subjects with two or more metabolic risk factors (16.13%) presented higher levels of both A-FABP (33.62 +/- 17.16 vs. 15.13 +/- 7.61 ng/mL, p = 0.001) and E-FABP (13.37 +/- 3.62 vs. 10.12 +/- 3.21 ng/mL, p = 0.021) compared to the controls. Univariable regression models showed significant associations between BMI and systolic blood pressure with the A-FABP level (coeff. 1.02 and 13.74, respectively; p < 0.05). In contrast, the E-FABP level was only affected by BMI (coeff. 0.48; p < 0.01). The findings reported herein suggest that the increased levels of A-FABP and E-FABP may be involved in the pathogenesis of overweight and the onset of metabolic syndrome in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, further longitudinal, prospective studies of fatty acid-binding proteins and their potential role in the pathogenesis of obesity and metabolic syndrome in ALL survivors remain to be performed.","['Kononczuk, Katarzyna', 'Latoch, Eryk', 'Zelazowska-Rutkowska, Beata', 'Krawczuk-Rybak, Maryna', 'Muszynska-Roslan, Katarzyna']","['Kononczuk K', 'Latoch E', 'Zelazowska-Rutkowska B', 'Krawczuk-Rybak M', 'Muszynska-Roslan K']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0540-8040', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7667-7953']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, 15-274 Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, 15-274 Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Laboratory Diagnostic, Medical University of Bialystok, 15-274 Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, 15-274 Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, 15-274 Bialystok, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210408,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,PMC8068128,['NOTNLM'],"['A-FABP', 'ALL', 'CCS', 'E-FABP', 'FABP', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'childhood cancer survivors', 'children', 'metabolic syndrome', 'obesity', 'overweight']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:07'],"['2021/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/04 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:07 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm10081567 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm10081567 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2021 Apr 8;10(8). pii: jcm10081567. doi: 10.3390/jcm10081567.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The DNA sequence polymorphisms of bovine leukocyte antigen (BoLA)-DRB3 have exhibited a correlation with BLV-induced lymphoma in Holstein cows. However, the association may vary between different cattle breeds. Furthermore, little is known about the relationship between BLV-induced lymphoma and DRB3 at the amino acid and structural diversity levels. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the correlation between BLV-induced lymphoma and DRB3 at DNA, amino acid, and binding pocket property levels, using 106 BLV-infected asymptomatic and 227 BLV-induced lymphoma Japanese black cattle samples. DRB3*011:01 was identified as a resistance allele, whereas DRB3*005:02 and DRB3*016:01 were susceptibility alleles. Amino acid association studies showed that positions 9, 11, 13, 26, 30, 47, 57, 70, 71, 74, 78, and 86 were associated with lymphoma susceptibility. Structure and electrostatic charge modeling further indicated that binding pocket 9 of resistance DRB3 was positively charged. In contrast, alleles susceptible to lymphoma were neutrally charged.

KRas is frequently mutated in pancreatic cancers. The growth of certain pancreatic cancers is KRas-dependent and can be suppressed by GSK-3 inhibitors, documenting a link between KRas and GSK-3. To further elucidate the roles of GSK-3beta in drug-resistance, we transfected KRas-dependent MIA-PaCa-2 pancreatic cells with wild-type (WT) and kinase-dead (KD) forms of GSK-3beta. Transfection of MIA-PaCa-2 cells with WT-GSK-3beta increased their resistance to various chemotherapeutic drugs and certain small molecule inhibitors. Transfection of cells with KD-GSK-3beta often increased therapeutic sensitivity. An exception was observed with cells transfected with WT-GSK-3beta and sensitivity to the BCL2/BCLXL ABT737 inhibitor. WT-GSK-3beta reduced glycolytic capacity of the cells but did not affect the basal glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. KD-GSK-3beta decreased both basal glycolysis and glycolytic capacity and reduced mitochondrial respiration in MIA-PaCa-2 cells. As a comparison, the effects of GSK-3 on MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which have mutant PIK3CA, were examined. KD-GSK-3beta increased the resistance of MCF-7 cells to chemotherapeutic drugs and certain signal transduction inhibitors. Thus, altering the levels of GSK-3beta can have dramatic effects on sensitivity to drugs and signal transduction inhibitors which may be influenced by the background of the tumor.","['Abrams, Stephen

The physiological roles of this hormone in the body are varied. The beneficial effects of MEL administration may be related to its influence on mitochondrial physiology. Mitochondrial dysfunction is considered an important factor in various physiological and pathological processes, such as the development of neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, various forms of liver disease, skeletal muscle disorders, and aging. Mitochondrial dysfunction induces an increase in the permeability of the inner membrane, which leads to the formation of a permeability transition pore (mPTP) in the mitochondria. The long-term administration of MEL has been shown to improve the functional state of mitochondria and inhibit the opening of the mPTP during aging. It is known that MEL is able to suppress the initiation, progression, angiogenesis, and metastasis of cancer as well as the sensitization of malignant cells to conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy. This review summarizes the studies carried out by our group on the combined effect of MEL with chemotherapeutic agents (retinoic acid, cytarabine, and navitoclax) on the HL-60 cells used as a model of acute promyelocytic leukemia.

WIP1, encoded from PPM1D, is a negative regulator of p53. We evaluated PPM1D expression and explored the therapeutic efficacy of WIP1 inhibitor (WIP1i) GSK2830371, in association with the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3a (Nut-3a) in AML cell lines and primary samples. PPM1D transcript levels were higher in young patients compared with older ones and in core-binding-factor AML compared with other cytogenetic subgroups. In contrast, its expression was reduced in NPM1-mutated (mut, irrespective of FLT3-ITD status) or TP53-mut cases compared with wild-type (wt) ones. Either Nut-3a, and moderately WIP1i, as single agent decreased cell viability of TP53-wt cells (MV-4-11, MOLM-13, OCI-AML3) in a time/dosage-dependent manner, but not of TP53-mut cells (HEL, KASUMI-1, NOMO-1). The drug combination synergistically reduced viability and induced apoptosis in TP53-wt AML cell line and primary cells, but not in TP53-mut cells. Gene expression and immunoblotting analyses showed increased p53, MDM2 and p21 levels in treated TP53-wt cells and highlighted the enrichment of MYC, PI3K-AKT-mTOR and inflammation-related signatures upon WIP1i, Nut-3a and their combination, respectively, in the MV-4-11 TP53-wt model.

However, the exact role of WT1 in leukemogenesis and disease progression remains unclear. In this real-world evidence retrospective study, we investigated prognostic role of WT1-mRNA expression levels in AML and MDS patients and correlations with complete blood counts, flow cytometry counts, and molecular features. A total of 71 patients (AML, n = 46; and MDS, n = 25) were included in this study, and WT1 levels were assessed at diagnosis, during treatment and follow-up. We showed that WT1 expression levels were inversely correlated with normal hemopoiesis in both AML and MDS, and positively associated with blast counts. Flow cytometry was more sensitive and specific in distinguishing normal myeloid cells from neoplastic counterpart even just using linear parameters and CD45 expression. Moreover, we showed that a simple integrated approach combining blast counts by flow cytometry, FLT3 mutational status, and WT1 expression levels might be a useful tool for a better prognostic definition in both AML and MDS patients.","['Giudice, Valentina', 'Gorrese, Marisa', 'Vitolo, Rosa', 'Bertolini, Angela', 'Marcucci, Rossella', 'Serio, Bianca', 'Guariglia, Roberto', 'Ferrara, Idalucia', 'Pepe, Rita', ""D'Alto, Francesca"", 'Izzo, Barbara', 'Pedicini, Antonio', 'Montuori, Nunzia', 'Langella, Maddalena', 'Selleri, Carmine']","['Giudice V', 'Gorrese M', 'Vitolo R', 'Bertolini A', 'Marcucci R', 'Serio B', 'Guariglia R', 'Ferrara I', 'Pepe R', ""D'Alto F"", 'Izzo B', 'Pedicini A', 'Montuori N', 'Langella M', 'Selleri C']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7492-6848', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8697-986X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5861-8984']","['Department of Medicine, Surgery and Dentistry, ""Scuola Medica Salernitana"", University of Salerno, 84081 Baronissi, Salerno, Italy.', 'Hematology and Transplant Center, University ""Hospital San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi D\'Aragona"", 84131 Salerno, Italy.', 'Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital ""San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi D\'Aragona"", 84131 Salerno, Italy.', 'Hematology and Transplant Center, University ""Hospital San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi D\'Aragona"", 84131 Salerno, Italy.', 'Hematology and Transplant Center, University ""Hospital San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi D\'Aragona"", 84131 Salerno, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Surgery and Dentistry, ""Scuola Medica Salernitana"", University of Salerno, 84081 Baronissi, Salerno, Italy.', 'Hematology and Transplant Center, University ""Hospital San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi D\'Aragona"", 84131 Salerno, Italy.', 'Hematology and Transplant Center, University ""Hospital San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi D\'Aragona"", 84131 Salerno, Italy.', 'Hematology and Transplant Center, University ""Hospital San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi D\'Aragona"", 84131 Salerno, Italy.', 'Hematology and Transplant Center, University ""Hospital San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi D\'Aragona"", 84131 Salerno, Italy.', 'Hematology and Transplant Center, University ""Hospital San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi D\'Aragona"", 84131 Salerno, Italy.', 'Hematology and Transplant Center, University ""Hospital San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi D\'Aragona"", 84131 Salerno, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnology, CEINGE-Biotecnologie Avanzate, University of Naples ""Federico II"", 80138 Naples, Italy.', 'Hematology and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, AORN San Giuseppe Moscati, 83100 Avellino, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Medical Sciences, ""Federico II"" University, 80138 Naples, Italy.', 'Hematology and Transplant Center, University ""Hospital San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi D\'Aragona"", 84131 Salerno, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Surgery and Dentistry, ""Scuola Medica Salernitana"", University of Salerno, 84081 Baronissi, Salerno, Italy.', 'Hematology and Transplant Center, University ""Hospital San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi D\'Aragona"", 84131 Salerno, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210406,Switzerland,Biomedicines,Biomedicines,101691304,PMC8067344,['NOTNLM'],"[""Wilms' tumor 1"", 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'flow cytometry', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'prognosis']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:05'],"['2021/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:05 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['biomedicines9040387 [pii]', '10.3390/biomedicines9040387 [doi]']",epublish,Biomedicines. 2021 Apr 6;9(4). pii: biomedicines9040387. doi: 10.3390/biomedicines9040387.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considering that hydrazides are a structural part of severa l drugs and metal complexes containing phenanthroline derivatives are known to interact with DNA and to exhibit antitumor activity, more potent anticancer agents can be obtained by covalently linking the thiophene acid hydrazide or the furoic acid hydrazide to a 1,10-phenanthroline moiety. These ligands and the Ru(II) complexes were characterized by elemental analyses, electronic, vibrational, (1)H NMR, and ESI-MS spectroscopies. Ru is bound to two different N-heterocyclic ligands. One chloride and one S-bonded DMSO in cis-configuration to each other complete the octahedral coordination sphere around the metal ion. The ligands are very effective in inhibiting cellular growth in a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, K562.

We aimed to investigate how p53 protein isoforms are modulated during epigenetic differentiation therapy in AML, and if p53 isoform expression could be a potential biomarker for predicting a response to this treatment. p53 full-length (FL), p53beta and p53gamma protein isoforms were analyzed by 1D and 2D gel immunoblots in AML cell lines, primary AML cells from untreated patients and AML cells from patients before and after treatment with valproic acid (VPA), all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and theophylline. Furthermore, global gene expression profiling analysis was performed on samples from the clinical protocol. Correlation analyses were performed between p53 protein isoform expression and in vitro VPA sensitivity and FAB (French-American-British) class in primary AML cells. The results show downregulation of p53beta/gamma and upregulation of p53FL in AML cell lines treated with VPA, and in some of the patients treated with differentiation therapy. p53FL positively correlated with in vitro VPA sensitivity and the FAB class of AML, while p53beta/gamma isoforms negatively correlated with the same.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-based therapies, a major breakthrough against cancer, have emerged as a powerful tool to reinvigorate antitumor responses. Herein, we analyzed the role of the novel inhibitory checkpoint BTLA and its ligand, HVEM, in the regulation of leukemic and natural killer (NK) cells in CLL. Flow cytometry analyses showed that BTLA expression is upregulated on leukemic cells and NK cells from patients with CLL, whereas HVEM is downregulated only in leukemic cells, especially in patients with advanced Rai-Binet stage. In silico analysis revealed that increased HVEM, but not BTLA, mRNA expression in leukemic cells correlated with diminished overall survival. Further, soluble BTLA (sBTLA) was found to be increased in the sera of patients with CLL and highly correlated with poor prognostic markers and shorter time to treatment. BTLA blockade with an anti-BTLA monoclonal antibody depleted leukemic cells and boosted NK cell-mediated responses ex vivo by increasing their IFN-gamma production, cytotoxic capability, and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC). In agreement with an inhibitory role of BTLA in NK cells, surface BTLA expression on NK cells was associated with poor outcome in patients with CLL. Overall, this study is the first to bring to light a role of BTLA/HVEM in the suppression of NK cell-mediated immune responses in CLL and its impact on patient's prognosis, suggesting that BTLA/HVEM axis may be a potential therapeutic target in this disease.","['Sordo-Bahamonde, Christian', 'Lorenzo-Herrero, Seila', 'Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Ana P', 'R Payer, Angel', 'Gonzalez-Garcia, Esther', 'Lopez-Soto, Alejandro', 'Gonzalez, Segundo']","['Sordo-Bahamonde C', 'Lorenzo-Herrero S', 'Gonzalez-Rodriguez AP', 'R Payer A', 'Gonzalez-Garcia E', 'Lopez-Soto A', 'Gonzalez S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9755-6149', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9729-3871', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0565-9133', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7171-4973', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6360-5205', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4631-9255']","['Department of Functional Biology, Immunology, Universidad de Oviedo, 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias (IUOPA), 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias (ISPA), 33011 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Functional Biology, Immunology, Universidad de Oviedo, 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias (IUOPA), 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias (ISPA), 33011 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias (IUOPA), 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias (ISPA), 33011 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias (HUCA), 33011 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias (IUOPA), 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias (ISPA), 33011 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias (HUCA), 33011 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital de Cabuenes, 33203 Gijon, Spain.', 'Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias (IUOPA), 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias (ISPA), 33011 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Oviedo, 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Functional Biology, Immunology, Universidad de Oviedo, 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias (IUOPA), 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias (ISPA), 33011 Oviedo, Spain.']",['eng'],['PI19/01353/Instituto de Salud Carlos III'],['Journal Article'],20210407,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC8067870,['NOTNLM'],"['BTLA', 'CD270', 'CD272', 'CLL', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'HVEM', 'NK cell', 'TNFRSF14', 'checkpoint', 'immunotherapy']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:05'],"['2021/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/02 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:05 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13081766 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13081766 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Apr 7;13(8). pii: cancers13081766. doi: 10.3390/cancers13081766.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report a metabolite in human specimens that is closely related to 2-hydroxyglutarate: the intramolecular ester of 2-hydroxyglutarate, 2-hydroxyglutarate-gamma-lactone. Using (13)C5-L-glutamine tracer analysis, we showed that 2-hydroxyglutarate is the endogenous precursor of 2-hydroxyglutarate-lactone and that there is a high exchange between these two metabolites. Lactone formation does not depend on mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase, but its formation is most probably linked to transport processes across the cell membrane and favored at low environmental pH. Furthermore, human macrophages showed not only striking differences in uptake of 2-hydroxyglutarate and its lactone but also in the enantiospecific hydrolysis of the latter. Consequently, 2-hydroxyglutarate-lactone may play a critical role in the modulation of the tumor microenvironment.","['Berger, Raffaela S', 'Wachsmuth, Christian J', 'Waldhier, Magdalena C', 'Renner-Sattler, Kathrin', 'Thomas, Simone', 'Chaturvedi, Anuhar', 'Niller, Hans-Helmut', 'Bumes, Elisabeth', 'Hau, Peter', 'Proescholdt, Martin', 'Gronwald, Wolfram', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Kreutz, Marina', 'Oefner, Peter J', 'Dettmer, Katja']","['Berger RS', 'Wachsmuth CJ', 'Waldhier MC', 'Renner-Sattler K', 'Thomas S', 'Chaturvedi A', 'Niller HH', 'Bumes E', 'Hau P', 'Proescholdt M', 'Gronwald W', 'Heuser M', 'Kreutz M', 'Oefner PJ', 'Dettmer K']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5783-3279', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6915-3206', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3894-5053', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3646-0060', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5318-9044', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7337-2380']","['Institute of Functional Genomics, University of Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Functional Genomics, University of Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Functional Genomics, University of Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Regensburg Center for Interventional Immunology, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, University Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Neurology and Wilhelm Sander-NeuroOncology Unit, Regensburg University Hospital, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Neurology and Wilhelm Sander-NeuroOncology Unit, Regensburg University Hospital, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Regensburg University Hospital, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Functional Genomics, University of Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Functional Genomics, University of Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Functional Genomics, University of Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['DFG KFO262/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', 'Interreg V BY-CZ118/European Regional Development Fund']",['Journal Article'],20210407,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC8067704,['NOTNLM'],"['D-2-hydroxyglutarate', 'IDH1/2 mutation', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'lactonization']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:05'],"['2021/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/31 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:05 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13081756 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13081756 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Apr 7;13(8). pii: cancers13081756. doi: 10.3390/cancers13081756.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the source of bystander signals is evident, the identification and characterization of these signals is challenging. Here, RIBEs were analyzed in human CD34+ cells cultured in distinct molecular size fractions of medium, conditioned by 2 Gy irradiated human MSC. Specifically, gammaH2AX foci (as a marker of DNA double-strand breaks) and chromosomal instability were evaluated in CD34+ cells grown in approximate (I) < 10 kDa, (II) 10-100 kDa and (III) > 100 kDa fractions of MSC conditioned medium and un-/fractionated control medium, respectively. Hitherto, significantly increased numbers of gammaH2AX foci (p = 0.0286) and aberrant metaphases (p = 0.0022) were detected in CD34+ cells grown in the (II) 10-100 kDa fraction (0.67 +/- 0.10 gammaH2AX foci per CD34+ cell logical or 3.8 +/- 0.3 aberrant metaphases per CD34+ cell sample; mean +/- SEM) when compared to (I) < 10 kDa (0.19 +/- 0.01 logical or 0.3 +/- 0.2) or (III) > 100 kDa fractions (0.23 +/- 0.04 logical or 0.4 +/- 0.4) or un-/fractionated control medium (0.12 +/- 0.01 logical or 0.1 +/- 0.1). Furthermore, RIBEs disappeared after heat inactivation of medium at 75 degrees C. Taken together, our data suggest that RIBEs are mainly mediated by the heat-sensitive (II) 10-100 kDa fraction of MSC conditioned medium. We postulate proteins as RIBE mediators and in-depth proteome analyses to identify key bystander signals, which define targets for the development of next-generation anti-leukemic drugs.","['Kohl, Vanessa', 'Fabarius, Alice', 'Drews, Oliver', 'Bierbaum, Miriam', 'Jawhar, Ahmed', 'Darwich, Ali', 'Weiss, Christel', 'Flach, Johanna', 'Brendel, Susanne', 'Kleiner, Helga', 'Seifarth, Wolfgang', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Popp, Henning D']","['Kohl V', 'Fabarius A', 'Drews O', 'Bierbaum M', 'Jawhar A', 'Darwich A', 'Weiss C', 'Flach J', 'Brendel S', 'Kleiner H', 'Seifarth W', 'Hofmann WK', 'Popp HD']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9463-9638', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0090-0204']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, University Medical Center Mannheim, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Orthopedics and Trauma Surgery, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Orthopedics and Trauma Surgery, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Statistics and Biomathematics, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Stefan Jentsch Fellowship 2020/Stefan Jentsch Fellowship, Deutsche Gesellschaft', 'fur DNA-Reparaturforschung (DGDR)', 'DJCLS 14 R/2017/Jose Carreras Leukamie-Stiftung']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210407,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,PMC8067571,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD34+ cells', '*bystander signals', '*leukemia', '*mesenchymal stromal cells', '*radiation-induced bystander effects']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:00,['2021/04/30 01:04'],"['2021/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:04 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['cells10040827 [pii]', '10.3390/cells10040827 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2021 Apr 7;10(4). pii: cells10040827. doi: 10.3390/cells10040827.,20211021,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Mutagens)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bystander Effect/drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Chromosomal Instability/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'X-Rays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among reported mutations, A6E mutation showed the greatest reduction in ASNS abundance. However, the effect of A6E mutation has not yet been tested with yeast asparagine synthetase (Asn1/2p). Here, we constructed a yeast strain by deleting ASN2 from its genome, introducing the A6E mutation codon to ASN1, along with GFP downstream of ASN1. Our mutant yeast construct showed a noticeable decrease of Asn1p(A6E)-GFP levels as compared to the control yeast expressing Asn1p(WT)-GFP. At the stationary phase, the A6E mutation also markedly lowered the assembly frequency of the enzyme. In contrast to Asn1p(WT)-GFP, Asn1p(A6E)-GFP was insensitive to changes in the intracellular energy levels upon treatment with sodium azide during the log phase or fresh glucose at the stationary phase. Our study has confirmed that the effect of A6E mutation on protein expression levels of asparagine synthetase is common in both unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes, suggesting that yeast could be a model of ASD. Furthermore, A6E mutation could be introduced to the ASNS gene of acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients to inhibit the upregulation of ASNS by cancer cells, reducing the risk of developing resistance to the asparaginase treatment.","['Surasiang, Thunyarat', 'Noree, Chalongrat']","['Surasiang T', 'Noree C']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7774-4281'],"['Institute of Molecular Biosciences, Mahidol University, Salaya, Nakhon Pathom 73170, Thailand.', 'Institute of Molecular Biosciences, Mahidol University, Salaya, Nakhon Pathom 73170, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['020/2559/The Development and Promotion of Science and Technology Talents Project', '(DPST)', 'FDA-CO-2563-12774-TH/The Coordinating Center for Thai Government Science and', 'Technology Scholarship Students (CSTS) - National Science and Technology', 'Development Agency (NSTDA)', 'n/a/Mahidol University']",['Journal Article'],20210403,Switzerland,Biology (Basel),Biology,101587988,PMC8065433,['NOTNLM'],"['asparagine synthetase', 'assembly', 'mutation', 'protein expression', 'yeast']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:04'],"['2021/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/25 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:04 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['biology10040294 [pii]', '10.3390/biology10040294 [doi]']",epublish,Biology (Basel). 2021 Apr 3;10(4). pii: biology10040294. doi: 10.3390/biology10040294.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the development of chemotherapy, there has been a substantial increase in the overall survival rate in the last 30 years. However, the overall mortality rate in children with cancer remains 25%, and many survivors experience a decline in overall quality of life and long-term adverse effects caused by treatments. Although cancer cells share common characteristics, pediatric cancers are different from adult cancers in their prevalence, mutation load, and drug response. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to develop therapeutic approaches specifically designed for children with cancer. Nanotechnology can potentially overcome the deficiencies of conventional methods of administering chemotherapy and ultimately improve clinical outcomes. The nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems can decrease the toxicity of therapy, provide a sustained or controlled drug release, improve the pharmacokinetic properties of loading contents, and achieve a targeted drug delivery with achievable modifications. Furthermore, therapeutic approaches based on combining nanoformulated drugs with novel immunotherapeutic agents are emerging.

Uninfected (CEM), HIV-1-infected (J1.1), and human T cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1)-infected (HUT102) cells were synchronized in G0. Viral latency was reversed by increasing gene expression with the addition of serum-rich media and inducers. Supernatants and cell pellets were collected post-induction at different timepoints and assayed for extracellular vesicle (EV) and autophagy markers; and for viral proteins and RNAs. Tetraspanins and autophagy-related proteins were found to be differentially secreted in HIV-1- and HTLV-1-infected cells when compared with uninfected controls. HIV-1 proteins were present at 6 h and their production increased up to 24 h. HTLV-1 proteins peaked at 6 h and plateaued. HIV-1 and HTLV-1 RNA production correlated with viral protein expression. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) showed increase of EV concentration over time in both uninfected and infected samples. Finally, the HIV-1 supernatant from the 6-h samples was found not to be infectious; however, the virus from the 24-h samples was successfully rescued and infectious. Overall, our data indicate that EV release may occur prior to viral release from infected cells, thereby implicating a potentially significant effect of EVs on uninfected recipient cells prior to subsequent viral infection and spread.","['Kim, Yuriy', 'Mensah, Gifty A', 'Al Sharif, Sarah', 'Pinto, Daniel O', 'Branscome, Heather', 'Yelamanchili, Sowmya V', 'Cowen, Maria', 'Erickson, James', 'Khatkar, Pooja', 'Mahieux, Renaud', 'Kashanchi, Fatah']","['Kim Y', 'Mensah GA', 'Al Sharif S', 'Pinto DO', 'Branscome H', 'Yelamanchili SV', 'Cowen M', 'Erickson J', 'Khatkar P', 'Mahieux R', 'Kashanchi F']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8658-6863', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1716-0217', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1530-0527', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5129-6804', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9681-2780']","['Laboratory of Molecular Virology, School of Systems Biology, George Mason University, Manassas, VA 20110, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, School of Systems Biology, George Mason University, Manassas, VA 20110, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, School of Systems Biology, George Mason University, Manassas, VA 20110, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, School of Systems Biology, George Mason University, Manassas, VA 20110, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, School of Systems Biology, George Mason University, Manassas, VA 20110, USA.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, School of Systems Biology, George Mason University, Manassas, VA 20110, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, School of Systems Biology, George Mason University, Manassas, VA 20110, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, School of Systems Biology, George Mason University, Manassas, VA 20110, USA.', 'International Center for Research in Infectiology, Retroviral Oncogenesis Laboratory, INSERM U1111-Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Universite de Lyon, Fondation Pour La Recherche Medicale, Labex Ecofect, 69007 Lyon, France.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, School of Systems Biology, George Mason University, Manassas, VA 20110, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI043894/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI078859/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI127351-01/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'AI078859/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'NS099029/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'AI074410/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 DA046855/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20210401,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,PMC8066806,['NOTNLM'],"['*HIV-1', '*HTLV-1', '*cART', '*exosomes', '*extracellular vesicles']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/12/04 06:00,['2021/04/30 01:02'],"['2021/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/24 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:02 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/04 06:00 [medline]']","['cells10040781 [pii]', '10.3390/cells10040781 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2021 Apr 1;10(4). pii: cells10040781. doi: 10.3390/cells10040781.,20211021,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Extracellular Vesicles/*metabolism', 'HIV Infections/*metabolism/*pathology', 'HIV-1/physiology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/physiology', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Virion/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A systematic meta-analysis of 43 peer-reviewed studies with 10,769 CML patients compared the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events (GI AEs) in a large heterogeneous CML population as a function of TKI type. Incidence and severity of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were assessed for imatinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and nilotinib. Examination of combined TKI average GI AE incidence found diarrhea most prevalent (22.5%), followed by nausea (20.6%), and vomiting (12.9%). Other TKI GI AEs included constipation (9.2%), abdominal pain (7.6%), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (3.5%), and pancreatitis (2.2%). Mean GI AE incidence was significantly different between TKIs (p < 0.001): bosutinib (52.9%), imatinib (24.2%), dasatinib (20.4%), and nilotinib (9.1%). Diarrhea was the most prevalent GI AE with bosutinib (79.2%) and dasatinib (28.1%), whereas nausea was most prevalent with imatinib (33.0%) and nilotinib (13.2%). Incidence of grade 3 or 4 severe GI AEs was </=3% except severe diarrhea with bosutinib (9.5%). Unsupervised clustering revealed treatment efficacy measured by the complete cytogenetic response, major molecular response, and overall survival is driven most by disease severity, not TKI type. For patients with chronic phase CML without resistance, optimal TKI selection should consider TKI AE profile, comorbidities, and lifestyle.","['Mohanavelu, Prahathishree', 'Mutnick, Mira', 'Mehra, Nidhi', 'White, Brandon', 'Kudrimoti, Sparsh', 'Hernandez Kluesner, Kaci', 'Chen, Xinyu', 'Nguyen, Tim', 'Horlander, Elaina', 'Thenot, Helena', 'Kota, Vamsi', 'Mitchell, Cassie S']","['Mohanavelu P', 'Mutnick M', 'Mehra N', 'White B', 'Kudrimoti S', 'Hernandez Kluesner K', 'Chen X', 'Nguyen T', 'Horlander E', 'Thenot H', 'Kota V', 'Mitchell CS']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4792-4337', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3762-0815', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8070-9778', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5290-9289']","['Laboratory for Pathology Dynamics, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30332, USA.', 'Laboratory for Pathology Dynamics, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30332, USA.', 'Laboratory for Pathology Dynamics, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30332, USA.', 'Laboratory for Pathology Dynamics, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30332, USA.', 'Laboratory for Pathology Dynamics, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30332, USA.', 'Laboratory for Pathology Dynamics, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30332, USA.', 'Laboratory for Pathology Dynamics, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30332, USA.', 'Laboratory for Pathology Dynamics, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30332, USA.', 'Laboratory for Pathology Dynamics, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30332, USA.', 'Laboratory for Pathology Dynamics, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30332, USA.', 'Hematology and Oncology, Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, GA 30912, USA.', 'Laboratory for Pathology Dynamics, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30332, USA.']",['eng'],"['R21CA232249/NH/NIH HHS/United States', '1944247/National Science Foundation', ""CM/Children's Hospital of Atlanta Aflac pilot grant"", ""PM,MM,NM,BK/President's Undergraduate Research Award, Georgia Institute of"", 'Technology', 'VK/Incyte']",['Journal Article'],20210401,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC8037766,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'gastrointestinal adverse event', 'quality of life', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:01'],"['2021/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:01 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13071643 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13071643 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Apr 1;13(7). pii: cancers13071643. doi: 10.3390/cancers13071643.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A promising option is to enhance the affinity of an antibody's Fc-part to the Fc-receptor CD16 by altering the amino acid sequence. Herein, we characterized an S239D/I332E-modified CD133 mAb termed 293C3-SDIE for treatment of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Flow cytometric analysis revealed CD133 expression on B-ALL cell lines and leukemic cells of 50% (14 of 28) B-ALL patients. 293C3-SDIE potently induced NK cell reactivity against the B-ALL cell lines SEM and RS4;11, as well as leukemic cells of B-ALL patients in a target antigen-dependent manner, as revealed by analysis of NK cell activation, degranulation, and cytotoxicity. Of note, CD133 expression did not correlate with BCR-ABL, CD19, CD20, or CD22, which are presently used as therapeutic targets in B-ALL, which revealed CD133 as an independent target for B-ALL treatment. Increased CD133 expression was also observed in MLL-AF4-rearranged B-ALL, indicating that 293C3-SDIE may constitute a particularly suitable treatment option in this hard-to-treat subpopulation. Taken together, our results identify 293C3-SDIE as a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of B-ALL.","['Riegg, Fabian', 'Lutz, Martina S', 'Schmied, Bastian J', 'Heitmann, Jonas S', 'Queudeville, Manon', 'Lang, Peter', 'Jung, Gundram', 'Salih, Helmut R', 'Marklin, Melanie']","['Riegg F', 'Lutz MS', 'Schmied BJ', 'Heitmann JS', 'Queudeville M', 'Lang P', 'Jung G', 'Salih HR', 'Marklin M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5642-1846', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6719-1847', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2920-3894']","['Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'DFG Cluster of Excellence 2180 ""Image-Guided and Functional Instructed Tumor Therapy (iFIT)"", University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'DFG Cluster of Excellence 2180 ""Image-Guided and Functional Instructed Tumor Therapy (iFIT)"", University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'DFG Cluster of Excellence 2180 ""Image-Guided and Functional Instructed Tumor Therapy (iFIT)"", University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'DFG Cluster of Excellence 2180 ""Image-Guided and Functional Instructed Tumor Therapy (iFIT)"", University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', ""Department I-General Pediatrics, Children's Hospital, University Hospital Tubingen, Hematology/Oncology, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany."", ""Department I-General Pediatrics, Children's Hospital, University Hospital Tubingen, Hematology/Oncology, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany."", 'Department for Immunology, Eberhard Karls University, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'DFG Cluster of Excellence 2180 ""Image-Guided and Functional Instructed Tumor Therapy (iFIT)"", University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'DFG Cluster of Excellence 2180 ""Image-Guided and Functional Instructed Tumor Therapy (iFIT)"", University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['2017.100.3/Wilhelm Sander-Stiftung', '70112914/Deutsche Krebshilfe', '70113496/Deutsche Krebshilfe', '70113999/Deutsche Krebshilfe', 'SA 1360/9-3/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', ""390900677/Germany's Excellence Strategy EXC 2180""]",['Journal Article'],20210401,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,PMC8036612,['NOTNLM'],"['ADCC', 'B-ALL', 'CD133', 'Fc engineering', 'NK cells', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'immunotherapy', 'prominin-1']",2021/05/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:01,['2021/04/30 01:01'],"['2021/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 01:01 [entrez]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13071632 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13071632 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Apr 1;13(7). pii: cancers13071632. doi: 10.3390/cancers13071632.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In a ""3 + 3'' design, patients received fixed doses of tipifarnib 200 mg bid (days 1-21) and escalating doses of bortezomib (days 8, 15, 22) every 4 weeks in 4-6 cycles. RESULTS: The combination was tolerated well by the 11 patients in this study without reaching the maximum tolerated dose. Myelosuppression was the most frequent side effect, but usually of short duration. Interestingly a complete response with or without complete count recovery was observed in three patients and three additional patients had stable disease. The median duration of overall survival was 449 days. Two patients were still alive at 4.0 and 4.3 years, including one patient in continuing CR. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of tipifarnib and bortezomib was tolerated well and appeared to have clinical activity in patients with high-risk MDS and AML with low counts of marrow blasts. Our results warrant further evaluation in a phase II study.","['Muus, Petra', 'Langemeijer, Saskia', 'van Bijnen, Sandra', 'Blijlevens, Nicole', 'de Witte, Theo']","['Muus P', 'Langemeijer S', 'van Bijnen S', 'Blijlevens N', 'de Witte T']",,"['Dept. of Hematology, Radboudumc, Nijmegen, the Netherlands; Dept. of Haematology, Leeds Teaching Hospitals, St James Institute of Oncology, Leeds, UK.

However, both cytogenetic and molecular risk stratification schemas are varied and few reports have studied correlations between these schemas. We have performed a single institution retrospective review of cytogenetic and molecular classifications of AMLs seen at Penn Medicine between 2013 and 2018. One-hundred fourty-four cases were characterized according to European Leukemia Net (ELN) or Medical Research Council (MRC) criteria for cytogenetics and results compared to molecular profiling. When we analyzed the most common sequencing study results within the risk groupings, negative sequencing studies and FLT3 mutations were common in favorable AMLs, intermediate AMLs had mutations in FLT3, NPM1, DNMT3A and IDH2, while adverse AMLs had a high prevalence of TP53 mutations. We next grouped the genes on the panel by their proteins' functions and found mutations in signaling pathway genes to be common in favorable AMLs while tumor suppressors were commonly mutated in adverse AMLs. AMLs grouped by the type of chromosomal abnormality present showed that FLT3 mutations were common in AMLs with a trisomy while TP53 mutations were common in AMLs with a monosomy or a deletion. TP53 mutations are especially common in AMLs with a monosomal karyotype and often overlap with 17p loss. Interestingly, although all AMLs with TP53 mutations have a defect in the response to DNA damage, expression of P53 protein before and after irradiation is not consistently predicted by phenotype. Overall, these studies confirm the genetic complexity of AML which does not fall into simple patterns of cooperating mutations.","['Sussman, Robyn T', 'Manning, Bryan', 'Ackerman, Daniel', 'Bigdeli, Ashkan', 'Pammer, Paige', 'Velu, Priya D', 'Luger, Selina M', 'Bagg, Adam', 'Carroll, Martin', 'Morrissette, Jennifer J D']","['Sussman RT', 'Manning B', 'Ackerman D', 'Bigdeli A', 'Pammer P', 'Velu PD', 'Luger SM', 'Bagg A', 'Carroll M', 'Morrissette JJD']",,"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.

METHODS: We describe three patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were persistently positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Viral viability from longitudinally-collected specimens was assessed. Whole-genome sequencing and serological studies were performed to measure viral evolution and evidence of immune escape. FINDINGS: We found compelling evidence of ongoing replication and infectivity for up to 162 days from initial positive by subgenomic RNA, single-stranded RNA, and viral culture analysis. Our results reveal a broad spectrum of infectivity, host immune responses, and accumulation of mutations, some with the potential for immune escape. INTERPRETATION: Our results highlight the potential need to reassess infection control precautions in the management and care of immunocompromised patients. Routine surveillance of mutations and evaluation of their potential impact on viral transmission and immune escape should be considered.","['Truong, Thao T', 'Ryutov, Alex', 'Pandey, Utsav', 'Yee, Rebecca', 'Goldberg, Lior', 'Bhojwani, Deepa', 'Aguayo-Hiraldo, Paibel', 'Pinsky, Benjamin A', 'Pekosz, Andrew', 'Shen, Lishuang', 'Boyd, Scott D', 'Wirz, Oliver F', 'Roltgen, Katharina', 'Bootwalla, Moiz', 'Maglinte, Dennis T', 'Ostrow, Dejerianne', 'Ruble, David', 'Han, Jennifer H', 'Biegel, Jaclyn A', 'Li, Maggie', 'Huang, ChunHong', 'Sahoo, Malaya K', 'Pannaraj, Pia S', ""O'Gorman, Maurice"", 'Judkins, Alexander R', 'Gai, Xiaowu', 'Dien Bard, Jennifer']","['Truong TT', 'Ryutov A', 'Pandey U', 'Yee R', 'Goldberg L', 'Bhojwani D', 'Aguayo-Hiraldo P', 'Pinsky BA', 'Pekosz A', 'Shen L', 'Boyd SD', 'Wirz OF', 'Roltgen K', 'Bootwalla M', 'Maglinte DT', 'Ostrow D', 'Ruble D', 'Han JH', 'Biegel JA', 'Li M', 'Huang C', 'Sahoo MK', 'Pannaraj PS', ""O'Gorman M"", 'Judkins AR', 'Gai X', 'Dien Bard J']",,"[""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States."", ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States."", 'Department of Pathology, Westchester Medical Center/New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, United States.', ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States; Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States; Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States; Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States; Department of Pediatrics, Cancer and Blood Disorder Institute, Transplant and Cellular Therapy Section, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, CA, United States."", 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States; Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States.', 'W.

Predicting treatment responses and toxicity (e.g., cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity) remains a big challenge. CAR-T19 monitoring could increase our understanding of treatment responses and be of relevance to patient management. A robust method for accurate CAR-T19 detection is therefore extremely desirable. METHODS: An assay that uses fluorochrome-conjugated human recombinant soluble CD19 was tested against two commercially available CAR-T19 therapies and a CAR-T19 cell line developed in-house. Precision, concordance, and analyte stability were tested using peripheral blood obtained from CAR-T19-treated patients and controls. RESULTS: The assay showed good accuracy, and had a limit of blank for whole blood samples of 0.13%. Reproducibility and inter-operator concordance were satisfactory (CVs <15%). The assay distinguished CAR-T19 from reactive T-cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with suspected immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), and was adapted to study memory T-cell compartments in treated patients. CONCLUSION: The assay enabled routine monitoring of CAR-T19 in blood and CSF samples. Despite profound cytopenia in many lymphoma patients, results were obtained regularly from only 4 ml of blood. The assay can be adapted easily to characterize the memory and exhaustion status of CAR-T19 and native T-cells. Importantly, it does not rely on CAR construct specificity; thus, it can be used to detect any CD19-targeted CAR cell. Finally, our validation process can serve as a blueprint for other fluorochrome proteins used to detect CAR cells.","['Johansson, Ulrika', 'Gallagher, Kathleen', 'Burgoyne, Victoria', 'Maus, Marcela V', 'Casey, Keagan S', 'Brini, Gabrielle G', 'Frigault, Matthew J', 'Yam, Jennifer Y', 'Chavda, Nikesh', 'Besley, Caroline', 'Lugthart, Sanne']","['Johansson U', 'Gallagher K', 'Burgoyne V', 'Maus MV', 'Casey KS', 'Brini GG', 'Frigault MJ', 'Yam JY', 'Chavda N', 'Besley C', 'Lugthart S']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0743-7400'],"['SI-HMDS, University Hospitals and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'SI-HMDS, University Hospitals and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospitals and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospitals and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospitals and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210429,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

METHODS: The authors evaluated the clinicopathologic features, outcomes, and responses to therapy of 65 patients with aCML. The median age was 67 years (range, 46-89 years). RESULTS: The most frequently mutated genes included ASXL1 (83%), SRSF2 (68%), and SETBP1 (58%). Mutations in SETBP1, SRSF2, TET2, and GATA2 appeared at variant allele frequencies (VAFs) greater than 40%, whereas other RAS pathway mutations were more likely to appear at low VAFs. The acquisition of new, previously undetectable mutations at transformation was observed in 63% of the evaluable patients, with the most common involving signaling pathway mutations. Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) were associated with the highest response rates but with a short duration of response (median, 2.7 months). Therapy with ruxolitinib was not associated with clinically significant responses as a single agent or in combination with an HMA. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation was the only therapy associated with improved outcomes (hazard ratio, 0.144; 95% CI, 0.035-0.593; P = .007). Age, platelet counts, bone marrow blast percentages, and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were independent predictors of survival and were integrated in a multivariable model that allowed the prediction of 1- and 3-year survival. CONCLUSIONS: aCML is characterized by high frequencies of ASXL1, SRSF2, and SETBP1 mutations and is associated with a high risk of acute myeloid leukemia transformation. Response and survival outcomes with current therapies remain poor. The incorporation of age, platelet counts, bone marrow blast percentages, and LDH levels can allow survival prediction, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation should be considered for all eligible patients.","['Montalban-Bravo, Guillermo', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Sasaki, Koji', 'Masarova, Lucia', 'Naqvi, Kiran', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Takahashi, Koichi', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Daver, Naval', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Khoury, Joseph D', 'Loghavi, Sanam', 'Soltysiak, Kelly A', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Bose, Prithviraj', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Montalban-Bravo G', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Sasaki K', 'Masarova L', 'Naqvi K', 'Jabbour E', 'DiNardo CD', 'Takahashi K', 'Konopleva M', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Kadia TM', 'Ravandi F', 'Daver N', 'Borthakur G', 'Estrov Z', 'Khoury JD', 'Loghavi S', 'Soltysiak KA', 'Pierce S', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Patel KP', 'Verstovsek S', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Bose P', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4533-5176', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7829-5249', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9140-0610', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6624-4196', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4465-6119', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9003-0390', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1670-6513', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9892-9832', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7103-373X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1908-3307', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3631-2482']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center', 'CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20210429,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'clinical outcomes', 'mutational codominance']",2021/04/30 06:00,2021/04/30 06:00,['2021/04/29 17:39'],"['2021/02/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/29 17:39 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33622 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2021 Sep 1;127(17):3113-3124. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33622.

METHODS: Neurocognitive function was evaluated once in survivors of ALL who were at least 8 years old and 5 years from their diagnosis. In a cross-sectional analysis, the associations with the body mass index (BMI) category and Z score were examined. A longitudinal analysis used the overweight/obesity area under the curve (AUC), which was determined via the trapezoidal rule by a sum of the integrals defined by the BMI Z score at each time point and the time intervals of the BMI measurement. RESULTS: For 210 survivors, the median BMI Z score at diagnosis was 0.17, which increased to 0.54 at the end of induction and to 0.74 at the neurocognitive assessment. In the cross-sectional analysis, overweight/obese survivors scored significantly lower than others on the measures of executive function (cognitive flexibility, planning, verbal fluency, working memory, and spatial construction; all P < .05), attention (attention span and risk taking; all P < .05), and processing speed (visual motor coordination, visual speed, and motor speed; all P < .05). In the longitudinal analysis, when the treatment period was subdivided into 4 time periods (induction, consolidation, early maintenance, and late maintenance), a greater overweight/obesity AUC during induction therapy was associated with worse cognitive flexibility (P = .01) and slower motor speed (P = .02), which persisted throughout the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight/obesity was significantly associated with neurocognitive impairment during long-term follow-up, and this association started early in treatment for ALL. Novel early interventions to provide cognitive training and prevent weight gain are required for patients at risk.","['Iijima, Mayuko', 'Liu, Wei', 'Panetta, John C', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Srivastava, Deo Kumar', 'Krull, Kevin R', 'Inaba, Hiroto']","['Iijima M', 'Liu W', 'Panetta JC', 'Hudson MM', 'Pui CH', 'Srivastava DK', 'Krull KR', 'Inaba H']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1564-6563', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0303-5658', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0476-7001', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0605-7342']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['R01 MH085849/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'MH085849/Foundation for the National Institutes of Health', 'U01 CA195547/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/Foundation for the National Institutes of Health']",['Journal Article'],20210429,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,PMC8355093,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'body mass index', 'children', 'neurocognitive function', 'obesity', 'survivor']",2021/04/30 06:00,2021/04/30 06:00,['2021/04/29 17:39'],"['2021/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/09/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/29 17:39 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33624 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2021 Sep 1;127(17):3202-3213. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33624.

Most studies focus on the cell-intrinsic genetic changes and how they impact cell fate decisions. We consider how chronic exposure to the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), impacts Cebpa-knockout hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in competitive settings. Surprisingly, we found that Cebpa loss did not confer a hematopoietic cell-intrinsic competitive advantage; rather chronic IL-1beta exposure engendered potent selection for Cebpa loss. Chronic IL-1beta augments myeloid lineage output by activating differentiation and repressing stem cell gene expression programs in a Cebpa-dependent manner. As a result, Cebpa-knockout HSPCs are resistant to the prodifferentiative effects of chronic IL-1beta, and competitively expand. We further show that ectopic CEBPA expression reduces the fitness of established human acute myeloid leukemias, coinciding with increased differentiation. These findings have important implications for the earliest events that drive hematologic disorders, suggesting that chronic inflammation could be an important driver of leukemogenesis and a potential target for intervention.","['Higa, Kelly C', 'Goodspeed, Andrew', 'Chavez, James S', 'De Dominici, Marco', 'Danis, Etienne', 'Zaberezhnyy, Vadym', 'Rabe, Jennifer L', 'Tenen, Daniel G', 'Pietras, Eric M', 'DeGregori, James']","['Higa KC', 'Goodspeed A', 'Chavez JS', 'De Dominici M', 'Danis E', 'Zaberezhnyy V', 'Rabe JL', 'Tenen DG', 'Pietras EM', 'DeGregori J']",,"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO.', 'Integrated Department of Immunology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO.', 'Medical Scientist Training Program, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO.', 'University of Colorado Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO.', 'University of Colorado Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO.', 'Cancer Science Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Integrated Department of Immunology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO.', 'University of Colorado Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO.', 'Integrated Department of Immunology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO.', 'University of Colorado Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO.']",['eng'],"['R01 AG066544/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL131477/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197697/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AG000279/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG067584/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 CA210383/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 HL138754/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008497/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK119394/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,PMC8094119,,,2021/04/30 06:00,2021/10/02 06:00,['2021/04/29 17:37'],"['2020/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/11 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/29 17:37 [entrez]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['212039 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20200560 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2021 Jun 7;218(6). pii: 212039. doi: 10.1084/jem.20200560.,20211001,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage/physiology', 'Gene Expression/physiology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/metabolism', 'Interleukin-1beta/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism']",['(c) 2021 Higa et al.'],,,,,['Disclosures: The authors declare no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to establish the Human Leukemia (HL-60) cells lipidomic and biological patterns when cryo-preserved in DMSO alone and with 300 microM Nigerose (Nig), 200 microM Salidroside (Sal) or a combination of Nig (150 microM) and Sal (100 microM). METHODS: HL-60 cells were pre-incubated with Nig/Sal prior, during and post cryopreservation, and subjected to global lipidomic analysis. Malondialdeyhde (MDA), released lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reactive oxygen scavenger (ROS) measurements were also carried out to evaluate levels of lipid peroxidation and cytotoxicity. RESULTS: Cryopreserving HL-60 cells in DMSO with Nig and Sal provided optimal protection against unsaturated fatty acid oxidation. Post-thaw, cellular phospholipids and mitochondrial cardiolipins were increased by Nig/Sal as the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids 2.08 +/- 0.03 and 0.95 +/- 0.09 folds respectively in comparison to cells cryopreserved in DMSO alone (0.49 +/- 0.05 and 0.86 +/- 0.10 folds). HL-60 lipid peroxidation levels in the presence of DMSO + Nig and Sal combined were significantly reduced relative to pre-cryopreservation levels (10.91 +/- 2.13 nmole) compared to DMSO (17.1 +/- 3.96 nmole). DMSO + Nig/Sal combined also significantly reduced cell cytotoxicity post-thaw (0.0128 +/- 0.00182 mU/mL) in comparison to DMSO (0.0164 +/- 0.00126 mU/mL). The combination of Nig/Sal also reduced significantly ROS levels to the levels of prior cryopreservation of HL-60. CONCLUSION: Overall, the establishment of the cryopreserved HL-60 cells lipidomic and the corresponding biological profiles showed an improved cryo-formulation in the presence of DMSO with the Nig/Sal combination by protecting the, mitochondrial inner membrane, unsaturated fatty acid components (i. e. Cardiolipins) and total phospholipids.","['Straka, Marc-Sebastian F', 'Al-Otaibi, Noha Abdullah', 'Whitfield, Philip D', 'Doherty, Mary K', 'Matarese, Bruno F E', 'Slater, Nigel K H', 'Rahmoune, Hassan']","['Straka MF', 'Al-Otaibi NA', 'Whitfield PD', 'Doherty MK', 'Matarese BFE', 'Slater NKH', 'Rahmoune H']",,"['Department of Chemical Engineering & Biotechnology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering & Biotechnology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Lipidomics Research Facility, University of the Highlands and Islands, Inverness, UK.', 'Lipidomics Research Facility, University of the Highlands and Islands, Inverness, UK.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering & Biotechnology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Physics, University of Cambridge, Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering & Biotechnology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering & Biotechnology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK, hr288@cam.ac.uk.']",['eng'],['King Abdul Aziz City for Science and Technology/Saudi Arabia'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,,['NOTNLM'],['Cryopreservation; Dimethylsulfoxide; Nigerose; Salidroside; Cardiolipins'],2021/04/30 06:00,2021/08/12 06:00,['2021/04/29 12:46'],"['2021/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/29 12:46 [entrez]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.33594/000000360 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2021 Apr 30;55(2):206-221. doi: 10.33594/000000360.,20210811,"['0 (Cardiolipins)', '0 (Disaccharides)', '0 (Glucosides)', '0 (Phenols)', '0WN3D69UW4 (laminaribiose)', 'M983H6N1S9 (rhodioloside)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cardiolipins/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cryopreservation', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Disaccharides/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Glucosides/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Phenols/pharmacology']",['(c) Copyright by the Author(s).

Many women after experiencing multiple attempts of assisted reproductive techniques fail to get implantation because of instability of leukaemia inhibitory factor and leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor-signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 (LIF-LIFR STAT3) signalling cascade. Therefore, this study explores the association of ovarian steroids, LIF and LIFR stop-gained variant using the tetra primer amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (TARMS-PCR) with unexplained infertility (UEX-IF) among Pakistani women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a case-control study, a total of 81 unexplained infertile women and 162 fertile controls (with age and BMI matched) were inducted. Serum estradiol, progesterone and LIF were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). T-ARMS-PCR was designed using Primer 1 software. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and amplified using T-ARMS-PCR followed by sequencing for validation and comprehensive concordance. RESULTS: This study established differences in LIF levels (chi(2) = 9.857, P < .05) between patients and controls as well as explored the decreased LIF significantly raised the risk of UEX-IF (OR = 2.316; 95% CI = 1.214, 4.416). Progesterone (P) was significantly associated with UEX-IF between fertile and infertile counterparts (chi(2) = 20.347, P < .05). It was also observed that increased Progesterone reduced the risk of UEX-IF (OR = 0.306; 95% CI = 0.166, 0.567). A rapid and inexpensive method for genotyping novel LIFR gene polymorphism through T- ARMS-PCR was successfully developed. LIFR gene SNP (rs121912501) had significant association (chi(2) = 200.681, P < .05) with UEX-IF. LIFR rs121912501 ""TT"" genotype (OR = 5.417; 95% CI = 1.868, 15.709) and ""CT"" genotype (OR = 3.104, 95% CI = 1.586,6.076) were at increased risk of infertility. CONCLUSION: UEX-IF can be caused by LIFR gene variation irrespective of increased P. It may open the doors for the discovery of new management plans for infertile women.","['Ali, Rabiya', 'Iqbal, Mehir Un Nisa', 'Rehman, Rehana', 'Khan, Taseer A']","['Ali R', 'Iqbal MUN', 'Rehman R', 'Khan TA']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8987-8877', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3844-4750']","['Department of Physiology, Karachi Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), CMH, Malir Cantt, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210519,England,Int J Clin Pract,International journal of clinical practice,9712381,,,,2021/04/30 06:00,2021/07/10 06:00,['2021/04/29 12:43'],"['2021/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/29 12:43 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijcp.14245 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Pract. 2021 Jul;75(7):e14245. doi: 10.1111/ijcp.14245.

This phase I dose-escalation trial assessed the safety and preliminary clinical activity of selinexor, an oral exportin-1 (XPO1) inhibitor, in combination with FLAG-Ida in younger R/R AML patients. The aim was to find the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Fourteen patients were included, and selinexor dosage was 60 mg (3 patients), 80 mg (3 patients), and 100 mg (7 patients) weekly. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported. Grade >/=3 non-hematologic adverse events (AEs) occurred in 78.6% of patients. Two patients were non MTD evaluable due to early death, and overall, 3 out of 14 patients (21.4%) had fatal AEs. Five out of 12 (42%) response and MTD evaluable patients achieved a complete remission (CR; n=4) or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi, n=1), and 4 patients (33%) subsequently underwent allogeneic transplantation. The median overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 6.0 (range 0.9-19.3) and 1.1 months (range 0.7-19.3), respectively. Using selinexor 100 mg/weekly, CR/CRi rate of 66.7%, OS 13.6 months (range, 1.6-19.3), and EFS 10.6 months (range, 0.9-19.3). At last follow-up, 3 patients were alive. Selinexor 100 mg/weekly with FLAG-Ida combination in R/R AML showed acceptable tolerability and efficacy, establishing the RP2D of this regimen in future clinical trials.

The most common mutation is the internal tandem duplication (ITD). We present a novel mutation, FLT-3/Q575Delta, identified in a patient with AML through next-generation sequencing (NGS). This mutation is activating, drives downstream signaling comparable to FLT-3/ITD, and can be targeted using available FLT-3 TKIs. We present the results of a systematic analysis that identified Y572Delta, E573Delta, and S574Delta as similarly activating and targetable deletions located in the FLT-3 juxtamembrane domain (JMD). These mutations target key residues in the JMD involved in the interactions within FLT-3 that regulate its activation. Our results suggest a new class of FLT-3 mutations that may have an impact on patient care and highlight the increasing importance of a systematic understanding of FLT-3 mutations other than ITD. It is likely that, as NGS becomes more commonly used in the diagnosis of patients with AML, these and other activating mutations will be discovered with increasing frequency.","['Young, David J', 'Nguyen, Bao', 'Zhu, Ruiqi', 'Seo, Jaesung', 'Li, Li', 'Levis, Mark J', 'Pratz, Keith W', 'Duffield, Amy S', 'Small, Donald']","['Young DJ', 'Nguyen B', 'Zhu R', 'Seo J', 'Li L', 'Levis MJ', 'Pratz KW', 'Duffield AS', 'Small D']",,"['Department of Oncology.', 'Department of Pediatrics, and.', 'Department of Oncology.', 'Department of Oncology.', 'Department of Oncology.', 'Department of Oncology.', 'Department of Oncology.', 'Department of Oncology.', 'Department of Oncology.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Oncology.', 'Department of Pediatrics, and.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA090668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA060441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC8114556,,,2021/04/30 06:00,2021/06/01 06:00,['2021/04/29 12:26'],"['2020/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/29 12:26 [entrez]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(21)00291-3 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002876 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2021 May 11;5(9):2285-2293. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002876.,20210531,['EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)'],IM,"['Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', '*fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we evaluated the characteristics and prognostic significance of gene mutations in refractory/relapsed (R/R) AML patients by comparing their gene mutation spectrum to those newly diagnosed. The frequencies of tumor suppressor mutations were increased, while the mutation frequencies of nucleophosmin and spliceosome complex were decreased in relapsed AML. The frequency of FLT3-ITD mutation was increased, while that of CEBPA biallelic mutation decreased in refractory AML. Activated signaling mutations predicted a lower complete remission rate. FLT3-ITD mutation predicted an inferior overall survival after relapse. DNMT3A mutation predicted an inferior relapse-free survival in R/R AML. These findings may shed light on the molecular mechanism study of leukemia refractory or relapse and provide new guidance for the dynamic risk assessment of AML.","['Wang, Mengzhen', 'Wang, Ruiqi', 'Wang, Hong', 'Chen, Chongjian', 'Qin, Jiayue', 'Gao, Xiaoning', 'Yu, Li']","['Wang M', 'Wang R', 'Wang H', 'Chen C', 'Qin J', 'Gao X', 'Yu L']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9473-3525', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4721-0016', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6872-2665']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Annoroad Gene Technology Co, Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area, Beijing, China.', 'Annoroad Gene Technology Co, Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, International Cancer Center, Shenzhen Key Laboratory, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Clinical Medical Academy, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210429,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*gene mutations', '*next-generation sequencing', '*refractory', '*relapse']",2021/04/30 06:00,2021/11/03 06:00,['2021/04/29 08:40'],"['2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/03 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/29 08:40 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2021.1919661 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2021 Oct;62(10):2416-2427. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2021.1919661.

While the RPP has been proven successful, there is still a compelling need for further improvement. Cyclo olefin polymer (COP) is a plastic material widely utilized due to its properties including its low protein absorption. We applied this as a raw material for RPP cell culture to see if the COP is suitable. A recombinant CHO cell line expressing the human erythropoietin (hEPO) gene under the control of the Moloney murine leukemia virus-long terminal repeat (MMLV-LTR) was established. When the cells were cultured in a dish made from COP, the cells attached to the bottom, and then started to float and form spheroids. RNASeq data analysis suggested the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was triggered with receptor tyrosine kinase activation shortly after cultivation. It coincided with the hEPO transcription increase. After the cell floating, though EMT marker gene expression subsided, a hEPO expression increase sustained. When fibronectin was applied to COP dish surface, the cell floating was suppressed and hEPO expression decreased. We then treated cells with MbetaCD, a drug that destroys the lipid raft, eliminating molecules in the raft. This facilitated cell floating and spheroid formation coincided with hEPO expression enhancement. These results suggest interactions between a cell and COP surface might trigger the EMT and the subsequent event, both of which activated the MMLV-LTR promoter. Thus, employing COP for culturing cells, a potent RPP system could be established with its advantage for efficient protein purification.","['Hirano, Takaaki', 'Adachi, Satoru', 'Ichimura, Naoya', 'Kasai, Akira', 'Kobayashi, Masashi', 'Okuda, Takashi', 'Ogawa, Ryohei', 'Kagiya, Go']","['Hirano T', 'Adachi S', 'Ichimura N', 'Kasai A', 'Kobayashi M', 'Okuda T', 'Ogawa R', 'Kagiya G']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8579-875X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8092-3785']","['R&D Center, Zeon Corporation, Kyoto, Japan.', 'R&D Center, Zeon Corporation, Kyoto, Japan.', 'R&D Center, Zeon Corporation, Kyoto, Japan.', 'R&D Center, Zeon Corporation, Kyoto, Japan.', 'R&D Center, Zeon Corporation, Kyoto, Japan.', 'R&D Center, Zeon Corporation, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Division of Radiation Oncology, Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Academic Assembly, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'School of Allied Health Sciences, Kitasato University, Sagamihara, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210531,United States,Biotechnol Prog,Biotechnology progress,8506292,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat (MMLV-LTR)', '*cyclo olefin polymer (COP)', '*epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)', '*recombinant protein production (RPP) technology']",2021/04/30 06:00,2021/04/30 06:00,['2021/04/29 06:54'],"['2021/04/06 00:00 [revised]', '2021/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/29 06:54 [entrez]']",['10.1002/btpr.3159 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Prog. 2021 Jul;37(4):e3159. doi: 10.1002/btpr.3159.

Common side effects like atrial fibrillation (AF), bleeding and infections might be caused by ibrutinib's inhibition of other kinases in non-B cells. Five-year follow-up of plasma biomarkers by proximity extension assay and immune cell numbers by flow cytometry during ibrutinib treatment revealed that 86 of the 265 investigated plasma biomarkers significantly changed during treatment, 74 of which decreased. Among the 12 markers that increased, 6 are associated with cardiovascular diseases and therefore potentially involved in ibrutinib-induced AF. Comparison between healthy donors and X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) patients, who have nonfunctional BTK and essentially lack B cells, showed indicative changes in 53 of the 265 biomarkers while none differed significantly. Hence, neither B cells nor BTK-dependent pathways in other cells seem to influence the levels of the studied plasma biomarkers in healthy donors. Regarding immune cells, the absolute number of T cells, including subsets, decreased, paralleling the decreasing tumor burden. T helper 1 (Th1) cell numbers dropped strongly, while Th2 cells remained relatively stable, causing Th2-skewing. Thus, long-term ibrutinib treatment has a profound impact on the plasma proteome and immune cells in patients with CLL.","['Mulder, Tom A', 'Pena-Perez, Lucia', 'Berglof, Anna', 'Meinke, Stephan', 'Estupinan, H Yesid', 'Heimersson, Kia', 'Zain, Rula', 'Mansson, Robert', 'Smith, C I Edvard', 'Palma, Marzia']","['Mulder TA', 'Pena-Perez L', 'Berglof A', 'Meinke S', 'Estupinan HY', 'Heimersson K', 'Zain R', 'Mansson R', 'Smith CIE', 'Palma M']",,"['Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine (HERM), Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Research Center, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Research Center, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Basicas, Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Research Center, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Centre for Rare Diseases, Department of Clinical Genetics, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine (HERM), Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Research Center, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Lymphoma Unit, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210426,United States,Hemasphere,HemaSphere,101740619,PMC8078281,,,2021/04/30 06:00,2021/04/30 06:01,['2021/04/29 06:33'],"['2020/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/29 06:33 [entrez]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1097/HS9.0000000000000564 [doi]'],epublish,Hemasphere. 2021 Apr 26;5(5):e564. doi: 10.1097/HS9.0000000000000564. eCollection 2021 May.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

Little is known about the long-term impact on kidney outcomes in this population despite the close relationship between kidney function and malignancy treatment eligibility. The purpose of this population-based cohort study was to determine the effect of AKI on kidney function in the year following a new diagnosis of acute leukemia or lymphoma. Methods: Participants were adults hospitalized within 3 weeks of malignancy diagnosis. Baseline kidney function was determined and AKI diagnosed using standardized criteria. Cox proportional hazard modeling examined the relationship between AKI and a >/=30% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline in the 1 year following hospitalization as the primary endpoint. Results: AKI occurred in 33% of 1064 participants, with 70% of episodes occurring within 48 hours of hospitalization, and significantly increased risk for a >/= 30% decline in eGFR (hazard ratio [HR] 2.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2-3.5) and incident chronic kidney disease (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.7-2.8). AKI remained a significant predictor of eGFR decline in subgroup and multivariable analyses (adjusted HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4-2.7). A >/= 30% decline in eGFR increased the risk for death within 1 year in participants with AKI (HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.3). Conclusion: Results aid in identifying individuals at highest risk for poor outcomes and highlight the need for research involving interventions that preserve kidney function from the time of initial hospitalization with a hematologic malignancy into the postdischarge period.","['May, Heather P', 'Barreto, Erin F', 'Mara, Kristin C', 'McCullough, Kristen B', 'Patnaik, Mrinal S', 'Leung, Nelson', 'Habermann, Thomas M']","['May HP', 'Barreto EF', 'Mara KC', 'McCullough KB', 'Patnaik MS', 'Leung N', 'Habermann TM']",,"['Department of Pharmacy, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Robert D. and Patricia E.

Method: All GN with fibrillar deposits of IgG and apparent light chain restriction on standard immunofluorescence on frozen tissue (IF-F) accessioned at the Columbia Renal Pathology Laboratory from 2012 to 2019 were identified. Additional studies including staining for Congo red, DNAJB9, IgG subtypes, and immunofluorescence on pronase-digested paraffin sections (IF-P) were performed. Result: Based on the results, biopsy samples were reclassified as polytypic DNAJB9-positive fibrillary glomerulonephritis (pFGN, n = 14), monotypic DNAJB9-positive FGN (mFGN, n = 7), GN with polytypic DNAJB9-negative fibrillar IgG deposits (n = 2), and GN with monotypic DNAJB9-negative fibrillar IgG deposits (n = 6). Among DNAJB9-positive FGN samples, IgG subtype staining was able to exclude monotypic deposits by demonstrating reactivity for >/=2 IgG subtypes (usually IgG1 and IgG4) in 67% (14 of 21), including 9 that would have been misclassified as monotypic by IF-F and IF-P alone. Monotypic DNAJB9-positive fibrillary glomerulonephritis (FGN) was not associated with monoclonal gammopathy in 5 of 6 patients. GN with monotypic DNAJB9-negative fibrillar IgG deposits exhibited focal parallel fibril alignment and frequent association with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but lacked the diagnostic microtubules of immunotactoid GN.

Spores may be inhaled, causing rhinocerebral or pulmonary infections, or gastrointestinal infections if swallowed. Less often, cutaneous mucormycosis develops after inoculation via broken skin. Presentation: A 72-year old male on ibrutinib and prednisone for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) presented with localized, right forearm cutaneous mucormycosis at the site of a dog-scratch sustained three weeks prior. The patient failed to respond to cephalexin as an outpatient, prompting biopsy showing ribbon-like pseudo septate hyphae and possible vascular invasion suggestive of Mucorales. Treatment course included liposomal amphotericin B 5mg/kg IV every 24h for ten days followed by a 90-day course of posaconazole 300mg daily after general surgery consultation was sought. Conclusion: We outline the second reported case of localized cutaneous mucormycosis arising in the setting of ibrutinib use. Because the combination of immunosuppressed states, ibrutinib and skin trauma may serve as a nidus for mucormycosis, practitioners should be vigilant of thorough skin evaluations in these patients and appropriate anti-fungal treatment. Although amphotericin B has been well studied as first line therapy, oral posaconazole has been shown as an efficacious second-line treatment.","['Sittig, Katherine R', 'Laageide, Leah G', 'Akhtar, Zaheer', 'Wall, Geoffrey C', 'Kumar, Sudhir C']","['Sittig KR', 'Laageide LG', 'Akhtar Z', 'Wall GC', 'Kumar SC']",,"['Department of Medicine, UnityPoint Health, Des Moines, IA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, UnityPoint Health, Des Moines, IA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, UnityPoint Health, Des Moines, IA, USA.', 'Drake College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Des Moines, IA, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, UnityPoint Health, Des Moines, IA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210412,Netherlands,IDCases,IDCases,101634540,PMC8065302,['NOTNLM'],"['14-alpha demethylase inhibitors', 'AFB, Acid-Fast Bacilli', 'Antifungal agents', ""BTK, Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase"", 'CLL, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'CNS, Central Nervous System', 'Chronic', 'IVIG, Intravenous Immunoglobulin', 'Ibrutinib', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphocytic', 'Mucormycosis', 'PAS, Periodic Acid Schiff', 'PCP, Primary Care Physician', 'PCR, Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Posaconazole']",2021/04/30 06:00,2021/04/30 06:01,['2021/04/29 06:28'],"['2021/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/06 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/29 06:28 [entrez]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.idcr.2021.e01120 [doi]', 'S2214-2509(21)00076-7 [pii]']",epublish,IDCases. 2021 Apr 12;24:e01120. doi: 10.1016/j.idcr.2021.e01120. eCollection 2021.,,,,,['(c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.'],,,,,"['The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.

Due to high toxicity, it has been progressively replaced with new specific regimens with a better safety profile (GELA protocol for MCL, BURKIMAB for BL and PETHEMA for B-cell and T-cell ALL). The objective of this study is to analyse the toxicity and infectious complications of these therapeutic regimens, as well as the event free survival (EFS). Patients and methods: This is a retrospective and descriptive observational study of 81 patients, comparing 42 patients treated with H-CVAD/MTX-AraC (group A) versus 39 patients treated with GELA/BURKIMAB/PETHEMA (group B). Results: All patients in group A developed pancytopenia, but in group B 74.4% neutropenia, 51.3% thrombocytopenia and 69.2% anaemia. The total number of infections in group A was higher than in group B: 154 versus 48, 3.67 versus 1.23 per patient and 0.59 versus 0.25 per cycle. Likewise, febrile neutropenia happened: 106 versus 21 cases, 2.52 versus 0.52 per patient and 0.41 versus 0.11 per cycle. EVS is higher in group B: 33% versus 79% (2-year), and 24% versus 69% (5-year). Conclusions: Current therapeutic protocols have shown higher EFS due to better safety profile, with less haematological, neurological and haemorrhagic toxicity, as well as lower rates of infectious complications.","['Marin-Sanchez, Alberto', 'Martinez-Fernandez, Gonzalo', 'Gomez-Catalan, Irene', 'Montoya-Morcillo, Mari Carmen', 'Algarra, Jesus Lorenzo', 'Garcia, Angela Ibanez', 'Hernandez-Fernandez, Francisco', 'Romero-Macias, Juan Ramon']","['Marin-Sanchez A', 'Martinez-Fernandez G', 'Gomez-Catalan I', 'Montoya-Morcillo MC', 'Algarra JL', 'Garcia AI', 'Hernandez-Fernandez F', 'Romero-Macias JR']",,"['Haematology Department, Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Albacete, Calle Hermanos Falco 37, 02008 Albacete, Spain.', 'Nephrology Department, Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia, Murcia, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Albacete, Calle Hermanos Falco 37, 02008 Albacete, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Albacete, Calle Hermanos Falco 37, 02008 Albacete, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Albacete, Calle Hermanos Falco 37, 02008 Albacete, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Albacete, Calle Hermanos Falco 37, 02008 Albacete, Spain.', 'Neurology Department, Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Albacete, Calle Hermanos Falco 37, 02008 Albacete, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Albacete, Calle Hermanos Falco 37, 02008 Albacete, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210322,England,Ecancermedicalscience,Ecancermedicalscience,101392236,PMC8057780,['NOTNLM'],"['blood cancers', 'infections', 'toxicity']",2021/04/30 06:00,2021/04/30 06:01,['2021/04/29 06:26'],"['2020/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/29 06:26 [entrez]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3332/ecancer.2021.1206 [doi]', 'can-15-1206 [pii]']",epublish,Ecancermedicalscience. 2021 Mar 22;15:1206. doi: 10.3332/ecancer.2021.1206. eCollection 2021.,,,,,['(c) the authors; licensee ecancermedicalscience.'],,,,,['The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monitoring the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire can provide insights into T-cell adaptive immunity. Previous studies found skewed TCR repertoires in MDS compared to healthy patients; however these studies that leverage mRNA-based spectratyping have limitations. Furthermore, evaluating the TCR repertoire in context of hypomethylating agents (HMAs) treatment can provide insights into the dynamics of T-cell mediated responses in MDS. We conducted immunosequencing of the CDR3 regions of TCRbeta chains in bone marrows of 11 MDS patients prior to treatment (n=11 bone marrows prior to treatment), and in at least 2 timepoints for each patient following treatment (n=26 bone marrow aspirates post-treatment) with (HMA), alongside analyzing bone marrows from 4 healthy donors as controls. TCR repertoires in MDS patients were more clonal and less diverse than healthy donors. However, unlike previous reports, we did not observe significant skewness in CDR3 length or spectratyping. The global metrics of TCR profiling including richness, clonality, overlaps were not significantly changed in responders or non-responders following treatment with HMAs. However, we found an emergence of novel clonotypes in MDS patients who responded to treatment, while non-responders had a higher frequency of contracted clonotypes following treatment. By applying GLIPH2 for antigen prediction, we found rare TCR specificity clusters shared by TCR clonotypes from different patients at pre- or following treatment. Our data show clear differences in TCR repertoires of MDS compared with healthy patients and that novel TCR clonotype emergence in response to HMA therapy was correlated with response. This suggests that response to HMA therapy may be partially driven by T-cell mediated immunity and that the immune-based therapies, which target the adaptive immune system, may play a significant role in select patients with MDS.","['Abbas, Hussein A', 'Reville, Patrick K', 'Jiang, Xianli', 'Yang, Hui', 'Reuben, Alexandre', 'Im, Jin Seon', 'Little, Latasha', 'Sinson, Jefferson C', 'Chen, Ken', 'Futreal, Andrew', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Abbas HA', 'Reville PK', 'Jiang X', 'Yang H', 'Reuben A', 'Im JS', 'Little L', 'Sinson JC', 'Chen K', 'Futreal A', 'Garcia-Manero G']",,"['Division of Cancer Medicine, Medical Oncology Fellowship, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Medical Oncology Fellowship, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Thoracic/Head & Neck Medical Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210412,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC8072464,['NOTNLM'],"['*T-cell repertoire', '*antigen recognition', '*clonality', '*diversity', '*myelodysplastic syndrome']",2021/04/30 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2021/04/29 06:26'],"['2021/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/29 06:26 [entrez]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.659625 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Apr 12;12:659625. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.659625. eCollection 2021.,20211018,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/genetics/immunology', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Decitabine/*therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*genetics/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics/immunology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Abbas, Reville, Jiang, Yang, Reuben, Im, Little, Sinson, Chen,', 'Futreal and Garcia-Manero.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We introduce the Emicro-Hnrnpk mouse model, a murine model characterized by hnRNP K overexpression in B cells, which develops B-cell lymphomas with high penetrance. Molecular analysis of the disease developed in this model reveals an upregulation of the c-Myc oncogene via post-transcriptional and translational mechanisms underscoring the impact of non-genomic MYC activation in B-cell lymphomas.

Exposure to antigens seems to play a role in malignant transformation and in the selection and expansion of more aggressive CLL clones. Furthermore, a biased usage of particular IGHV gene subgroups and the existence of stereotyped B-cell receptors (BCRs) are distinctive characteristics of human CLL. We have previously described that Traf2DN/BCL2 double-transgenic (tg, (+/+)) mice develop CLL/SLL with high incidence with aging. In this model, TNF-Receptor Associated Factor (TRAF)-2 deficiency cooperates with B cell lymphoma (BCL)-2 in promoting CLL/SLL in mice by specifically enforcing marginal zone (MZ) B cell differentiation and rendering B cells independent of BAFF for survival. In this report, we have performed the sequencing of the IGHV-D-J rearrangements of B cell clones from the Traf2DN/BCL2-tg(+/+) mice with CLL/SLL. The results indicate that these mice develop oligoclonal and monoclonal B cell expansions. Allotransplantation of the oligoclonal populations into immunodeficient mice resulted in the preferential expansion of one of the parental clones. The analysis of the IGHV sequences indicated that 15% were mutated (M) and 85% unmutated (UM). Furthermore, while the Traf2DN/BCL2-tg(-/-) (wild-type), (-/+) (BCL2 single-tg) and (+/-) (Traf2DNDN single-tg) littermates showed the expression of various IGHV gene subgroups, the CLL/SLL expanded clones from the Traf2DN/BCL2-tg(+/+) (double-transgenic) mice showed a more restricted IGHV gene subgroup usage and an overrepresentation of particular IGHV genes. In addition, the HCDR3-encoded protein sequence indicates the existence of stereotyped immunoglobulin (Ig) in the BCRs and strong similarities with BCR recognizing autoantigens and pathogen-associated antigens. Altogether, these results highlight the remarkable similarities between the CLL/SLL developed by the Traf2DN/BCL2-tg(+/+) mice and its human counterpart.","['Perez-Chacon, Gema', 'Zapata, Juan M']","['Perez-Chacon G', 'Zapata JM']",,"['Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas ""Alberto Sols"", CSIC-UAM, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Hospital Universitario La Paz (IDIPAZ), Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas ""Alberto Sols"", CSIC-UAM, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Hospital Universitario La Paz (IDIPAZ), Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210412,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC8072112,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCL2', '*BCR stereotipy', '*CLL', '*IGHV', '*TRAF2', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*small lymphocytic lymphoma']",2021/04/30 06:00,2021/09/21 06:00,['2021/04/29 06:25'],"['2020/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/29 06:25 [entrez]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.627602 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Apr 12;12:627602. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.627602. eCollection 2021.,20210920,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 2)', '0 (TRAF2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/chemistry/*genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 2/genetics']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Perez-Chacon and Zapata.'],,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then the current work aimed to provide pure L-asparaginase with in-vitro efficacy against various human carcinomas without adverse effects related to current L-asparaginase formulations. Submerged fermentation (SMF) bioprocess was applied and improved to maximize L-asparaginase production from Fusarium equiseti AHMF4 as alternative sources of bacteria. The enzyme production in SMF was maximized to reach 40.78 U mL(-1) at the 7th day of fermentation with initial pH 7.0, incubation temperature 30 degrees C, 1.0% glucose as carbon source, 0.2% asparagine as nitrogen source, 0.1% alanine as amino acid supplement and 0.1% KH2PO4. The purification of AHMF4 L-asparaginase yielded 2.67-fold purification and 48% recovery with final specific activity of 488.1 U mg(-1) of protein. Purified L-asparaginase was characterized as serine protease enzyme with molecular weight of 45.7 kDa beside stability at neutral pH and between 20 and 40 degrees C. Interestingly, purified L-asparaginase showed promising DPPH radical scavenging activity (IC50 69.12 mug mL(-1)) and anti-proliferative activity against cervical epitheloid carcinoma (Hela), epidermoid larynx carcinoma (Hep-2), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG-2), Colorectal carcinoma (HCT-116), and breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) with IC50 equal to 2.0, 5.0, 12.40, 8.26 and 22.8 mug mL(-1), respectively. The enzyme showed higher activity, selectivity and anti-proliferative activity against cancerous cells along with tiny cytotoxicity toward normal cells (WI-38) which indicates that it has selective toxicity and it could be applied as a less toxic alternative to the current formulations.","['El-Gendy, Mervat Morsy Abbas Ahmed', 'Awad, Mohamed F', 'El-Shenawy, Fareed Shawky', 'El-Bondkly, Ahmed Mohamed Ahmed']","['El-Gendy MMAA', 'Awad MF', 'El-Shenawy FS', 'El-Bondkly AMA']",,"['Chemistry of Natural and Microbial Products Department, National Research Centre, Dokki, Giza 12622, Egypt.', 'Department of Biology, College of Science, Taif University, P.O.

Methods: A cohort state-transition model, with 12 health-states, was used to estimate the lifetime accumulated cost and benefits in terms of quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) in AML patients with favourable, intermediate, and unknown cytogenetic profiles. Patient profile was defined based on the ALFA-0701 trial. Therapeutic regimens were defined by 5 haematologists. SOC was assumed to be idarubicin and cytarabine, the combination most used in Spain. QALYs were estimated by applying utilities for the time spent by the cohort in each health-state and utility decrements associated with adverse events (AE). Total cost (euro,2020) included drug-acquisition, hematologic stem-cell transplantation, disease management, AE management and end-of-life costs. Unit costs were derived from local databases. All parameters were validated by haematologist. Costs and outcomes were discounted (3%/year). Results: Higher cost/patient (euro177,618 vs euro151,434) and greater QALYs (5,70 vs 4,62) were obtained with GO+SOC vs SOC. The ICUR was euro24,203/QALY gained. Conclusion: This simulation suggests that GO + SOC could be a cost-effective option for treatment of patients with de novo AML in first line.","['Mareque, Maria', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Font, Patricia', 'Guinea, Jose Maria', 'de la Fuente, Adolfo', 'Soto, Javier', 'Oyaguez, Itziar', 'Brockbank, James', 'Iglesias, Tamara', 'Llinares, Julia', 'Sierra, Jorge']","['Mareque M', 'Montesinos P', 'Font P', 'Guinea JM', 'de la Fuente A', 'Soto J', 'Oyaguez I', 'Brockbank J', 'Iglesias T', 'Llinares J', 'Sierra J']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7726-9030', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3047-6152', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5349-6017']","['Pharmacoeconomics & Outcomes Research Iberia (PORIB), Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Organizacion Sanitaria Integrada Araba, Pais Vasco, Spain.', 'Hospital MD Anderson, Madrid, Spain.', 'Pfizer, Madrid, Spain.', 'Pharmacoeconomics & Outcomes Research Iberia (PORIB), Madrid, Spain.', 'RTI Health Solutions, Manchester, UK.', 'Pfizer, Madrid, Spain.', 'Pfizer, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario de La Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210422,New Zealand,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,ClinicoEconomics and outcomes research : CEOR,101560564,PMC8075179,['NOTNLM'],"['Spain', 'acute myeloid leukaemia', 'cost-effectiveness', 'gemtuzumab ozogamicin']",2021/04/30 06:00,2021/04/30 06:01,['2021/04/29 06:23'],"['2021/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/29 06:23 [entrez]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CEOR.S302097 [doi]', '302097 [pii]']",epublish,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res. 2021 Apr 22;13:263-277. doi: 10.2147/CEOR.S302097. eCollection 2021.,,,,,['(c) 2021 Mareque et al.'],,,,,"['Pau Montesinos, Patricia Font, Jorge Sierra, Adolfo de la Fuente and Jose Maria', 'Guinea have received honoraria from Pfizer for advocacy tasks related to this', 'project.

In this exploratory study, we aimed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of the AS4S4 formula in children. Methods: Eleven newly diagnosed and one relapsed pediatric patient (4-14 years of age) treated with the AS4S4 formula were included. Blood samples were collected from 12 children, and drug concentrations were quantified by ICP-MS. Population pharmacokinetic analysis and Monte-Carlo simulation were performed using NONMEM software. Toxic effects were graded according to the NCI-CTCAE, Version 3. Results: A total of 107 arsenic concentrations (0.1-75.0 microg L(-1)) were used for population pharmacokinetic analysis. The median (range) of estimated weight-normalized CL and volume distribution at steady-state were 45.26 (35.63-82.18) L h(-1) kg(-1) and 230.37 (85.96-495.68) L kg(-1), respectively. No patients discontinued AS4S4 treatment owing to adverse events, and there were no drug-related adverse events over grades 3-4. All newly diagnosed APL patients were in MCR with a median follow-up of 28 months (range, 23 to 37 months). Both the estimated 3-year EFS and OS rates were 100%. Conclusion: The pharmacokinetics and safety oral AS4S4 formula was evaluated for the first time in pediatric APL. The pharmacokinetic assessment demonstrated that the dosing regimen of 60 mg/kg/d TID resulted in a higher steady-state through concentration in children than that which was achieved in adults. The results of this study indicate that the AS4S4 formula is safe in newly diagnosed pediatric APL patients.","['Zhang, Li', 'Yang, Xin-Mei', 'Chen, Jing', 'Hu, Lei', 'Yang, Fan', 'Zhou, Yue', 'Zhao, Bei-Bei', 'Zhao, Wei', 'Zhu, Xiao-Fan']","['Zhang L', 'Yang XM', 'Chen J', 'Hu L', 'Yang F', 'Zhou Y', 'Zhao BB', 'Zhao W', 'Zhu XF']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1830-338X'],"[""Department of Pediatric, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Clinical Trial Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Jinan, People's Republic of China."", ""Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Tianjin Institute of Pharmaceutical Research (TIPR), Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatric, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Clinical Trial Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Jinan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatric, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210421,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,PMC8071704,['NOTNLM'],"['Realgar-Indigo Naturalis Formula', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'pediatric', 'population pharmacokinetics', 'safety']",2021/04/30 06:00,2021/11/05 06:00,['2021/04/29 06:22'],"['2021/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/29 06:22 [entrez]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S305244 [doi]', '305244 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2021 Apr 21;15:1633-1640. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S305244. eCollection 2021.,20211104,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Arsenic/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Asians', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies']",['(c) 2021 Zhang et al.'],,,,,"['Li Zhang, Xin-Mei Yang, Jing Chen, Lei Hu, Fan Yang, Yue Zhou, Bei-Bei Zhao, Wei', 'Zhao and Xiao-Fan Zhu declare that they have no conflicts of interest relevant to', 'this article to disclose.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies indicate a cumulative dose of 50mGy triples the risk of leukemia and a dose of 60mGy triples the risk of brain tumors in children. This study aimed to assess the application of ""Justification and Optimization Principles of ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable)"" in pediatric CT. Method: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2017 to July 2018 G.C at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital. CT request forms were reviewed. All pediatric patients listed for CT were included. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS version 25. Results: Four hundred and twenty nine CT requests were reviewed, 246 (57.3%) were males and 183(42.7%) were females; 52(12.1%) were less than 1 year old, 153(35.7%) between 1 to 5 years, 113(26.3%) between 5 to 10 years and 111(25.8%) 10 to 14 years old. On the other hand, 28(6.5%) scan requests were rejected based on the ALARA justification principle, and from these, in 11(39.2%) MRI was recommended instead of CT, in 6(21.42%) US was recommended. Review of previous CT helped to reject 4(14.28%). Review of prior chest radiographs helped in rejecting 2(7.14%) requests. For 5(17.8%) and 19(4.4%), requests were optimized by applying principles of optimization to reduce received dose from CT. Conclusion: Overall, 47(11%) patients were protected from unnecessary radiation exposure by applying the principles of ALARA. The use of other alternating imaging modalities is vital in pediatric patients who are more radiosensitive and have longer time to manifest radiation induced injury.","['Solomon, Daniel Z', 'Ayalew, Bezawit', 'Dellie, Seife T', 'Admasie, Daniel']","['Solomon DZ', 'Ayalew B', 'Dellie ST', 'Admasie D']",,"['Department of Radiology, College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University.', 'Department of Radiology, College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University.', 'Department of Radiology, College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University.', 'Department of Radiology, College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Ethiopia,Ethiop J Health Sci,Ethiopian journal of health sciences,101224773,PMC8047270,['NOTNLM'],"['Justification', 'optimization', 'pediatric CT', 'radiation dose']",2021/04/30 06:00,2021/08/19 06:00,['2021/04/29 06:22'],"['2021/04/29 06:22 [entrez]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.4314/ejhs.v30i5.16 [doi]', 'jEJHS.v30.i5.pg761 [pii]']",ppublish,Ethiop J Health Sci. 2020 Sep;30(5):761-766. doi: 10.4314/ejhs.v30i5.16.,20210818,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Ethiopia', 'Female', '*Hospitals, Teaching', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Pediatrics', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiation Dosage', '*Tomography, X-Ray Computed']","['(c) 2020 Daniel Z.

ICG-001 selectively blocks the interaction of beta-catenin with its transcriptional co-activator cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CBP). Recent studies have provided convincing evidence of the inhibitory effects of ICG-001 on Wnt-driven disease models, such as organ fibrosis, cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and asthma. However, the effects of ICG-001 in atopic dermatitis (AD) have not been investigated. Objective: To investigate whether beta-catenin/CBP-dependent signaling was contributed in the pathogenesis of AD and ICG-001 could be a therapeutic agent for AD. Methods: We examined the effects of ICG-001 in an AD-like murine model generated by repeated topical application of the hapten, oxazolone (Ox). ICG-001 or vehicle alone was injected intraperitoneally every day during the development of AD-like dermatitis arising from once-daily Ox treatment. Results: Ox-induced AD-like dermatitis characterized by increases in transepidermal water loss, epidermal thickness, dermal thickness accompanied by increased myofibroblast and mast cell counts, and serum levels of thymic stromal lymphopoietin and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine, and decreases in stratum corneum hydration, were virtually normalized by the treatment with ICG-001. Elevated serum levels of periostin tended to be downregulated, without statistical significance. Conclusion: These results suggest that beta-catenin/CBP-dependent signaling might be involved in the pathogenesis of AD and could be a therapeutic target.","['Matsuda-Hirose, Haruna', 'Yamate, Tomoko', 'Goto, Mizuki', 'Katoh, Akira', 'Kouji, Hiroyuki', 'Yamamoto, Yuya', 'Sakai, Takashi', 'Uemura, Naoto', 'Kobayashi, Takashi', 'Hatano, Yutaka']","['Matsuda-Hirose H', 'Yamate T', 'Goto M', 'Katoh A', 'Kouji H', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Sakai T', 'Uemura N', 'Kobayashi T', 'Hatano Y']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4821-4406', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8586-7783', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7225-5270', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4517-7670', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1908-8578', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9351-0856', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7128-3237', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3722-8979', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9069-5736', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1349-755X']","['Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Oita, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Oita, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Oita, Japan.', 'Translational Chemical Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Oita, Japan.', 'Translational Chemical Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Oita, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Oita, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Oita, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Oita, Japan.', 'Department of Infectious Disease Control, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Oita, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Oita, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191031,Korea (South),Ann Dermatol,Annals of dermatology,8916577,PMC7992594,['NOTNLM'],"['Atopic dermatitis', 'Mouse', 'Therapy']",2019/12/01 00:00,2019/12/01 00:01,['2021/04/29 06:21'],"['2019/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/29 06:21 [entrez]', '2019/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.5021/ad.2019.31.6.631 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Dermatol. 2019 Dec;31(6):631-639. doi: 10.5021/ad.2019.31.6.631.

Although synchronous angiosarcoma and Kaposi sarcoma have been documented, to our knowledge, the coexistence of these vascular malignancies with underlying chronic lymphocytic leukemia has not been previously reported. A 51-year-old male patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with Kaposi sarcoma located on his left ankle. Shortly after, the patient presented with de novo lesions located on the plantar region of the right foot, reported as angiosarcoma.

A Prospective Study.,e2034542,10.25100/cm.v52i1.4542 [doi],"Background: Acute leukemias are the most frequent malignancies in children. Advances in treatment have improved the overall survival to 80%. Almost 10% of children with cancer develop clinical cardiac toxicity. Total anthracycline cumulative dose is a risk factor for early-onset cardiotoxicity. Objective: To describe the incidence of early-onset cardiotoxicity in children with acute leukemia treated with chemotherapy. Methods: A prospective descriptive study of patients >1 y and <18 years diagnosed with acute leukemia. Assessed with electrocardiograma, echocardiography, and blood biomarkers at diagnosis and during the follow-up. Results: 94 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 18 with acute myeloid leukemia were included. 20 patients (17.9%) developed early-onset cardiotoxicity. Statistically significant data was seen after anthracycline dose >150 mg/m(2), between the first echocardiographic evaluation and posterior analyses in the left ventricular fraction ejection with Teicholz p 0.05, Simpson p 0.018 and GLS p 0.004. In this study, there was no relation between blood biomarkers and cardiotoxicity. Conclusions: Cancer therapeutic-related cardiac dysfunction is related to anthracycline cumulative dose. In this study, echocardiographic follow-up was useful to predict risk factors for early cardiac dysfunction.","['Linares Ballesteros, Adriana', 'Sanguino Lobo, Roy', 'Villada Valencia, Juan Camilo', 'Arevalo Leal, Oscar', 'Plazas Hernandez, Diana Constanza', 'Aponte Barrios, Nelson', 'Perdomo Ramirez, Ivan']","['Linares Ballesteros A', 'Sanguino Lobo R', 'Villada Valencia JC', 'Arevalo Leal O', 'Plazas Hernandez DC', 'Aponte Barrios N', 'Perdomo Ramirez I']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7429-6850', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2292-8099', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5572-897X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1575-7690', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6238-9750', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0680-2066']","['Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Facultad de Medicina, Departamento de Pediatria, Bogota, Colombia Universidad Nacional de Colombia Universidad Nacional de Colombia Facultad de Medicina Departamento de Pediatria Bogota Colombia.', 'Fundacion Hospital Pediatrico de la Misericordia-HOMI, Oncohematologia pediatrica, Bogota Colombia Fundacion Hospital Pediatrico de la Misericordia-HOMI Oncohematologia pediatrica Bogota Colombia.', 'Fundacion Hospital Pediatrico de la Misericordia-HOMI, Cardiologia pediatrica, Bogota Colombia Fundacion Hospital Pediatrico de la Misericordia-HOMI Cardiologia pediatrica Bogota Colombia.', 'Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Facultad de Medicina, Departamento de Pediatria, Bogota, Colombia Universidad Nacional de Colombia Universidad Nacional de Colombia Facultad de Medicina Departamento de Pediatria Bogota Colombia.', 'Fundacion Hospital Pediatrico de la Misericordia-HOMI, Cardiologia pediatrica, Bogota Colombia Fundacion Hospital Pediatrico de la Misericordia-HOMI Cardiologia pediatrica Bogota Colombia.', 'Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Facultad de Medicina, Departamento de Pediatria, Bogota, Colombia Universidad Nacional de Colombia Universidad Nacional de Colombia Facultad de Medicina Departamento de Pediatria Bogota Colombia.', 'Fundacion Hospital Pediatrico de la Misericordia-HOMI, Oncohematologia pediatrica, Bogota Colombia Fundacion Hospital Pediatrico de la Misericordia-HOMI Oncohematologia pediatrica Bogota Colombia.', 'Fundacion Hospital Pediatrico de la Misericordia-HOMI, Oncohematologia pediatrica, Bogota Colombia Fundacion Hospital Pediatrico de la Misericordia-HOMI Oncohematologia pediatrica Bogota Colombia.', 'Fundacion Hospital Pediatrico de la Misericordia-HOMI, Unidad Cuidado Intensivo pediatrico, Bogota Colombia Fundacion Hospital Pediatrico de la Misericordia-HOMI Unidad Cuidado Intensivo pediatrico Bogota Colombia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210215,Colombia,Colomb Med (Cali),"Colombia medica (Cali, Colombia)",9212578,PMC8054707,['NOTNLM'],"['anthracyclines', 'antineoplastic agents', 'child', 'drug therapy', 'echocardiography', 'leukemia', 'ventricular dysfunction']",2021/04/30 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/04/29 06:20'],"['2021/04/29 06:20 [entrez]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.25100/cm.v52i1.4542 [doi]'],epublish,Colomb Med (Cali). 2021 Feb 15;52(1):e2034542. doi: 10.25100/cm.v52i1.4542.,20211210,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthracyclines/adverse effects', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/adverse effects', '*Cardiotoxicity/epidemiology/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Leukemia', 'Prospective Studies']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Colombia Medica.'],,,,,['Conflicts of interest: none declared.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon chromosomal rearrangement, G2DHE acquires characteristics of a super-enhancer and causes overexpression of EVI1 at 3q26.2. However, the transcription factor (TF) complex of G2DHE remains poorly characterized. The aim of this study was to unravel key components of G2DHE-bound TFs involved in the deregulation of EVI1. We have identified several CEBPA and RUNX1 binding sites to be enriched and critical for G2DHE function in 3q-AML cells. Using ChIP-SICAP (ChIP followed by selective isolation of chromatin-associated proteins), a panel of chromatin interactors of RUNX1 and CEBPA were detected in 3q-AML, including PARP1 and IKZF1. PARP1 inhibition (PARPi) caused a reduction of EVI1 expression and a decrease in EVI1-G2DHE interaction frequency, highlighting the involvement of PARP1 in oncogenic super-enhancer formation. Furthermore, 3q-AML cells were highly sensitive to PARPi and displayed morphological changes with higher rates of differentiation and apoptosis as well as depletion of CD34 + cells. In summary, integrative analysis of the 3q-AML super-enhancer complex identified CEBPA and RUNX1 associated proteins and nominated PARP1 as a potential new therapeutic target in EVI1 + 3q-AML.","['Kiehlmeier, Sandra', 'Rafiee, Mahmoud-Reza', 'Bakr, Ali', 'Mika, Jagoda', 'Kruse, Sabrina', 'Muller, Judith', 'Schweiggert, Sabrina', 'Herrmann, Carl', 'Sigismondo, Gianluca', 'Schmezer, Peter', 'Krijgsveld, Jeroen', 'Groschel, Stefan']","['Kiehlmeier S', 'Rafiee MR', 'Bakr A', 'Mika J', 'Kruse S', 'Muller J', 'Schweiggert S', 'Herrmann C', 'Sigismondo G', 'Schmezer P', 'Krijgsveld J', 'Groschel S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1317-1162', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6111-0591', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4989-4722', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4062-6281']","['Molecular Leukemogenesis, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Proteomics of Stem Cells and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Cancer Epigenomics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Leukemogenesis, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Leukemogenesis, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Leukemogenesis, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Leukemogenesis, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Health Data Science Unit, Medical Faculty Heidelberg and BioQuant, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Proteomics of Stem Cells and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Cancer Epigenomics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Proteomics of Stem Cells and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Heidelberg University, Medical Faculty, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Leukemogenesis, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany. stefan.groeschel@dkfz.de.', 'Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany. stefan.groeschel@dkfz.de.', 'Oncology Center Worms, Worms, Germany. stefan.groeschel@dkfz.de.']",['eng'],['677209/ERC_/European Research Council/International'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210428,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC8550965,,,2021/04/30 06:00,2021/12/31 06:00,['2021/04/29 06:13'],"['2020/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/31 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/29 06:13 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-021-01235-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-021-01235-z [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Nov;35(11):3127-3138. doi: 10.1038/s41375-021-01235-z.

In the current study we inspect the genomic regions around recurrent deletions in myeloid malignancies, and identify microhomology-based signatures in CALR, ASXL1 and SRSF2 loci. We demonstrate that these deletions are the result of double stand break repair by a PARP1 dependent microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) pathway. Importantly, we provide evidence that these recurrent deletions originate in pre-leukemic stem cells. While DNA polymerase theta (POLQ) is considered a key component in MMEJ repair, we provide evidence that pre-leukemic MMEJ (preL-MMEJ) deletions can be generated in POLQ knockout cells. In contrast, aphidicolin (an inhibitor of replicative polymerases and replication) treatment resulted in a significant reduction in preL-MMEJ. Altogether, our data indicate an association between POLQ independent MMEJ and clonal hematopoiesis and elucidate mutational mechanisms involved in the very first steps of leukemia evolution.","['Feldman, Tzah', 'Bercovich, Akhiad', 'Moskovitz, Yoni', 'Chapal-Ilani, Noa', 'Mitchell, Amanda', 'Medeiros, Jessie J F', 'Biezuner, Tamir', 'Kaushansky, Nathali', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Gupta, Vikas', 'Milyavsky, Michael', 'Livneh, Zvi', 'Tanay, Amos', 'Shlush, Liran I']","['Feldman T', 'Bercovich A', 'Moskovitz Y', 'Chapal-Ilani N', 'Mitchell A', 'Medeiros JJF', 'Biezuner T', 'Kaushansky N', 'Minden MD', 'Gupta V', 'Milyavsky M', 'Livneh Z', 'Tanay A', 'Shlush LI']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6597-4613', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3642-0977', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9419-3824', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3700-270X']","['Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network (UHN), Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network (UHN), Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network (UHN), Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network (UHN), Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel. liranshlush3@gmail.com.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network (UHN), Toronto, ON, Canada. liranshlush3@gmail.com.', 'Division of Hematology, Rambam Healthcare Campus, Haifa, Israel. liranshlush3@gmail.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210428,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,PMC8080710,,,2021/04/30 06:00,2021/05/13 06:00,['2021/04/29 05:52'],"['2020/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/29 05:52 [entrez]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-021-22803-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-021-22803-y [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2021 Apr 28;12(1):2455. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-22803-y.,20210512,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '147153-65-9 (SRSF2 protein, human)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA polymerase theta)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Aphidicolin/pharmacology', 'Calreticulin/genetics', 'Clonal Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA End-Joining Repair/*genetics', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/drug effects/*genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion/genetics', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we took advantage of a novel Siglec-8 transgenic mouse model to assess the impact of modulating IgE-dependent mast cell degranulation and anaphylaxis using a liposomal platform to display an allergen with or without a synthetic glycan ligand for Siglec-8 (Sig8L). The hypothesis is that recruitment of Siglec-8 to the IgE-FcepsilonRI receptor complex will inhibit allergen-induced mast cell degranulation. Codisplay of both allergen and Sig8L on liposomes profoundly suppresses IgE-mediated degranulation of mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells or rat basophilic leukemia cells expressing Siglec-8. In contrast, liposomes displaying only Sig8L have no significant suppression of antigenic liposome-induced degranulation, demonstrating that the inhibitory activity by Siglec-8 occurs only when Ag and Sig8L are on the same particle. In mouse models of anaphylaxis, display of Sig8L on antigenic liposomes completely suppresses IgE-mediated anaphylaxis in transgenic mice with mast cells expressing Siglec-8 but has no protection in mice that do not express Siglec-8. Furthermore, mice protected from anaphylaxis remain desensitized to subsequent allergen challenge because of loss of Ag-specific IgE from the cell surface and accelerated clearance of IgE from the blood. Thus, although expression of human Siglec-8 on murine mast cells does not by itself modulate IgE-FcepsilonRI-mediated cell activation, the enforced recruitment of Siglec-8 to the FcepsilonRI receptor by Sig8L-decorated antigenic liposomes results in inhibition of degranulation and desensitization to subsequent Ag exposure.","['Duan, Shiteng', 'Arlian, Britni M', 'Nycholat, Corwin M', 'Wei, Yadong', 'Tateno, Hiroaki', 'Smith, Scott A', 'Macauley, Matthew S', 'Zhu, Zhou', 'Bochner, Bruce S', 'Paulson, James C']","['Duan S', 'Arlian BM', 'Nycholat CM', 'Wei Y', 'Tateno H', 'Smith SA', 'Macauley MS', 'Zhu Z', 'Bochner BS', 'Paulson JC']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1031-3046', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5153-2726', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4579-1048', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1098-1135', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9411-6009', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4589-5322']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Science, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, and Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Brown University Alpert Medical School, Providence, RI.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Allergy and Immunology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA jpaulson@scripps.edu.']",['eng'],"['P01 HL107151/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI132790/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI136443/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI123307/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20210428,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,PMC8113104,,,2021/04/30 06:00,2021/09/18 06:00,['2021/04/29 05:47'],"['2019/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/05/15 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/18 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/29 05:47 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1901212 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1901212 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2021 May 15;206(10):2290-2300. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1901212.

Erythropoietin is a key cytokine for erythroid proliferation and differentiation (erythropoiesis), and truncated human erythropoietin receptors (thEpoR) have been reported in familial polycythemia. We reasoned that coexpression of thEpoR could enhance the phenotypic effect of a therapeutic vector in erythroid cells in xenograft mouse and autologous nonhuman primate transplantation models. We generated thEpoR by deleting 40 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus, allowing for erythropoietin-dependent enhanced erythropoiesis of gene-modified cells. We then designed lentiviral vectors encoding both thEpoR and B cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A)-targeting microRNA-adapted short hairpin RNA (shmiR BCL11A) driven by an erythroid-specific promoter. thEpoR expression enhanced erythropoiesis among gene-modified cells in vitro. We then transplanted lentiviral vector gene-modified CD34(+) cells with erythroid-specific expression of both thEpoR and shmiR BCL11A and compared to cells modified with shmiR BCL11A only. We found that thEpoR enhanced shmiR BCL11A-based fetal hemoglobin (HbF) induction in both xenograft mice and rhesus macaques, whereas HbF induction with shmiR BCL11A only was robust, yet transient. thEpoR/shmiR BCL11A coexpression allowed for sustained HbF induction at 20 to 25% in rhesus macaques for 4 to 8 months. In summary, we developed erythroid-specific thEpoR/shmiR BCL11A-expressing vectors, enhancing HbF induction in xenograft mice and rhesus macaques. The sustained HbF induction achieved by addition of thEpoR and shmiR BCL11A may represent a viable gene therapy strategy for hemoglobin disorders.","['Uchida, Naoya', 'Ferrara, Francesca', 'Drysdale,

This synthesis allowed the co-encapsulation of oncocalyxone A (onco A) and surface-modified magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4@citrate) into the same nanostructure. The synthesized nanocapsules exhibited a core-shell morphology, with an average diameter of 143nm. This nanocomposite showed potential anticancer activity (IC50) against four human tumor cell lines: glioblastoma SNB-19 (1.010 mugmL(-1)), colon carcinoma HCT-116 (2.675 mugmL(-1)), prostate PC3 (4.868 mugmL(-1)), and leukemia HL-60 (2.166 mugmL(-1)). Additionally, in vivo toxicity and locomotor activity were evaluated in a zebrafish (Danio rerio) model.

Also, intestinal CRE colonization is a risk factor for subsequent CRE infection. Several clinical studies have reported successful fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for the gut decontamination of a variety of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB), even in immunosuppressed patients. Similarly, other studies have also indicated that multiple FMTs may increase or lead to successful therapeutic outcomes. CASE PRESENTATION: We report CRE colonization in an allo-HSCT patient with recurrent CRE infections, and its successful eradication using tandem FMT cycles at 488 days after allo-HSCT. We also performed a comprehensive microbiota analysis. No acute or delayed adverse events (AEs) were observed. The patient remained clinically stable with CRE-negative stool culture at 26-month follow-up. Our analyses also showed some gut microbiota reconstruction. We also reviewed the current literature on decolonization strategies for CRE.

To identify novel targets for immunotherapy treatments, we compiled a lineage-independent MLL-r leukemia gene signature using publicly available data sets. Data from large leukemia repositories were filtered through the In-silico Human Surfaceome, providing a list of highly predicted cell surface proteins overexpressed in MLL-r leukemias. LAMP5, a lysosomal associated membrane protein, is expressed highly and specifically in MLL-r leukemia. We found that LAMP5 is a direct target of the oncogenic MLL-fusion protein. LAMP5 depletion significantly inhibited leukemia cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Functional studies showed that LAMP-5 is a novel modulator of innateimmune pathways in MLL-r leukemias. Downregulation of LAMP5 led to inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling and increased activation of type-1 interferon signaling downstream of Toll-like Receptor/Interleukin 1 Receptor activation. These effects were attributable to the critical role of LAMP-5 in transferring the signal flux from Interferon Signaling Endosomes to Pro-Inflammatory Signaling Endosome. Depletion of IRF7 was able to partially rescue the cell growth inhibition upon LAMP5 downregulation. Lastly, LAMP-5 was readily detected on the surface of MLL-r leukemia cells. Targeting surface LAMP-5 using an antibody-drug conjugate leads to significant cell viability decrease specifically on MLL-r leukemias. Overall, based on the limited expression throughout human tissues, we postulate that LAMP-5 could potentially serve as an immunotherapeutic target with a wide therapeutic window to treat MLL-r leukemias.","['Gracia-Maldonado, Gabriel', 'Clark, Jason', 'Burwinkel, Matthew', 'Greenslade, Brenay', 'Wunderlich, Mark', 'Salomonis, Nathan', 'Leone, Dario', 'Gatti, Evelina', 'Pierre, Philippe', 'Kumar, Ashish R', 'Lee, Lynn H']","['Gracia-Maldonado G', 'Clark J', 'Burwinkel M', 'Greenslade B', 'Wunderlich M', 'Salomonis N', 'Leone D', 'Gatti E', 'Pierre P', 'Kumar AR', 'Lee LH']",,"[""Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA; Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Immune Deficiency, Cincinnati, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229."", ""Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA; Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Immune Deficiency, Cincinnati, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229."", ""Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA; Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Immune Deficiency, Cincinnati, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229."", ""Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA; Division of Oncology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229."", ""Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA; Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229."", ""Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229."", ""Aix Marseille Universite, CNRS, INSERM, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy (CIML), 13288 Marseille Cedex 9."", ""Aix Marseille Universite, CNRS, INSERM, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy (CIML), 13288 Marseille Cedex 9."", ""Aix Marseille Universite, CNRS, INSERM, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy (CIML), 13288 Marseille Cedex 9."", ""Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA; Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Immune Deficiency, Cincinnati, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati School of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, 45229.

Methods: Using CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out the miR-21 gene in K562/G01 cells, and single-cell-derived clones of miR-21 knockout were obtained by genomic DNA PCR screening, Sanger sequencing, and real-time PCR. We used MTT and cell colony formation assays to assess the cell proliferation, and determined imatinib sensitivity by MTT assay and Annexin--APC/7-AAD double staining flow cytometry. Using western blot, we examined the potential mechanisms affecting imatinib sensitivity by knocking out miR-21 in K562/G01 cells. Results: Three miR-21 knockout K562/G01 single-cell-derived clones were successfully constructed. The mutation efficiency mediated by CRISPR/Cas9 was 7.12%-8.11%. MiR-21 knockout inhibited the proliferation of K562/G01 cells; the clone formation rates of WT and 1#, 2#, 6# K562/G01 single-cell clones were (57.67+/-8.25) %, (26.94+/- 5.36) %, (7.17+/-2.11) %, (31.50+/-3.65) %, respectively. MiR-21 knockout increased the sensitivity of K562/G01 cells to imatinib, IC(50) of imatinib in WT, and 1#, 2#, 6# K562/G01 single-cell clones were (21.92+/-1.36) micromol/ml, (3.98+/-0.39) micromol/ml, (5.38+/-1.01) micromol/ml, (9.24+/-1.36) micromol/ml. After the knockout of miR-21, the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling molecules was inhibited, while the expression of P210(B)CR-ABL and p-P210(BCR-ABL) was downregulated; however, the expression of PTEN was not affected. Conclusion: The knockout of miR-21 can suppress cell proliferation and improve sensitivity to imatinib in K562/G01 cells, which may be achieved by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and BCR-ABL expression.","['Zhang, Y', 'Wang, L Y', 'Li, J Z', 'Jiang, P F', 'Hu, J D', 'Chen, B Y']","['Zhang Y', 'Wang LY', 'Li JZ', 'Jiang PF', 'Hu JD', 'Chen BY']",,"['Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fuzhou 350001, China.', 'Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fuzhou 350001, China.', 'Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fuzhou 350001, China.', 'Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fuzhou 350001, China.', 'Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fuzhou 350001, China.', 'Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fuzhou 350001, China.']",['chi'],"['2017J05129/Fujian Provincial Natural Science Foundation', '81600137/National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China']",['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,PMC8081948,['NOTNLM'],"['CRISPR/Cas9', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Knockout', 'imatinib', 'miR-21']",2021/04/30 06:00,2021/05/01 06:00,['2021/04/29 02:48'],"['2021/04/29 02:48 [entrez]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2021.03.011 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2021 Mar 14;42(3):243-249. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2021.03.011.,20210430,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MIRN21 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', '*MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Five hematopoietic cell tumors of ambiguous lineage cases were collected, including myeloid sarcoma, mixed phenotype acute leukemia, B/myeloid, T-lymphoblastic lymphoma combined with acute myeloid leukemia, acute undifferentiated leukemia with cutaneous MPDCP and early T-precursor cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The data including morphology, immunostaining, and flow cytometry analysis were collected, and we explored the problems and differential diagnosis in the diagnosis of hematopoietic cell tumors of ambiguous lineage. Results: The five cases showed that the accurate pathological diagnosis and classification of hematopoietic cell tumors of ambiguous lineage should be based on lineage-specific antigens. Moreover, tumor cells have the potential of multi-directional differentiation. In different sites or different periods, the differentiation of tumor cells may be different. Biopsy and detection of all related markers should be performed for the initial diagnosis, and the detection should be repeated when the condition of the patient changes. Combined application of multi-techniques, including morphology and flow cytometry analysis, is recommend for the diagnosis of hematopoietic cell tumors of ambiguous lineage, since the conventional morphology and immunophenotyping methods are limited. Conclusion: Hematopoietic cell tumors of ambiguous lineage are derived from hematopoietic stem cells with a potential of multi-differentiation. The differentiation of tumor cells is variable.

Methods: The expression of circ-KEL was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in bone marrow mononuclear cells collected from 116 patients with AML and 40 healthy donors. The correlation of circ-KEL expression with the clinical characteristics of patients with AML was further systematically analyzed. The modulations among circ-KEL, miR-335-5p, and LRG1 were predicted through bioinformatics analysis and validated by dual luciferase assay. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected using CCK8 and flow cytometry. Results: The expression of circ-KEL was significantly elevated in patients with AML compared with the healthy controls (Relative expression level, -Deltact, AML: -7.117+/-1.831; control: -8.669+/-1.771, P<0.001) . Moreover, patients with high circ-KEL expression have significantly worse overall survival. The level of circ-KEL in patients with AML was downregulated after chemo-treatment. In addition, circ-KEL could serve as the sponge of miR-335-5p and regulate LRG1. Bioinformatics analysis showed that miR-335-5p correlates with good prognosis and was negatively associated with LRG1. LRG1 could promote cell proliferation and inhibit cell apoptosis. Our results also exhibited the higher expression of LRG1 in patients with AML. Moreover, circ-KEL exerted functional effects via sponging miR-335-5p and regulating LRG1. Conclusion: circ-KEL expresses highly in patients with AML and correlates with poor prognosis, suggesting its important role in the genesis and progress of AML.","['Wu, Z J', 'Sun, Q', 'Gu, D L', 'Wang, L Q', 'Li, J Y', 'Jin, H']","['Wu ZJ', 'Sun Q', 'Gu DL', 'Wang LQ', 'Li JY', 'Jin H']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Jiangsu Provincial People Hospital), Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Jiangsu Provincial People Hospital), Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Jiangsu Provincial People Hospital), Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Jiangsu Provincial People Hospital), Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Jiangsu Provincial People Hospital), Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Jiangsu Provincial People Hospital), Nanjing 210029, China.']",['chi'],"['817001558197014681720108002/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2018ZX09734-007/National Major Science and Technology Projects of China']",['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,PMC8081935,['NOTNLM'],"['Circular RNA', 'Leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1', 'Leukemia, myeloid, acute', 'miR-335-5p']",2021/04/30 06:00,2021/05/01 06:00,['2021/04/29 02:48'],"['2021/04/29 02:48 [entrez]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2021.03.009 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2021 Mar 14;42(3):230-237. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2021.03.009.,20210430,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Circular)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (KEL protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Metalloendopeptidases', '*MicroRNAs/genetics', 'RNA, Circular']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The peripheral blood samples of 84 CML patients were collected. The same sample was divided into different groups according to storage time (0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h) , temperature (room temperature, 18-24 ; low temperature, 2-8 ) , and vibration conditions (3, 6, and 12 h) . RQ-PCR was used to detect BCR-ABL (P210) transcript levels of the different groups. This study logarithmically transformed (log(10N)) the original data [BCR-ABL copy number, ABL copy number, and BCR-ABL (P210) transcript levels]. Results: 1 in circleAgarose gel electrophoresis showed significant RNA degradation of samples after storage for 48 and 72 h at room temperature. 2 in circleAmong the overall samples, the BCR-ABL copy number of the samples stored at room temperature for 48 and 72 h was significantly lower than that of the samples stored at low temperature (P<0.05) . However, the BCR-ABL (P210) transcript levels had no significant difference between samples stored at low temperature and room temperature. 3 in circleNo significant changes were noted in the BCR-ABL (P210) transcript levels at different storage times (6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h) regardless of storage temperature (P>0.05) compared with that at baseline (0 h, -0.56+/-1.51) . 4 in circle The BCR-ABL copy number of the overall sample only decreased significantly (P<0.05) at 48 h (2.93+/-1.59) and 72 h (2.79+/-1.42) compared with that at baseline (0 h, 3.35+/-1.60) when stored at room temperature. The ABL copy number in the overall sample decreased significantly at 48 and 72 h (whether low and room temperature; P<0.05) . However, no significant changes were noted in the BCR-ABL (P210) transcript levels after vibration for 3 h (-1.29+/-1.81) , 6 h (-1.24+/-1.72) , and 12 h (-1.18+/-1.68; P>0.05) compared with that at baseline (0 h, -0.60+/-1.37) . Conclusion: Sample storage time, storage temperature, and vibration can interfere with the results of BCR-ABL and ABL copy number but have no significant effect on the quantitative determination of BCR-ABL (P210) transcript levels. This study provides strong support for the feasibility of transregional transportation of peripheral blood samples from patients with CML.","['Hua, M Q', 'He, N', 'Zhong, C Q', 'Yang, X Y', 'Liu, J T', 'Wang, R Q', 'Han, F J', 'Zhang, C', 'Ma, D X']","['Hua MQ', 'He N', 'Zhong CQ', 'Yang XY', 'Liu JT', 'Wang RQ', 'Han FJ', 'Zhang C', 'Ma DX']",,"['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, China Department of Emergency Medicine, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, China Department of Hematology, Yantai Mountain Hospital, Yantai, Shandong 264000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,PMC8081946,['NOTNLM'],"['Delivery', 'Fusion proteins, BCR-ABL', 'Internal quality control', 'Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction', 'Storage conditions']",2021/04/30 06:00,2021/05/01 06:00,['2021/04/29 02:48'],"['2021/04/29 02:48 [entrez]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2021.03.008 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2021 Mar 14;42(3):224-229. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2021.03.008.,20210430,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: 19TriTE was constructed by molecular cloning technology and successfully expressed through the eukaryotic expressing system. The effects of 19TriTE on the proliferation and activation of T cells, as well as the specific cytotoxicity against CD19 positive tumor cell lines were verified. Results: 1 in circle19TriTE expressing plasmid was constructed and successfully expressed through the eukaryotic expressing system. 2 in circle19TriTE can specifically bind to T cells and Nalm6 cells, with equilibrium dissociation constants of 19.21 nmol/L and 11.67 nmol/L, respectively. 3 in circleThe expression rates of CD69 positive T cells and CD25 positive T cells were 35.4% and 49.8% respectively, when 2 nmol/L 19TriTE were added in the co-culture system, which were significantly higher than those in the control group. 4 in circle19TriTE can significantly promote the proliferation of T cells. The absolute count of T cells expanded from the initial one million to 74 million with an 74 fold increase at the concentration of 1 nmol/L on day 12. 19TriTE can significantly mediate T cells killing of CD19 positive target cells in a dose-dependent manner. At the concentration of 10 nmol/L, the target cells lysis reached 50%. Degranulation experiment verified that 19TriTE can activate T cells in the presence of CD19 positive target cells, and the activation of T cells positively correlated with the dose of 19TriTE. When 19TriTE fusion protein co-cultured with T cells and target cells overexpression RFP and luciferase genes respectively, 19TriTE can notably mediate T cells killing of CD19 positive target cells through fluorescent microscope or bioluminescence imaging technology. Conclusion: In this study, we successfully constructed and expressed 19TriTE fusion protein and verified that it can effectively activate T cells and promote their proliferation in vitro. At the same time, it can bind to CD19 positive target cells and T cells, as well as enhance T cells anti-leukemia effect in vitro, providing the foundation for further clinical research.","['Chen, M L', 'Peng, N', 'Liu, X Y', 'Zhang, T', 'Xu, Y X', 'Tian, Z', 'Xing, H Y', 'Tang, K J', 'Rao, Q', 'Wang, J X', 'Wang, M']","['Chen ML', 'Peng N', 'Liu XY', 'Zhang T', 'Xu YX', 'Tian Z', 'Xing HY', 'Tang KJ', 'Rao Q', 'Wang JX', 'Wang M']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical University, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical University, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical University, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical University, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical University, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical University, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical University, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical University, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical University, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical University, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical University, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],"['81830005/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2019YFA0110204/National Key R&D Program of China']",['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,PMC8081940,['NOTNLM'],"['CD19', 'Fusion protein', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, lymphoblastic, acute', 'T cell engager, tri-specific']",2021/04/30 06:00,2021/05/01 06:00,['2021/04/29 02:48'],"['2021/04/29 02:48 [entrez]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2021.03.007 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2021 Mar 14;42(3):217-223. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2021.03.007.,20210430,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)']",IM,"['*Antigens, CD19', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', '*Leukemia', 'T-Lymphocytes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using an AML-composite model (AML-CM) that assigns higher scores to older age, increased comorbidity-burdens and adverse cytogenetic-risks, we defined three distinct prognostic groups, and within each, compared outcomes after less-intensive versus intensive induction therapies in a multicenter retrospective cohort (n=1292) treated at six institutions from 2008-2012 and a prospective cohort (n=695) treated at thirteen institutions from 2013-2017. Prospective study included impacts of Karnofsky performance status (KPS), quality of life (QOL), and physicians' perceptions of cure. In the retrospective cohort, recipients of less-intensive therapies were older, had more comorbidities, more adverse cytogenetics, and worse KPS. Less-intensive therapies were associated with higher risks for mortality in AML-CM scores of 4-6, 7-9, and >/=10. Results were independent from receipt of allogeneic transplants and similar in those aged 70-79 years old. In the Prospective cohort, the two groups were similar in baseline QOL, geriatric assessment, and patients' outcome preferences. Higher mortality risks were seen after less-intensive therapies. However, in models adjusted for age, physician-assigned KPS and chances of cure, mortality risks and QOL were similar. Less-intensive recipients had lessened length of hospitalization (LOH). Our studies question the survival or QOL, except LOH, benefits from less-intensive therapies in patients with AML, including those aged 70-79 years or with high comorbidity-burden.

The number of clinical trials in both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies for new products and potential indications continues to grow. The clinical toxicities of CAR T therapy include cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, which often warrant inpatient admission for close monitoring and treatment. Consequently, many centers have built processes around the administration of these cells in the inpatient setting. As new products gain Food and Drug Administration approval with more manageable toxicity profiles, and as institutions gain experience with the management of these toxicities, outpatient administration and monitoring should be expected. In addition, payor reimbursements for inpatient treatment have put the sustainability of inpatient CAR T therapy in jeopardy, especially for centers with a payor mix that includes a high proportion of Medicare patients. This has the serious potential to limit access to care. As the use of CAR T therapy continues to expand, changes in payment models, care settings, or both are needed to ensure the sustainability of safe, efficient, and cost-effective treatment. This review outlines the efficacy and toxicity of currently approved products, as well as best practices to optimize the management of CAR T cell therapy in the outpatient setting.","['Alexander, Maurice', 'Culos, Kathryn', 'Roddy, Julianna', 'Shaw, J Ryan', 'Bachmeier, Christina', 'Shigle, Terri Lynn', 'Mahmoudjafari, Zahra']","['Alexander M', 'Culos K', 'Roddy J', 'Shaw JR', 'Bachmeier C', 'Shigle TL', 'Mahmoudjafari Z']",,"['Department of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina Medical Center, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

Therefore, they are unable to produce ATP via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Instead, they have evolved strategies to obtain and manipulate host metabolism to acquire nutrients. However, little is known about how microsporidia modulate host energy metabolisms. Here, we present the first targeted metabolomics study to investigate changes in host energy metabolism as a result of infection by a microsporidian. Metabolites of silkworm embryo cell (BmE) were measured 48 h post infection by Nosema bombycis. Thirty metabolites were detected, nine of which were upregulated and mainly involved in glycolysis (glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate) and the TCA cycle (succinate, alpha-ketoglutarate, cis-aconitate, isocitrate, citrate, fumarate). Pathway enrichment analysis suggested that the upregulated metabolites could promote the synthesization of nucleotides, fatty acids, and amino acids by the host. ATP concentration in host cells, however, was not significantly changed by the infection. This ATP homeostasis was also found in Encephalitozoon hellem infected mouse macrophage RAW264.7, human monocytic leukemia THP-1, human embryonic kidney 293, and human foreskin fibroblast cells. These findings suggest that microsporidia have evolved strategies to maintain levels of ATP in the host while stimulating metabolic pathways to provide additional nutrients for the parasite.","['Luo, Jian', 'He, Qiang', 'Xu, Jin-Zhi', 'Xu, Chen', 'Han, Yin-Ze', 'Gao, Hai-Long', 'Meng, Xian-Zhi', 'Pan, Guo-Qing', 'Li, Tian', 'Zhou, Ze-Yang']","['Luo J', 'He Q', 'Xu JZ', 'Xu C', 'Han YZ', 'Gao HL', 'Meng XZ', 'Pan GQ', 'Li T', 'Zhou ZY']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Microsporidia Infection and Control, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Microsporidia Infection and Control, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Microsporidia Infection and Control, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Microsporidia Infection and Control, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Microsporidia Infection and Control, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Microsporidia Infection and Control, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Microsporidia Infection and Control, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Microsporidia Infection and Control, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Microsporidia Infection and Control, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an efficient method for simultaneous detection of clinically significant genomic mutations with high sensitivity. Various NGS based in-house developed and commercial myeloid neoplasm panels have been integrated into routine clinical practice. However, some genes frequently mutated in myeloid malignancies are particularly difficult to sequence with NGS panels (e.g., CEBPA, CARL, and FLT3). We report development and validation of a 48-gene NGS panel that includes genes that are technically challenging for molecular profiling of myeloid neoplasms including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Target regions were captured by hybridization with complementary biotinylated DNA baits, and NGS was performed on an Illumina NextSeq500 instrument. A bioinformatics pipeline that was developed in-house was used to detect single nucleotide variations (SNVs), insertions/deletions (indels), and FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD). An analytical validation study was performed on 184 unique specimens for variants with allele frequencies >/=5%. Variants identified by the 48-gene panel were compared to those identified by a 35-gene hematologic neoplasms panel using an additional 137 unique specimens. The developed assay was applied to a large cohort (n = 2,053) of patients with suspected myeloid neoplasms. Analytical validation yielded 99.6% sensitivity (95% CI: 98.9-99.9%) and 100% specificity (95% CI: 100%). Concordance of variants detected by the 2 tested panels was 100%. Among patients with suspected myeloid neoplasms (n = 2,053), 54.5% patients harbored at least one clinically significant mutation: 77% in AML patients, 48% in MDS, and 45% in MPN. Together, these findings demonstrate that the assay can identify mutations associated with diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options of myeloid neoplasms even in technically challenging genes.","['Rosenthal, Sun Hee', 'Gerasimova, Anna', 'Ma, Charles', 'Li, Hai-Rong', 'Grupe, Andrew', 'Chong, Hansook', 'Acab, Allan', 'Smolgovsky, Alla', 'Owen, Renius', 'Elzinga, Christopher', 'Chen, Rebecca', 'Sugganth, Daniel', 'Freitas, Tracey', 'Graham, Jennifer', 'Champion, Kristen', 'Bhattacharya, Anindya', 'Racke, Frederick', 'Lacbawan, Felicitas']","['Rosenthal SH', 'Gerasimova A', 'Ma C', 'Li HR', 'Grupe A', 'Chong H', 'Acab A', 'Smolgovsky A', 'Owen R', 'Elzinga C', 'Chen R', 'Sugganth D', 'Freitas T', 'Graham J', 'Champion K', 'Bhattacharya A', 'Racke F', 'Lacbawan F']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5478-0274'],"['Department of Advanced Diagnostics, Quest Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Advanced Diagnostics, Quest Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Advanced Diagnostics, Quest Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Advanced Diagnostics, Quest Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Advanced Diagnostics, Quest Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Advanced Diagnostics, Quest Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Advanced Diagnostics, Quest Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Advanced Diagnostics, Quest Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Advanced Diagnostics, Quest Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Advanced Diagnostics, Quest Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Advanced Diagnostics, Quest Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Advanced Diagnostics, Quest Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Med Fusion, Lewisville, TX, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Med Fusion, Lewisville, TX, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Med Fusion, Lewisville, TX, United States of America.', 'Department of Advanced Diagnostics, Quest Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Advanced Diagnostics, Quest Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Advanced Diagnostics, Quest Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA, United States of America.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20210428,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC8081174,,,2021/04/29 06:00,2021/09/14 06:00,['2021/04/28 17:31'],"['2020/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/28 17:31 [entrez]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0243683 [doi]', 'PONE-D-20-37053 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2021 Apr 28;16(4):e0243683. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0243683. eCollection 2021.,20210913,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],IM,"['*Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/metabolism', '*Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",,,,,,"['Sun Hee Rosenthal, Anna Gerasimova, Charles Ma, Hai-Rong Li, Andrew Grupe,', 'Hansook Chong, Allan Acab, Alla Smolgovsky, Renius Owen, Christopher Elzinga,', 'Rebecca Chen, Daniel Sugganth, Anindya Bhattacharya, Frederick Racke, and', 'Felicitas Lacbawan are employees of Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute.

Over the 13 years covered by this analysis, research funding into Treatment and Early Detection, Diagnosis, and Prognosis had increased in terms of absolute investment and as a proportion of the portfolio. Research funding in Cancer Biology and Etiology declined as a percentage of the portfolio, and funding for Prevention and Control, Survivorship and Outcomes remained static. In terms of cancer site-specific research, funding for breast cancer and colorectal cancer had increased in absolute terms but declined as a percentage of the portfolio. By contrast, investment for brain cancer, lung cancer, leukemia, melanoma, and pancreatic cancer increased both in absolute terms and as a percentage of the portfolio.","['Abudu, Rachel', 'Bouche, Gauthier', 'Bourougaa, Karima', 'Davies, Lynne', 'Duncan, Kalina', 'Estaquio, Carla', 'Font, Anna Diaz', 'Hurlbert, Marc S', 'Jackson, Paul', 'Kroeskop-Bossenbroek, Linda', 'Lewis, Ian', 'Mitrou, Giota', 'Mutabbir, Abdul', 'Pettigrew, Christopher A', 'Turner, Lynn', 'Weerman, Annemarie', 'Wojtanik, Kari']","['Abudu R', 'Bouche G', 'Bourougaa K', 'Davies L', 'Duncan K', 'Estaquio C', 'Font AD', 'Hurlbert MS', 'Jackson P', 'Kroeskop-Bossenbroek L', 'Lewis I', 'Mitrou G', 'Mutabbir A', 'Pettigrew CA', 'Turner L', 'Weerman A', 'Wojtanik K']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7739-0591', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3407-2788', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0339-962X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2066-7008', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3301-3572', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3485-6694']","['London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.', 'Anticancer Fund, Brabant, Belgium.', 'Institut National du Cancer, Boulogne-Billancourt, France.', 'International Cancer Research Partnership, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'US National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.', 'Institut National du Cancer, Boulogne-Billancourt, France.', 'World Cancer Research Fund International, London, United Kingdom.', 'Melanoma Research Alliance, Washington, DC.', 'Cancer Australia, Surry Hills, NSW, Australia.', 'Dutch Cancer Society, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'National Cancer Research Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'World Cancer Research Fund International, London, United Kingdom.', 'National Cancer Research Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'National Breast Cancer Foundation, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Worldwide Cancer Research HQ, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.', 'Dutch Cancer Society, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Susan G.

Hence, they must adapt to proliferation-induced metabolic stress through intrinsic or acquired anti-metabolic stress responses to maintain homeostasis and survival. One mechanism to achieve this is to reprogram gene expression in a metabolism-dependent manner. MondoA (also known as MLXIP), a member of the MYC interactome, has been described as an example of such a metabolic sensor. However, the role of MondoA in malignancy is not fully understood and the underlying mechanism in metabolic responses remains elusive. By assessing patient data sets we found that MondoA overexpression is associated with a worse survival in pediatric common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Using CRISPR/Cas9 and RNA interference approaches, we observed that MondoA depletion reduces transformational capacity of B-ALL cells in vitro and dramatically inhibits malignant potential in an in vivo mouse model. Interestingly, reduced expression of MondoA in patient data sets correlated with enrichment in metabolic pathways. The loss of MondoA correlated with increased tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity. Mechanistically, MondoA senses metabolic stress in B-ALL cells by restricting oxidative phosphorylation through reduced PDH activity. Glutamine starvation conditions greatly enhance this effect and highlight the inability to mitigate metabolic stress upon loss of MondoA in B-ALL. Our findings give a novel insight into the function of MondoA in pediatric B-ALL and support the notion that MondoA inhibition in this entity offers a therapeutic opportunity and should be further explored.","['Sipol, Alexandra', 'Hameister, Erik', 'Xue, Busheng', 'Hofstetter, Julia', 'Barenboim, Maxim', 'Ollinger, Rupert', 'Jain, Gaurav', 'Prexler, Carolin', 'Rubio, Rebeca Alba', 'Baldauf, Michaela Carina', 'Franchina, Davide G', 'Petry, Andreas', 'Schmah, Juliane', 'Thiel, Uwe', 'Gorlach, Agnes', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Brenner, Dirk', 'Richter, Gunther', 'Grunewald, Thomas G P', 'Rad, Roland', 'Wolf, Elmar', 'Ruland, Jurgen', 'Sorensen, Poul H', 'Burdach, Stefan E G']","['Sipol A', 'Hameister E', 'Xue B', 'Hofstetter J', 'Barenboim M', 'Ollinger R', 'Jain G', 'Prexler C', 'Rubio RA', 'Baldauf MC', 'Franchina DG', 'Petry A', 'Schmah J', 'Thiel U', 'Gorlach A', 'Cario G', 'Brenner D', 'Richter G', 'Grunewald TGP', 'Rad R', 'Wolf E', 'Ruland J', 'Sorensen PH', 'Burdach SEG']",,"['Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Germany.', 'Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Universitat Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Munich, Germany.', 'LMU, St. Gallen, Switzerland.', 'Luxembourg Institute of Health, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'German Hear Center Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'UKSH, Kiel, Germany.', 'CCC Munchen - Comprehensive Cancer Center and Deutsches Konsortium fur Translationale Krebsforschung (DKTK), Germany.', 'DZHK (German Centre for Cardiovascular Research), Germany.', 'University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Odense Research Center for Anaphylaxis (ORCA), Denmark.', 'CCC Munchen - Comprehensive Cancer Center and Deutsches Konsortium fur Translationale Krebsforschung (DKTK), Germany.', 'CCC Munchen - Comprehensive Cancer Center and Deutsches Konsortium fur Translationale Krebsforschung (DKTK), Germany.', 'CCC Munchen - Comprehensive Cancer Center and Deutsches Konsortium fur Translationale Krebsforschung (DKTK), Germany.', 'Theodor Boveri Institute, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'CCC Munchen - Comprehensive Cancer Center and Deutsches Konsortium fur Translationale Krebsforschung (DKTK), Germany.', 'Technische Universitat Munchen, Germany.', 'CCC Munchen - Comprehensive Cancer Center and Deutsches Konsortium fur Translationale Krebsforschung (DKTK), Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210428,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,,,2021/04/29 06:00,2021/04/29 06:00,['2021/04/28 08:56'],"['2021/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/16 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/28 08:56 [entrez]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(21)00940-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020007932 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood. 2021 Apr 28. pii: S0006-4971(21)00940-X. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020007932.,,,IM,,['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33908275,NLM,MEDLINE,20211109,2376-1032 (Electronic),27,5,2021 May,The effects of oral anticancer parity laws on out-of-pocket spending and adherence among commercially insured patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.,554-564,10.18553/jmcp.2021.27.5.554 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Over the past 12 years, 43 states and Washington DC have implemented oral anticancer medication parity laws in response to the burden of pharmacy cost sharing. Parity laws are designed to provide equal coverage and cost sharing between orally and parenterally administered anticancer medications for patients in commercial, fully insured health plans (FIHPs). However, there is considerable state-level variation in the requirements to achieve compliance with parity laws, and the clinical and economic effectiveness of parity is not fully known. OBJECTIVES: To (a) understand the impact of parity laws on out-of-pocket (OOP) spending and adherence to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) among commercially insured patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and (b) compare these effects across states with and without per prescription or per 30-day OOP spending limits as part of their parity laws. METHODS: Patients aged 18-64 years with CML, at least 1 pharmacy claim for a TKI, and residence in a state that implemented oral anticancer parity legislation between January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2017, were identified from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database. A propensity score-weighted difference-in-difference approach was used to measure the impact of parity on OOP spending and adherence in the 6 months after the first pharmacy claim for a TKI (index date) for patients enrolled in FIHPs (subject to parity) and self-funded health plans (SFHPs; exempt from parity). OOP spending was standardized to a 30-day equivalent amount and adjusted to 2017 US dollars. Adherence was assessed using the proportion of days covered (PDC), and patients were categorized as adherent with PDC >/= 0.80. RESULTS: Of 1,887 patients initiating a TKI before or after their state's parity law, 678 (35.9%) were enrolled in FIHPs (480 before vs 198 after parity), and 1,209 (64.1%) were enrolled in SFHPs (688 before vs 521 after parity). Implementation of parity laws was not associated with any changes in mean OOP spending; however, it was associated with a reduced likelihood of paying $0 per 30 days across all states (adjusted difference-in-difference [aDD] OR = 0.662; 95% CI = 0.535-0.820) and states without OOP spending limits (aDD OR = 0.654; 95% CI = 0.508-0.848), but not in states with limits. Nonsignificant but directionally opposite changes at each end of the OOP spending distribution were observed for states with and without OOP spending limits, with increased spending observed at the 75th, 90th, and 95th percentiles in states without limits. Mean PDC and adherence showed a nonsignificant increase among FIHP and SFHP patients across all states, states with limits, and states without limits. CONCLUSIONS: Oral anticancer parity laws are not associated with reduced OOP spending or improved adherence in a commercially insured sample of patients with CML. These findings were consistent for states that included OOP spending limits as a component of their parity laws. DISCLOSURES: This study did not receive any external funding.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 134 patients diagnosed with WR-DLBCL. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the prognostic factors for WR-DLBCL. Then, we divided these patients into the rituximab plus chemotherapy group (R-chemotherapy) (n = 88) and chemotherapy group (n = 46), and the Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression model analyses were applied to investigate the treatment value of RT in both the groups. Multivariate analysis revealed international prognostic index (IPI) >/= 3 and chemotherapy without rituximab as significant risk factors for the progression-free survival (PFS, IPI >/= 3: p = 0.001; chemotherapy without rituximab: p = 0.002) and overall survival (OS, IPI >/= 3, p < 0.001; chemotherapy without rituximab, p = 0.024). Rituximab combined with chemotherapy significantly improved PFS (p = 0.002) and OS (p = 0.006) in these patients. RT did not significantly contribute to the survival in the overall cohort analysis, whereas in the subgroup analysis, RT significantly improved the PFS (p = 0.025) and OS (p = 0.029) for the patients in the chemotherapy group, but not in the R-chemotherapy group. In conclusion, the WR-DLBCL patients could benefit from RT in the pre-rituximab era, whereas the addition of rituximab to chemotherapy significantly improved the survival of WR-DLBCL patients, and the clinical benefit of RT was reduced.","['Guan, Qingpei', 'Hong, Yuheng', 'Hu, Ge', 'Zhou, Qiqi', 'Li, Lanfang', 'Qian, Zhengzi', 'Zhou, Shiyong', 'Ren, Xiubao', 'Qiu, Lihua', 'Wang, Xianhuo', 'Zhang, Huilai']","['Guan Q', 'Hong Y', 'Hu G', 'Zhou Q', 'Li L', 'Qian Z', 'Zhou S', 'Ren X', 'Qiu L', 'Wang X', 'Zhang H']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7663-2923'],"[""Departments of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."", ""Departments of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."", ""Departments of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."", ""Departments of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."", ""Departments of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."", ""Departments of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."", ""Departments of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."", 'Departments of Immunology/Biotherapy, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.', ""Departments of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."", ""Departments of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."", ""Departments of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China.""]",['eng'],"['2018ZX09201015/National Key New Drug Creation Special Programs', '18JCZDJC45100/Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City China', '19JCYBJC26500/Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City China', 'Y-Roche20192-0097/Clinical Oncology Research Fund of CSCO', 'Y-XD2019-162/Clinical Oncology Research Fund of CSCO', '2005DKA21300/National Human Genetic Resources Sharing Service Platform / Cancer', 'Biobank of Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital', '81770213/National Natural Science Foundation of China China']",['Journal Article'],20210427,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,['NOTNLM'],"[""Waldeyer's ring DLBCL"", 'prognostic factor', 'radiotherapy', 'rituximab', 'survival']",2021/04/29 06:00,2021/10/13 06:00,['2021/04/28 06:34'],"['2021/03/23 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/13 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/28 06:34 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2869 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2021 Oct;39(4):490-497. doi: 10.1002/hon.2869.

Ph + ALL is caused by the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), which consists of a t(9;22)(q34;q11) reciprocal translocation leading to the formation of a BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. The disease is treated with targeted therapy comprising ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Ponatinib is a third generation TKI that demonstrates higher binding affinity for ABL1 than first/second generation TKIs. Although intensive combined immunotherapy with ponatinib greatly improves the prognosis of Ph + ALL, the safety and efficacy profiles of ponatinib in Japanese patients are unclear. This retrospective study investigated five cases of Ph + ALL at a single institute to evaluate safety and efficacy profiles. Three patients achieved a deep molecular response (DMR) following combined intensive treatment with ponatinib as induction chemotherapy. Four patients received consolidative allogenic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) during their first complete response. Three of the four experienced early relapse within 100 days; they subsequently received ponatinib, and one of the three achieved a DMR. No patient experienced severe cardiovascular events. This case series suggests that ponatinib at a concentration of least 30 mg exhibits anti-leukemia effects in Japanese patients with Ph + ALL.","['Kidoguchi, Keisuke', 'Ureshino, Hiroshi', 'Kizuka-Sano, Haruna', 'Yamaguchi, Kyosuke', 'Katsuya, Hiroo', 'Kubota, Yasushi', 'Ando, Toshihiko', 'Miura, Masatomo', 'Takahashi, Naoto', 'Kimura, Shinya']","['Kidoguchi K', 'Ureshino H', 'Kizuka-Sano H', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Katsuya H', 'Kubota Y', 'Ando T', 'Miura M', 'Takahashi N', 'Kimura S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5034-3699'],"['Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan. m00010hu@jichi.ac.jp.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, Saga University Hospital, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20210427,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor', 'Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Philadelphia chromosome', 'Ponatinib', 'T315I mutation']",2021/04/29 06:00,2021/08/10 06:00,['2021/04/28 06:30'],"['2021/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/22 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/28 06:30 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-021-03156-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-021-03156-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2021 Aug;114(2):199-204. doi: 10.1007/s12185-021-03156-0.

Genetic mutation in SAMHD1 causes the inflammatory Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome and abnormal intracellular deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) pool. At present, the role of SAMHD1 in numerous types of cancer, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, is highly studied. Furthermore, it has been found that methylation, acetylation and phosphorylation are involved in the regulation of SAMHD1 expression, and that genetic mutations can cause changes in its activities, including dNTPase activity, long interspersed element type 1 (LINE-1) suppression and DNA damage repair, which could lead to uncontrolled cell cycle progression and cancer development. In addition, SAMHD1 has been reported to have a negative regulatory role in the chemosensitivity to anticancer drugs through its dNTPase activity. The present review aimed to summarize the regulation of SAMHD1 expression in cancer and its function in tumor growth and chemotherapy sensitivity, and discussed controversial points and future directions.","['Chen, Zhangming', 'Hu, Jie', 'Ying, Songcheng', 'Xu, Aman']","['Chen Z', 'Hu J', 'Ying S', 'Xu A']",,"['Department of General Surgery, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui 230001, P.R.

The present study aimed to demonstrate whether miR-155 enables CD34(+) CML cells to escape from the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-beta1 and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Among differentially expressed miRNAs in CD34(+) CML cells, miR-155 was highly up-regulated. QRT-PCR revealed an inverse correlation between miR-155 and two key members of the TGF-beta pathway-TGF-betaR2 and SMAD5. Results showed that SMAD5 is not only up-regulated through BMPs treatment, but recombinant TGF-beta1 can also induce SMAD5 in CML cells. We also demonstrated that TGF-beta1-mediated phosphorylation of SMAD1/5 was abolished by pre-treatment with the blocking TGF-betaR2 antibody, suggesting a possible involvement of TGF-betaR2. Additionally, overexpression of miR-155 significantly promoted the proliferation rate of CD34(+) CML cells. Results showed that siRNA-mediated knockdown of SMAD5 had a promoting effect on CD34(+) CML cell proliferation, suggesting that SMAD5 knock-down recapitulates the proliferative effects of miR-155. Importantly, TGF-beta1 and BMP2/4 treatment had inhibitory effects on cell proliferation; however, miR-155 overexpression enabled CD34(+) CML cells to evade the anti-proliferative effects of TGF-beta1 and BMPs. Consistently, down-regulation of miR-155 augmented the promoting effects of TGF-beta1 and BMP signaling on inducing apoptosis in CD34(+) CML stem cells. Our findings demonstrated that targeting of SMAD5 and TGF-betaR2 links miR-155 to TGF-beta signaling in CML. Overexpression of miR-155 enables CD34(+) CML cells to evade growth-inhibitory effects of the TGF-beta1 and BMP signaling, providing new perspectives for miR-155 as a therapeutic target for CML.","['Mahdloo, Touba', 'Sahami, Pantea', 'Ramezani, Reihaneh', 'Jafarinia, Mojtaba', 'Goudarzi, Hamedreza', 'Babashah, Sadegh']","['Mahdloo T', 'Sahami P', 'Ramezani R', 'Jafarinia M', 'Goudarzi H', 'Babashah S']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7066-0918'],"['Department of Genetics, Faculty of Basic Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Marvdasht, Iran.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Women Research Center, University of Alzahra, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Women Research Center, University of Alzahra, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Genetics, Faculty of Basic Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Marvdasht, Iran.', 'Department of Genetics, Faculty of Basic Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Marvdasht, Iran.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210415,Germany,EXCLI J,EXCLI journal,101299402,PMC8073837,['NOTNLM'],"['TGF-beta signaling', 'bone morphogenetic protein', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'miR-155']",2021/04/29 06:00,2021/04/29 06:01,['2021/04/28 06:20'],"['2021/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/28 06:20 [entrez]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.17179/excli2021-3404 [doi]', '2021-3404 [pii]']",epublish,EXCLI J. 2021 Apr 15;20:748-763. doi: 10.17179/excli2021-3404. eCollection 2021.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2021 Mahdloo et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several natural products including bioactive peptides have been explored and studied for their anti-leukemic activities. In the present study, anti-leukemic peptide, IGTLILM (IM-7), was isolated and identified from the protein hydrolysate of sesame seeds by reverse phase-solid phase extraction, off-gel fractionation and nano LC-MS/MS. The cytotoxic effects of IM-7 were studied in MOLT-4 and NB4 acute leukemic cell lines using an MTT assay. The induction of apoptosis and autophagy was investigated by flow cytometry using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and anti-LC3/FITC antibodies, respectively. The mRNA alterations of apoptotic and autophagic-related genes were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. The present study found that IM-7 inhibited the proliferation of MOLT-4 and NB4 cells in dose-dependent manner, but it showed a minimal effect on healthy mononuclear cells. IM-7 activated apoptosis and autophagy through the upregulation of CASP3, ULK1 and BECN1 and the downregulation of BCL2. In addition, IM-7 enhanced the cytotoxic effect of the anti-leukemic drug, daunorubicin. The findings suggested that IM-7 was potent to suppress the proliferation of MOLT-4 and NB4 leukemic cells and induce apoptosis and autophagy through the regulation of caspase 3-Bcl-2 and ULK1-Beclin1, respectively.","['Deesrisak, Kamolchanok', 'Yingchutrakul, Yodying', 'Krobthong, Sucheewin', 'Roytrakul, Sittiruk', 'Chatupheeraphat, Chawalit', 'Subkorn, Paweena', 'Anurathapan, Usanarat', 'Tanyong, Dalina']","['Deesrisak K', 'Yingchutrakul Y', 'Krobthong S', 'Roytrakul S', 'Chatupheeraphat C', 'Subkorn P', 'Anurathapan U', 'Tanyong D']",,"['Department of Clinical Microscopy, Faculty of Medical Technology, Mahidol University, Nakhon Pathom 73170, Thailand.', 'Proteomics Research Team, National Omics Center, National Science and Technology Development Agency, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand.', 'Proteomics Research Team, National Omics Center, National Science and Technology Development Agency, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand.', 'Functional Proteomics Technology Laboratory, Functional Ingredients and FoodInnovation Research Group, National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, National Science and Technology for Development Agency, Pathum Thani 12120,Thailand.', 'Department of Clinical Microscopy, Faculty of Medical Technology, Mahidol University, Nakhon Pathom 73170, Thailand.', 'Department of Clinical Microscopy, Faculty of Medical Technology, Mahidol University, Nakhon Pathom 73170, Thailand.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.', 'Department of Clinical Microscopy, Faculty of Medical Technology, Mahidol University, Nakhon Pathom 73170, Thailand.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210323,Germany,EXCLI J,EXCLI journal,101299402,PMC8073838,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'bioactive peptide', 'leukemia', 'sesame']",2021/04/29 06:00,2021/04/29 06:01,['2021/04/28 06:20'],"['2021/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/28 06:20 [entrez]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.17179/excli2021-3406 [doi]', '2021-3406 [pii]']",epublish,EXCLI J. 2021 Mar 23;20:709-721. doi: 10.17179/excli2021-3406. eCollection 2021.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2021 Deesrisak et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Significant improvements in survival and cure rates have been made over the past four decades in pediatric ALL treatment. Asparaginases, derived from Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi, have become a critical component of ALL therapy since the 1960s. Asparaginases cause depletion of serum asparagine, leading to deprivation of this critical amino acid for protein synthesis, and hence limit survival of lymphoblasts. Pegaspargase, a conjugate of monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG) and L-asparaginase, has become an integral component of pediatric upfront and relapsed ALL protocols due to its longer half-life and improved immunogenicity profile compared to native asparaginase preparations. Over the past two decades great strides have been made in outcomes for pediatric ALL due to risk stratification, incorporation of multiagent chemotherapy protocols, and central nervous system prophylaxis with pegaspargase having played an important role in this success. However, adolescents and young adults (AYA) with ALL when treated on contemporaneous trials using adult ALL regimens, continue to have poor outcomes. There is increasing realization of adapting pediatric trial regimens for treating AYAs, especially those incorporating higher intensity of chemotherapeutic agents with pegaspargase being one such agent. Dose or treatment-limiting toxicity is observed in 25-30% of patients, most notable being hypersensitivity reactions. Other toxicities include asparaginase-associated pancreatitis, thrombosis, liver dysfunction, osteonecrosis, and dyslipidemia. Discontinuation or subtherapeutic levels of asparaginase are associated with inferior disease-free survival leading to higher risk of relapse, and in cases of relapse, a higher risk for remission failure. This article provides an overview of available evidence for use of pegaspargase in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Bender, Cynthia', 'Maese, Luke', 'Carter-Febres, Maria', 'Verma, Anupam']","['Bender C', 'Maese L', 'Carter-Febres M', 'Verma A']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6555-7924'],"[""Department of Pharmacy, Primary Children's Hospital, Salt Lake City, UT, USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah and Primary Children's Hospital, Salt Lake City, UT, USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah and Primary Children's Hospital, Salt Lake City, UT, USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah and Primary Children's Hospital, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210419,New Zealand,Blood Lymphat Cancer,Blood and lymphatic cancer : targets and therapy,101596730,PMC8064615,['NOTNLM'],"['asparaginase', 'asparagine', 'serum asparaginase activity', 'toxicity']",2021/04/29 06:00,2021/04/29 06:01,['2021/04/28 06:19'],"['2020/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/28 06:19 [entrez]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/BLCTT.S245210 [doi]', '245210 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Lymphat Cancer. 2021 Apr 19;11:25-40. doi: 10.2147/BLCTT.S245210. eCollection 2021.,,,,,['(c) 2021 Bender et al.'],,,,,"['Anupam Verma, Cynthia Bender and Maria Carter have no conflicts of interest to', 'report in this work.

Recent studies reported that IL-37 was abnormally expressed in several tumor patients, including those with hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer, and multiple myeloma. However, the expression and potential function of IL-37 in leukemia remain unknown. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate IL-37 as a prognostic factor and its possible mechanism of action. Methods: Polymerase chain reaction products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and were purified and subsequently sequenced by a genetic testing laboratory. Human PBMC was purified from whole blood samples by using Ficoll-Paque PLUS. The concentrations of human IL-37 and human IL-6 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Results: IL-37, especially isoform b and d, was expressed in the bone marrow of AML, CML, ALL, and CLL. Importantly, IL-37 expression was downregulated in newly diagnosed AML patients and restored in patients in complete remission. Moreover, a significant association was found between IL-37 expression and NPM1 mutation or possible prognosis evaluated by karyotype and gene mutation. Further analysis revealed that IL-37 expression was negatively correlated with IL-6 expression. With regard to the mechanism, recombinant human IL-37 could suppress IL-6 expression stimulated by LPS in PBMC of AML patients. Conclusion: Our study suggested that IL-37 may be an important prognostic factor in AML and is involved in AML via the IL-6 signaling pathway, indicating that IL-37 is an innovative research strategy for AML pathogenesis and therapy.","['Wei, Xiaonan', 'Li, Yulan', 'Zhang, Guili', 'Wang, Na', 'Mi, Miaomiao', 'Xin, Yu', 'Jiang, Huihui', 'Sun, Chengming']","['Wei X', 'Li Y', 'Zhang G', 'Wang N', 'Mi M', 'Xin Y', 'Jiang H', 'Sun C']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8065-9053'],"[""Qingdao Women and Children's Hospital, Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong, 266000, People's Republic of China."", ""Center for Laboratory Diagnosis, Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital Affiliated to Qingdao University, Yantai Shandong, 264000, People's Republic of China."", ""Center for Laboratory Diagnosis, Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital Affiliated to Qingdao University, Yantai Shandong, 264000, People's Republic of China."", ""Center for Laboratory Diagnosis, Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital Affiliated to Qingdao University, Yantai Shandong, 264000, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Medicine, Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong, 266000, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Clinical Medical, Binzhou Medical University Clinical Laboratory, Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital, Yantai, Shandong, 264000, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Medicine, Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong, 266000, People's Republic of China."", ""Center for Laboratory Diagnosis, Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital Affiliated to Qingdao University, Yantai Shandong, 264000, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210419,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,PMC8064683,['NOTNLM'],"['IL-6', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'interleukin-37', 'prognosis']",2021/04/29 06:00,2021/04/29 06:01,['2021/04/28 06:18'],"['2021/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/28 06:18 [entrez]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S303017 [doi]', '303017 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2021 Apr 19;13:3393-3402. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S303017. eCollection 2021.,,,,,['(c) 2021 Wei et al.'],,,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms of PAX2 action during kidney development have been evaluated in mice but not in humans. This is a critical gap in knowledge since important differences have been reported in kidney development in the two species. In the present study, we hypothesized that key human PAX2-dependent kidney development genes are differentially expressed in nephron progenitor cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in patients with RCS relative to healthy individuals. Cap analysis of gene expression revealed 189 candidate promoters and 71 candidate enhancers that were differentially activated by PAX2 in this system in three patients with RCS with PAX2 mutations. By comparing this list with the list of candidate Pax2-regulated mouse kidney development genes obtained from the Functional Annotation of the Mouse/Mammalian (FANTOM) database, we prioritized 17 genes. Furthermore, we ranked three genes-PBX1, POSTN, and ITGA9-as the top candidates based on closely aligned expression kinetics with PAX2 in the iPSC culture system and susceptibility to suppression by a Pax2 inhibitor in cultured mouse embryonic kidney explants. Identification of these genes may provide important information to clarify the pathogenesis of RCS, human kidney development, and kidney regeneration.","['Yamamura, Yuta', 'Furuichi, Kengo', 'Murakawa, Yasuhiro', 'Hirabayashi, Shigeki', 'Yoshihara, Masahito', 'Sako, Keisuke', 'Kitajima, Shinji', 'Toyama, Tadashi', 'Iwata, Yasunori', 'Sakai, Norihiko', 'Hosomichi, Kazuyoshi', 'Murphy, Philip M', 'Tajima, Atsushi', 'Okita, Keisuke', 'Osafune, Kenji', 'Kaneko, Shuichi', 'Wada, Takashi']","['Yamamura Y', 'Furuichi K', 'Murakawa Y', 'Hirabayashi S', 'Yoshihara M', 'Sako K', 'Kitajima S', 'Toyama T', 'Iwata Y', 'Sakai N', 'Hosomichi K', 'Murphy PM', 'Tajima A', 'Okita K', 'Osafune K', 'Kaneko S', 'Wada T']",,"['Department of Nephrology and Laboratory Medicine, Institute of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takara-machi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, 920-8640, Japan.', 'Department of Nephrology, School of Medicine, Kanazawa Medical University, 1-1 Daigaku, Uchinada, Kahoku, Ishikawa, 920-0293, Japan. furuichi@kanazawa-med.ac.jp.', 'RIKEN Preventive Medicine and Diagnosis Innovation Program, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'RIKEN Preventive Medicine and Diagnosis Innovation Program, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Division of Genomic Technologies, RIKEN Center for Life Science Technologies, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Nephrology and Laboratory Medicine, Institute of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takara-machi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, 920-8640, Japan.', 'Department of Nephrology and Laboratory Medicine, Institute of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takara-machi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, 920-8640, Japan.', 'Department of Nephrology and Laboratory Medicine, Institute of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takara-machi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, 920-8640, Japan.', 'Department of Nephrology and Laboratory Medicine, Institute of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takara-machi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, 920-8640, Japan.', 'Department of Nephrology and Laboratory Medicine, Institute of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takara-machi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, 920-8640, Japan.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics, Graduate School of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan.', 'Molecular Signaling Section, Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics, Graduate School of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan.', 'Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of System Biology, Institute of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan.', 'Department of Nephrology and Laboratory Medicine, Institute of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takara-machi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, 920-8640, Japan. twada@m-kanazawa.jp.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210427,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC8079710,,,2021/04/29 06:00,2021/10/26 06:00,['2021/04/28 06:10'],"['2020/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/28 06:10 [entrez]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-021-88743-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-021-88743-1 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2021 Apr 27;11(1):9123. doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-88743-1.,20211025,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (ITGA9 protein, human)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (PAX2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX2 protein, human)', '0 (POSTN protein, human)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics', 'Cell Lineage', 'Coloboma/pathology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Integrins/genetics', 'Kidney/cytology/*growth & development', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Middle Aged', 'Nephrons/cytology/physiology', 'PAX2 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1/genetics', 'Renal Insufficiency/pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we evaluated the in vivo effects of EGCG in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) using an acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) experimental model (PML/RARalpha). Haematological analysis revealed that EGCG treatment reversed leucocytosis, anaemia and thrombocytopenia, and prolonged survival of PML/RARalpha mice. Notably, EGCG reduced leukaemia immature cells and promyelocytes in the bone marrow while increasing mature myeloid cells, possibly due to apoptosis increase and cell differentiation. The reduction of promyelocytes and neutrophils/monocytes increase detected in the peripheral blood, in addition to the increased percentage of bone marrow cells with aggregated promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies staining and decreased expression of PML-RAR oncoprotein corroborates our results. In addition, EGCG increased expression of neutrophil differentiation markers such as CD11b, CD14, CD15 and CD66 in NB4 cells; and the combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) plus EGCG yield higher increase the expression of CD15 marker. These findings could be explained by a decrease of peptidyl-prolyl isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (PIN1) expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase. EGCG also decreased expression of substrate oncoproteins for PIN1 (including cyclin D1, NF-kappaB p65, c-MYC, and AKT) and 67 kDa laminin receptor (67LR) in the bone marrow cells. Moreover, EGCG showed inhibition of ROS production in NB4 cells in the presence of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), as well as a partial blockage of neutrophil differentiation and apoptosis, indicating that EGCG-activities involve/or are in response of oxidative stress. Furthermore, apoptosis of spleen cells was supported by increasing expression of BAD and BAX, parallel to BCL-2 and c-MYC decrease. The reduction of spleen weights of PML/RARalpha mice, as well as apoptosis induced by EGCG in NB4 cells in a dose-dependent manner confirms this assumption. Our results support further evaluation of EGCG in clinical trials for AML, since EGCG could represent a promising option for AML patient ineligible for current mainstay treatments.","['Della Via, Fernanda Isabel', 'Shiraishi, Rodrigo Naoto', 'Santos, Irene', 'Ferro, Karla Priscila', 'Salazar-Terreros, Myriam Janeth', 'Franchi Junior, Gilberto Carlos', 'Rego, Eduardo Magalhaes', 'Saad, Sara Teresinha Olalla', 'Torello, Cristiane Okuda']","['Della Via FI', 'Shiraishi RN', 'Santos I', 'Ferro KP', 'Salazar-Terreros MJ', 'Franchi Junior GC', 'Rego EM', 'Saad STO', 'Torello CO']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8508-9187', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8138-7088', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1567-4086', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0809-8068', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1611-020X']","['Haematology and Transfusion Medicine Centre - Hemocentro, University of Campinas, Campinas, 13083-878, Brazil.', 'Haematology and Transfusion Medicine Centre - Hemocentro, University of Campinas, Campinas, 13083-878, Brazil.', 'Haematology and Transfusion Medicine Centre - Hemocentro, University of Campinas, Campinas, 13083-878, Brazil.', 'Haematology and Transfusion Medicine Centre - Hemocentro, University of Campinas, Campinas, 13083-878, Brazil.', 'Haematology and Transfusion Medicine Centre - Hemocentro, University of Campinas, Campinas, 13083-878, Brazil.', 'Onco-Haematological Child Centre, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Campinas, Campinas, 13083-970, Brazil.', 'Haematology and Clinical Oncology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, 14048-900, Brazil.', 'Haematology and Transfusion Medicine Centre - Hemocentro, University of Campinas, Campinas, 13083-878, Brazil.', 'Haematology and Transfusion Medicine Centre - Hemocentro, University of Campinas, Campinas, 13083-878, Brazil. cris.okuda@gmail.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210427,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC8079435,,,2021/04/29 06:00,2021/10/26 06:00,['2021/04/28 06:03'],"['2019/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/28 06:03 [entrez]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-021-88478-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-021-88478-z [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2021 Apr 27;11(1):9103. doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-88478-z.,20211025,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Bad protein, mouse)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (PIN1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha/genetics', 'Spleen/drug effects/pathology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is no much literature available on pulmonary rehabilitation in pediatric patients' post lung transplant. Through this case report, we would like to present our intensive PR program for pediatric patients' post-lung transplant. PATIENT CONCERNS: The 10-year-old boy's breathing before receiving a lung transplant continued to deteriorate and he eventually became dependent on a wheelchair. DIAGNOSIS: He was diagnosed with infantile acute lymphoblastic leukemia at 6 months of age. At the age of one year, he underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, but was diagnosed with post-transplantation bronchiolitis obliterans (PTBO) two months later. He had a lung transplant at the age of 10. INTERVENTIONS: He was hospitalized and received an initial assessment. This assessment included functional, cognitive, and psychological evaluations. He additionally completed PR exercises twice daily for two weeks. After discharge, he continued to participate in an outpatient-based PR program for three months. During the outpatient phase, PR exercises were performed once weekly, in addition to home-based cognitive training. OUTCOMES: Our intensive post-lung PR program improved our patient's exercise capacity, lung function, and quality of life. As a comprehensive rehabilitation service, our program also included a cognitive training component. CONCLUSION: We describe an intensive PR program tailored to pediatric patients' post-lung transplant. The program was feasible and resulted in improvements in functional exercise capacity, lung function, and quality of life. Future research into our method is necessary for continued improvement of this novel program.","['Choi, Eun Jung', 'Kim, Won', 'Jeon, Jae Yong', 'Ko, Eun Jae', 'Yu, Jinho', 'Choi, Se Hoon', 'Lee, Seung Hak', 'Sung, In Young']","['Choi EJ', 'Kim W', 'Jeon JY', 'Ko EJ', 'Yu J', 'Choi SH', 'Lee SH', 'Sung IY']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3017-8497'],"['Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Seongnam Citizens Medical Center, Seongnam.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul.', 'Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,PMC8084064,,,2021/04/29 06:00,2021/05/05 06:00,['2021/04/28 05:47'],"['2021/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/28 05:47 [entrez]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000025523 [doi]', '00005792-202104300-00016 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2021 Apr 30;100(17):e25523. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000025523.,20210504,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Bronchiolitis Obliterans/etiology/physiopathology/*surgery', 'Child', 'Exercise Therapy/*methods', 'Exercise Tolerance', 'Humans', 'Lung/physiopathology', 'Lung Transplantation/*rehabilitation', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Respiratory Therapy/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome']","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

We assessed the prevalence and clinical impact of functional subtypes of IKZF1 deletions in pediatric BCR-ABL1-negative B-ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study of IKZF1 deletions was done in cases of pediatric BCR-ABL1-negative B-ALL. The genomic DNA of cases, over a 53-month period, was analyzed using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and multiplex fluorescent polymerase chain reaction. The deletions were divided into functional subgroups: (1) loss-of-function/haploinsufficiency, (2) dominant-negative, and (3) a combination of both types of deletion. The post-induction remission status, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) were noted. RESULTS: Out of 320 cases, 47 (14.7%) had IKZF1 deletions. Thirty-six of the 47 (77%) had loss-of-function deletions, 10 (21%) had dominant-negative deletions, and one (2%) had a combination of both types. The post-induction remission rates in cases with loss-of-function deletions (22/30, 73%; P = .060) and dominant-negative deletions (4/5, 80%; P = .517) were lower compared with those without deletions (215/248, 86.7%). These cases also had worse median EFS: 21.1 months (P = .006) for loss-of-function and 15.4 months (P = .156) for dominant-negative deletions, compared with 46.4 months in cases without IKZF1 deletions. They also had worse median OS: 23.4 months (P = .012) for loss-of-function deletions and 15.7 months (P = .233) for dominant-negative deletions, compared with median not reached in cases without IKZF1 deletions. CONCLUSION: The IKZF1 deletions were seen in 14.7% of BCR-ABL1-negative pediatric B-ALL. Most of these deletions (77%) were loss-of-function type. The cases with loss-of-function deletions had lower remission rates and poor EFS and OS compared with cases without IKZF1 deletions. A similar trend of poor outcome was seen in the few cases with dominant-negative IKZF1 deletions.","['Gupta, Sanjeev Kumar', 'Bakhshi, Sameer', 'Gupta, Ritu', 'Sharma, Preity', 'Pushpam, Deepam', 'Sahoo, Ranjit Kumar', 'Kamal, Vineet Kumar']","['Gupta SK', 'Bakhshi S', 'Gupta R', 'Sharma P', 'Pushpam D', 'Sahoo RK', 'Kamal VK']",,"['Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr. B.R.A.

Secondary CNS T-cell lymphoma generally affects about 5% of patients with T- or NK-cell lymphoma, with some exceptions. Acute and lymphomatous subtypes of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) have high risk of CNS progression, may affect up to 20% of patients; ALK-positive ALCL with extranodal involvement >1 also has high risk of CNS progression. However, the impact and the optimal methodology of CNS prophylaxis remain unclear in systemic T-cell lymphomas. There are little data on the treatment strategy of primary and secondary CNS T-cell lymphoma. Treatment strategy derived from B-cell CNS primary lymphoma is generally used; this includes induction therapy with high-dose methotrexate-based regimens, followed by high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant in fit patients. There are unmet needs for patients who are not fit for intensive chemotherapy. The prognosis after CNS progression in T-cell lymphoma is dismal with the median overall survival of less than 1 year. New agents targeting T-cell lymphomas are emerging and should be tested in patients with mature T- and NK-cell lymphoma who suffer from CNS involvement.","['Pang, Yifan', 'Chihara, Dai']","['Pang Y', 'Chihara D']",,"['Medical Oncology Service, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

Confirmation of seropositivity of anti-HTLV-1 antibody, and clonal proliferation of CD4 and CD25 positive lymphocytes with nuclear pleomorphism in patients suspicious of malignant lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia is crucial for the diagnosis of ATL. The clinical course of ATL is very heterogeneous, and divided into acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types. The chronic type is further subclassified into the favorable and unfavorable subtypes. Acute, lymphoma, and unfavorable chronic type ATL, and favorable chronic and smoldering type ATL are defined as aggressive and indolent ATL, respectively. Recently identified prognostic indices based on clinical parameters and/or genetic predictors of outcomes need to be confirmed and incorporated for more stratified therapeutic interventions. The standard of care for aggressive ATL is multiagent chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation if possible, while that for indolent ATL is watchful waiting until progression to aggressive ATL. The combination of interferon-alpha and zidovudine is also standard for leukemic type ATL.

RUNX1 forms a heterodimeric complex with CBFB. Germline mutations and somatic alterations (i.e. translocations, mutations and abnormal expression) are frequently associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with RUNX1 mutations conferring unfavorable prognosis. Therefore, RUNX1 constitutes a potential innovative and interesting therapeutic target. In this review, we discuss recent therapeutic advances of RUNX1 targeting in AML.Areas covered: Firstly, we cover the clinical basis for RUNX1 targeting. We have subdivided recent therapeutic approaches either by common biochemical pathways or by similar pharmacological targets. Genome editing of RUNX1 induces anti-leukemic effects; however, off-target events prohibit clinical use. Several molecules inhibit the interaction between RUNX1/CBFB and control AML development and progression. BET protein antagonists target RUNX1 (i.e. specific BET inhibitors, BRD4 shRNRA, proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTAC) or expression-mimickers). All these molecules improve survival in mutant RUNX1 AML preclinical models.Expert opinion: Some of these novel molecules have shown encouraging anti-leukemic potency at the preclinical stage. A better understanding of RUNX1 function in AML development and progression and its key downstream pathways, may result in more precise and more efficient RUNX1 targeting therapies.","['Gonzales, Fanny', 'Barthelemy, Adeline', 'Peyrouze, Pauline', 'Fenwarth, Laurene', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Duployez, Nicolas', 'Cheok, Meyling H']","['Gonzales F', 'Barthelemy A', 'Peyrouze P', 'Fenwarth L', 'Preudhomme C', 'Duployez N', 'Cheok MH']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2808-4843', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3927-1022', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7820-8026']","['Factors of Leukemic cell Persistence, Univ.

It is a potent source of secondary metabolites. The aim of this study was to evaluate the apoptotic properties of leaf extracts of Simarouba glauca against human leukemic cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytotoxicity of Simarouba glauca was assessed in the leaf extract of petroleum ether against leukemic cells by MTT assay. To detect the apoptotic features, fluorescence microscopy analysis was done with dual acridine orange/ethidium bromide fluorescent staining and Hoechst staining. To determine the externalization of phosphatidylserine, annexin v staining was done. Mitochondrial or death receptor activation was confirmed by caspase 3 analysis by flow cytometry. RESULTS: This study revealed that Simarouba glauca was able to treat leukemia. Among the four extracts, petroleum ether extract showed a higher order of in vitro anticancer activity. The petroleum ether extract strongly inhibited the proliferation of K562 cell lines with IC50 values of 186 microg/ml. Dual acridine orange/ethidium bromide fluorescent staining and Hoechst staining revealed the characteristic features of apoptosis. Annexin V confirmed early and late stage apoptosis. Caspase-3 analysis revealed that cell death was due to mitochondrial or death receptor activation in mitochondrial pathway. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that Simarouba glauca leaf extracts inhibited leukemic cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner either through mitochondrial or death receptor activation. The leaf extracts of Simarouba glauca was found to be nontoxic to lymphocytes. It can be concluded that Simarouba glauca is an important source of phytochemicals posing efficacy against leukemic cancer cells.<br />.","['Biba, Vikas', 'Kunjiraman, Sujathan', 'Rajam, Suja Somasekharan Nair', 'Anil, Sukumaran']","['Biba V', 'Kunjiraman S', 'Rajam SSN', 'Anil S']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6489-6385', 'ORCID: ORCID-ID: 0000-0002-6440-8780']","['Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden and Research, Trivandrum, Kerala, India.', 'Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, Kerala, India.', 'Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden and Research, Trivandrum, Kerala, India.', 'Department of Dentistry, Oral Health Institute, Hamad Medical corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'College of Dental Medicine, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210401,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,PMC8325137,['NOTNLM'],"['Anticancer', 'Antiproliferative', 'Leukemia', 'Simarouba glauca', 'apoptotic']",2021/04/29 06:00,2021/11/24 06:00,['2021/04/28 01:03'],"['2021/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/28 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.4.1305 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2021 Apr 1;22(4):1305-1312. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.4.1305.,20211123,"['0 (Alkanes)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'O3L624621X (naphtha)']",IM,"['Alkanes', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves', '*Simarouba']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated mutagenesis in Escherichia coli ASNase II to find a mutant with lower GLNase activity via molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Residues with low binding energy to asparagine (Asn) and high binding energy to glutamine (Gln) were chosen for mutagenesis. A mutant with low free binding energy to Gln was then selected for molecular docking and MD studies. The results showed that V27F is a good candidate for reducing GLNase activity and that it has little effect on enzyme ASNase activity. A simulation analysis showed that the V27F mutant was more stable than the WT ASNase and that mutagenesis was quite successful.","['Ardalan, Noeman', 'Akhavan Sepahi, Abbas', 'Khavari-Nejad, Ramazan Ali']","['Ardalan N', 'Akhavan Sepahi A', 'Khavari-Nejad RA']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4144-4313'],"['Department of Microbiology, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Science, North Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210401,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,PMC8325130,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'E. coli', 'Glutaminase activity', 'L-asparaginase', 'Molecular Dynamics']",2021/04/29 06:00,2021/11/06 06:00,['2021/04/28 01:03'],"['2020/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/28 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.4.1137 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2021 Apr 1;22(4):1137-1147. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.4.1137.,20211105,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects/chemical synthesis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Drug Design', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Protein Engineering/*methods']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the existence of a cure rate, if the distribution of survival times for susceptible patients is specified, researchers usually prefer cure models to parametric models. Different distributions can be assumed for the survival times, for instance, generalized modified Weibull (GMW), exponentiated Weibull (EW), and log-beta Weibull. The purpose of this study is to select the best distribution for uncured patients' survival times by comparing the mixture cure models based on the GMW distribution and its particular cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A data set of 91 patients with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) followed for five years from 1982 to 1987 was chosen for fitting the mixture cure model. We used the maximum likelihood estimation technique via R software 3.6.2 to obtain the estimates for parameters of the proposed model in the existence of cure rate, censored data, and covariates. For the best model choice, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) was implemented. RESULTS: After comparing different parametric models fitted to the data, including or excluding cure fraction, without covariates, the smallest AIC values were obtained by the EW and the GMW distributions, (953.31/969.35) and (955.84/975.99), respectively. Besides, assuming a mixture cure model based on GMW with covariates, an estimated ratio between cure fractions for allogeneic and autologous bone marrow transplant groups (and its 95% confidence intervals) were 1.42972 (95% CI: 1.18614 - 1.72955). CONCLUSION: The results of this study reveal that the EW and the GMW distributions are the best choices for the survival times of Leukemia patients.<br />.","['Omer, Mohamed Elamin', 'Abu Bakar, Mohd', 'Adam, Mohd', 'Mustafa, Mohd']","['Omer ME', 'Abu Bakar M', 'Adam M', 'Mustafa M']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/00'],"['Department of Mathematics, College of Science, Sudan University of Science and Technology, Khartoum, Sudan.', 'Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, Universiti Putra Malaysia, 43400 UPM, Serdang, Malaysia.', 'Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, Universiti Putra Malaysia, 43400 UPM, Serdang, Malaysia.', 'Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, Universiti Putra Malaysia, 43400 UPM, Serdang, Malaysia.', 'Institute of Mathematical Research, Universiti Putra Malaysia, 43400 UPM, Serdang, Malaysia.', 'Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, Universiti Putra Malaysia, 43400 UPM, Serdang, Malaysia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210401,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,PMC8325136,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'Cure fraction model', 'Maximum likelihood estimation', 'Right-censored data', 'Survival Analysis']",2021/04/29 06:00,2021/11/06 06:00,['2021/04/28 01:03'],"['2020/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/28 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.4.1045 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2021 Apr 1;22(4):1045-1053. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.4.1045.,20211105,,IM,"['Humans', 'Likelihood Functions', '*Models, Statistical', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality', 'Statistical Distributions', '*Survival Analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1(SDF-1) and its receptor CXC receptor 4 (CXCR4) has an essential role in dissemination of blast cells. Study aimed to detect CXCR4 expression and the SDF-1 (rs1801157) gene polymorphisms and correlate them with prognosis and outcome in AML patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on 60 de-novo AML patients, and 60 healthy controls. SDF-1 (rs1801157) gene polymorphisms were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), and CXCR4 expression was done using flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS: SDF-1 dominant model (AG+AA) had higher risk AML (p 0.002). CXCR4positive cases were associated significantly with toxic manifestations (p 0.019), lower CR rates (p 0.004), and unfavorable cytogenetics (p 0.027). Multivariate analysis showed that combined CXCR4positive with dominant SDF-1 considered as independent prognostic factor for shorter overall survival (OS) in AML patients (p 0.031). CONCLUSION: SDF-1 dominant model had a higher risk to develop AML, and CXCR4 positive expression predicts poor prognosis in AML patients and it could represent a targeted therapy in AML. In addition, CXCR4 could be easily integrated into the initial routine diagnostic work up of AML.<br />.","['Aladle, Doaa Abd Allah M', 'Ghannam, Mayada A', 'El-Ashwah, Shaimaa', 'Ghobrial, F E I', 'Mortada, Metwaly Ibrahim']","['Aladle DAAM', 'Ghannam MA', 'El-Ashwah S', 'Ghobrial FEI', 'Mortada MI']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3465-1955'],"['Hematology Unit, Department of Clinical Pathology, Mansoura Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Egypt.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Clinical Pathology, Mansoura Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Egypt.', 'Clinical Hematology Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Oncology Center, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Medical Oncology Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Oncology Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Egypt.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Clinical Pathology, Mansoura Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210401,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,PMC8325146,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CXCR4', 'Flowcytometry', 'PCR-RFLP']",2021/04/29 06:00,2021/11/06 06:00,['2021/04/28 01:03'],"['2020/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/28 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.4.1035 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2021 Apr 1;22(4):1035-1043. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.4.1035.,20211105,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*genetics', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics', 'Risk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While first-generation antibody tests have primarily provided qualitative results, accurate seroprevalence studies and tracking of antibody levels over time require highly specific, sensitive and quantitative test setups. METHODS: We have developed two quantitative, easy-to-implement SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests, based on the spike receptor binding domain and the nucleocapsid protein. Comprehensive evaluation of antigens from several biotechnological platforms enabled the identification of superior antigen designs for reliable serodiagnostic. Cut-off modelling based on unprecedented large and heterogeneous multicentric validation cohorts allowed us to define optimal thresholds for the tests' broad applications in different aspects of clinical use, such as seroprevalence studies and convalescent plasma donor qualification. FINDINGS: Both developed serotests individually performed similarly-well as fully-automated CE-marked test systems. Our described sensitivity-improved orthogonal test approach assures highest specificity (99.8%); thereby enabling robust serodiagnosis in low-prevalence settings with simple test formats. The inclusion of a calibrator permits accurate quantitative monitoring of antibody concentrations in samples collected at different time points during the acute and convalescent phase of COVID-19 and disclosed antibody level thresholds that correlate well with robust neutralization of authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. INTERPRETATION: We demonstrate that antigen source and purity strongly impact serotest performance. Comprehensive biotechnology-assisted selection of antigens and in-depth characterisation of the assays allowed us to overcome limitations of simple ELISA-based antibody test formats based on chromometric reporters, to yield comparable assay performance as fully-automated platforms.

Despite unrelated donor registries listing > 38 million volunteers, 25%-80% of US patients lack an HLA-matched unrelated donor, with significant disparity across ethnic groups. We hypothesized that HCT with a mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD) using post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy), a novel strategy successful in overcoming genetic disparity using mismatched related donors, would be feasible and increase access to HCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective phase II study of MMUD bone marrow HCT with PTCy for patients with hematologic malignancies. The primary end point was 1-year overall survival (OS), hypothesized to be 65% or better. 80 patients enrolled at 11 US transplant centers (December 2016-March 2019). Following myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning-based HCT, patients received PTCy on days +3, +4, with sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil starting on day +5. We compared outcomes to Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research contemporary controls receiving PTCy. RESULTS: Notably, 48% of patients enrolled were ethnic minorities. 39% of pairs were matched for 4-6 out of 8 HLA alleles. The primary end point was met, with 1-year OS of 76% (90% CI, 67.3 to 83.3) in the entire cohort, and 72% and 79% in the myeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning strata, respectively. Secondary end points related to engraftment and graft-versus-host-disease were reached. Multivariate analysis comparing the study group with other mismatched HCT controls found no significant differences in OS. CONCLUSION: Our prospective study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of HCT with an MMUD in the setting of PTCy.

The development of oral HMAs has been an area of active interest; however, oral bioavailability has been quite poor due to rapid metabolism by cytidine deaminase (CDA). This led to the development of the novel CDA inhibitor cedazuridine, which was combined with an oral formulation of decitabine. Preclinical work demonstrated a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile approximate to parenteral decitabine, leading to early-phase clinical trials of oral cedazuridine-decitabine (C-DEC) in myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). A combination of oral decitabine 35 mg with oral cedazuridine 100 mg was established as the recommended phase 2 dose. Phase 2 data confirmed bioequivalence of C-DEC when compared with parenteral decitabine, and a larger phase 3 trial has demonstrated similar results, leading to the FDA approval of C-DEC for use in intermediate/high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and CMML. This review will focus upon the current role of HMA therapy in MDS/CMML, preclinical and clinical development of C-DEC, and potential roles of oral HMA therapy in myeloid malignancies moving forward.","['Patel, Anand A', 'Cahill, Kirk', 'Saygin, Caner', 'Odenike, Olatoyosi']","['Patel AA', 'Cahill K', 'Saygin C', 'Odenike O']",,"['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC8095139,,,2021/04/28 06:00,2021/06/01 06:00,['2021/04/27 12:16'],"['2020/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/27 12:16 [entrez]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(21)00287-1 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002929 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2021 Apr 27;5(8):2264-2271. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002929.,20210531,"['39IS23Q1EW (cedazuridine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/therapeutic use', 'Decitabine', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy', 'Uridine/analogs & derivatives']",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The malignant B cells obtain key proliferation and survival signals within lymph nodes or bone marrow. Moreover, CLL B cells and tumor microenvironment dynamically co-evolve organizing inflammatory and immunosuppressive microenvironment by direct contact with surrounding cells and secretion of cytokines, growth factors, or extracellular vesicles. Finding a way to weaken obtaining by malignant B cells supportive signals may improve CLL outcome and optimize treatment strategies. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether CD150 and CD180 cell surface receptors could be involved in the regulation of CLL B cells-derived cytokines (CCL3, CCL4, IL-6, and IL-10). The study was performed on malignant B cells isolated from peripheral blood of primary CLL patients. Flow cytometry, qPCR, ELISA, western blot, ex vivo cell surface ligation assay, ex vivo drug sensitivity assay, and cell viability assay were used in this study. The CCL3, CCL4, IL-6, and IL-10 mRNA expression levels were heterogeneously presented among studied CLL cases. The elevated CCL3/CCL4 and decreased IL-6/IL-10 expression level are specific features of CLL B cells with positive CD150 and CD180 expression status. Ligation of CD150 and CD180 receptors did not affect CCL3/CCL4 mRNA expression level in CLL B cells, while IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly decreased. After malignant B cells stimulation via CD150 and CD180 observed reduced IL-10 but not IL-6 levels in culture supernatants. Ligation of CD150 and CD180 was linked to the classical NF-kappaB pathway via regulation of phosphorylation level of NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaBalpha. We found several correlations between basal mRNA expression levels of CCL3, CCL4, IL-6, and IL-10 in CLL B cells and their sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs ex vivo. High CCL3/CCL4 and low IL-10 mRNA expression levels are associated with malignant B cells' sensitivity to BEN, while high IL-6 levels are a sign of CLL B cells' resistance to FC. The revealed involvement of CD150 and CD180 in cytokine regulation expands our knowledge of the role of CD150 and CD180 in the pathobiology of CLL and their contribution to a favorable clinical outcome. Determining the cytokines expression levels together with CD150 and CD180 expression status may help to predict the responsiveness of CLL B cells to chemotherapeutic drugs and optimize personalized chemotherapy scheme.","['Shcherbina, Valeriia', 'Gordiienko, Inna', 'Shlapatska, Larysa', 'Gluzman, Danilo', 'Sidorenko, Svitlana']","['Shcherbina V', 'Gordiienko I', 'Shlapatska L', 'Gluzman D', 'Sidorenko S']",,"['Oncohematology, RE Kavetsky Institute of Experimental Pathology, Oncology and Radiobiology, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv, Ukraine.', 'Oncohematology, RE Kavetsky Institute of Experimental Pathology, Oncology and Radiobiology, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv, Ukraine.', 'Oncohematology, RE Kavetsky Institute of Experimental Pathology, Oncology and Radiobiology, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv, Ukraine.', 'Oncohematology, RE Kavetsky Institute of Experimental Pathology, Oncology and Radiobiology, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv, Ukraine.', 'Oncohematology, RE Kavetsky Institute of Experimental Pathology, Oncology and Radiobiology, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv, Ukraine.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210428,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,,,,2021/04/28 06:00,2021/08/07 06:00,['2021/04/27 08:36'],"['2021/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/27 08:36 [entrez]']","['10.4149/neo_2021_210104N8 [doi]', '210104N8 [pii]']",ppublish,Neoplasma. 2021 Jul;68(4):760-769. doi: 10.4149/neo_2021_210104N8.

Still, a relevant percentage of patients do not respond to lenalidomide and even experience progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, we aimed to investigate whether global DNA methylation patterns could predict response to lenalidomide. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis using Illumina 450k methylation arrays was performed on n=51 patients with MDS del5q who were uniformly treated with lenalidomide in a prospective multicenter trial of the German MDS study group. To study potential direct effects of lenalidomide on DNA methylation, 17 paired samples pre- and post-treatment were analyzed. Our results revealed no relevant effect of lenalidomide on methylation status. Furthermore, methylation patterns prior to therapy could not predict lenalidomide response. However, methylation clustering identified a group of patients with a trend towards inferior overall survival. These patients showed hypermethylation of several interesting target genes, including genes of relevant signaling pathways, potentially indicating the evaluation of novel therapeutic targets.","['Hecht, Anna', 'Meyer, Julia A', 'Jann, Johann-Christoph', 'Sockel, Katja', 'Giagounidis, Aristoteles', 'Gotze, Katharina S', 'Letsch, Anne', 'Haase, Detlef', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Schafhausen, Philippe', 'Bug, Gesine', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Thol, Felicitas', 'Busche, Guntram', 'Schuler, Esther', 'Nowak, Verena', 'Oblander, Julia', 'Fey, Stephanie', 'Muller, Nadine', 'Metzgeroth, Georgia', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Nolte, Florian', 'Reinwald, Mark', 'Nowak, Daniel']","['Hecht A', 'Meyer JA', 'Jann JC', 'Sockel K', 'Giagounidis A', 'Gotze KS', 'Letsch A', 'Haase D', 'Schlenk RF', 'Haferlach T', 'Schafhausen P', 'Bug G', 'Lubbert M', 'Thol F', 'Busche G', 'Schuler E', 'Nowak V', 'Oblander J', 'Fey S', 'Muller N', 'Metzgeroth G', 'Hofmann WK', 'Germing U', 'Nolte F', 'Reinwald M', 'Nowak D']",,"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany. anna.hecht@medma.uni-heidelberg.de.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Palliative Care, Marien Hospital Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Charite, Benjamin Franklin University, Berlin, Germany.', 'Clinics of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Medicine Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, BMT with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Internal Medicine, University Hospital Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Hannover Medical School, Institute of Pathology, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department for Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital, Heinrich-Heine-University, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department for Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital, Heinrich-Heine-University, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Brandenburg Medical School Theodor Fontane, Brandenburg an der Havel, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],"['NO817/5-2/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', '70113953/Deutsche Krebshilfe', 'M83/H.W. & J.

During induction treatment, white blood cell (WBC) count >4x10(9)/l and multiplication rate of WBC <3 days were defined as rapid WBC multiplication. Patients were divided into two groups: With or without rapid WBC multiplication. Comparison between the two groups revealed that the incidence of differentiation syndrome (DS) (48.1% vs. 6.5%; P<0.001), grade 3-4 bleeding (34.8% vs. 6.5%; P=0.022) and peak WBC count (30.4+/-20.0x10(9)/l vs. 8.67+/-5.4x10(9)/l; P<0.001) were significantly higher in the group with rapid WBC multiplication compared with in the group without rapid WBC multiplication. No significant differences were observed in bone marrow depression, infection, complete remission (CR) rate, time to achieve CR and early mortality rate between the two groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that WBC count at chemotherapy initiation was an independent risk factor for the occurrence of DS (P=0.040). Peak WBC count and rapid WBC multiplication were significantly associated with grade 3-4 bleeding (P=0.019 and P=0.002, respectively). Hence, WBC count at chemotherapy initiation along with its multiplication rate may direct the timing of cytoreduction chemotherapy during induction treatment in newly diagnosed APL with low-intermediate risk.","['Wen, Jingjing', 'Xu, Fang', 'Zhou, Qiaolin', 'Hu, Hong', 'Liu, Yiping', 'Su, Jing', 'Zhang, Ya', 'Qu, Wen', 'Shi, Lin']","['Wen J', 'Xu F', 'Zhou Q', 'Hu H', 'Liu Y', 'Su J', 'Zhang Y', 'Qu W', 'Shi L']",,"['Department of Hematology, Mianyang Central Hospital, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Mianyang, Sichuan 621000, P.R.

In addition to sequence variants, gene-level copy number variations (CNVs) were investigated as well. We identified 197 somatic sequence variants and 223 somatic CNVs. The IKZF1 alteration was found to have an adverse effect on overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) in childhood ALL. We found recurrent somatic alterations in Korean ALL patients similar to previous studies on both prevalence and prognostic impact. Six patients were found to be carriers of variants in six genes associated with primary immunodeficiency disorder (PID).

In stem cell research, it has been shown pluripotency can be induced starting with a fibroblast population. In so doing major changes in expressed proteins is inevitable. Here we have created a reference library to underpin such studies. This is inclusive of an extensively documented script to enable replication of library generation from the raw data.

However, a substantial proportion of patients experience primary or secondary disease resistance to TKI. There are multifactorial causes contributing to the treatment failure of which BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutation being the most common. Here, we describe a case of a CML patient with H396P mutation following treatment with nilotinib. CASE: A 60-year-old woman presented with abdominal discomfort and hyperleukocytosis. She was diagnosed as CML in the chronic phase with positive BCR-ABL1 transcripts. Due to the failure to obtain an optimal response with imatinib treatment, it was switched to nilotinib. She responded well to nilotinib initially and achieved complete haematological and cytogenetic responses, with undetectable BCR-ABL1 transcripts. However, in 4 years she developed molecular relapse. Mutation analysis which was done 70 months after commencement of nilotinib showed the presence of BCRABL1 kinase domain mutation with nucleotide substitution at position 1187 from Histidine(H) to Proline(P) (H396P). Currently, she is on nilotinib 400mg twice daily. Her latest molecular analysis showed the presence of residual BCR-ABL1 transcripts at 0.22%. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the importance of BCR-ABL1 mutation analysis in CML patients with persistent BCR-ABL1 positivity in spite of treatment.

Constitutive activation of Hedgehog pathway can be found in various types of malignancies including medulloblastoma, basal cell carcinoma, gastrointestinal, breast, pancreatic, prostate cancer and leukaemia. Little is known about the expression and role of Hedgehog signalling in bladder cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The purpose of this study was to investigate the immunohistochemical expression of SMO in 112 bladder cancer cases and determine their association with demographic and clinicopathological parameters. Bladder cancer tissues were obtained from the Hospital Kuala Lumpur. RESULTS: SMO was expressed in the cytoplasm of all cases of bladder cancer. 6 cases (5.4%) showed low expression, while 106 cases (94.6%) showed high expression. Positive expression of SMO protein was correlated with a few variables which include grade and stage of tumour, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis. SMO expression showed statistically significant association with higher grade (p=0.001) and higher stage (p=0.042) of bladder cancer. SMO expression also showed borderline association with lymph node metastasis (p=0.056). CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that SMO expression may be a poor prognostic marker in bladder cancer.","['Mohd Ariffin, K', 'Abd Ghani, F', 'Hussin, H', 'Md Said, S', 'Yunus, R', 'Veerakumarasivam, A', 'Abdullah, M A']","['Mohd Ariffin K', 'Abd Ghani F', 'Hussin H', 'Md Said S', 'Yunus R', 'Veerakumarasivam A', 'Abdullah MA']",,"['Universiti Putra Malaysia, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Pathology, 43400 UPM Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Universiti Putra Malaysia, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Pathology, 43400 UPM Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia. maizaton@upm.edu.my.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Malaysia,Malays J Pathol,The Malaysian journal of pathology,8101177,,,,2021/04/28 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2021/04/27 06:20'],"['2021/04/27 06:20 [entrez]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Malays J Pathol. 2021 Apr;43(1):49-54.,,,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic receptors that redirect T-cell specificity against cancer. CARs include ""built-in"" signaling domains that reprogram T-cell metabolism, enhance effector function, and support long-term persistence. Despite their success in blood-based malignancies, relapse can occur in CD19-redirected CAR T-cell therapies for several reasons, including poor engraftment, impaired in vivo proliferation, and T-cell senescence. Herein, we explain how subtle alterations in CAR design may overcome barriers to effective adoptive immunotherapy. We also discuss how the physiochemical properties of the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) affect differentiation and persistence. Moreover, we describe innovative advances in CAR engineering and provide insight into the development of humanized scFvs whose proposed benefits include increased persistence and improved clinical outcomes. Tumor cells can evade CAR T-cell-mediated detection and elimination due to the emergence or presence of CD19-negative leukemic cell subpopulations. We also discuss the opportunities and challenges in targeting other B-ALL-associated antigens. Identifying alternate targets is fundamentally necessary to restore the success of CAR T-cell therapies in CD19-negative patients with B-ALL.","['Safarzadeh Kozani, Pouya', 'Safarzadeh Kozani, Pooria', ""O'Connor, Roddy S""]","['Safarzadeh Kozani P', 'Safarzadeh Kozani P', ""O'Connor RS""]","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2602-3871', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9901-7851']","['Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Paramedicine, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Medical Biotechnology Research Center, School of Nursing, Midwifery, and Paramedicine, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. oconnorr@pennmedicine.upenn.edu.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],['R01 CA226983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20210426,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,PMC8285067,,,2021/04/28 06:00,2022/01/11 06:00,['2021/04/27 06:18'],"['2020/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/26 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/27 06:18 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-20-1089 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-20-1089 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2021 Jul;20(7):1223-1233. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-20-1089.

Children with Down syndrome (DS) have an even higher risk of developing leukaemia during the first years of life. The presence of a constitutive trisomy of chromosome 21 (T21) in DS acts as a genetic driver for leukaemia development, however, additional oncogenic mutations are required. Therefore, T21 provides the opportunity to better understand leukaemogenesis in children. Here, we describe the increased risk of leukaemia in DS during childhood from a somatic evolutionary view. According to this idea, cancer is caused by a variation in inheritable phenotypes within cell populations that are subjected to selective forces within the tissue context. We propose a model in which the increased risk of leukaemia in DS children derives from higher rates of mutation accumulation, already present during fetal development, which is further enhanced by changes in selection dynamics within the fetal liver niche. This model could possibly be used to understand the rate-limiting steps of leukaemogenesis early in life.","['Hasaart, K A L', 'Bertrums, E J M', 'Manders, F', 'Goemans, B F', 'van Boxtel, R']","['Hasaart KAL', 'Bertrums EJM', 'Manders F', 'Goemans BF', 'van Boxtel R']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1285-2836'],"['Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Heidelberglaan 25, 3584 CSUtrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Oncode, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Heidelberglaan 25, 3584 CSUtrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Oncode, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Doctor Molewaterplein 40, 3015 GD, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Heidelberglaan 25, 3584 CSUtrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Oncode, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Oncode, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Heidelberglaan 25, 3584 CSUtrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Oncode, Utrecht, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210427,England,Expert Rev Mol Med,Expert reviews in molecular medicine,100939725,PMC8086399,['NOTNLM'],"['*DS-ALL', '*Down syndrome', '*ML-DS', '*TAM', '*paediatric leukaemia', '*somatic evolutionary model']",2021/04/28 06:00,2021/10/26 06:00,['2021/04/27 05:53'],"['2021/04/27 05:53 [entrez]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1017/erm.2021.6 [doi]', 'S1462399421000065 [pii]']",epublish,Expert Rev Mol Med. 2021 Apr 27;23:e5. doi: 10.1017/erm.2021.6.,20211025,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Down Syndrome/complications/epidemiology/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mutation Accumulation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although VEN-containing regimens yield 60-70% clinical response rates, the vast majority of patients inevitably suffer disease relapse, likely because of the persistence of drug-resistant LSCs. We previously reported preclinical activity of the ribonucleoside analog 8-chloro-adenosine (8-Cl-Ado) against AML blast cells and LSCs. Moreover, our ongoing phase I clinical trial of 8-Cl-Ado in patients with refractory/relapsed AML demonstrates encouraging clinical benefit. Of note, LSCs uniquely depend on amino acid-driven and/or fatty acid oxidation (FAO)-driven oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for survival. VEN inhibits OXPHOS in LSCs, which eventually may escape the antileukemic activity of this drug. FAO is activated in LSCs isolated from patients with relapsed AML. METHODS: Using AML cell lines and LSC-enriched blast cells from pre-treatment AML patients, we evaluated the effects of 8-Cl-Ado, VEN and the 8-Cl-Ado/VEN combination on fatty acid metabolism, glycolysis and OXPHOS using liquid scintillation counting, a Seahorse XF Analyzer and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Western blotting was used to validate results from GSEA. HPLC was used to measure intracellular accumulation of 8-Cl-ATP, the cytotoxic metabolite of 8-Cl-Ado. To quantify drug synergy, we created combination index plots using CompuSyn software. The log-rank Kaplan-Meier survival test was used to compare the survival distributions of the different treatment groups in a xenograft mouse model of AML. RESULTS: We here report that VEN and 8-Cl-Ado synergistically inhibited in vitro growth of AML cells. Furthermore, immunodeficient mice engrafted with MV4-11-Luc AML cells and treated with the combination of VEN plus 8-Cl-Ado had a significantly longer survival than mice treated with either drugs alone (p </= 0.006). We show here that 8-Cl-Ado in the LSC-enriched population suppressed FAO by downregulating gene expression of proteins involved in this pathway and significantly inhibited the oxygen consumption rate (OCR), an indicator of OXPHOS. By combining 8-Cl-Ado with VEN, we observed complete inhibition of OCR, suggesting this drug combination cooperates in targeting OXPHOS and the metabolic homeostasis of AML cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together, the results suggest that 8-Cl-Ado enhances the antileukemic activity of VEN and that this combination represents a promising therapeutic regimen for treatment of AML.","['Buettner, Ralf', 'Nguyen, Le Xuan Truong', 'Morales, Corey', 'Chen, Min-Hsuan', 'Wu, Xiwei', 'Chen, Lisa S', 'Hoang, Dinh Hoa', 'Hernandez Vargas, Servando', 'Pullarkat, Vinod', 'Gandhi, Varsha', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Rosen, Steven T']","['Buettner R', 'Nguyen LXT', 'Morales C', 'Chen MH', 'Wu X', 'Chen LS', 'Hoang DH', 'Hernandez Vargas S', 'Pullarkat V', 'Gandhi V', 'Marcucci G', 'Rosen ST']",,"['Hematology Malignancies Research Institute, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope Medical Center, Kaplan CRB, 1026, 1500 East Duarte Road, Duarte, CA, 91010, USA. rbuettner@coh.org.', 'Hematology Malignancies Research Institute, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope Medical Center, Kaplan CRB, 1026, 1500 East Duarte Road, Duarte, CA, 91010, USA. lenguyen@coh.org.', 'Hematology Malignancies Research Institute, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope Medical Center, Kaplan CRB, 1026, 1500 East Duarte Road, Duarte, CA, 91010, USA.', 'Integrative Genomics Core, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Integrative Genomics Core, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Hematology Malignancies Research Institute, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope Medical Center, Kaplan CRB, 1026, 1500 East Duarte Road, Duarte, CA, 91010, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Hematology Malignancies Research Institute, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope Medical Center, Kaplan CRB, 1026, 1500 East Duarte Road, Duarte, CA, 91010, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Hematology Malignancies Research Institute, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope Medical Center, Kaplan CRB, 1026, 1500 East Duarte Road, Duarte, CA, 91010, USA.', 'Hematology Malignancies Research Institute, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope Medical Center, Kaplan CRB, 1026, 1500 East Duarte Road, Duarte, CA, 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA201496/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210426,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,PMC8074444,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Fatty acid oxidation', '*Metabolism', '*Nucleoside analog', '*Oxidative phosphorylation']",2021/04/28 06:00,2021/09/16 06:00,['2021/04/27 05:48'],"['2021/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/27 05:48 [entrez]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-021-01076-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-021-01076-4 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2021 Apr 26;14(1):70. doi: 10.1186/s13045-021-01076-4.,20210915,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)', 'PA05MFH3I7 (8-chloroadenosine)']",IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prognosis for CLL hinges, in part, on the presence or absence of less-favorable genetic aberrations, including del(17p), del(11q), TP53 dysfunction, and IGHV mutations, as these markers are associated with worse treatment response. Promising results from multiple clinical trials show emerging therapies targeting Burton tyrosine kinase, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit delta result in better outcomes and prolonged progression-free survival for patients both with and without certain high-risk aberrations. Favorable outcomes using these novel oral targeted therapies, either alone or in combination with other treatments such as anti-CD20 antibodies, has led to their use almost entirely supplanting chemoimmunotherapy in the treatment of CLL. In this narrative review, we summarize the current clinical evidence for the use of targeted mono- and combination therapies for CLL, discuss new and next-generation treatment approaches currently in development, and provide insight into areas of unmet need for the treatment of patients with CLL.","['Patel, Krish', 'Pagel, John M']","['Patel K', 'Pagel JM']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2446-098X'],"['Center for Blood Disorders and Stem Cell Transplantation, Swedish Cancer Institute, 1221 Madison St, Seattle, WA, 98104, USA. krish.patel@swedish.org.', 'Center for Blood Disorders and Stem Cell Transplantation, Swedish Cancer Institute, 1221 Madison St, Seattle, WA, 98104, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20210426,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,PMC8074228,['NOTNLM'],"['*BTK inhibitors', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*Emerging treatment', '*Treatment strategy']",2021/04/28 06:00,2021/09/16 06:00,['2021/04/27 05:47'],"['2020/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/27 05:47 [entrez]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-021-01054-w [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-021-01054-w [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2021 Apr 26;14(1):69. doi: 10.1186/s13045-021-01054-w.,20210915,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many researchers have proposed circulating microRNAs as biomarkers for the diagnosis of leukemia. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of circulating miRNAs in the diagnosis of leukemia. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search (updated to October 13, 2020) in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Wanfang database and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) was performed to identify eligible studies. The sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) for diagnosing leukemia were pooled for both overall and subgroup analysis. The meta-regression and subgroup analysis were performed to explore heterogeneity and Deeks' funnel plot was used to assess publication bias. RESULTS: 49 studies from 22 publications with a total of 3,489 leukemia patients and 2,756 healthy controls were included in this meta-analysis. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratio and area under the curve were 0.83, 0.92, 10.8, 0.18, 59 and 0.94, respectively.

Methods: The clinical profiles of four APL patients complicated with thrombosis treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University between January 2012 and December 2019 were reviewed. Literature search and review covered the China national knowledge infrastructure, Wanfang database, China biology medicine disc and PubMed using the key words of ""acute promyelocytic leukemia"" and ""thrombosis"" up to June 2020. Results: Four patients included one male and three females with an age range of 4-13 years. In two patients, thrombosis occurred intracranially, both patients presented with seizure and hemiplegia. In one patient, thrombosis occurred in spleen, the patient presented with severe abdominal pain. In the last patient, thrombosis occurred in liver, the patient presented with abdominal pain, distension and ascites. Thrombosis occurred during the course of retinoic acid treatment in three patients, it occurred before the initiation of the treatment in one patient. Thrombosis was confirmed by imaging examination in all four patients. After thrombolytic and anticoagulation treatment, the vessels were recanalized and the symptoms were alleviated in 3 cases, the fourth patient died of hepatic venous thrombosis. Literature search identified no similar reports in Chinese journals, 11 case reports were found in English journals. In these 15 patients, 9 were male and 6 females with an age range of 3-16 years. Thrombus located in brain in 6 cases, in lower limbs for 3 cases, in liver for 3 cases, in spleen in 2 cases and in coronary artery for 1 case. In 10 cases thrombosis occurred before the induce treatment and in 5 cases occurred during the induction treatment. After surgery, thrombolytic and anticoagulation treatment vascular recanalization was observed in 10 patients, and in those patients, the symptoms were relieved, death occurred in 5 patients, including three patients with hepatic venous thrombosis. Conclusions: Thrombosis may occur before or during the treatment for APL. Both arterial and venous thrombosis may occur in patients with APL. Imaging examination is a reliable method for its diagnosis. After treatment, most patients had good prognosis with recanalization of blood vessels, but the mortality rate was high for patients with hepatic venous thrombosis.","['Yao, Q H', 'Wang, Y C', 'Wang, D', 'Liu, Y F']","['Yao QH', 'Wang YC', 'Wang D', 'Liu YF']",,"[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.""]",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,,,,2021/04/27 06:00,2021/04/29 06:00,['2021/04/26 23:14'],"['2021/04/26 23:14 [entrez]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.cn112140-20201104-01004 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2021 May 2;59(5):407-411. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112140-20201104-01004.,20210428,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', '*Thrombosis/drug therapy/etiology', 'Tretinoin', '*Venous Thrombosis/drug therapy/etiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The m(6)A methyltransferase METTL3 has been linked to the initiation and maintenance of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), but the potential of therapeutic applications targeting this enzyme remains unknown(5-7). Here we present the identification and characterization of STM2457, a highly potent and selective first-in-class catalytic inhibitor of METTL3, and a crystal structure of STM2457 in complex with METTL3-METTL14. Treatment of tumours with STM2457 leads to reduced AML growth and an increase in differentiation and apoptosis. These cellular effects are accompanied by selective reduction of m(6)A levels on known leukaemogenic mRNAs and a decrease in their expression consistent with a translational defect. We demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of METTL3 in vivo leads to impaired engraftment and prolonged survival in various mouse models of AML, specifically targeting key stem cell subpopulations of AML. Collectively, these results reveal the inhibition of METTL3 as a potential therapeutic strategy against AML, and provide proof of concept that the targeting of RNA-modifying enzymes represents a promising avenue for anticancer therapy.","['Yankova, Eliza', 'Blackaby, Wesley', 'Albertella, Mark', 'Rak, Justyna', 'De Braekeleer, Etienne', 'Tsagkogeorga, Georgia', 'Pilka, Ewa S', 'Aspris,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 73 children with diagnosed pediatric AML (based on standard morphologic, cytochemical, cytogenetic, immunologic, and molecular workup, and the French-American British classification) admitted to Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt (CCHE-57357), and 9 healthy age-matched and sex-matched controls were recruited for a case-control study. Gene expression levels of miRNA-29a and miRNA-100 were assessed using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: When diagnosed, patients had a significantly higher expression of miRNA-100 as against controls (median [range]: 12.99 [0.92-851.38] vs. 0.26 [0.03-2.67], P<0.001), with a significantly lower expression of miRNA-29a (2.08 [0.02-19.72] vs. 24.95 [15.48-42.54], P<0.001). Likewise, high-risk patients according to cytogenetic stratification had significantly higher miRNA-100 expression and lower miRNA-29a expression. Both miRNA-100 and miRNA-29a performed well as diagnostic markers of pediatric AML with an area under the curve of 0.977 (95% confidence interval [95% CI: 0.943-1.0]) and 0.994 (0.982-1.0) for miRNA-100 and miRNA-29a, respectively. Both miRNA-29a (odds ratio [95% CI]: 0.160 [0.054-0.474], P=0.001) and miRNA-100 (odds ratio [95% CI]: 1.997 [1.994-2.001], P=0.047) were identified as significant predictors of treatment response. CONCLUSION: The miRNA-29a and miRNA-100 expression may serve as diagnostic and prognostic markers in pediatric AML.","['Said, Fadwa', 'Tantawy, Marwa', 'Sayed, Ahmed', 'Ahmed, Sonia']","['Said F', 'Tantawy M', 'Sayed A', 'Ahmed S']",,"[""Departmens of Clinical Pathology Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University Hematology Laboratory Research Department Genomics Program Pediatric Oncology Department, Children's Cancer Hospital (CCHE-57357) Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210426,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,,,2021/04/27 06:00,2021/04/27 06:00,['2021/04/26 20:30'],"['2021/04/26 20:30 [entrez]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0000000000002168 [doi]', '00043426-900000000-96905 [pii]']",aheadofprint,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2021 Apr 26. pii: 00043426-900000000-96905. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000002168.,,,IM,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Cladribine is found to selectively deplete adaptive immune cell types, and its role on innate immune cells is largely unknown. Among the lymphocyte populations and subtypes, the magnitude and kinetics of depletion by cladribine vary substantially. The current consensus on the selective cytotoxic effect of cladribine is that it is dependent on the deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) to 5'nucleotidase (5-NT) ratio of the immune cell type. Nonetheless, there are some discrepancies that cannot be fully elucidated by the DCK:5-NT ratio paradigm.

N-NOSE (Nematode-NOSE) is a simple, inexpensive, and highly sensitive cancer screening method based on the chemotaxis of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which shows evasive action from the urine of healthy individuals while being attracted to the urine of cancer patients. Initially, N-NOSE relied on chemotaxis indexes obtained with 10-fold dilutions of urine samples. However, cancer tissue size and concentrations of cancer odors differ among cancer patients. In this study, we examined the accuracy improvement of N-NOSE method by using two types of dilutions, 10-fold and 100-fold. We have conducted N-NOSE tests with urine samples from 32 cancer patients (esophageal, gastric, colorectal, gallbladder, cholangiocarcinoma, breast, malignant lymphoma, and acute myeloid leukemia) along with 143 healthy subjects. Our data showed a significant difference in the N-NOSE at 10-fold dilution between the two groups (p < 0.0001), with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9188 based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. N-NOSE index at 100-fold dilutions was also significantly different between the two groups (p < 0.0001), with an AUC of 0.9032 based on ROC analysis. In this clinical study, we further improve N-NOSE with a combined method of two dilutions (10-fold and 100-fold) of urine samples, which results in a markedly improvement in cancer detection sensitivity of 87.5%. N-NOSE sensitivity improvement was significantly high even for early-stage cancer detection, which is in stark contrast with the sensitivity of detection using blood tumor markers (CEA, CA19-9 and CA15-3). These results strongly suggest that the N-NOSE test by this new combined method strikes a good balance between sensitivity and specificity.","['Inaba, Satoshi', 'Shimozono, Naoki', 'Yabuki, Hidehiko', 'Enomoto, Motoki', 'Morishita, Masayo', 'Hirotsu, Takaaki', 'di Luccio, Eric']","['Inaba S', 'Shimozono N', 'Yabuki H', 'Enomoto M', 'Morishita M', 'Hirotsu T', 'di Luccio E']",,"['Engaru Kosei General Hospital, Chome-1-5 Odorikita, Engaru, Mombetsu District, Hokkaido 099-0404, Japan.', 'Hirotsu Bio Science Inc., New Otani Garden Court 22F, 4-1 Kioi-cho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 102-0094, Japan.', 'Engaru Kosei General Hospital, Chome-1-5 Odorikita, Engaru, Mombetsu District, Hokkaido 099-0404, Japan.', 'Engaru Kosei General Hospital, Chome-1-5 Odorikita, Engaru, Mombetsu District, Hokkaido 099-0404, Japan.', 'Hirotsu Bio Science Inc., New Otani Garden Court 22F, 4-1 Kioi-cho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 102-0094, Japan.', 'Hirotsu Bio Science Inc., New Otani Garden Court 22F, 4-1 Kioi-cho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 102-0094, Japan.', 'Hirotsu Bio Science Inc., New Otani Garden Court 22F, 4-1 Kioi-cho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 102-0094, Japan.

Fruit.,104797,S0045-2068(21)00174-7 [pii] 10.1016/j.bioorg.2021.104797 [doi],"Prenylated or geranylated flavonoids have been studied for their promising antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities. Twelve natural geranylated flavonoids (1-12) were isolated from the fruit of Paulownia tomentosa Steud. Their structures were elucidated using UV and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. The absolute configurations were determined using NMR and circular dichroism. Seven of the compounds were characterized as new geranylated derivatives isolated from a natural source for the first time, namely 3'-O-methyl-5'-hydroxyisodiplacone (3), paulodiplacone A (5), tomentone II (6), tomentone B (7), tomentodiplacone P (8), paulodiplacone B (9), and tomentoflavone A (12). After 24 h of incubation at concentrations in the range 1-30 muM, the isolated compounds were tested for their antiproliferative and cytotoxic potentials against the human monocytic leukaemia cell line THP-1, using WST-1 and LDH assays, respectively. Almost all of the test compounds induced a concentration-dependent reduction in the metabolic activity of THP-1 cells and a concentration-dependent reduction in the cell viability. Diplacone (1) was the most potent antiproliferative and cytotoxic agent (IC50 9.31 +/- 0.72 muM, LC50 18.01 +/- 1.19 microM). 3'-O-Methyl-5'-hydroxydiplacone (2) showed relatively strong antiproliferative effect (IC50 12.61 +/- 0.90 muM) and weaker cytotoxic activity (LC50 > 30 muM), indicating that it may serve as a potential lead compound for further testing. The structure-activity relationship for the 12 isolated compounds is discussed.","['Molcanova, Lenka', 'Kauerova, Tereza', ""Dall'Acqua, Stefano"", 'Marsik, Petr', 'Kollar, Peter', 'Smejkal, Karel']","['Molcanova L', 'Kauerova T', ""Dall'Acqua S"", 'Marsik P', 'Kollar P', 'Smejkal K']",,"['Department of Natural Drugs, Faculty of Pharmacy, Masaryk University, Palackeho tr. 1946/1, 61200 Brno, Czech Republic.

In the allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) setting, clonal hematopoiesis (CH) mutations present in donor stem cells can be transferred to recipients at the time of HCT. Given that the consequences of donor-derived CH in HCT recipients are not entirely clear, we sought to investigate clinical outcomes in patients with engrafted donor-derived CH using a matched cohort analysis of both related and unrelated donors. Of 209 patients with next-generation sequencing performed before and after HCT, donor-derived CH mutations were detected in 15 (5.2%). DNMT3A was the most commonly mutated gene (9 of 15; 60%); mutations in SF3B1, CSF3R, STAT3, CBLB, TET2, and ASXL1 were also identified. Donor-derived CH was not associated with delayed neutrophil or platelet engraftment, and there was no impact on conversion to full donor chimerism. No patients with donor-derived CH experienced relapse, in contrast to 15.6% (7 of 45) in the matched control cohort without CH (P = .176). Donor-derived CH was not associated with worse overall survival; however, patients with donor-derived CH were more likely to develop chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) necessitating systemic immunosuppressive therapy (IST) (P = .045) and less likely to discontinue IST (P = .03) compared with controls without donor-derived CH. We conclude that donor-derived CH does not have an adverse impact on relapse, survival, or engraftment outcomes but may potentiate a graft-versus-leukemia effect, as reflected by increased chronic GVHD necessitating IST.","['Newell, Laura F', 'Williams, Todd', 'Liu, James', 'Yu, Yun', 'Chen, Yiyi', 'Booth, Georgeann C', 'Knight, Rebekah J', 'Goslee, Kelli R', 'Cook, Rachel J', 'Leonard, Jessica', 'Meyers, Gabrielle', 'Traer, Elie', 'Press, Richard D', 'Fan, Guang', 'Wang, Ying', 'Raess, Philipp W', 'Maziarz, Richard T', 'Dunlap, Jennifer']","['Newell LF', 'Williams T', 'Liu J', 'Yu Y', 'Chen Y', 'Booth GC', 'Knight RJ', 'Goslee KR', 'Cook RJ', 'Leonard J', 'Meyers G', 'Traer E', 'Press RD', 'Fan G', 'Wang Y', 'Raess PW', 'Maziarz RT', 'Dunlap J']",,"['Knight Cancer Institute, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Department of Pathology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Department of Pathology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Biostatistics Shared Resources, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Biostatistics Shared Resources, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Hospital and Clinics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon; Department of Pathology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Department of Pathology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Department of Pathology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Department of Pathology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Department of Pathology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.

Here, we investigated the effect of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT) on adult B-ALL with CDKN2 deletion. The patients with adult B-ALL underwent more than two courses of chemotherapy were enrolled in the multicenter retrospective study. Relapse and survival were analyzed. A total of 1336 adult B-ALL, including 295 patients with CDKN2 deletion and 1041 wild-type (WT), from five institutes were enrolled. The complete remission (CR) rates were 86.8% and 91.1% (P = 0.229) after two cycles of chemotherapy in patients with CDKN2 deletion and WT, respectively. The 5-year cumulative relapse post-CR were 56% (95% CI, 52-68) and 43% (95% CI, 40-51) (P < 0.001), 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) were 30% (95% CI, 24-36) and 41% (95% CI, 39-46) (P < 0.001), and 5-year overall survival (OS) were 35% (95% CI, 28-39) and 47% (95% CI, 44-49) (P < 0.001) in the two groups, respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed that the 5-year relapse were 89.3% (95% CI, 83.0-96.5) and 68.4% (95% CI, 60.2-72.5) (P < 0.001), 5-year DFS were 4.9% (95% CI, 1.8-10.4) and 22.7% (95% CI, 18.0-27.7) (P < 0.001), and 5-year OS were 6.9% (95% CI, 3.1-12.9) and 23.4% (95% CI, 18.7-28.6) (P < 0.001) in CDKN2 deletion and WT groups undergoing chemotherapy alone, respectively, while there were not different in terms of 5-year relapse (38.1% vs 34.3%, P = 0.211), DFS (48.4% vs 52.2%, P = 0.325) and OS (54.5% vs 56.3%, P = 0.483) between those with CDKN2 deletion and WT undergoing allo-HCT. Multivariate analysis showed that CDKN2 deletion and high-risk stratification both were the risk factors for relapse, DFS and OS, while allo-HCT was a protective factor. CDKN2 deletion might be a poor prognostic predictor of adult B-ALL. Adult B-ALL with CDKN2 deletion might benefit from allo-HCT.","['Ling, Yiwen', 'Xu, Na', 'Zhao, Ke', 'Han, Lijie', 'Zhang, Qing', 'Fan, Zhiping', 'Huang, Fen', 'Chen, Zhuowen', 'Xuan, Li', 'Liu, Hui', 'Xu, Jun', 'Chen, Xiaoxia', 'Yu, Sijian', 'Zhou, Hongsheng', 'Sun, Jing', 'Liu, Qifa']","['Ling Y', 'Xu N', 'Zhao K', 'Han L', 'Zhang Q', 'Fan Z', 'Huang F', 'Chen Z', 'Xuan L', 'Liu H', 'Xu J', 'Chen X', 'Yu S', 'Zhou H', 'Sun J', 'Liu Q']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China; Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Foshan, Foshan, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Henan Cancer Hospital, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Foshan, Foshan, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanhai Hospital, Southern Medical University, Foshan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.

We evaluated two new lower-intensity regimens with clofarabine (n = 119) or cladribine (n = 129) combined with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) alternating with decitabine. We reviewed response rates by subgroup and long term outcomes of 248 patients with newly diagnosed non core-binding-factor AML treated on two clinical trials investigating double nucleoside-analogue therapy (DNT) alternating with HMA from October, 2008 to April, 2018. Of 248 patients with a median age of 69 years (range, 49-85 years), 102 patients (41%) were >/= 70 years, and 108 (44%) had adverse karyotype. Overall, 164 patients (66%) responded: 147 (59%) complete remission (CR) and 17 (7%) CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi). With a median follow up of 60 months, median relapse-free and overall survival (OS) were 10.8 and 12.5 months, respectively. The 2-year OS was 29%. Among patients with normal karyotype, the CR/CRi rate was 79% and the median OS 19.9 months. High response rates and OS were observed in patients with mutations in NPM1, FLT3, IDH2, and RUNX1. The 4- and 8-week mortality rates were 2% and 11%, respectively.

Previous studies have primarily focused on the retinoic acid signaling pathway and how it is interfered with by promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor-alpha (PML/RARalpha) fusion protein. However, this hardly explains how APL cells are blocked at the promyelocytic stage. Here, we demonstrated that C/EBPalpha bound and transactivated the promoter of long non-coding RNA NEAT1, an essential element for terminal differentiation of APL cells, through C/EBP binding sites. More importantly, PML/RARalpha repressed C/EBPalpha-mediated transactivation of NEAT1 through binding to NEAT1 promoter. Consistently, mutation of the C/EBP sites or deletion of retinoic acid responsive elements (RAREs) and RARE half motifs abrogated the PML/RARalpha-mediated repression. Moreover, silencing of C/EBPalpha attenuated ATRA-induced NEAT1 upregulation and APL cell differentiation. Finally, simultaneous knockdown of C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta reduces ATRA-induced upregulation of C/EBPepsilon and dramatically impaired NEAT1 activation and APL cell differentiation. In sum, C/EBPalpha binds and transactivates NEAT1 whereas PML/RARalpha represses this process. This study describes an essential role for C/EBPalpha in PML/RARalpha-mediated repression of NEAT1 and suggests that PML/RARalpha could contribute to the pathogenesis of APL through suppressing C/EBPalpha targets.","['Tang, Doudou', 'Hu, Piao', 'Zhu, Dengqin', 'Luo, Yujiao', 'Chen, Mingjie', 'Zhang, Guangsen', 'Wang, Yewei']","['Tang D', 'Hu P', 'Zhu D', 'Luo Y', 'Chen M', 'Zhang G', 'Wang Y']",,"['Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Hunan Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Hematology, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Hematology, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Hematology, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Cloud-Seq Bio-Tech Inc., Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Hematology, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Hematology, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210426,United States,Aging (Albany NY),Aging,101508617,PMC8148485,['NOTNLM'],"['*APL', '*C/EBPalpha', '*NEAT1', '*PML/RARalpha', '*transcriptional regulation']",2021/04/27 06:00,2021/07/24 06:00,['2021/04/26 17:17'],"['2020/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/26 17:17 [entrez]']","['203000 [pii]', '10.18632/aging.203000 [doi]']",ppublish,Aging (Albany NY). 2021 Apr 26;13(9):13179-13194. doi: 10.18632/aging.203000.

The members of the sirtuin family of NAD(+)-dependent enzymes play an anti-senescence role and their activation suggests a promising approach for preventing UV-induced senescence in the treatment of skin aging. A two-step screening designed to identify compounds able to protect cells from UV-induced senescence through sirtuin activation identified shikimic acid (SA), a metabolic intermediate in many organisms, as a bona-fide candidate. The protective effects of SA against senescence were dependent on specific activation of SIRT1 as the effect was abrogated by the SIRT1 inhibitor EX-527. Upon UV irradiation SA induced S-phase accumulation and a decrease in p16(INK4A) expression but did not protect against DNA damage or increased polyploidies. In contrast, SA reverted misfolded protein accumulation upon senescence, an effect that was abrogated by EX-527. Consistently, SA induced an increase in the levels of the chaperone BiP, resulting in a downregulation of unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling and UPR-dependent autophagy, avoiding their abnormal hyperactivation during senescence. SA did not directly activate SIRT1 in vitro, suggesting that SIRT1 is a downstream effector of SA signaling specifically in the response to cellular senescence. Our study not only uncovers a shikimic acid/SIRT1 signaling pathway that prevents cellular senescence, but also reinforces the role of sirtuins as key regulators of cell proteostasis.","['Martinez-Gutierrez, Alfredo', 'Fernandez-Duran, Irene', 'Marazuela-Duque, Anna', 'Simonet, Nicolas G', 'Yousef, Ibraheem', 'Martinez-Rovira, Immaculada', 'Martinez-Hoyos, Josefina', 'Vaquero, Alejandro']","['Martinez-Gutierrez A', 'Fernandez-Duran I', 'Marazuela-Duque A', 'Simonet NG', 'Yousef I', 'Martinez-Rovira I', 'Martinez-Hoyos J', 'Vaquero A']",,"['Chromatin Biology Laboratory, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Barcelona 08916, Badalona, Spain.', 'Chromatin Biology Laboratory, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Barcelona 08908, Spain.', 'Mesostetic Pharma Group, Barcelona 08840, Viladecans, Spain.', 'Chromatin Biology Laboratory, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Barcelona 08916, Badalona, Spain.', 'Chromatin Biology Laboratory, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Barcelona 08916, Badalona, Spain.', 'Chromatin Biology Laboratory, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Barcelona 08908, Spain.', 'Chromatin Biology Laboratory, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Barcelona 08916, Badalona, Spain.', 'Chromatin Biology Laboratory, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Barcelona 08908, Spain.', 'MIRAS Beamline, ALBA-CELLS Synchrotron, Barcelona 08290, Cerdanyola del Valles, Spain.', 'MIRAS Beamline, ALBA-CELLS Synchrotron, Barcelona 08290, Cerdanyola del Valles, Spain.', 'Ionizing Radiation Research Group, Physics Department, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona (UAB), Barcelona 08193, Cerdanyola del Valles, Spain.', 'Mesostetic Pharma Group, Barcelona 08840, Viladecans, Spain.', 'Chromatin Biology Laboratory, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Barcelona 08916, Badalona, Spain.', 'Chromatin Biology Laboratory, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Barcelona 08908, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210426,United States,Aging (Albany NY),Aging,101508617,PMC8148468,['NOTNLM'],"['*SIRT1', '*UV irradiation', '*human dermal fibroblasts', '*senescence', '*shikimic acid']",2021/04/27 06:00,2021/07/27 06:00,['2021/04/26 17:17'],"['2020/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/26 17:17 [entrez]']","['203010 [pii]', '10.18632/aging.203010 [doi]']",ppublish,Aging (Albany NY). 2021 Apr 26;13(9):12308-12333. doi: 10.18632/aging.203010.

We present a case of lumbar epidural T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma which appeared with clinical features of epidural spinal cord compression. METHODS: A 38-year-old male patient presented with weakness in the lower extremities and newly developed urinary incontinence. His medical history included precursor T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and treatment with allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation 5 years previously. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an epidural mass lesion at L2-L4 levels and there was no sign of leukemia or lymphoma in clinical, laboratory, and radiological examinations. Surgery was planned for obtaining diagnostic material. Decompressive laminectomy and subtotal excision of the tumor were performed. RESULTS: At surgery, the tumor consisted of yellow-colored and hypovascular soft tissue fragments. It was encircling the spinal cord and spreading through the left L3 foramen. The patient underwent adjuvant chemoradiotherapy after the histopathological evaluation. At 2-month follow-up, the patient was able to walk without assistance, but the urinary incontinence was the same. At 5-month follow-up, the disease progressed, and the patient passed away because of infective endocarditis. CONCLUSION: Spinal lymphomas may display its characteristic ""wrap-around"" fashion in the MRI. In this report, we shared the microsurgical appearance of this fashion. As the lymphomas are chemoradiosensitive tumors, the treatment should be managed with a multidisciplinary approach.","['Erdem, Munibe Busra', 'Kale, Aydemir', 'Yaman, Mesut Emre', 'Emmez, Hakan']","['Erdem MB', 'Kale A', 'Yaman ME', 'Emmez H']",,"['Department of Neurosurgery, Gazi University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Gazi University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Gazi University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Gazi University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210118,Netherlands,Int J Spine Surg,International journal of spine surgery,101579005,PMC7888206,['NOTNLM'],"['epidural space', 'precursor T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia-lymphoma', 'recurrence', 'spinal cord compression', 'tumor']",2021/04/27 06:00,2021/04/27 06:01,['2021/04/26 17:16'],"['2021/04/26 17:16 [entrez]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:01 [medline]']","['7165 [pii]', '10.14444/7165 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Spine Surg. 2021 Feb;14(s4):S52-S56. doi: 10.14444/7165.

Despite the increase in the success of therapies, disease-free survival is over 80% in most cases. For the remaining 20% of patients, new strategies are needed to allow us to know and select those at greatest risk of relapse. We evaluated by immunohistochemistry the expression of the transcription factor YY1 and found that it is overexpressed in peripheral blood leukemia cells of pediatric patients with ALL with Pro-B and T phenotype compared to control samples. Over expression of YY1 was associated with a significantly lower chance of survival. We also evaluated by RT-PCR in bone marrow samples from ALL pediatric patients the association of YY1 expression with the percentage of blasts. High levels of YY1 were present in samples with higher percent of blasts in these patients. In addition, ALL pediatric patients with a poor response to therapy had higher levels at the nuclear level of YY1 than those who responded well to chemotherapy. In conclusion, our data suggest that YY1 could serve in pediatric ALL as markers of evolution and response for this disease, mainly in patients with pro-B and T immunophenotype. It is also suggested that YY1 is implicated in the expanse of blast in these patients.","['Antonio-Andres, Gabriela', 'Jimenez-Hernandez, Elva', 'Estrada-Abreo, Laura A', 'Garfias-Gomez, Yanelly', 'Patino-Lopez, Genaro', 'Juarez-Mendez, Sergio', 'Huerta-Yepez, Sara']","['Antonio-Andres G', 'Jimenez-Hernandez E', 'Estrada-Abreo LA', 'Garfias-Gomez Y', 'Patino-Lopez G', 'Juarez-Mendez S', 'Huerta-Yepez S']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5633-6249'],"[""Oncology Disease Research Unit, Children's Hospital of Mexico, Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico."", ""Hemato-Oncology Service, Moctezuma Children's Hospital, Mexico City, Mexico."", 'Immunology and Proteomics Laboratory, Hospital Infantil de Mexico, Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Immunology and Proteomics Laboratory, Hospital Infantil de Mexico, Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Immunology and Proteomics Laboratory, Hospital Infantil de Mexico, Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Oncologia Experimental, Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, S.S.A, Mexico City, Mexico.', ""Oncology Disease Research Unit, Children's Hospital of Mexico, Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210426,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'B cells', 'T cells', 'YY1', 'survival']",2021/04/27 06:00,2021/07/30 06:00,['2021/04/26 17:15'],"['2021/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/26 17:15 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880018.2020.1871139 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2021 Aug;38(5):456-470. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2020.1871139.

Unlike normal B cells, CLL cells do not proliferate in vitro upon engagement of the BCR, suggesting that CLL cell proliferation is regulated by other signals from the microenvironment, such as those provided by Toll-like receptors or T cells. Here, we report that BCR engagement of human and murine CLL cells induces several positive regulators of the cell cycle, but simultaneously induces the negative regulators CDKN1A, CDKN2A, and CDKN2B, which block cell-cycle progression. We further show that introduction of genetic lesions that downregulate these cell-cycle inhibitors, such as inactivating lesions in CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and the CDKN1A regulator TP53, leads to more aggressive disease in a murine in vivo CLL model and spontaneous proliferation in vitro that is BCR dependent but independent of costimulatory signals. Importantly, inactivating lesions in CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and TP53 frequently co-occur in Richter syndrome (RS), and BCR stimulation of human RS cells with such lesions is sufficient to induce proliferation. We also show that tumor cells with combined TP53 and CDKN2A/2B abnormalities remain sensitive to BCR-inhibitor treatment and are synergistically sensitive to the combination of a BCR and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor both in vitro and in vivo. These data provide evidence that BCR signals are directly involved in driving CLL cell proliferation and reveal a novel mechanism of Richter transformation.","['Chakraborty, Supriya', 'Martines, Claudio', 'Porro, Fabiola', 'Fortunati, Ilaria', 'Bonato, Alice', 'Dimishkovska, Marija', 'Piazza, Silvano', 'Yadav, Brijesh S', 'Innocenti, Idanna', 'Fazio, Rosa', 'Vaisitti, Tiziana', 'Deaglio, Silvia', 'Zamo, Alberto', 'Dimovski, Aleksandar J', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Efremov, Dimitar G']","['Chakraborty S', 'Martines C', 'Porro F', 'Fortunati I', 'Bonato A', 'Dimishkovska M', 'Piazza S', 'Yadav BS', 'Innocenti I', 'Fazio R', 'Vaisitti T', 'Deaglio S', 'Zamo A', 'Dimovski AJ', 'Laurenti L', 'Efremov DG']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7136-7174', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6612-3068', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3634-6527', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7156-5434', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3095-3369', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0632-5036', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6203-7966', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8327-1396', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9081-5462']","['Molecular Hematology Unit, International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy.', 'Molecular Hematology Unit, International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy.', 'Molecular Hematology Unit, International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy.', 'Molecular Hematology Unit, International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy.', 'Molecular Hematology Unit, International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy.', 'Research Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Skopje, North Macedonia.', 'Computational Biology Unit, International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy.', 'University of Information Science & Technology St Paul the Apostle, Ohrid, North Macedonia.', 'Department of Hematology, Catholic University Hospital A.

This protocol describes a chemically-induced protein dimerization system to create condensates on telomeres. The chemical dimerizer consists of two linked ligands that can each bind to a protein: Halo ligand to Halo-enzyme and trimethoprim (TMP) to E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR), respectively. Fusion of Halo enzyme to a telomere protein anchors dimerizers to telomeres through covalent Halo ligand-enzyme binding. Binding of TMP to eDHFR recruits eDHFR-fused phase separating proteins to telomeres and induces condensate formation. Because TMP-eDHFR interaction is non-covalent, condensation can be reversed by using excess free TMP to compete with the dimerizer for eDHFR binding. An example of inducing promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear body formation on telomeres and determining condensate growth, dissolution, localization and composition is shown. This method can be easily adapted to induce condensates at other genomic locations by fusing Halo to a protein that directly binds to the local chromatin or to dCas9 that is targeted to the genomic locus with a guide RNA. By offering the temporal resolution required for single cell live imaging while maintaining phase separation in a population of cells for biochemical assays, this method is suitable for probing both the formation and function of chromatin-associated condensates.","['Zhao, Rongwei', 'Chenoweth, David M', 'Zhang, Huaiying']","['Zhao R', 'Chenoweth DM', 'Zhang H']",,"['Department of Biological Sciences, Mellon College of Science, Carnegie Mellon University.', 'Department of Chemistry, School of Arts and Sciences, University of Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Mellon College of Science, Carnegie Mellon University; huaiyinz@andrew.cmu.edu.']",['eng'],['K22 CA237632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",20210412,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,PMC8118565,,,2021/04/27 06:00,2021/06/16 06:00,['2021/04/26 12:18'],"['2021/04/26 12:18 [entrez]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/62173 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2021 Apr 12;(170). doi: 10.3791/62173.,20210614,"['0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', 'AN164J8Y0X (Trimethoprim)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Escherichia coli/*enzymology', 'Escherichia coli Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Multimerization', 'Telomere/*metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Trimethoprim/chemistry/*metabolism']",,,,['NIHMS1691798'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent integrated genomic analyses have highlighted the importance of the JAK-STAT3 pathway in the molecular pathogenesis of DLBCL. However, its relevance to clinical outcomes remains controversial. Therefore, we evaluated the extent of the nuclear expression of phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3), a surrogate marker of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation, by immunohistochemistry. We also analyzed the potential relationship between pSTAT3 positivity (defined as >/=40% positive neoplastic cells) and clinicopathologic characteristics in 294 patients with DLBCL. pSTAT3 was detected in 122 patients (42%), with a higher rate in the non-GCB subtype than in the GCB subtype (57% vs. 28%, P<0.001). Factors potentially activating STAT3, MYD88L265P, and Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNA were identified in the pSTAT3-positive non-GCB subtype, whereas the pSTAT3-positive GCB subtype often showed STAT3 mutations and lacked EZH2 mutations and the rearrangements of BCL2 and MYC. Multivariate analyses revealed that the pSTAT3-positive GCB subtype showed a favorable prognosis (HR: 0.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.7; P=0.014). These findings suggest that pSTAT3 positivity may have a unique impact on the clinicopathologic characteristics of DLBCL, making it a promising novel marker for the favorable prognosis of patients with the GCB subtype.","['Morichika, Kazuho', 'Karube, Kennosuke', 'Sakihama, Shugo', 'Watanabe, Risa', 'Kawaki, Mamoru', 'Nishi, Yukiko', 'Nakachi, Sawako', 'Okamoto, Shiki', 'Takahara, Taishi', 'Satou, Akira', 'Shimada, Satoko', 'Shimada, Kazuyuki', 'Tsuzuki, Toyonori', 'Fukushima, Takuya', 'Morishima, Satoko', 'Masuzaki, Hiroaki']","['Morichika K', 'Karube K', 'Sakihama S', 'Watanabe R', 'Kawaki M', 'Nishi Y', 'Nakachi S', 'Okamoto S', 'Takahara T', 'Satou A', 'Shimada S', 'Shimada K', 'Tsuzuki T', 'Fukushima T', 'Morishima S', 'Masuzaki H']",,"['Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology, Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine).', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Faculty of Medicine.', 'Faculty of Medicine.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology, Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine).', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology, Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine).', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology, Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine).', 'Department of Surgical Pathology, Aichi Medical University Hospital.', 'Department of Surgical Pathology, Aichi Medical University Hospital.', 'Departments of Pathology and Clinical Laboratories.', 'Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Surgical Pathology, Aichi Medical University Hospital.', 'Laboratory of Hematoimmunology, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology, Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine).', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology, Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine).']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,,,,2021/04/27 06:00,2021/08/03 06:00,['2021/04/26 09:05'],"['2021/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/26 09:05 [entrez]']","['10.1097/PAS.0000000000001691 [doi]', '00000478-900000000-97212 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2021 Jun 1;45(6):832-840. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0000000000001691.,20210802,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (MYD88 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Japan', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*chemistry/drug therapy/genetics/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*analysis/genetics', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein/genetics']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T (CD19 CAR-T) cells have shown promising responses in B-ALL. However, their role in chemotherapy-refractory MRD-positive B-ALL remains unclear. Here we aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of CD19 CAR-T cells in MRD-positive B-ALL patients. From January 2018, a total of 14 MRD-positive B-ALL patients received one or more infusions of autogenous CD19 CAR-T cells. Among them, 12 patients achieved MRD-negative remission after one cycle of CAR-T infusion. At a median follow-up time of 647 days (range 172-945 days), the 2-year event-free survival rate in MRD-positive patients was 61.2% +/- 14.0% and the 2-year overall survival was 78.6 +/- 11.0%, which were significantly higher than patients with active disease (blasts >/= 5% or with extramedullary disease). Moreover, patients with MRD had a lower grade of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) than patients with active disease. However, the peak expansion of CAR-T cells in MRD positive patients showed no statistical difference compared to patients with active disease. Five patients received two or more CAR-T cell infusions and these patients showed a decreased peak expansion of CAR-T cell in subsequent infusions. In conclusion, pre-emptive CD19 CAR-T cell treatment is an effective and safe approach and may confer sustained remission in B-ALL patients with chemotherapy-refractory MRD.

In Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), expansion is often complicated by lack of T cell proliferation, as these cells frequently show signs of exhaustion. This report seeks to identify specific biomarkers or measures of cell function that capture the proliferative potential of a starting population of cells. Mixed CD4+/CD8+ T cells from healthy donors and individuals previously treated for CLL were characterized on the basis of proliferative potential and in vitro cellular functions. Single-factor analysis found little correlation between the number of populations doublings reached during expansion and either Rai stage (a clinical measure of CLL spread) or PD-1 expression. However, inclusion of in vitro IL-2 secretion and the propensity of cells to align onto micropatterned features of activating proteins as factors identified three distinct groups of donors. Notably, these group assignments provided an elegant separation of donors with regards to proliferative potential. Furthermore, these groups exhibited different motility characteristics, suggesting a mechanism that underlies changes in proliferative potential. This study describes a new set of functional readouts that augment surface marker panels to better predict expansion outcomes and clinical prognosis.","['Lee, Joanne H', 'Shao, Shuai', 'Kim, Michelle', 'Fernandes, Stacey M', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Kam, Lance C']","['Lee JH', 'Shao S', 'Kim M', 'Fernandes SM', 'Brown JR', 'Kam LC']",,"['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI110593/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 AI118669/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20210409,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,PMC8063612,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia', 'T cell', 'cell migration', 'immunotherapy', 'machine learning']",2021/04/27 06:00,2021/04/27 06:01,['2021/04/26 05:57'],"['2021/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/26 05:57 [entrez]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.648925 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Apr 9;9:648925. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.648925. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Lee, Shao, Kim, Fernandes, Brown and Kam.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although taking place in cardiomyocytes, the hypertrophic response is influenced by other cell types, both within the heart and derived from circulation. In the present study we investigated the myeloid-specific role of megakaryocytic leukemia 1 (MKL1) in cardiac hypertrophy. Following transverse aortic constriction (TAC), myeloid MKL1 conditional knockout (MFCKO) mice exhibit an attenuated phenotype of cardiac hypertrophy compared to the WT mice. In accordance, the MFCKO mice were protected from excessive cardiac inflammation and fibrosis as opposed to the WT mice. Conditioned media collected from macrophages enhanced the pro-hypertrophic response in cardiomyocytes exposed to endothelin in an MKL1-dependent manner. Of interest, expression levels of macrophage derived miR-155, known to promote cardiac hypertrophy, were down-regulated in the MFCKO mice compared to the WT mice. MKL1 depletion or inhibition repressed miR-155 expression in macrophages. Mechanistically, MKL1 interacted with NF-kappaB to activate miR-155 transcription in macrophages. In conclusion, our data suggest that MKL1 may contribute to pathological hypertrophy via regulating macrophage-derived miR-155 transcription.","['Liu, Li', 'Zhao, Qianwen', 'Lin, Lin', 'Yang, Guang', 'Yu, Liming', 'Zhuo, Lili', 'Yang, Yuyu', 'Xu, Yong']","['Liu L', 'Zhao Q', 'Lin L', 'Yang G', 'Yu L', 'Zhuo L', 'Yang Y', 'Xu Y']",,"['Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Molecular and Medical Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Targeted Intervention of Cardiovascular Disease and Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Translational Medicine, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Targeted Intervention of Cardiovascular Disease and Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Translational Medicine, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Molecular and Medical Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Suzhou Municipal Hospital Affiliated with Nanjing Medical University, Suzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Targeted Intervention of Cardiovascular Disease and Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Translational Medicine, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Geriatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Molecular and Medical Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Targeted Intervention of Cardiovascular Disease and Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Translational Medicine, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210409,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,PMC8063155,['NOTNLM'],"['NF-kappaB', 'cardiac hypertrophy', 'macrophage', 'miRNA', 'transcriptional regulation']",2021/04/27 06:00,2021/04/27 06:01,['2021/04/26 05:57'],"['2020/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/26 05:57 [entrez]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.583492 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Apr 9;9:583492. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.583492. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Liu, Zhao, Lin, Yang, Yu, Zhuo, Yang and Xu.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have significantly improved the outcome even though there are still some problems including relapse due to drug-resistant mutations and suboptimal molecular remission depth. Previously, we reported the safety and efficacy of sequential infusion of CD19/22 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) immunotherapy in the treatment of relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell neoplasms including cases with Ph(+) ALL. Given possible deeper reaction, more patients were expected to reach optimal minimal residual disease (MRD) response. An alternative method, duplex droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) with high sensitivity was established, which could provide absolute quantification of MRD without the need for calibration curves. Here, we retrospectively collected 95 bone marrow samples from 10 patients with R/R Ph(+), who received 19/22 CAR-T-cell cocktail therapy. Notably, sequential molecular remission for more than 3 months (SMR3), a significant indicator based on ddPCR after CAR-T infusion was established, which was defined as a sequential molecular remission for not <3 months with negative MRD. In this cohort, no recurrence was observed in six patients achieving SMR3, where four of whom accepted allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) after CAR-T cell regimen. Unfortunately, the other four patients who did not reach SMR3 relapsed, and did not receive extra specific treatment except CAR-T regimen. To sum up, ddPCR may be an alternative, especially when nucleic acid was insufficient in clinical practice. No achievement of SMR3 may be an early warning of potential relapse after CAR-T and indicating the initiation of other therapies including allo-HSCT.","['Guan, Yuqi', 'Zhang, Meilan', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Wang, Jiachen', 'Shen, Kefeng', 'Zhang, Kai', 'Yang, Li', 'Huang, Liang', 'Wang, Na', 'Xiao, Min', 'Zhou, Jianfeng']","['Guan Y', 'Zhang M', 'Zhang W', 'Wang J', 'Shen K', 'Zhang K', 'Yang L', 'Huang L', 'Wang N', 'Xiao M', 'Zhou J']",,"['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'PerfectGen, Zhuhai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210407,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC8059437,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'CAR19/22 T-cell cocktail', 'Philadelphia chromosome positive', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'droplet digital PCR', 'minimal residual disease', 'relapsed/refractory']",2021/04/27 06:00,2021/04/27 06:01,['2021/04/26 05:56'],"['2020/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/26 05:56 [entrez]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.646499 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Apr 7;11:646499. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.646499. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Guan, Zhang, Zhang, Wang, Shen, Zhang, Yang, Huang, Wang, Xiao', 'and Zhou.']",,,,,"['KZ was employed by the company PerfectGen, Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China.

Its fate is determined by abnormal intracellular competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network and extracellular tumor microenvironment (TME). This study aims to build a ceRNA network related to AML TME to explore new prognostic and therapeutic targets. The RNA expression data of AML were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. First, we used the ESTIMATE algorithm to calculate the immune cells and stromal cells infiltration scores in the TME and found that all scores were highly correlated with AML's prognostic characteristics. Subsequently, differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs between high and low score groups were identified to construct a TME-related ceRNA network. Further, the Cox-lasso survival model was employed to screen out the hub prognostic ceRNA network composed of two mRNAs (EPB41L3, COL2A1), three miRNAs (hsa-mir-26a-5p, hsa-mir-148b-3p, hsa-mir-148a-3p), and two lncRNAs (CYP1B1-AS1, C9orf106), and construct nomograms. Finally, we used CIBERSORT algorithm and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to identify the prognostic TME immune cells and found that naive B cells, M2-type macrophages, and helper follicular T cells were related to prognosis, and the hub ceRNAs were highly correlated with immune cell infiltration. This study provided a new perspective to elucidate how TME regulates AML process and put forward the new therapy strategies combining targeting tumor cells with disintegrating TME.","['Cheng, Yaqi', 'Wang, Xiaoran', 'Qi, Peiyan', 'Liu, Chengxiu', 'Wang, Shoubi', 'Wan, Qi', 'Liu, Yurun', 'Su, Yaru', 'Jin, Lin', 'Liu, Ying', 'Li, Chaoyang', 'Sang, Xuan', 'Yang, Liu', 'Liu, Chang', 'Duan, Hucheng', 'Wang, Zhichong']","['Cheng Y', 'Wang X', 'Qi P', 'Liu C', 'Wang S', 'Wan Q', 'Liu Y', 'Su Y', 'Jin L', 'Liu Y', 'Li C', 'Sang X', 'Yang L', 'Liu C', 'Duan H', 'Wang Z']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangzhou International Travel Health Care Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University Medical College, Qingdao, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Department of Ophthalmology, The Second People's Hospital of Foshan, Foshan, China."", 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210409,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC8063692,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'ceRNA network', 'immune microenvironment', 'prognosis', 'tumor microenvironment']",2021/04/27 06:00,2021/04/27 06:01,['2021/04/26 05:56'],"['2020/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/26 05:56 [entrez]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.584884 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Apr 9;11:584884. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.584884. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Cheng, Wang, Qi, Liu, Wang, Wan, Liu, Su, Jin, Liu, Li, Sang,', 'Yang, Liu, Duan and Wang.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, whether one factor conjunctively controls the separated functions of AIF is not clear. Here, it is shown that OTU deubiquitinase 1 (OTUD1) acts as a link between the two functions of AIF via deubiquitination events. Deubiquitination of AIF at K244 disrupts the normal mitochondrial structure and compromises oxidative phosphorylation, and deubiquitination of AIF at K255 enhances its DNA-binding ability to promote parthanatos. Moreover, OTUD1 stabilizes DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 10 (DCAF10) and recruits the cullin 4A (CUL4A)-damage specific DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1) complex to promote myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1) degradation, thereby activating caspase-dependent apoptotic signaling. Collectively, these results reveal the central role of OTUD1 in activating both caspase-independent and caspase-dependent apoptotic signaling and propose decreased OTUD1 expression as a key event promoting chemoresistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","['Luo, Qingyu', 'Wu, Xiaowei', 'Zhao, Pengfei', 'Nan, Yabing', 'Chang, Wan', 'Zhu, Xiaolin', 'Su, Dan', 'Liu, Zhihua']","['Luo Q', 'Wu X', 'Zhao P', 'Nan Y', 'Chang W', 'Zhu X', 'Su D', 'Liu Z']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4164-637X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4176-7198', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4242-033X']","['State Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100021 China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100021 China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100021 China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100021 China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100021 China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100021 China.', 'Department of Pathology Zhejiang Cancer Hospital Zhejiang 310022 China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100021 China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210208,Germany,Adv Sci (Weinh),"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",101664569,PMC8061361,['NOTNLM'],"['*AIF', '*MCL1', '*OTUD1', '*apoptosis', '*chemoresistance', '*deubiquitination', '*oxidative phosphorylation']",2021/04/27 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/04/26 05:55'],"['2020/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/29 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/26 05:55 [entrez]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1002/advs.202002874 [doi]', 'ADVS2400 [pii]']",epublish,Adv Sci (Weinh). 2021 Feb 8;8(8):2002874. doi: 10.1002/advs.202002874. eCollection 2021 Apr.,20211203,"['0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (OTUD1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/*metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport/physiology', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases/genetics/*metabolism']",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

In this study, we investigated the effects of hypoxia-induced exosomal microRNA-181 (miR-181a) from PTC on tumor growth and angiogenesis. Thyroid-cancer-related differentially expressed miR-181a was identified by microarray-based analysis in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We validated that miR-181a was highly expressed in PTC cells and even more so in cells cultured under hypoxic conditions, which also augmented exosome secretion from PTC cells. Exosomes extracted from PTC cells with manipulated miR-181a and mixed-lineage leukemia 3 (MLL3) were subjected to normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were transfected with miR-181a inhibitor/mimic or small interfering RNA (siRNA)-MLL3 or treated with exosomes from hypoxic PTC cells. Hypoxic exosomal miR-181a delivery promoted proliferation and capillary-like network formation in HUVECs. Mechanistically, miR-181a targeted and inhibited MLL3. Furthermore, miR-181a downregulated DACT2 and upregulated YAP and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Further, hypoxic exosomal miR-181a induced angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo, which was reversed by hypoxic exosomal miR-181a inhibitor.

There are few formal reports of Brevibacterium casei infection and even fewer reports of CRBSI due to this Gram-positive rod. Here we report the first case of CRBSI due to B. casei in an 8-year-old girl with acute myeloid leukemia in Japan. The isolate exhibited decreased susceptibility to ss-lactam antibiotics. Antimicrobial therapy with meropenem and vancomycin, in addition to the removal of central venous catheter line, consequently led to a significant clinical improvement of the patient's symptoms. A literature review found available clinical courses in 16 cases (4 pediatric cases including our case) of B. casei infection.

We present the case of a 14-year-old male with prior history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented with a several month history of vague flank pain which increased in intensity, leading to an emergency department presentation with the only significant finding on exam being microhematuria. Subsequent imaging showed a tumor like replacement of the right ureter with proximal hydronephrosis, initially felt to represent recurrent leukemia. Pathology revealed the tumor like ureteral replacement to represent a nephrogenic adenoma, a benign entity which often responds to conservative management, though not previously reported in the ureter in pediatrics.","['Koberlein, George', 'Munden, Martha']","['Koberlein G', 'Munden M']",,"['Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, Department of Radiology, 1 Medical Center Blvd, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.', 'Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, Department of Radiology, 1 Medical Center Blvd, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210409,Netherlands,Radiol Case Rep,Radiology case reports,101467888,PMC8055516,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Cystourethroscopy', 'MRI', 'Nephrogenic adenoma', 'Pediatric']",2021/04/27 06:00,2021/04/27 06:01,['2021/04/26 05:52'],"['2021/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/02 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/26 05:52 [entrez]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.radcr.2021.03.002 [doi]', 'S1930-0433(21)00140-0 [pii]']",epublish,Radiol Case Rep. 2021 Apr 9;16(6):1384-1387. doi: 10.1016/j.radcr.2021.03.002. eCollection 2021 Jun.,,,,,"['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Fat mass and obesity associated protein (FTO), an mRNA N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) demethylase, functions as an oncogene that promotes leukemic oncogene-mediated cell transformation and leukemogenesis. Here, we investigated the role of Saikosaponin-d (SsD) in broad anti-proliferation effects in AML and evaluated the m(6)A demethylation activity by targeting FTO of SsD. Methods: It was examined whether and how SsD regulates FTO/m(6)A signaling in AML. The pharmacologic activities and mechanisms of actions of SsD in vitro, in mice, primary patient cells, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors-resistant cells were determined. Results: SsD showed a broadly-suppressed AML cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SsD directly targeted FTO, thereby increasing global m(6)A RNA methylation, which in turn decreased the stability of downstream gene transcripts, leading to the suppression of relevant pathways. Importantly, SsD also overcame FTO/m(6)A-mediated leukemia resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that FTO-dependent m(6)A RNA methylation mediated the anti-leukemic actions of SsD, thereby opening a window to develop SsD as an epitranscriptome-base drug for leukemia therapy.","['Sun, Kaiju', 'Du, Yangyang', 'Hou, Yuzhu', 'Zhao, Mingyue', 'Li, Jiajia', 'Du, Yazhe', 'Zhang, Lingxiao', 'Chen, Changbao', 'Yang, Hongmei', 'Yan, Fei', 'Su, Rui']","['Sun K', 'Du Y', 'Hou Y', 'Zhao M', 'Li J', 'Du Y', 'Zhang L', 'Chen C', 'Yang H', 'Yan F', 'Su R']",,"['Jilin Ginseng Academy, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, 130017, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Inorganic Synthesis and Preparative Chemistry, International Joint Research Laboratory of Nano-Micro Architecture Chemistry (NMAC), International Research Center for Chemistry-Medicine Joint Innovation, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, 2699 Qianjin Street, Changchun 130012, China.', 'Jilin Ginseng Academy, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, 130017, China.', 'Jilin Ginseng Academy, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, 130017, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Hospital, Jilin University, 130021, P.

This study aimed to identify whether c-Myc could facilitate cytogenetics to predict a ""7 + 3"" induction chemoresponse in de novo AML. Methods: We stratified 75 untreated patients (24 and 51 from prospective and retrospective cohorts, respectively) with de novo AML who completed ""7 + 3"" induction into groups with and without complete remission (CR). We then compared Myc-associated molecular signatures between the groups in the prospective cohort after gene set enrichment analysis. The expression of c-Myc protein was assessed by immunohistochemical staining. We defined high c-Myc-immunopositivity as > 40% of bone marrow myeloblasts being c-Myc (+). Results: Significantly more Myc gene expression was found in patients who did not achieve CR by ""7 + 3"" induction than those who did (2439.92 +/- 1868.94 vs. 951.60 +/- 780.68; p = 0.047). Expression of the Myc gene and c-Myc protein were positively correlated (r = 0.495; p = 0.014). Although the non-CR group did not express more c-Myc protein than the CR group (37.81 +/- 25.13% vs. 29.04 +/- 19.75%; p = 0.151), c-Myc-immunopositivity could be a surrogate to predict the ""7 + 3"" induction chemoresponse (specificity: 81.63%). More importantly, c-Myc-immunopositivity facilitated cytogenetics to predict a ""7 + 3"" induction chemoresponse by increasing specificity from 91.30 to 95.92%. Conclusion: The ""7 + 3"" induction remains the standard of care for de novo AML patients, especially for those without a high c-Myc-immunopositivity and high-risk cytogenetics. However, different regimens might be considered for patients with high c-Myc-immunopositivity or high-risk cytogenetics.","['Hsiao, Tzu-Hung', 'Wang, Ren Ching', 'Lu, Tsai-Jung', 'Shih, Chien-Hung', 'Su, Yu-Chen', 'Tsai, Jia-Rong', 'Jhan, Pei-Pei', 'Lia, Cai-Sian', 'Chuang, Han-Ni', 'Chang, Kuang-Hsi', 'Teng, Chieh-Lin']","['Hsiao TH', 'Wang RC', 'Lu TJ', 'Shih CH', 'Su YC', 'Tsai JR', 'Jhan PP', 'Lia CS', 'Chuang HN', 'Chang KH', 'Teng CL']",,"['Department of Medical Research, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Nursing, College of Nursing, Hungkuang University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', ""Department of Medical Research, Tungs' Taichung Metroharbor Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan."", 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'General Education Center, Jen-The Junior College of Medicine, Nursing and Management, Miaoli, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Life Science, Tunghai University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210408,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,PMC8061304,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemoresponse', 'induction chemotherapy', 'myc (c-Myc)', '""7+3""']",2021/04/27 06:00,2021/04/27 06:01,['2021/04/26 05:48'],"['2021/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/26 05:48 [entrez]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2021.649267 [doi]', '649267 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2021 Apr 8;12:649267. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2021.649267. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Hsiao, Wang, Lu, Shih, Su, Tsai, Jhan, Lia, Chuang, Chang and', 'Teng.']",,,,,"['CT received an honorarium and consulting fees from Novartis, Roche, Takeda,', 'Johnson and Johnson, Amgen, BMS Celgene, Kirin, AbbVie, and MSD.

HSP90 is one of the most important and well-known family members, necessary for maintaining intracellular homeostasis. In the extracellular space, it is responsible for the transmission of alarm signals to the immune system. Numerous reports have indicated that the level of intra - and extracellular HSP90 can correlate either with a poorer prognosis or with a better outcome, depending on the type of cancer. Still, little is known why the level of this chaperone is increased in some tumors and decreased in others, reflecting dual role of protein in cell death processes. Currently, there is no database reporting levels of serum HSP90 in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). As such, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, we aimed to determine this parameter in a group of 21 patients with newly diagnosed ALL. We found decreased protein serum levels in patients at disease presentation and after induction block of chemotherapy in comparison to healthy controls. Furthermore, we observed a negative correlation between HSP90 serum levels and one of the earliest prognostic factors of the treatment response - peripheral blood lymphoblasts on the 8(th) day of treatment. Our results indicate that HSP90 serum may play an important role in leukemogenesis and could be used as a marker to predict treatment failure in children with ALL.","['Pawlik-Gwozdecka, Dorota', 'Gorska-Ponikowska, Magdalena', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska, Elzbieta', 'Niedzwiecki, Maciej']","['Pawlik-Gwozdecka D', 'Gorska-Ponikowska M', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska E', 'Niedzwiecki M']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Hematology, Oncology and Endocrinology, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Chemistry, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology, Oncology and Endocrinology, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology, Oncology and Endocrinology, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200608,Poland,Cent Eur J Immunol,Central-European journal of immunology,9702239,PMC8056347,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cancer biomarkers', 'heat shock proteins (HSPs)']",2021/04/27 06:00,2021/04/27 06:01,['2021/04/26 05:47'],"['2019/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/26 05:47 [entrez]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5114/ceji.2020.95114 [doi]', '40583 [pii]']",ppublish,Cent Eur J Immunol. 2021;46(1):63-67. doi: 10.5114/ceji.2020.95114.

In this in vitro study, we investigated the effects of Gal-1 inhibition in the sera of immunocompromised CLL patients on immunomodulating properties of dendritic cells (DCs). DCs derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with a healthy serum, CLL serum as well as the combination of CLL serum and Gal-1 inhibitor (OTX008). Following the treatment, the expression levels of DC maturation markers (CD80, CD83, CD86 and IDO-1) were determined as well as their cytokine profile and the ability to polarize the immune response in co-cultures with CD4(+) T cells. After treatment with CLL serum, an increase in interleukin (IL)-10 production was observed in both DC cultures and co-cultures with CD4(+) T cells. OTX008 caused a reduction in IL-10 production as well as IL-2, but no significant alteration in the expression of DC maturation markers or T regulatory cell (Treg) frequency was observed. The results of our study suggest that Gal-1 from CLL serum give rise to a specific IL-10(+) CD4(+) T cell phenotype, other than Treg, that could mediate immunodeficiency development in CLL patients.","['Kostic, Milos', 'Dzopalic, Tanja', 'Marjanovic, Goran', 'Urosevic, Ivana', 'Milosevic, Ivana']","['Kostic M', 'Dzopalic T', 'Marjanovic G', 'Urosevic I', 'Milosevic I']",,"['Department of Immunology, Medical Faculty of Nis, University of Nis, Nis, Serbia.', 'Department of Immunology, Medical Faculty of Nis, University of Nis, Nis, Serbia.', 'Department of Immunology, Medical Faculty of Nis, University of Nis, Nis, Serbia.', 'Department of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Clinical Centre Nis, Nis, Serbia.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Novi Sad, Faculty of Medicine, Novi Sad, Serbia.', 'Clinical Centre of Vojvodina, Hematology Clinic, Novi Sad, Serbia.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Novi Sad, Faculty of Medicine, Novi Sad, Serbia.', 'Clinical Centre of Vojvodina, Hematology Clinic, Novi Sad, Serbia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210418,Poland,Cent Eur J Immunol,Central-European journal of immunology,9702239,PMC8056350,['NOTNLM'],"['OTX008', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'dendritic cell', 'galectin-1', 'immunodeficiency']",2021/04/27 06:00,2021/04/27 06:01,['2021/04/26 05:47'],"['2020/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/26 05:47 [entrez]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5114/ceji.2021.105246 [doi]', '43813 [pii]']",ppublish,Cent Eur J Immunol. 2021;46(1):54-62. doi: 10.5114/ceji.2021.105246.

Interferon stimulated exonuclease gene 20 (ISG20) is a protein induced by interferons or double-stranded RNA, which is associated with poor prognosis in several malignant tumors. However its expression in AML is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To explore the expression of ISG20 in AML and its prognostic significance. METHODS: The expression of ISG20 in AML patients was analyzed by GEPIA database, detected by qRT-PCR and their prognosis was followed-up. Chi-square test was used to identify the association between ISG20 expression and clinical characteristics of the patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to draw survival curves and Cox regression analysis to confirm the independent prognostic factors of AML patients. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that whether to receive treatment, karyotype, and ISG20 expression were related to overall survival time of AML patients (P< 0.05). Cox regression analysis showed that whether to receive treatment (HR = 0.248, 95% CI = 0.076-0.808, P= 0.021) and high expression of ISG20 (HR = 4.266, 95% CI = 1.118-16.285, P= 0.034) were independent unfavorable prognostic factors for AML patients. CONCLUSION: The high expression of ISG20 acts as a poor prognosis indicator in AML patients.","['Xiong, Hao', 'Zhang, Xinwen', 'Chen, Xiaomin', 'Liu, Yang', 'Duan, Jialin', 'Huang, Chunlan']","['Xiong H', 'Zhang X', 'Chen X', 'Liu Y', 'Duan J', 'Huang C']",,,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'ISG20', 'interferon', 'prognosis', 'survival times']",2021/04/27 06:00,2021/12/24 06:00,['2021/04/26 05:39'],"['2021/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/26 05:39 [entrez]']","['CBM210061 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-210061 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2021;31(3):255-261. doi: 10.3233/CBM-210061.,20211222,"['EC 3.1.- (Exoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (ISG20 protein, human)']",IM,"['Exoribonucleases/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its role in retinoblastoma (RB) has not yet been explored. METHODS: The expression level of TRIB3 was detected in RB tissues and cell lines using qRT-PCR. The effects of TRIB3 on cell proliferation and invasion capacities were analyzed with MTT, crystal violet, and transwell assays. Western blot and rescue assays were conducted to explore the underlying mechanism. RESULTS: This study found that TRIB3 was upregulated in human RB tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues both at the mRNA and protein levels. Overexpression of TRIB3 significantly promoted cell proliferation and invasion of RB cells, while TRIB3 knockdown inhibited these processes. Moreover, the mechanism deciphering experiments showed that TRIB3 overexpression can increase AKT and mTOR phosphorylation. Conversely, TRIB3 knockdown decreased the phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR. Additionally, MK2206, a potent AKT inhibitor, blocked the promotive effects of TRIB3 in RB cells. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that TRIB3 acts as an oncogene and plays a crucial role in the proliferation and invasion of RB cells via regulating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Therefore, TRIB3 may serve as a potential target in the diagnosis and/or treatment of RB.","['Bao, Xian-Yi', 'Sun, Ming', 'Peng, Ting-Ting', 'Han, Dong-Mei']","['Bao XY', 'Sun M', 'Peng TT', 'Han DM']",,"['Department of Cataract, Aier Eye Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Cataract, Aier Eye Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Cataract, Aier Eye Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Fundus Disease, Huainan Chenguang Eye Hospital, Huainan, Anhui, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT', 'TRIB3 retinoblastoma', 'proliferation migration invasion']",2021/04/27 06:00,2022/01/15 06:00,['2021/04/26 05:39'],"['2021/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/26 05:39 [entrez]']","['CBM200050 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-200050 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2021;31(4):307-315. doi: 10.3233/CBM-200050.,20220114,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TRIB3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, patients with refractory or relapsed B-ALL or T-ALL have much worse outcomes with conventional chemotherapy, hence treatment of these cohorts with novel agents is a priority.Areas Covered: This paper reviews early phase clinical trials in pediatric leukemia. Investigational antibody therapy, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T), and other targeted therapies are examined. The authors discuss the mechanisms of action, side effects, trial designs, and outcomes and reflect on potential research directions. PubMed and Clinicaltrials.gov were searched from 2010 to present, using keywords 'lymphoblastic leukemia' with filters for pediatric age, Phase 1 clinical trial and Phase 2 clinical trial.Expert Opinion: Pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia often do not derive additional benefit from intensified conventional chemotherapy approaches which have arguably been maximized in the upfront setting. Therefore, novel approaches, such as immunotherapy and targeted agents should be prioritized. Progress will require commitment from pharmaceutical companies regarding these orphan diagnoses and acknowledgment from regulatory bodies that outcomes are suboptimal with conventional chemotherapy.","['Asare, Julie M', 'Rabik, Cara A', 'Muller, Bradley', 'Brown, Patrick A', 'Cooper, Stacy']","['Asare JM', 'Rabik CA', 'Muller B', 'Brown PA', 'Cooper S']",,"['Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210504,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-ALL', 'CAR T-cells', 'T-ALL', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'blinatumomab', 'daratumumab', 'inotuzumab', 'venetoclax']",2021/04/27 06:00,2021/07/08 06:00,['2021/04/26 05:24'],"['2021/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/26 05:24 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13543784.2021.1916466 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2021 Jun;30(6):611-620. doi: 10.1080/13543784.2021.1916466.

Despite its impressive activity against APL, the same could not be clinically observed in other types of cancer. Nanotechnology can be a tool to enhance ATRA anticancer efficacy and resolve its drawbacks in APL as well as in other malignancies.Areas covered: This review covers ATRA use in APL and non-APL cancers, the problems that were found in ATRA therapy and how nanoencapsulation can aid to circumvent them. Pre-clinical results obtained with nanoencapsulated ATRA are shown as well as the two ATRA products based on nanotechnology that were clinically tested: ATRA-IV(R) and Apealea(R).Expert opinion: ATRA presents interesting properties to be used in anticancer therapy with a notorious differentiation and antimetastatic activity. Bioavailability and resistance limitations impair the use of ATRA in non-APL cancers. Nanotechnology can circumvent these issues and provide tools to enhance its anticancer activities, such as co-loading of multiple drug and active targeting to tumor site.","['Borges, Gabriel Silva Marques', 'Lima, Flavia Alves', 'Carneiro, Guilherme', 'Goulart, Gisele Assis Castro', 'Ferreira, Lucas Antonio Miranda']","['Borges GSM', 'Lima FA', 'Carneiro G', 'Goulart GAC', 'Ferreira LAM']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0292-076X'],"['Departamento De Produtos Farmaceuticos, Faculdade De Farmacia, Universidade Federal De Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Departamento De Produtos Farmaceuticos, Faculdade De Farmacia, Universidade Federal De Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Departamento De Farmacia, Faculdade De Ciencias Biologicas E Da Saude, Universidade Federal Dos Vales Do Jequitinhonha E Mucuri, Diamantina, Brazil.', 'Departamento De Produtos Farmaceuticos, Faculdade De Farmacia, Universidade Federal De Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Departamento De Produtos Farmaceuticos, Faculdade De Farmacia, Universidade Federal De Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20210519,England,Expert Opin Drug Deliv,Expert opinion on drug delivery,101228421,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Tretinoin', '*acute promyelocytic leukemia', '*all-trans retinoic acid', '*cancer', '*drug combination', '*drug delivery', '*nano-conjugates', '*nanotechnology', '*self-assembly']",2021/04/27 06:00,2021/04/27 06:00,['2021/04/26 05:24'],"['2021/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/26 05:24 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17425247.2021.1919619 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Deliv. 2021 Oct;18(10):1335-1354. doi: 10.1080/17425247.2021.1919619.

Host genetic heterozygosity at the major histocompatibility complex can enhance the ability to combat infectious diseases.

Bovine leukocyte antigen (BoLA)-DRB3 polymorphisms are related with BLV-infection outcome; however, whether BoLA-DRB3 heterozygotes have an advantage against BLV-induced lymphoma and proviral load (PVL) remains unclear. By analyzing 1567 BLV-infected individuals, we found that BoLA-DRB3 heterozygous status was significantly associated with lymphoma resistance irrespective of cattle breeds (p < 0.0001). Similarly, decreased PVL was observed in BoLA-DRB3 heterozygotes (p = 0.0407 for Holstein cows; p = 0.0889 for Japanese Black cattle). Our report provides first evidence of BoLA-DRB3 heterozygote advantage against BLV infection outcome.","['Lo, Chieh-Wen', 'Takeshima, Shin-Nosuke', 'Wada, Satoshi', 'Matsumoto, Yasunobu', 'Aida, Yoko']","['Lo CW', 'Takeshima SN', 'Wada S', 'Matsumoto Y', 'Aida Y']",,"['Laboratory of Global Infectious Diseases Control Science, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Global Animal Resource Science, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Food and Nutrition, Jumonji University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, Saitama, Japan.', 'Photonics Control Technology Team, RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, Wako, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Global Infectious Diseases Control Science, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Global Animal Resource Science, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Global Infectious Diseases Control Science, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Global Animal Resource Science, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210502,England,HLA,HLA,101675570,,['NOTNLM'],"['*BoLA-DRB3', '*association study', '*bovine leukemia virus', '*heterozygosity', '*lymphoma', '*proviral load', '*resistance', '*susceptibility']",2021/04/26 06:00,2021/08/12 06:00,['2021/04/25 21:04'],"['2021/04/21 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/12 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/25 21:04 [entrez]']",['10.1111/tan.14285 [doi]'],ppublish,HLA. 2021 Aug;98(2):132-139. doi: 10.1111/tan.14285.

The international UKALLXII/ECOG-ACRIN E2993 (#NCT00002514) trial accrued 1229 adolescent/adult patients with BCR-ABL1- B-ALL (aged 14 to 65 years). Although 93% of patients achieved remission, 41% relapsed at a median of 13 months (range, 28 days to 12 years). Five-year overall survival (OS) was 42% (95% confidence interval, 39, 44). Transcriptome sequencing, gene expression profiling, cytogenetics, and fusion polymerase chain reaction enabled genomic subtyping of 282 patient samples, of which 264 were eligible for trial, accounting for 64.5% of E2993 patients. Among patients with outcome data, 29.5% with favorable outcomes (5-year OS 65% to 80%) were deemed standard risk (DUX4-rearranged [9.2%], ETV6-RUNX1/-like [2.3%], TCF3-PBX1 [6.9%], PAX5 P80R [4.1%], high-hyperdiploid [6.9%]); 50.2% had high-risk genotypes with 5-year OS of 0% to 27% (Ph-like [21.2%], KMT2A-AFF1 [12%], low-hypodiploid/near-haploid [14.3%], BCL2/MYC-rearranged [2.8%]); 20.3% had intermediate-risk genotypes with 5-year OS of 33% to 45% (PAX5alt [12.4%], ZNF384/-like [5.1%], MEF2D-rearranged [2.8%]). IKZF1 alterations occurred in 86% of Ph-like, and TP53 mutations in patients who were low-hypodiploid (54%) and BCL2/MYC-rearranged (33%) but were not independently associated with outcome. Of patients considered high risk based on presenting age and white blood cell count, 40% harbored subtype-defining genetic alterations associated with standard- or intermediate-risk outcomes. We identified distinct immunophenotypic features for DUX4-rearranged, PAX5 P80R, ZNF384-R/-like, and Ph-like genotypes. These data in a large adult B-ALL cohort treated with a non-risk-adapted approach on a single trial show the prognostic importance of genomic analyses, which may translate into future therapeutic benefits.","['Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Roberts, Kathryn G', 'Wang, Victoria', 'Gu, Zhaohui', 'Buck, Georgina A N', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Cheng, Zhongshan', 'Wu, Gang', 'Qu, Chunxu', 'Shi, Lei', 'Pounds, Stanley', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Harvey, Richard', 'Racevskis, Janis', 'Barinka, Jan', 'Zhang, Yanming', 'Dewald, Gordon W', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Alejos, David', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Luger, Selina M', 'Foroni, Letizia', 'Patel, Bela', 'Fielding, Adele K', 'Melnick, Ari', 'Marks, David I', 'Moorman, Anthony V', 'Wiernik, Peter H', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Goldstone, Anthony H', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Litzow, Mark R']","['Paietta E', 'Roberts KG', 'Wang V', 'Gu Z', 'Buck GAN', 'Pei D', 'Cheng C', 'Levine RL', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Cheng Z', 'Wu G', 'Qu C', 'Shi L', 'Pounds S', 'Willman CL', 'Harvey R', 'Racevskis J', 'Barinka J', 'Zhang Y', 'Dewald GW', 'Ketterling RP', 'Alejos D', 'Lazarus HM', 'Luger SM', 'Foroni L', 'Patel B', 'Fielding AK', 'Melnick A', 'Marks DI', 'Moorman AV', 'Wiernik PH', 'Rowe JM', 'Tallman MS', 'Goldstone AH', 'Mullighan CG', 'Litzow MR']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1581-1327', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4904-9767', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1159-5607', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4746-7789', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8074-2287', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1871-1850', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9816-6302']","['Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY.', ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Department of Data Science, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Clinical Trial Service Unit, Nuttfield Department of Population Health, Oxford, United Kingdom.', ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program-Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program-Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', ""Centre for Applied Bioinformatics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Centre for Applied Bioinformatics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM.', 'University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM.', 'Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY.', ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom.', 'UCL Cancer Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY.', 'Bristol Haematology and Oncology Centre, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Newcastle University Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research Foundation, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Hematology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', 'University College London Hospitals, London, United Kingdom;

Activating mutations affecting components of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway occur in the majority of Ph-like ALL cases. The use of JAK inhibitors represents a potential treatment option for Ph-like ALL, although we and others have shown that CRLF2-rearranged Ph-like ALL responds poorly to single-agent JAK inhibitors in the preclinical setting. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify effective combination treatments against CRLF2-rearranged Ph-like ALL, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of synergy. We carried out a series of high-throughput combination drug screenings and found that ruxolitinib exerted synergy with standard-of-care drugs used in the treatment of ALL. In addition, we investigated the molecular effects of ruxolitinib on Ph-like ALL by combining mass spectrometry phosphoproteomics with gene expression analysis. Based on these findings, we conducted preclinical in vivo drug testing and demonstrated that ruxolitinib enhanced the in vivo efficacy of an induction-type regimen consisting of vincristine, dexamethasone, and L-asparaginase in 2/3 CRLF2-rearranged Ph-like ALL xenografts. Overall, our findings support evaluating the addition of ruxolitinib to conventional induction regimens for the treatment of CRLF2-rearranged Ph-like ALL.","['Bhm, Julia W', 'Sia, Keith C S', 'Jones, Connor', 'Evans, Kathryn', 'Mariana, Anna', 'Pang, Ignatius', 'Failes, Tim', 'Zhong, Ling', 'Mayoh, Chelsea', 'Landman, Robert', 'Collins, Robert', 'Erickson, Stephen W', 'Arndt, Greg', 'Raftery, Mark J', 'Wilkins, Marc R', 'Norris, Murray D', 'Haber, Michelle', 'Marshall, Glenn M', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Bhm JW', 'Sia KCS', 'Jones C', 'Evans K', 'Mariana A', 'Pang I', 'Failes T', 'Zhong L', 'Mayoh C', 'Landman R', 'Collins R', 'Erickson SW', 'Arndt G', 'Raftery MJ', 'Wilkins MR', 'Norris MD', 'Haber M', 'Marshall GM', 'Lock RB']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6398-3046', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0632-4589', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2503-0762', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3436-9071']","[""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Centre for Childhood Cancer Research, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Centre for Childhood Cancer Research, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Centre for Childhood Cancer Research, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Centre for Childhood Cancer Research, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Centre for Childhood Cancer Research, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Centre for Childhood Cancer Research, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'Bioanalytical Mass Spectrometry Facility, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Centre for Childhood Cancer Research, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'Incyte Corporation, Wilmington, DE, USA.', 'Incyte Corporation, Wilmington, DE, USA.', 'RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Centre for Childhood Cancer Research, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'Bioanalytical Mass Spectrometry Facility, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Centre for Childhood Cancer Research, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Centre for Childhood Cancer Research, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Centre for Childhood Cancer Research, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Centre for Childhood Cancer Research, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia. rlock@ccia.unsw.edu.au.""]",['eng'],"['U01 CA199222/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA199000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210424,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,2021/04/26 06:00,2021/12/31 06:00,['2021/04/25 20:50'],"['2020/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/31 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/25 20:50 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-021-01248-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-021-01248-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Nov;35(11):3101-3112. doi: 10.1038/s41375-021-01248-8.

To elucidate the mechanism underlying the behavioral phenotypes, we conducted histological analyses and observed impairments in thinning of neocortical layer 6 (L6) and a reduction of TBR1+ neurons in Zbtb16 KO mice. Furthermore, we found increased dendritic spines and microglia, as well as developmental defects in oligodendrocytes and neocortical myelination in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of Zbtb16 KO mice. Using genomics approaches, we identified the Zbtb16 transcriptome that includes genes involved in neocortical maturation such as neurogenesis and myelination, and both autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) pathobiology. Co-expression networks further identified Zbtb16-correlated modules that are unique to ASD or SCZ, respectively.

Several large record based studies have recently reported heterogeneous results. Differences in exposure assessment timing may explain this heterogeneity. OBJECTIVES: In a previous ecological study we did not observe any association between childhood AL incidence in France and NBR exposure at the time of diagnosis. With the same methodology, the present study focused on NBR exposure at the time of birth. Based on data from the French national registry of childhood cancer, we analyzed all AL together, and lymphoblastic and myeloid AL, separately. METHODS: We included 6,059 childhood AL cases born and diagnosed in mainland France between 1990 and 2009. NBR levels in municipalities of residence at birth were estimated by cokriging models, using NBR measurements and precise geological data. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) per unit variation of exposure was estimated with Poisson regression models, with adjustment for socio-demographic indicators and ultraviolet radiation levels. NBR exposures were considered at the time of birth, and cumulatively from birth to diagnosis. We also estimated a total NBR dose to red-bone marrow (RBM). RESULTS: There was no evidence for an association between NBR exposure at birth and childhood AL incidence, neither overall (gamma radiation: IRR = 0.99 (0.94,1.05) per 50 nSv/h; radon: IRR = 0.97 (0.91,1.03) per 100 Bq/m(3)) nor for the main AL types. The conclusions were similar with the cumulative exposures, and the total RBM dose.

In accordance, over the last years, basic research focusing on the aberrations underlying malignant transformation of myeloid cells has provided the basis for precision medicine approaches and subsequently has led to the development of powerful therapeutic strategies. In this review article, we will recapitulate what has happened since in the 1980s the use of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), as a first targeted cancer therapy, has changed one of the deadliest leukemia subtypes, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), into one that can be cured without classical chemotherapy today. Similarly, imatinib, the first molecularly designed cancer therapy, has revolutionized the management of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Thus, targeted treatment approaches have become the paradigm for myeloid malignancy, but many questions still remain unanswered, especially how identical mutations can be associated with different phenotypes. This might be linked to the impact of the cell of origin, gene-gene interactions, or the tumor microenvironment including the immune system. Continuous research in the field of myeloid neoplasia has started to unravel the molecular pathways that are not only crucial for initial treatment response, but also resistance of leukemia cells under therapy. Ongoing studies focusing on leukemia cell vulnerabilities do already point to novel (targetable) ""Achilles heels"" that can further improve myeloid cancer therapy.","['Westermann, Jorg', 'Bullinger, Lars']","['Westermann J', 'Bullinger L']",,"['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite University Medicine Berlin, Campus Virchow Clinic, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany.

Therefore, many clinical aspects of ALL with TLS-ERG gene remain unknown. The aim of this study was to report the clinical features and outcomes of four TLS-ERG-positive pediatric ALL cases. The results showed that all four pediatric patients with this fusion gene achieved an excellent outcome even with a very short-term induction chemotherapy of less than two months. These findings indicated that children with TLS-ERG-positive ALL have very low risk of leukemia, and can be treated and cured with less intensive chemotherapy.","['Li, Sisi', 'Huang, Wei', 'Wu, Yuanyuan', 'Xu, Xiaojun', 'Liao, Chan', 'Tang, Yongmin']","['Li S', 'Huang W', 'Wu Y', 'Xu X', 'Liao C', 'Tang Y']",,"[""Department/Center of Hematology-oncology, Diagnostic and Treatment Center for Childhood Leukemia of Zhejiang Province, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, National Medical Research Center for Child Health, #57 Zhuganxiang Road, Yan-an Street, Hangzhou 310003, China; School of Medicine, Zhejiang University City College, China."", ""Department/Center of Hematology-oncology, Diagnostic and Treatment Center for Childhood Leukemia of Zhejiang Province, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, National Medical Research Center for Child Health, #57 Zhuganxiang Road, Yan-an Street, Hangzhou 310003, China."", ""Department/Center of Hematology-oncology, Diagnostic and Treatment Center for Childhood Leukemia of Zhejiang Province, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, National Medical Research Center for Child Health, #57 Zhuganxiang Road, Yan-an Street, Hangzhou 310003, China."", ""Department/Center of Hematology-oncology, Diagnostic and Treatment Center for Childhood Leukemia of Zhejiang Province, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, National Medical Research Center for Child Health, #57 Zhuganxiang Road, Yan-an Street, Hangzhou 310003, China."", ""Department/Center of Hematology-oncology, Diagnostic and Treatment Center for Childhood Leukemia of Zhejiang Province, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, National Medical Research Center for Child Health, #57 Zhuganxiang Road, Yan-an Street, Hangzhou 310003, China."", ""Department/Center of Hematology-oncology, Diagnostic and Treatment Center for Childhood Leukemia of Zhejiang Province, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, National Medical Research Center for Child Health, #57 Zhuganxiang Road, Yan-an Street, Hangzhou 310003, China.

Although bone marrow transplantation, immunotherapy and chemotherapy have led to significant improvements in efficacy, poor prognosis in elderly patients, recurrence and high mortality among hematological malignancies remain major challenges, and innovative therapeutic strategies should be explored. Besides directly lyse tumor cells, oncolytic viruses can activate immune responses or be engineered to express therapeutic factors to increase antitumor efficacy, and have gradually been recognized as an appealing approach for fighting cancers. An increasing number of studies have applied oncolytic viruses in hematological malignancies and made progress. In particular, strategies combining immunotherapy and oncolytic virotherapy are emerging. Various phase I clinical trials of oncolytic reovirus with lenalidomide or programmed death 1(PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitors in multiple myeloma are ongoing. Moreover, preclinical studies of combinations with chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells are underway. Thus, oncolytic virotherapy is expected to be a promising approach to cure hematological malignancies. This review summarizes progress in oncolytic virus research in hematological malignancies. After briefly reviewing the development and oncolytic mechanism of oncolytic viruses, we focus on delivery methods of oncolytic viruses, especially systemic delivery that is suitable for hematological tumors. We then discuss the main types of oncolytic viruses applied for hematological malignancies and related clinical trials. In addition, we present several ways to improve the antitumor efficacy of oncolytic viruses. Finally, we discuss current challenges and provide suggestions for future studies.","['Yang, Chen', 'Hua, Nanni', 'Xie, Shufang', 'Wu, Yi', 'Zhu, Lifeng', 'Wang, Shibing', 'Tong, Xiangmin']","['Yang C', 'Hua N', 'Xie S', 'Wu Y', 'Zhu L', 'Wang S', 'Tong X']",,"[""Molecular diagnosis laboratory, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Affiliated People's Hospital, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, PR China; Department of Clinical Medicine, Qingdao University, Qingdao, PR China."", ""Molecular diagnosis laboratory, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Affiliated People's Hospital, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, PR China; The Second Clinical Medical College, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310000, PR China."", ""Molecular diagnosis laboratory, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Affiliated People's Hospital, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, PR China; The Second Clinical Medical College, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310000, PR China."", ""Phase I clinical research center, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital,Affiliated People's Hospital, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, PR China."", ""Molecular diagnosis laboratory, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Affiliated People's Hospital, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, PR China."", ""Molecular diagnosis laboratory, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Affiliated People's Hospital, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, PR China; The Key Laboratory of Tumor Molecular Diagnosis and Individualized Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital ,Affiliated People's Hospital, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou 310014, PR China.

We have previously shown that activation and nuclear accumulation of MRTFA mediate endocrine resistance of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) positive breast cancers by initiating a partial transition from luminal to basal-like phenotype and impairing ERalpha cistrome and transcriptome. In the present study, we deepen our understanding of the mechanism by monitoring functional changes in the receptor's activity. We demonstrate that MRTFA nuclear accumulation down-regulates the expression of the unliganded (Apo-)ERalpha and causes a redistribution of the protein localization from its normal nuclear place to the entire cell volume. This phenomenon is accompanied by a shift in Apo-ERalpha monomer/dimer ratio towards the monomeric state, leading to significant functional consequences on ERalpha activities. In particular, the association of Apo-ERalpha with chromatin is drastically decreased, and the remaining ERalpha binding sites are substantially less enriched in ERE motifs than in control conditions. Monitored by proximity Ligation Assay, ERalpha interactions with P160 family coactivators are partly impacted when MRTFA accumulates in the nucleus, and those with SMRT and NCOR1 corepressors are abolished. Finally, ERalpha interactions with kinases such as c-src and PI3K are increased, thereby enhancing MAP Kinase and AKT activities. In conclusion, the activation and nuclear accumulation of MRTFA in ERalpha positive breast cancer cells remodels both ERalpha location and functions by shifting its activity from nuclear genome regulation to extra-nuclear non-genomic signaling.","['Jehanno, Charly', 'Percevault, Frederic', 'Boujrad, Noureddine', 'Le Goff, Pascale', 'Fontaine, Coralie', 'Arnal, Jean-Francois', 'Primig, Michael', 'Pakdel, Farzad', 'Michel, Denis', 'Metivier, Raphael', 'Flouriot, Gilles']","['Jehanno C', 'Percevault F', 'Boujrad N', 'Le Goff P', 'Fontaine C', 'Arnal JF', 'Primig M', 'Pakdel F', 'Michel D', 'Metivier R', 'Flouriot G']",,"['Univ Rennes, Inserm, EHESP, Irset (Institut de Recherche en Sante, Environnement et Travail), UMR_S 1085, F-35000, Rennes, France; University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Univ Rennes, Inserm, EHESP, Irset (Institut de Recherche en Sante, Environnement et Travail), UMR_S 1085, F-35000, Rennes, France.', 'Univ Rennes, Inserm, EHESP, Irset (Institut de Recherche en Sante, Environnement et Travail), UMR_S 1085, F-35000, Rennes, France.', 'Univ Rennes, Inserm, EHESP, Irset (Institut de Recherche en Sante, Environnement et Travail), UMR_S 1085, F-35000, Rennes, France.', 'INSERM U1048, Institut des Maladies Metaboliques et Cardiovasculaires, Universite de Toulouse - UPS, Toulouse, France.', 'INSERM U1048, Institut des Maladies Metaboliques et Cardiovasculaires, Universite de Toulouse - UPS, Toulouse, France.', 'Univ Rennes, Inserm, EHESP, Irset (Institut de Recherche en Sante, Environnement et Travail), UMR_S 1085, F-35000, Rennes, France.', 'Univ Rennes, Inserm, EHESP, Irset (Institut de Recherche en Sante, Environnement et Travail), UMR_S 1085, F-35000, Rennes, France.', 'Univ Rennes, Inserm, EHESP, Irset (Institut de Recherche en Sante, Environnement et Travail), UMR_S 1085, F-35000, Rennes, France.', 'Univ Rennes, Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes, UMR 6290 CNRS, Rennes, France.', 'Univ Rennes, Inserm, EHESP, Irset (Institut de Recherche en Sante, Environnement et Travail), UMR_S 1085, F-35000, Rennes, France.

The aim of this study was to describe management of critically ill CAR T-cell recipients in intensive care. METHODS: This international, multicentre, observational cohort study was done in 21 intensive care units in France, Spain, the USA, the UK, Russia, Canada, Germany, and Austria. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older; had received CAR T-cell therapy in the past 30 days; and had been admitted to intensive care for any reason. Investigators retrospectively included patients admitted between Feb 1, 2018, and Feb 1, 2019, and prospectively included patients admitted between March 1, 2019, and Feb 1, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were extracted from medical records. The primary endpoint was 90-day mortality. Factors associated with mortality were identified using a Cox proportional hazard model. FINDINGS: 942 patients received CAR T-cell therapy, of whom 258 (27%) required admission to intensive care and 241 (26%) were included in the analysis. Admission to intensive care was needed within median 4.5 days (IQR 2.0-7.0) of CAR T-cell infusion. 90-day mortality was 22.4% (95% CI 17.1-27.7; 54 deaths). At initial evaluation on admission, isolated cytokine release syndrome was identified in 101 patients (42%), cytokine release syndrome and ICANS in 93 (39%), and isolated ICANS in seven (3%) patients. Grade 3-4 cytokine release syndrome within 1 day of admission to intensive care was found in 50 (25%) of 200 patients and grade 3-4 ICANS in 38 (35%) of 108 patients. Bacterial infection developed in 30 (12%) patients. Life-saving treatments were used in 75 (31%) patients within 24 h of admission to intensive care, primarily vasoactive drugs in 65 (27%) patients. Factors independently associated with 90-day mortality by multivariable analysis were frailty (hazard ratio 2.51 [95% CI 1.37-4.57]), bacterial infection (2.12 [1.11-4.08]), and lifesaving therapy within 24 h of admission (1.80 [1.05-3.10]). INTERPRETATION: Critical care management is an integral part of CAR T-cell therapy and should be standardised. Studies to improve infection prevention and treatment in these high-risk patients are warranted.

Mutations in CSF3R and RUNX1 are frequently observed in CN patients, although how they drive the transition from CN to AML (CN/AML) is unclear. Here we establish a model of stepwise leukemogenesis in CN/AML using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of CN patient-derived iPSCs. We identified BAALC upregulation and resultant phosphorylation of MK2a as a key leukemogenic event. BAALC deletion or treatment with CMPD1, a selective inhibitor of MK2a phosphorylation, blocked proliferation and induced differentiation of primary CN/AML blasts and CN/AML iPSC-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) without affecting healthy donor or CN iPSC-derived HSPCs. Beyond detailing a useful method for future investigation of stepwise leukemogenesis, this study suggests that targeting BAALC and/or MK2a phosphorylation may prevent leukemogenic transformation or eliminate AML blasts in CN/AML and RUNX1 mutant BAALC(hi) de novo AML.","['Dannenmann, Benjamin', 'Klimiankou, Maksim', 'Oswald, Benedikt', 'Solovyeva, Anna', 'Mardan, Jehan', 'Nasri, Masoud', 'Ritter, Malte', 'Zahabi, Azadeh', 'Arreba-Tutusaus, Patricia', 'Mir, Perihan', 'Stein, Frederic', 'Kandabarau, Siarhei', 'Lachmann, Nico', 'Moritz, Thomas', 'Morishima, Tatsuya', 'Konantz, Martina', 'Lengerke, Claudia', 'Ripperger, Tim', 'Steinemann, Doris', 'Erlacher, Miriam', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte M', 'Zeidler, Cornelia', 'Welte, Karl', 'Skokowa, Julia']","['Dannenmann B', 'Klimiankou M', 'Oswald B', 'Solovyeva A', 'Mardan J', 'Nasri M', 'Ritter M', 'Zahabi A', 'Arreba-Tutusaus P', 'Mir P', 'Stein F', 'Kandabarau S', 'Lachmann N', 'Moritz T', 'Morishima T', 'Konantz M', 'Lengerke C', 'Ripperger T', 'Steinemann D', 'Erlacher M', 'Niemeyer CM', 'Zeidler C', 'Welte K', 'Skokowa J']",,"['Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72074 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72074 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72074 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72074 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72074 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72074 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72074 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72074 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72074 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72074 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72074 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch-Institute of Clinical Pharmacology (IKP), 70376 Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72074 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel, 4031 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72074 Tuebingen, Germany; Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel, 4031 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Medical Center, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), 79106 Freiburg, Germany; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Medical Center, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), 79106 Freiburg, Germany; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, 39625 Hannover, Germany.', ""University Children's Hospital Tuebingen, 72074 Tuebingen, Germany."", 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72074 Tuebingen, Germany.

Coagulopathy may persist after induction therapy. We evaluated the overall role of circulating microparticles (MPs) in coagulation activation in APL-associated coagulopathy before and during induction therapy. Eleven adult patients with >/= World Health Organization's (WHO) grade 2 bleeding events and 11 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were selected. All patients received arsenic trioxide alone as induction therapy. MP-associated TF (MP-TF) activity and MP procoagulant activity (MP-PCA) and 12 coagulation- and anticoagulation-associated indexes were measured before, during, and after induction therapy. Correlation between MP-associated indexes and the other 12 indexes was analyzed in patients. The MP-TF activity was negligible in controls, whereas it markedly increased in patients, dropped rapidly after treatment, and returned to normal at the end of induction therapy. The MP-PCA was similar between patients and controls. The correlation analysis revealed that TF-bearing MPs in patients mainly originated from APL cells. Partially differentiated APL cells could also release TF-bearing MPs, and the higher the degree of APL cell differentiation, the lower the ability of APL cells to release TF-bearing MPs. MP-TF was the main source of active TF in plasma and an important contributor for the coagulation activation in APL-associated coagulopathy. It was MPs released by APL cells/partially differentiated APL cells that served as the vehicle to transfer the large amount of TF to plasma to activate coagulation.","['Zhao, Hongli', 'Sun, Jiayue', 'Yan, Liru', 'Jin, Bo', 'Hou, Wenyi', 'Cao, Fenglin', 'Li, Haitao', 'Zhou, Jin', 'Zhang, Yingmei']","['Zhao H', 'Sun J', 'Yan L', 'Jin B', 'Hou W', 'Cao F', 'Li H', 'Zhou J', 'Zhang Y']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7830-6702'],"[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Carders Outpatient Service, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Central Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, No. 23, Youzheng Street, Nangang District, Harbin, 150001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Central Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, No. 23, Youzheng Street, Nangang District, Harbin, 150001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Central Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, No. 23, Youzheng Street, Nangang District, Harbin, 150001, People's Republic of China. zhangyingmei1111@126.com.""]",['eng'],"['No. 81270589/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'No. H2017032/Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province', 'No. 2019-KYYWF-0371/The Fundamental Research Funds for the Provincial', 'Universities', 'No. HYDSYYXQN202013/Excellent youth project of the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of', 'Harbin Medical University']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20210424,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'Coagulopathy', 'Microparticle', 'Tissue factor']",2021/04/25 06:00,2021/05/27 06:00,['2021/04/24 12:06'],"['2020/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/24 12:06 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-021-04533-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-021-04533-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2021 Jun;100(6):1473-1483. doi: 10.1007/s00277-021-04533-9.

METHODS: Eighty patients were randomly divided into two groups: LLLT and LEDT. Both protocols were applied with the same energy and radiant exposure. The protocols started in the beginning of high doses MTX and finished when the patients were discharged from the hospital or there was oral mucositis resolution. The oral mucositis was assessed during each session in accordance to the World Health Organization (WHO) score. The patients' self-assessed pain was scored on a visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS: The incidence of oral mucositis was similar to LLLT and LEDT, 10% and 12.5%, respectively. Both groups required the same number of days to reach score of zero for mucositis and pain (p > 0. 05), and there was no significant difference in mean VAS between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that LEDT has similar effects to LLLT to avoid and treat oral mucositis.

Based on the efficiency of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in hip osteonecrosis, we performed an evaluation of this treatment in 51 children and adolescents who had symptomatic ankle osteonecrosis after therapy for haematologic cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 51 patients had a total of 79 osteonecrosis sites on MRI, with 29 talus sites, 18 metaphyseal tibia sites, 12 epiphyseal tibia sites, eight calcaneus sites, six fibula sites, four navicular sites, and two cuboid sites. In this prospective randomized trial, 37 ankles were addressed for cell therapy, 37 others for core decompression alone, and 20 were considered as a control group without treatment. We analyzed the outcome of this treatment osteonecrosis, the number and characteristics of bone marrow mesenchymal cells (MSCs) that could be transplanted, and the risks of tumorigenesis in these patients with haematologic cancers. The patients were operated on over a period of ten years from 2000 to 2010 and were monitored through December 31, 2019. RESULTS: Despite a normal systemic blood cells count, MSCs in the iliac crest (counted as CFU-F) were in low number (1021 MSCs/mL; range 314-3015) and were of host origin after even allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Better clinical outcomes (pain, foot and ankle deformity) and osteonecrosis repair on MRI with absence of collapse were obtained in ankles that received cell therapy as compared with those with core decompression alone or those without initial surgery. No tumour was found on MRI at the sites of injection and this study found no increased risk of recurrence or of new cancer in this population after an average follow-up of 15 years. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that autologous MSCs can improve the quality of life of leukemia survivors with ankle osteonecrosis.","['Hernigou, Philippe', 'Auregan, Jean Charles', 'Dubory, Arnaud', 'Flouzat Lachaniette, Charles Henri', 'Rouard, Helene']","['Hernigou P', 'Auregan JC', 'Dubory A', 'Flouzat Lachaniette CH', 'Rouard H']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8475-279X'],"['Orthopedic Department, Henri Mondor Hospital, University Paris East, Paris, France. philippe.hernigou@wanadoo.fr.', 'Orthopedic Department, Antoine Beclere Hospital, University Paris West, Paris, France.', 'Orthopedic Department, Henri Mondor Hospital, University Paris East, Paris, France.', 'Orthopedic Department, Henri Mondor Hospital, University Paris East, Paris, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang, Henri Mondor Hospital, University Paris East, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20210423,Germany,Int Orthop,International orthopaedics,7705431,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Ankle osteonecrosis', '*Children cancer', '*Children osteonecrosis', '*Corticosteroid osteonecrosis', '*Distal tibia osteonecrosis', '*Leukemia survivors', '*Mesenchymal stem cells', '*Talus osteonecrosis']",2021/04/25 06:00,2021/10/26 06:00,['2021/04/24 06:11'],"['2021/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/24 06:11 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00264-021-05051-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00264-021-05051-z [pii]']",ppublish,Int Orthop. 2021 Sep;45(9):2383-2393. doi: 10.1007/s00264-021-05051-z.

Recent studies reported the down-regulation of PTPRG expression levels in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia disease (CML). In addition, the BCR-ABL1 transcript level is currently a key predictive biomarker of CML response to treatment with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs). The aim of this study was to employ flow cytometry to monitor the changes in the expression level of PTPRG in the white blood cells (WBCs) of CML patients at the time of diagnosis and following treatment with TKIs. WBCs from peripheral blood of 21 CML patients were extracted at diagnosis and during follow up along with seven healthy individuals. The PTPRG expression level was determined at protein and mRNA levels by both flow cytometry with monoclonal antibody (TPgamma B9-2) and RT-qPCR, and BCR-ABL1 transcript by RT-qPCR, respectively. PTPRG expression was found to be lower in the neutrophils and monocytes of CML patients at time of diagnosis compared to healthy individuals.

Moreover, restoration levels were greatest in optimal responders and occurred earlier with nilotinib compared to imatinib.

Our initial GEO database analysis identified the presence of differentially-expressed microRNA-1246 (miR-1246) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell-derived EVs. Consequently, the current study set out to investigate the role of AML-derived EVs-packaged miR-1246 in leukemia stem cells (LSCs) bioactivities. The predicted binding between miR-1246 and LRIG1 was verified using dual luciferase reporter assay. Then, gain- and loss-of-function assays were performed in LSCs, where LSCs were co-cultured with AML cell-derived EVs to characterize the effects of miR-1246-containing EVs, miR-1246, LRIG1 and STAT3 pathway in LSCs. Our findings revealed, in AML cell-derived EVs, miR-1246 was highly-expressed and directly-targeted LRIG1 to activate the STAT3 pathway. MiR-1246 inhibitor or EV-encapsulated miR-1246 inhibitor was found to suppress the viability and colony formation abilities but promoted the apoptosis and differentiation of LSCs through inactivation of STAT3 pathway by up-regulating LRIG1. In addition, the inhibitory effects of AML cell-derived EVs carrying miR-1246 inhibitor on LSCs were substantiated by in vivo experiments. Collectively, our findings reveal that the repression of AML cell-derived EVs containing miR-1246 inhibitor alters the survival of LSCs by inactivating the LRIG1-mediated STAT3 pathway.","['Chen, Lijuan', 'Guo, Zhi', 'Zhou, Yongming', 'Ni, Jian', 'Zhu, Jianhua', 'Fan, Xu', 'Chen, Xuexing', 'Liu, Yiling', 'Li, Ziping', 'Zhou, Hao']","['Chen L', 'Guo Z', 'Zhou Y', 'Ni J', 'Zhu J', 'Fan X', 'Chen X', 'Liu Y', 'Li Z', 'Zhou H']",,"['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Cancer for Cancer/Cancer Hospital and Shenzhen Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Shenzhen 518116, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Tianyou Hospital, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430064, China.', ""Department of Oncology Clinical Pharmacy, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'Laboratory of Clinical Immunology, Wuhan No. 1 Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Liver Research Center, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing Key Laboratory of Translational Medicine in Liver Cirrhosis and National Clinical Research Center for Digestive Diseases, Beijing 100050, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210423,United States,Aging (Albany NY),Aging,101508617,PMC8202884,['NOTNLM'],"['*LRIG1', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*extracellular vesicle', '*leukemia stem cells', '*microRNA-1246']",2021/04/25 06:00,2021/07/23 06:00,['2021/04/24 05:41'],"['2020/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/24 05:41 [entrez]']","['202893 [pii]', '10.18632/aging.202893 [doi]']",ppublish,Aging (Albany NY). 2021 Apr 23;13(10):13644-13662. doi: 10.18632/aging.202893.

However, the borderlines among different risk groups are sometimes ambiguous, and for some patients, early death and relapse remained challenges. Besides, with the evolving of the treatment strategy from all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy to ATRA-arsenic trioxide-based synergistic targeted therapy, the precise risk stratification with molecular markers is needed. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This study performed a systematic analysis of APL genomics and transcriptomics to identify genetic abnormalities in 348 patients mainly from the APL2012 trial (NCT01987297) to illustrate the potential molecular background of Sanz score and further optimize it. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm was used to analyze the gene expression in 323 cases to establish a scoring system (i.e., APL9 score). RESULTS: Through combining NRAS mutations, APL9 score, and WBC, 321 cases can be stratified into two groups with significantly different outcomes. The estimated 5-year overall (P = 0.00031), event-free (P < 0.0001), and disease-free (P = 0.001) survival rates in the revised standard-risk group (95.6%, 93.8%, and 98.1%, respectively) were significantly better than those in the revised high-risk group (82.9%, 77.4%, and 88.4%, respectively), which could be validated using The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. CONCLUSIONS: We have proposed a two-category system for improving prognosis in patients with APL. Molecular markers identified in this study may also provide genomic insights into the disease mechanism for improved therapy.","['Lin, Xiaojing', 'Qiao, Niu', 'Shen, Yang', 'Fang, Hai', 'Xue, Qing',

Here, we demonstrate how gene silencing can lead to an acquired dependency on the DNA repair machinery in AML. We make this observation by profiling the essentiality of the ubiquitination machinery in cancer cell lines using domain-focused CRISPR screening, which revealed Fanconi anemia (FA) proteins UBE2T and FANCL as unique dependencies in AML. We demonstrate that these dependencies are due to a synthetic lethal interaction between FA proteins and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), which function in parallel pathways to counteract the genotoxicity of endogenous aldehydes. We show DNA hypermethylation and silencing of ALDH2 occur in a recurrent manner in human AML, which is sufficient to confer FA pathway dependency. Our study suggests that targeting of the ubiquitination reaction catalyzed by FA proteins can eliminate ALDH2-deficient AML. SIGNIFICANCE: Aberrant gene silencing is an epigenetic hallmark of human cancer, but the functional consequences of this process are largely unknown. In this study, we show how an epigenetic alteration leads to an actionable dependency on a DNA repair pathway through the disabling of genetic redundancy.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 2113.","['Yang, Zhaolin', 'Wu, Xiaoli S', 'Wei, Yiliang', 'Polyanskaya, Sofya A', 'Iyer, Shruti V', 'Jung, Moonjung', 'Lach, Francis P', 'Adelman, Emmalee R', 'Klingbeil, Olaf', 'Milazzo, Joseph P', 'Kramer, Melissa', 'Demerdash, Osama E', 'Chang, Kenneth', 'Goodwin, Sara', 'Hodges, Emily', 'McCombie, W Richard', 'Figueroa, Maria E', 'Smogorzewska, Agata', 'Vakoc, Christopher R']","['Yang Z', 'Wu XS', 'Wei Y', 'Polyanskaya SA', 'Iyer SV', 'Jung M', 'Lach FP', 'Adelman ER', 'Klingbeil O', 'Milazzo JP', 'Kramer M', 'Demerdash OE', 'Chang K', 'Goodwin S', 'Hodges E', 'McCombie WR', 'Figueroa ME', 'Smogorzewska A', 'Vakoc CR']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7857-9724', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8956-2955', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3664-3967', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4351-9975', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1364-1814', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3708-7122', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6285-1562']","['Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York.', 'Genetics Program, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York.', 'Genetics Program, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York.', 'Laboratory of Genome Maintenance, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York.', 'Laboratory of Genome Maintenance, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida.', 'Laboratory of Genome Maintenance, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York. vakoc@cshl.edu.']",['eng'],"['T32 CA217835/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA204127/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA045508/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA013106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA174793/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K99 HL150628/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20210423,United States,Cancer Discov,Cancer discovery,101561693,PMC8419016,,,2021/04/25 06:00,2021/04/25 06:00,['2021/04/24 05:39'],"['2020/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/23 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/03/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/24 05:39 [entrez]']","['2159-8290.CD-20-1542 [pii]', '10.1158/2159-8290.CD-20-1542 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Discov. 2021 Sep;11(9):2300-2315. doi: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-20-1542.

However, it remains unclear whether they have inhibitory effects on the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). METHODS: Primary cultured VSMCs from SHRs were treated with different concentrations of Y16 or Y16 plus Rhosin for 24 h, followed by 10-min stimulation with 10(-7) M angiotensin II (Ang II). The cells were then harvested, and the total protein was extracted. The co-immunoprecipitation method, Western blot analysis, and MTT assay were performed to determine the LARG-RhoA interaction, the protein levels of RhoA and MYPT1, and cell viability, respectively. RESULTS: Y16 dose-dependently inhibited the LARG-RhoA complex formation induced by Ang II. With 50 muM of Y16, the effect of inhibition was statistically significant. Y16 also reduced the formation of phospho-MYPT1 stimulated by Ang II. With 5 muM of Y16, the inhibitory effect was statistically significant. When 25 muM of Y16 and 25 muM of Rhosin were combined, the inhibitory effect on LARG-RhoA interaction was statistically significant. When Y16 and Rhosin were combined, a significantly reduced concentration could effectively inhibit MYPT1 phosphorylation (2.5 muM compared with 5 muM for Y16 alone). CONCLUSION: Treating SHR VSMCs with Y16 can suppress the activation of LARG, prevent LARG binding to RhoA, and decrease the phosphorylation of MYPT1, thus weakening the activation of the calcium (Ca(2+)) sensitization pathway in SHR VSMCs.","['Chiu, Wei-Chiao', 'Chiang, Jiun-Yang', 'Chiang, Fu-Tien']","['Chiu WC', 'Chiang JY', 'Chiang FT']",,"['Graduate Institute of Physiology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Fu Jen Catholic University Hospital, New Taipei, Taiwan; Fu Jen Catholic University, Taiwan.

We retrospectively analyzed the TFR outcomes to identify the clinical efficacy of MR4.0/4.3 as the UMRD criterion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CML patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) between March 2001 and May 2015 for >3 years and treatment cessation for over 6 months were included. TFR was analyzed using MR3.0 loss and UMRD loss as criteria. TFR failure-free survival was defined as the time from cessation of TKI therapy to MR loss or restarting TKI, and overall survival as the time from TKI cessation to death. The probability of regaining the MR was evaluated. RESULTS: In the 93 participants, the median duration of follow-up and TKI therapy were 17.3 (3.9-92.0) months and 7.4 (3.1-16.9) years, respectively. TFR at 5 years was 47.9 % and 44.4 %, for MR3.0 loss and UMRD loss, respectively. Among the 42 patients who restarted TKI, 41 regained MR3.0 (97.6 %). In multivariate analysis, the time to UMRD was </=12 months, and the absence of prior TKI treatment (P = 0.018 and 0.044 in UMRD loss, respectively) was significantly correlated with TFR failure-free survival. CONCLUSION: Clinical outcomes were comparable to those of clinical trials. Our results suggest that the detection limit of MR4.3 can be used in clinical practice for TKI treatment cessation for TFR in CML patients.","['Park, Sungwoo', 'Choi, Eun-Ji', 'Lee, Hyewon', 'Jo, Deog-Yeon', 'Jung, Chul Won', 'Kong, Jee Hyun', 'Kim, Hawk']","['Park S', 'Choi EJ', 'Lee H', 'Jo DY', 'Jung CW', 'Kong JH', 'Kim H']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Gyeongsang National University Hospital, Gyeongsang National University College of Medicine, Jinju, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Hematology-Oncology Clinic, Center for Specific Organs, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chungnam National University College of Medicine, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Wonju Severance Christian Hospital, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology, Gachon University Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Republic of Korea.

Elevated levels of eIF4E, p-eIF4E and/or the MNK protein kinases have been found in many types of cancer, including solid tumors and leukemia. MNKs also play a role in metabolic disease. Regulation of the activities of MNKs (MNK1 and MNK2), control the phosphorylation of eIF4E, which in turn has a close relationship with the processes of tumor development, cell migration and invasion, and energy metabolism. MNK knock-out mice display no adverse effects on normal cells or phenotypes suggesting that MNK may be a potentially safe targets for the treatment of various cancers. Several MNK inhibitors or 'degraders' have been identified. Initially, some of the inhibitors were developed from natural products or based on other protein kinase inhibitors which inhibit multiple kinases. Subsequently, more potent and selective inhibitors for MNK1/2 have been designed and synthesized. Currently, three inhibitors (BAY1143269, eFT508 and ETC-206) are in various stages of clinical trials for the treatment of solid cancers or leukemia, either alone or combined with inhibitors of other protein kinase. In this review, we summarize the diverse MNK inhibitors that have been reported in patents and other literature, including those with activities in vitro and/or in vivo.","['Jin, Xin', 'Yu, Rilei', 'Wang, Xuemin', 'Proud, Christopher G', 'Jiang, Tao']","['Jin X', 'Yu R', 'Wang X', 'Proud CG', 'Jiang T']",,"['School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ocean University of China and Laboratory for Marine Drugs and Bioproducts, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao, China; College of Marine Life Sciences, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China.', 'School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ocean University of China and Laboratory for Marine Drugs and Bioproducts, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao, China.', 'Lifelong Health, South Australian Health & Medical Research Institute, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA5000, Australia; School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, 5005, Australia.', 'Lifelong Health, South Australian Health & Medical Research Institute, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA5000, Australia; School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, 5005, Australia.', 'School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ocean University of China and Laboratory for Marine Drugs and Bioproducts, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao, China.

We have previously reported that FPIES is associated with systemic innate immune activation in the absence of a detectable antigen-specific antibody or T-cell response. The mechanism of specific food recognition by the immune system remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to identify immune mechanisms underlying FPIES reactions by proteomic and flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood. METHODS: Children with a history of FPIES underwent supervised oral food challenge. Blood samples were taken at baseline, at symptom onset, and 4 hours after symptom onset. We analyzed samples from 23 children (11 reactors and 12 outgrown). A total of 184 protein markers were analyzed by proximity ligation assay and verified by multiplex immunoassay. Analysis of cell subset activation was performed by mass cytometry and spectral cytometry. RESULTS: Symptomatic FPIES challenge results were associated with significant elevation of levels of cytokines and chemokines, including IL-17 family markers (IL-17A, IL-22, IL-17C, and CCL20) and T-cell activation (IL-2), and innate inflammatory markers (IL-8, oncostatin M, leukemia inhibitory factor, TNF-alpha, IL-10, and IL-6). The level of the mucosal damage marker regenerating family member 1 alpha (REG1A) was also significantly increased. These biomarkers were not increased in asymptomatic challenges or IgE-mediated allergy. The level of phospho-STAT3 was significantly elevated in myeloid and T cells after challenge in individuals with symptoms. Mass cytometry indicated preferential activation of nonconventional T-cell populations, including gammadelta T cells and CD3(+)CD4(-)CD8(-)CD161(+) cells; however, the potential sources of IL-17 in PBMCs were primarily CD4(+) TH17 cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a unique IL-17 signature and activation of innate lymphocytes in FPIES.","['Berin, M Cecilia', 'Lozano-Ojalvo, Daniel', 'Agashe, Charuta', 'Baker, Mary Grace', 'Bird, J Andrew', 'Nowak-Wegrzyn, Anna']","['Berin MC', 'Lozano-Ojalvo D', 'Agashe C', 'Baker MG', 'Bird JA', 'Nowak-Wegrzyn A']",,"['Jaffe Food Allergy Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.

We present the case of a 45-year-old male with no relevant prior medical history presenting with 6 months of migratory nodules, 2 months of drenching night sweats, and a 20 pound weight loss. Physical examination showed firm subcutaneous nodules with overlying ecchymoses present on the right lateral thigh and left lower back. Biopsy of a nodule from the right thigh showed a subcutaneous lobular panniculitis involved by a dense infiltrate of neutrophils and granulocyte precursors. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) was positive for t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)BCR-ABL1 fusion. A concurrent hemogram revealed a white blood cell count elevation of 600,000 K/muL. Bone marrow biopsy examination showed marked myeloid expansion with an increase in granulocyte precursors and Philadelphia chromosome positivity by FISH, consistent with bone marrow involvement by CML.

In this study, we conducted a genome-wide association study in 466 all-age Chinese patients with Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 1,466 non-ALL controls to estimate the impact of age on ALL susceptibility in the Chinese population. Among the 17 reported loci, 8 have been validated in pediatric and 1 in adult patients. The strongest association signal was identified at ARID5B locus and gradually decreased with age, while the signal at GATA3 exhibited the opposite trend and significantly impact on adult patients. With genome-wide approaches, germline variants at 2q14.3 rank as the top inherited predisposition to adult patients (e.g., rs73956024, P = 4.3 x 10(-5)) and separate the genetic risk of pediatric vs. adult patients (P = 3.6 x 10(-6)), whereas variants at 15q25.3 (e.g., rs11638062) have a similar impact on patients in different age groups (overall P = 2.9 x 10(-7)).

Given that COMMD7 has been reported associated with tumor progression in various human solid cancers but rarely reported in AML, herein, RNA sequencing data from TCGA and GTEx were obtained for analysis of COMMD7 expression and differentially expressed gene (DEG). Furthermore, functional enrichment analysis of COMMD7-related DEGs was performed by GO/KEGG, GSEA, immune cell infiltration analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. In addition, the clinical significance of COMMD7 in AML was figured out by Kaplan-Meier Cox regression and prognostic nomogram model. R package was used to analyze incorporated studies. As a result, COMMD7 was highly expressed in various malignancies, including AML, compared with normal samples. Moreover, high expression of COMMD7 was associated with poor prognosis in 151 AML samples, as well as subgroups with age >60, NPM1 mutation-positive, FLT3 mutation-negative, and DNMT3A mutation-negative, et al. (P < 0.05). High COMMD7 was an independent prognostic factor in Cox regression analysis; Age and cytogenetics risk were included in the nomogram prognostic model. Furthermore, a total of 529 DEGs were identified between the high- and the low- expression group, of which 92 genes were up-regulated and 437 genes were down-regulated. Collectively, high expression of COMMD7 is a potential biomarker for adverse outcomes in AML. The DEGs and pathways recognized in the study provide a preliminary grasp of the underlying molecular mechanisms of AML carcinogenesis and progression.","['Li, Kongfei', 'Chen, Lieguang', 'Zhang, Hua', 'Wang, Lu', 'Sha, Keya', 'Du, Xiaohong', 'Li, Daiyang', 'Zheng, Zhongzheng', 'Pei, Renzhi', 'Lu, Ying', 'Tong, Hongyan']","['Li K', 'Chen L', 'Zhang H', 'Wang L', 'Sha K', 'Du X', 'Li D', 'Zheng Z', 'Pei R', 'Lu Y', 'Tong H']",,"[""Department of Hematology, People's Hospital Affiliated to Ningbo University, Ningbo 315000, China."", 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes Diagnosis and Therapy Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Zhejiang Provincial Key Lab of Hematopoietic Malignancy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', ""Department of Hematology, People's Hospital Affiliated to Ningbo University, Ningbo 315000, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Jinshan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai 201500, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes Diagnosis and Therapy Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Zhejiang Provincial Key Lab of Hematopoietic Malignancy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', ""Department of Hematology, People's Hospital Affiliated to Ningbo University, Ningbo 315000, China."", ""Department of Hematology, People's Hospital Affiliated to Ningbo University, Ningbo 315000, China."", 'Shanghai Tissuebank Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Shanghai 201318, China.', 'Shanghai Tissuebank Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Shanghai 201318, China.', ""Department of Hematology, People's Hospital Affiliated to Ningbo University, Ningbo 315000, China."", ""Department of Hematology, People's Hospital Affiliated to Ningbo University, Ningbo 315000, China."", 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes Diagnosis and Therapy Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Zhejiang Provincial Key Lab of Hematopoietic Malignancy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210423,United States,Aging (Albany NY),Aging,101508617,PMC8109082,['NOTNLM'],"['*COMMD7', '*R packages', '*The Cancer Genome Atlas', '*acute myeloid leukemia']",2021/04/24 06:00,2021/07/27 06:00,['2021/04/23 17:14'],"['2020/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/23 17:14 [entrez]']","['202901 [pii]', '10.18632/aging.202901 [doi]']",ppublish,Aging (Albany NY). 2021 Apr 23;13(8):11988-12006. doi: 10.18632/aging.202901.

Among patients with malignant diseases, those with hematologic neoplasms are at a higher risk for poor outcomes. The objective of this study was to register treatment modifications associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and their short-term consequences in Latin America. METHODS: Multicenter, prospective, observational, cohort study including patients older than 14 years from 14 centers in four countries (Mexico, Peru, Guatemala, and Panama) who had a confirmed diagnosis of acute leukemia, and who were undergoing active treatment since the first COVID-19 case in each country until the cutoff on July 15, 2020. RESULTS: We recruited 635 patients. Treatment modifications because of the COVID-19 pandemic were reported in 40.8% of cases. The main reason for such modifications was logistic issues (55.0%) and the most frequent modification was chemotherapy delay (42.0%). A total of 13.1% patients developed COVID-19 disease, with a mortality of 37.7%. Several factors were identified as independently associated with mortality, including a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (odds ratio 2.38 [95% CI, 1.47 to 3.84]; P < .001), while the use of telemedicine was identified as a protective factor (odds ratio 0.36 [95% CI, 0.18 to 0.82]; P = .014). CONCLUSION: These results highlight the collateral damage of COVID-19 in oncology patients.","['Demichelis-Gomez, Roberta', 'Alvarado-Ibarra, Martha', 'Vasquez-Chavez, Jule', 'Delgado-Lopez, Nancy',

However, the need for immediate diagnosis and access to specialized care and the cost associated with APL management can potentially act as barriers for disadvantaged patients. The influence of sociodemographic factors on the outcomes of patients with APL remains unclear. METHODS: The authors used the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program to characterize the impact of sociodemographic factors on survival in patients younger than 65 years with APL. RESULTS: The authors identified 1787 cases: 816 who were younger than 40 years and 971 who were 40 years old or older. Insured patients who were younger than 40 years had an improved 5-year overall survival (OS) rate in comparison with patients without insurance. Among patients who were 40 years or older, having insurance (other than Medicaid) was associated with better survival than being a Medicaid beneficiary or being uninsured, whereas patients with Medicaid had improved 5-year OS in comparison with uninsured patients. In a multivariate analysis of patients younger than 40 years, a higher risk of death was associated with being male, being diagnosed in earlier years, and being uninsured. For patients who were 40 years old or older, mortality increased with increasing age and for both Medicaid and uninsured patients in comparison with insured patients. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high cure rate experienced by patients with APL, patients younger than 65 years without insurance and those 40 years old or older with Medicaid are at a significant disadvantage in comparison with patients with insurance. These findings point to an opportunity to improve survival in APL by addressing access to care.","['Jamy, Omer H', 'Godby, Richard', 'Dhir, Aditi', 'Costa, Luciano J', 'Xavier, Ana C']","['Jamy OH', 'Godby R', 'Dhir A', 'Costa LJ', 'Xavier AC']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2411-4742', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5362-2469', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3659-3798']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's of Alabama, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama."", 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's of Alabama, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210423,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'health care disparity', 'insurance status', 'sociodemographic factors', 'survival']",2021/04/24 06:00,2021/04/24 06:00,['2021/04/23 12:37'],"['2020/11/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/23 12:37 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33593 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2021 Aug 15;127(16):2966-2973. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33593.

Thus, tools that may add to current diagnostic practices could aid in disease discrimination. Constitutive innate immune activation is a pathogenetic driver of ineffective hematopoiesis in MDS through Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)-inflammasome-induced pyroptotic cell death. Oxidized mitochondrial DNA (ox-mtDNA) is released upon cytolysis, acts as a danger signal, and triggers inflammasome oligomerization via DNA sensors. By using immortalized bone marrow cells from murine models of common MDS somatic gene mutations and MDS primary samples, we demonstrate that ox-mtDNA is released upon pyroptosis. ox-mtDNA was significantly increased in MDS peripheral blood (PB) plasma compared with the plasma of healthy donors, and it was significantly higher in lower-risk MDS vs higher-risk MDS, consistent with the greater pyroptotic cell fraction in lower-risk patients. Furthermore, ox-mtDNA was significantly higher in MDS PB plasma compared with all other hematologic malignancies studied, with the exception of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Receiver operating characteristic/area under the curve (ROC/AUC) analysis demonstrated that ox-mtDNA is a sensitive and specific biomarker for patients with MDS compared with healthy donors (AUC, 0.964), other hematologic malignancies excluding CLL (AUC, 0.893), and reactive conditions (AUC, 0.940). ox-mtDNA positively and significantly correlated with levels of known alarmins S100A9, S100A8, and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing caspase recruitment domain (CARD) specks, which provide an index of medullary pyroptosis. Collectively, these data indicate that quantifiable ox-mtDNA released into the extracellular space upon inflammasome activation serves as a biomarker for MDS and the magnitude of pyroptotic cell death.","['Ward, Grace A', 'McGraw, Kathy L', 'Abbas-Aghababazadeh, Farnoosh', 'Meyer, Benjamin S', 'McLemore, Amy F', 'Vincelette, Nicole D', 'Lam, Nghi B', 'Aldrich, Amy L', 'Al Ali, Najla H', 'Padron, Eric', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier', 'Masala, Erico', 'Santini, Valeria', 'Kosmider, Olivier', 'Fontenay, Michaela', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Johnson, Joseph', 'Fridley, Brooke L', 'List, Alan F']","['Ward GA', 'McGraw KL', 'Abbas-Aghababazadeh F', 'Meyer BS', 'McLemore AF', 'Vincelette ND', 'Lam NB', 'Aldrich AL', 'Al Ali NH', 'Padron E', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J', 'Masala E', 'Santini V', 'Kosmider O', 'Fontenay M', 'Fenaux P', 'Johnson J', 'Fridley BL', 'List AF']",,"['Cancer Biology PhD Program, University of South Florida and H.

There is limited information regarding the CRLF2 abnormalities and dominant-negative IKZF1 isoforms associated with surrogate markers of Jak2, ABL, and Ras signaling pathways. To assess this, we evaluated 24 Mexican children with B-ALL positive for recurrent gene fusions at diagnosis. We found CRLF2 rearrangements and/or overexpression, dominant-negative IKZF1 isoforms, and surrogate phosphorylated markers of signaling pathways coexisting with recurrent gene fusions. All the BCR-ABL1 patients expressed CRLF2 and were positive for pCrkl (ABL); most of them were also positive for pStat5 (Jak2/Stat5) and negative for pErk (Ras). TCF3-PBX1 patients with CRLF2 abnormalities were positive for pStat5, most of them were also positive for pCrkl, and two patients were also positive for pErk. One patient with ETV6-RUNX1 and intracellular CRLF2 protein expressed pCrkl. In some cases, the activated signaling pathways were reverted in vitro by specific inhibitors. We further analyzed a TCF3-PBX1 patient at relapse, identifying a clone with the recurrent gene fusion, P2RY8-CRLF2, rearrangement, and phosphorylation of the three surrogate markers that we studied. These results agree with the previous reports regarding resistance to treatment observed in patients with recurrent gene fusions and coexisting CRLF2 gene abnormalities. A marker phosphorylation signature was identified in BCR-ABL1 and TCF3-PBX1 patients. To obtain useful information for the assessment of treatment in B-ALL patients with recurrent gene fusions, we suggest that they should be evaluated at diagnosis for CRLF2 gene abnormalities and dominant-negative IKZF1 isoforms, in addition to the analyses of activation and inhibition of signaling pathways.","['Moreno Lorenzana, Dafne', 'Juarez Velazquez, Maria Del Rocio', 'Reyes Leon, Adriana', 'Martinez Anaya, Daniel', 'Hernandez Monterde, Adrian', 'Salas Labadia, Consuelo', 'Navarrete Meneses, Maria Del Pilar', 'Zapata Tarres, Marta', 'Juarez Villegas, Luis', 'Jarquin Ramirez, Berenice', 'Cardenas Cardos, Rocio', 'Herrera Almanza, Martha', 'Paredes Aguilera, Rogelio', 'Perez Vera, Patricia']","['Moreno Lorenzana D', 'Juarez Velazquez MDR', 'Reyes Leon A', 'Martinez Anaya D', 'Hernandez Monterde A', 'Salas Labadia C', 'Navarrete Meneses MDP', 'Zapata Tarres M', 'Juarez Villegas L', 'Jarquin Ramirez B', 'Cardenas Cardos R', 'Herrera Almanza M', 'Paredes Aguilera R', 'Perez Vera P']",,"['Laboratorio de Genetica y Cancer, Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Catedra CONACYT-Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Genetica y Cancer, Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Genetica y Cancer, Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Genetica y Cancer, Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Posgrado en Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Genetica y Cancer, Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Genetica y Cancer, Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Genetica y Cancer, Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Oncologia, Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hemato-Oncologia, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Especialidad en Citogenetica Humana, Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Oncologia, Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Genetica y Cancer, Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Becaria de la Direccion General de Calidad y Educacion en Salud, Secretaria de Salud Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Genetica y Cancer, Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Catedras CONACYT 2038 (DML)/Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia', 'PDCPN-2014/248591 (PPV), scholarship 816116 (DMA)/Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y', 'Tecnologia', 'Project INP-2016/019/Recursos Fiscales Instituto Nacional de Pediatria']",['Journal Article'],20210423,England,J Pathol Clin Res,The journal of pathology.

Based on this, the Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell'Adulto (GIMEMA) has recently developed a digital health tool dedicated to patients with hematologic malignancies: the GIMEMA-ALLIANCE platform. OBJECTIVE: The main objectives of this web-based platform are to generate relevant data to better understand quality of life, symptoms, and medication adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic and postpandemic era; to develop a prospective real-life registry on outcomes of patients with hematologic cancer, with or without a diagnosis of COVID-19; and to facilitate patient-centered care in routine practice. METHODS: The platform consists of physician- and patient-secure portals and enables electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) assessments with real-time graphical presentation to physicians of individual patient symptoms and quality-of-life outcomes. Automated alerts are sent to treating hematologists based on the following predetermined criteria: presence of clinically important problems and symptoms, problems with adherence to therapy, and risk of COVID-19 diagnosis. The platform also allows physicians to set up video consultations. Clinical information regarding disease and treatment as well as clinical and survival outcomes are also prospectively collected. RESULTS: Recruitment of participants started in December 2020. As of April 2021, a total of 116 patients have been enrolled in this study. Use of this platform may help to improve patient-physician communication and help hematologists in the early recognition of clinically important problems and symptoms of their patients. More than 20 community and university-based hospitals have currently agreed to participate. In addition to patient-reported outcome data, the prospective collection of disease- and treatment-related information, as well as data on possible COVID-19 diagnosis and COVID-19 vaccination, will allow the development of a large database to also identify subgroups of patients at risk of poor outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Data generated via this platform will help to answer clinically relevant questions for patients with hematologic malignancies during the COVID-19 pandemic and postpandemic era. The use of the GIMEMA-ALLIANCE platform in routine practice may also contribute to enhancing patient-centered care.

METHODS: Participants were between 30 and 65 years old and were family caregivers of a living patient with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or lymphoma. We conducted semi-structured interviews with parent caregivers (n = 20) and adult-child caregivers (n = 19) and a thematic analysis of the interview data. RESULTS: Both types of caregivers report the patient experiencing (1) mis- and missed diagnosis (facing delayed diagnosis or treatment and having symptoms dismissed or overlooked) and (2) emotional distress (being in shock and survival mode, struggling with uncertainty, and confronting mortality). Adult-child caregivers also experienced relational shifts in assuming control of their parent's care, sometimes despite geographic distance, and struggled to distribute the care burden among family members. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Differences between the caregivers' experiences emerged based on the relational role and the patient's place in the lifespan. Findings can be used to inform the development of support resources to address the needs of each group.","['Kastrinos, Amanda L', 'Fisher, Carla L', 'Mullis, Michaela D', 'Wollney, Easton', 'Sae-Hau, Maria', 'Weiss, Elisa S', 'Bylund, Carma L']","['Kastrinos AL', 'Fisher CL', 'Mullis MD', 'Wollney E', 'Sae-Hau M', 'Weiss ES', 'Bylund CL']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8571-355X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9335-1496']","['College of Journalism and Communications, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', 'College of Journalism & Communications, UF Health Cancer Center, UF Health Center for Arts in Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', 'College of Journalism and Communications, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', 'College of Journalism and Communications, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', 'The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Rye Brook, NY.', 'The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Rye Brook, NY.', 'College of Journalism & Communications, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210423,England,Palliat Support Care,Palliative & supportive care,101232529,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Diagnosis', 'Family caregivers', 'Hematological malignancy', 'Lifespan', 'Oncology']",2021/04/24 06:00,2021/04/24 06:00,['2021/04/23 08:41'],"['2021/04/23 08:41 [entrez]', '2021/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1017/S1478951521000389 [doi]', 'S1478951521000389 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Palliat Support Care. 2021 Apr 23:1-8. doi: 10.1017/S1478951521000389.,,,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data are limited on the incidence and nature of these disorders during intensive therapy. This study's objective was to provide a cross-sectional description of MSK impairments in this population. PROCEDURE: Children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (rALL), or undergoing HSCT were systematically assessed for MSK impairments as part of Children's Oncology Group study ACCL0934. Assessments occurred at study entry, at 2 months, and at 12 months and included evaluation for signs or symptoms of MSK impairment and the type, site, and diagnosis. RESULTS: Six hundred three patients were included. MSK signs or symptoms were present in 48 (8.0%) children at study entry, 64 (13.5%) children at 2 months, and 40 (11.6%) children at 12 months. Arthralgia and/or gait abnormalities were the most common impairments; the knee was the most common site. Arthritis and tendonitis were both rare. Vincristine neuropathy, MSK impacts from central nervous system pathology, and bone or joint pain from underlying cancer were the most common diagnoses. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that having rALL (odds ratio [OR] 2.00, 95% CI 1.07-3.76, p = .03) or obesity (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.12-3.95, p = .02) were risk factors for MSK impairment at study entry. CONCLUSIONS: MSK impairments are common in this intensively treated patient population, especially in those with rALL and those who are obese.","['Thompson, Joel', 'Fisher, Brian', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Dvorak, Christopher', 'Dang, Ha', 'Lo, Tammy', 'Alexander, Sarah']","['Thompson J', 'Fisher B', 'Sung L', 'Dvorak C', 'Dang H', 'Lo T', 'Alexander S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6146-3952', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9695-1702']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology/BMT, Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, Kansas City, Missouri, USA."", ""Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'Child Health Evaluation Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Pediatric Allergy, Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplant, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA.', 'Department of Research and Evaluation, Kaiser Permanente, Pasadena, California, USA.', 'Division of Hematology Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['UG1 CA189955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA095861/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20210423,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,['NOTNLM'],"['*impairment', '*leukemia', '*musculoskeletal']",2021/04/24 06:00,2021/04/24 06:00,['2021/04/23 06:50'],"['2021/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2021/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/23 06:50 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.29053 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Aug;68(8):e29053. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29053.

Patient management including therapies and response together with clinical progress was obtained from medical records and laboratory information systems. Prior to CML diagnosis, all five had a preceding diagnosis of CLL. Three had received prior fludarabine. All received tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). None required subsequent therapy for CLL. One patient had 17p deletion CLL and another patient had normal CLL cytogenetics. All currently have satisfactory blood counts with quantitative polymerase chain reaction for CML showing molecular response. All remain alive. Thus, such cases can be successfully managed by treating each haematological disorder in the usual manner. The control achieved in CML with the TKI enables satisfactory marrow function to recover in patients with concomitant CLL. The role for allograft in patients with dual malignancies is uncertain and needs to be individualised depending on control of each malignancy.","['Armarego, Michael', 'Gottlieb, David', 'Dunlop, Lindsay', 'Cooney, Julian P']","['Armarego M', 'Gottlieb D', 'Dunlop L', 'Cooney JP']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4820-6406'],"['School of Medicine, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.', 'Westmead Hospital Sydney, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Liverpool Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Fiona Stanley Hospital, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', 'Medical School, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'CML', 'combined malignancies']",2021/04/24 06:00,2021/06/01 06:00,['2021/04/23 06:49'],"['2020/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/23 06:49 [entrez]', '2021/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imj.15271 [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med J. 2021 Apr;51(4):580-584. doi: 10.1111/imj.15271.,20210531,,IM,"['Australia', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/therapy', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics']",['(c) 2021 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Increasing data support the use of molecular data to refine the diagnostic approach to persistent monocytosis. The absence of a TET2, SRSF2, or ASXL1 mutation has >/= 90% negative predictive value for a diagnosis of CMML. These data may also reliably differentiate chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, the malignancy that is most associated with mature monocytosis, from several other diseases that can be associated with typically a lesser degree of monocytosis. These include acute myelomonocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia with monocytic differentiation, myelodysplastic syndromes, and myeloproliferative neoplasms driven by BCR-ABL1, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGFR1 rearrangements or PCM1-JAK2 fusions among other rarer aberrations. The combination of monocyte partitioning with molecular data in patients with persistent monocytosis may increase the predictive power for the ultimate development of CMM but has not been prospectively validated. Many conditions, both benign and malignant, can be associated with an increase in mature circulating monocytes. After reasonably excluding a secondary or reactive monocytosis, there should be a concern for and investigation of malignant monocytosis, which includes hematopathologic review of blood and marrow tissues, flow cytometric analysis, and cytogenetic and molecular studies to arrive at an appropriate diagnosis.","['Shallis, Rory M', 'Siddon, Alexa J', 'Zeidan, Amer M']","['Shallis RM', 'Siddon AJ', 'Zeidan AM']",,"['Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine and Yale Cancer Center, 333 Cedar Street, PO Box 208028, New Haven, CT, 06520-8028, USA.', 'Departments of Laboratory Medicine & Pathology, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine and Yale Cancer Center, 333 Cedar Street, PO Box 208028, New Haven, CT, 06520-8028, USA. amer.zeidan@yale.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210422,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CMML', '*Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', '*MDS/MPN', '*Malignant', '*Monocytes', '*Monocytosis']",2021/04/24 06:00,2021/08/31 06:00,['2021/04/23 06:42'],"['2021/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/31 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/23 06:42 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-021-00632-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-021-00632-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2021 Jun;16(3):276-285. doi: 10.1007/s11899-021-00632-6.

Aberrant expression of CD56 has been observed on myeloid leukemic blasts in DS patients. In general, CD56 expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is considered a promoter of leukemogenesis. We did a retrospective flow cytometric study to investigate mature myelomonocytic cell CD56 expression patterns in TAM, non-TAM, and leukemia cases with DS. Flow cytometric analysis showed that granulocyte and monocyte aberrant/dysplastic CD56 expression is an inherent characteristic of most DS patients irrespective of the presence of TAM or leukemia. Increased CD56 expression in monocyte and granulocyte populations in DS could be multifactorial; greater expression of RUNX1 secondary to the gene dose effect of trisomy 21 along with the maturational state of the cells are the potential contributors. Unlike AML seen in non-DS patients, CD56 overexpression in DS AML cases does not appear to play a role in leukemogenesis.","['Gadgeel, Manisha', 'AlQanber, Batool', 'Buck, Steven', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Ravindranath, Yaddanapudi', 'Savasan, Sureyya']","['Gadgeel M', 'AlQanber B', 'Buck S', 'Taub JW', 'Ravindranath Y', 'Savasan S']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8366-9487', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0828-2471', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5015-0187', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2228-3235', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9577-9624']","[""Children's Hospital of Michigan, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Hematology/Oncology Flow Cytometry Laboratory, Detroit, MI, USA."", ""Children's Hospital of Michigan, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Hematology/Oncology Flow Cytometry Laboratory, Detroit, MI, USA."", ""Children's Hospital of Michigan, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Hematology/Oncology Flow Cytometry Laboratory, Detroit, MI, USA."", ""Children's Hospital of Michigan, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Center, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA."", ""Children's Hospital of Michigan, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Hematology/Oncology Flow Cytometry Laboratory, Detroit, MI, USA."", ""Children's Hospital of Michigan, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Center, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA."", ""Children's Hospital of Michigan, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Hematology/Oncology Flow Cytometry Laboratory, Detroit, MI, USA. savas1s@cmich.edu."", ""Children's Hospital of Michigan, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Center, Central Michigan University College of Medicine, 3901 Beaubien Blvd., Detroit, MI, 48201, USA. savas1s@cmich.edu.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210423,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,['NOTNLM'],"['Aberrant CD56 expression', 'Down syndrome', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Neural adhesion molecule 1', 'Transient abnormal myelopoiesis']",2021/04/24 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2021/04/23 06:40'],"['2021/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/23 06:40 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-021-04531-x [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-021-04531-x [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2021 Jul;100(7):1695-1700. doi: 10.1007/s00277-021-04531-x.

AMKL is characterized by high proliferation of megakaryoblasts and myelofibrosis of bone marrow, this disease is also associated with poor prognosis. Previous analyses have reported that the human megakaryoblastic cells can be differentiated into cells with megakaryocyte (MK)-like characteristics by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). However, little is known about the mechanism responsible for regulating this differentiation process. We performed long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) profiling to investigate the differently expressed lncRNAs in megakaryocyte blast cells treated with and without PMA and examined those that may be responsible for the PMA-induced differentiation of megakaryoblasts into MKs. We found 30 out of 90 lncRNA signatures to be differentially expressed after PMA treatment of megakaryoblast cells, including the highly expressed JPX lncRNA. Further, in silico lncRNA-miRNA and miRNA-mRNA interaction analysis revealed that the JPX is likely involved in unblocking the expression of TGF-beta receptor (TGF-betaR) by sponging oncogenic miRNAs (miR-9-5p, miR-17-5p, and miR-106-5p) during MK differentiation. Further, we report the activation of TGF-betaR-induced non-canonical ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways during PMA-induced MK differentiation and ploidy development. The present study demonstrates that TGF-betaR-induced non-canonical ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways are associated with PMA-induced MK differentiation and ploidy development; in this molecular mechanism, JPX lncRNA could act as a decoy for miR-9-5p, miR-17-5p, and miR-106-5p, titrating them away from TGF-betaR mRNAs. Importantly, this study reveals the activation of ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathway in PMA-induced Dami cell differentiation into MK. The identified differentially expressed lncRNA signatures may facilitate further study of the detailed molecular mechanisms associated with MK development. Thus, our data provide numerous targets with therapeutic potential for the modulation of the differentiation of megakaryoblastic cells in AMKL.","['Dahariya, Swati', 'Raghuwanshi, Sanjeev', 'Sangeeth, Anjali', 'Malleswarapu, Mahesh', 'Kandi, Ravinder', 'Gutti, Ravi Kumar']","['Dahariya S', 'Raghuwanshi S', 'Sangeeth A', 'Malleswarapu M', 'Kandi R', 'Gutti RK']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0912-5796'],"['Department of Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Gachibowli, Hyderabad, TS, 500046, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Gachibowli, Hyderabad, TS, 500046, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Gachibowli, Hyderabad, TS, 500046, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Gachibowli, Hyderabad, TS, 500046, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Gachibowli, Hyderabad, TS, 500046, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Gachibowli, Hyderabad, TS, 500046, India. guttiravi@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['27(0343)/19/EMR-II/Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India', 'EEQ/2018/00853/Science and Engineering Research Board', 'F.5-12/2016/DRS-I (SAP-II)/University Grants Commission', 'BUILDER/Department of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology']",['Journal Article'],20210423,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT', 'ERK1/2', 'Leukemia', 'LncRNA', 'Megakaryocyte', 'PI3K', 'PMA', 'TGF-betaR', 'miRNA']",2021/04/24 06:00,2021/11/18 06:00,['2021/04/23 06:39'],"['2020/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/18 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/23 06:39 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00262-021-02937-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00262-021-02937-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2021 Dec;70(12):3477-3488. doi: 10.1007/s00262-021-02937-0.

THZ1, a covalent cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) inhibitor, shows anti-tumor effects in various cancers by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. However, whether THZ1 has an inhibitory effect on B-ALL cells and the underlying mechanism remains obscure. In this study, we showed that THZ1 arrested the cell cycle of B-ALL cells in vitro in a low concentration, while inducing the apoptosis of B-ALL cells in vitro in a high concentration by activating the apoptotic pathways. In addition, RNA-SEQ results revealed that THZ1 disrupted the cellular metabolic pathways of B-ALL cells. Moreover, THZ1 suppressed the cellular metabolism and blocked the production of cellular metabolic intermediates in B-ALL cells. Mechanistically, THZ1 inhibited the cellular metabolism of B-ALL by downregulating the expression of c-MYC-mediated metabolic enzymes. However, THZ1 treatment enhanced cell apoptosis in over-expressed c-MYC B-ALL cells, which was involved in the upregulation of p53 expression. Collectively, our data demonstrated that CDK7 inhibitor THZ1 induced the apoptosis of B-ALL cells by perturbing c-MYC-mediated cellular metabolism, thereby providing a novel treatment option for

Like CD19, CD22 is broadly expressed by B-lineage cells and thus serves as an alternative immunotherapy target in ALL. Here we present the composite outcomes of two pilot clinical trials ( NCT02588456 and NCT02650414 ) of T cells bearing a 4-1BB-based, CD22-targeting CAR in patients with relapsed or refractory ALL. The primary end point of these studies was to assess safety, and the secondary end point was antileukemic efficacy. We observed unexpectedly low response rates, prompting us to perform detailed interrogation of the responsible CAR biology. We found that shortening of the amino acid linker connecting the variable heavy and light chains of the CAR antigen-binding domain drove receptor homodimerization and antigen-independent signaling. In contrast to CD28-based CARs, autonomously signaling 4-1BB-based CARs demonstrated enhanced immune synapse formation, activation of pro-inflammatory genes and superior effector function. We validated this association between autonomous signaling and enhanced function in several CAR constructs and, on the basis of these observations, designed a new short-linker CD22 single-chain variable fragment for clinical evaluation. Our findings both suggest that tonic 4-1BB-based signaling is beneficial to CAR function and demonstrate the utility of bedside-to-bench-to-bedside translation in the design and implementation of CAR T cell therapies.","['Singh, Nathan', 'Frey, Noelle V', 'Engels, Boris', 'Barrett, David M', 'Shestova, Olga', 'Ravikumar, Pranali', 'Cummins, Katherine D', 'Lee, Yong Gu', 'Pajarillo, Raymone',

However, the mechanism of EMI remains indistinct. Clinical trials showed that increased miR-29s were associated with a poor overall survival in AML [14]. Nevertheless, they were proved to work as tumor suppressor genes by encouraging apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation in vitro. These contradictory results led us to the hypothesis that miR-29s may play a notable role in the prognosis of AML rather than leukemogenesis. Thus, we explored the specimens of AML patients and addressed this issue into miR-29c&b2 knockout mice. As a result, a poor overall survival and invasive blast cells were observed in high miR-29c&b2-expression patients, and the wildtype mice presented a shorter survival with heavier leukemia infiltration in extramedullary organs. Subsequently, we found that the miR-29c&b2 inside leukemia cells promoted EMI, but not the one in the microenvironment. The analysis of signal pathway revealed that miR-29c&b2 could target HMG-box transcription factor 1 (Hbp1) directly, then reduced Hbp1 bound to the promoter of non-muscle myosin IIB (Myh10) as a transcript inhibitor. Thus, increased Myh10 encouraged the migration of leukemia cells. Accordingly, AML patients with EMI were confirmed to have high miR-29c&b2 and MYH10 with low HBP1. Therefore, we identify that miR-29c&b2 contribute to the poor prognosis of AML patients by promoting EMI, and related genes analyses are prospectively feasible in assessment of AML outcome.","['Wei, Yanyu', 'Lu, Wei', 'Yu, Yehua', 'Zhai, Yuanmei', 'Guo, Hezhou', 'Yang, Shaoxin', 'Zhao, Chong', 'Zhang, Yanjie', 'Liu, Jiali', 'Liu, Yuhui', 'Fei, Jian', 'Shi, Jun']","['Wei Y', 'Lu W', 'Yu Y', 'Zhai Y', 'Guo H', 'Yang S', 'Zhao C', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu J', 'Liu Y', 'Fei J', 'Shi J']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5127-0321', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5952-8948', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7755-0818', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0780-5242']","[""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Tongren Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", 'School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.', 'School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China. jfei@tongji.edu.cn.', 'Shanghai Engineering Research Center for Model Organisms, SMOC, Shanghai, China. jfei@tongji.edu.cn.', ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. junshi@sjtu.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210422,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,,,2021/04/24 06:00,2022/01/13 06:00,['2021/04/23 06:17'],"['2020/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/03/11 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/23 06:17 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-021-01775-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-021-01775-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2021 May;40(19):3434-3448. doi: 10.1038/s41388-021-01775-9.

Our previous study has demonstrated that LIF mRNA is dysregulated in the peripheral nerve segments after nerve injury. Here, we show that LIF protein is abundantly expressed in Schwann cells after rat sciatic nerve injury. Functionally, suppressed or elevated LIF increases or decreases the proliferation rate and migration ability of Schwann cells, respectively. Morphological observations demonstrate that in vivo application of siRNA against LIF after peripheral nerve injury promotes Schwann cell migration and proliferation, axon elongation, and myelin formation. Electrophysiological and behavior assessments disclose that knockdown of LIF benefits the function recovery of injured peripheral nerves. Differentially expressed LIF affects the metabolism of Schwann cells and negatively regulates ERFE (Erythroferrone). Collectively, our observations reveal the essential roles for LIF in regulating the proliferation and migration of Schwann cells and the regeneration of injured peripheral nerves, discover ERFE as a downstream effector of LIF, and extend our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying peripheral nerve regeneration.","['Chen, Qianqian', 'Liu, Qianyan', 'Zhang, Yunsong', 'Li, Shiying', 'Yi, Sheng']","['Chen Q', 'Liu Q', 'Zhang Y', 'Li S', 'Yi S']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2818-8511', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1316-3370']","['NMPA Key Laboratory for Research and Evaluation of Tissue Engineering Technology Products, Key Laboratory of Neuroregeneration of Jiangsu and Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, 226001, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology and MOE Key Laboratory of Model Animal for Disease Study, Model Animal Research Center, Nanjing Biomedical Research Institute, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'NMPA Key Laboratory for Research and Evaluation of Tissue Engineering Technology Products, Key Laboratory of Neuroregeneration of Jiangsu and Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, 226001, China.', 'NMPA Key Laboratory for Research and Evaluation of Tissue Engineering Technology Products, Key Laboratory of Neuroregeneration of Jiangsu and Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, 226001, China.', 'NMPA Key Laboratory for Research and Evaluation of Tissue Engineering Technology Products, Key Laboratory of Neuroregeneration of Jiangsu and Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, 226001, China.', 'NMPA Key Laboratory for Research and Evaluation of Tissue Engineering Technology Products, Key Laboratory of Neuroregeneration of Jiangsu and Ministry of Education, Co-innovation Center of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, 226001, China. syi@ntu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210422,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,PMC8062678,,,2021/04/24 06:00,2021/10/16 06:00,['2021/04/23 05:47'],"['2021/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/23 05:47 [entrez]', '2021/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-021-03706-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-021-03706-8 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2021 Apr 22;12(5):417. doi: 10.1038/s41419-021-03706-8.,20211015,['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Nerve Regeneration/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Schwann Cells/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The average time interval from KT to AML development is 5 years. We present the case of a 61-year-old man who was found to have peripheral blood blasts on a postoperative day 20 routine blood draw after an uneventful unrelated living donor kidney transplant. He subsequently had a bone marrow biopsy and next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based molecular testing, which demonstrated AML characterized by SMC1A and TET2 mutations. He received induction chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from the kidney donor, who happened to be matched at one haplotype. At 12 months after his HCT and 15 months after his KT, his AML remained in remission, normal renal function was preserved, no active graft-versus-host disease was present, and immunosuppression was tapering. With full donor-derived hematopoietic chimerism, we expect to be able to discontinue immunosuppression shortly, thereby achieving tolerance. The short time interval between KT and development of AML suggests the malignancy was likely present before KT. Modern NGS-based analysis offers a promising method of identifying transplant candidates with unexplained hematologic abnormalities on pre-KT testing who may benefit from formal hematologic evaluation.","['Yu, Jielin', 'Sherburne, Bradford', 'Chen, Yi-Bin', 'Kutzler, Heather L', 'Tremaglio, Joseph', 'Rochon, Caroline', 'Sheiner, Patricia', 'Serrano, Oscar K']","['Yu J', 'Sherburne B', 'Chen YB', 'Kutzler HL', 'Tremaglio J', 'Rochon C', 'Sheiner P', 'Serrano OK']",,"['Department of Surgery, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut.', 'Transfusion Medicine, Clinical Laboratory, Hartford Hospital, Hartford, Connecticut; Hartford Hospital Transplant and Comprehensive Liver Center, Hartford, Connecticut.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts; Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Hartford Hospital Transplant and Comprehensive Liver Center, Hartford, Connecticut.', 'Hartford Hospital Transplant and Comprehensive Liver Center, Hartford, Connecticut.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut; Hartford Hospital Transplant and Comprehensive Liver Center, Hartford, Connecticut.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut; Hartford Hospital Transplant and Comprehensive Liver Center, Hartford, Connecticut.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut; Hartford Hospital Transplant and Comprehensive Liver Center, Hartford, Connecticut.

However, the functional and molecular mechanisms of ARV-825 in T-ALL remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and potential mechanism of ARV-825 in T-ALL. METHODS: Expression of the BRD4 were determined in pediatric T-ALL samples and differential gene expression after ARV-825 treatment was explored by RNA-seq and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. T-ALL cell viability was measured by CCK8 assay after ARV-825 administration. Cell cycle was analyzed by propidium iodide (PI) staining and apoptosis was assessed by Annexin V/PI staining. BRD4, BRD3 and BRD2 proteins were detected by western blot in cells treated with ARV-825. The effect of ARV-825 on T-ALL cells was analyzed in vivo. The functional and molecular pathways involved in ARV-825 treatment of T-ALL were verified by western blot and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). RESULTS: BRD4 expression was higher in pediatric T-ALL samples compared with T-cells from healthy donors. High BRD4 expression indicated a poor outcome. ARV-825 suppressed cell proliferation in vitro by arresting the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis, with elevated poly-ADP ribose polymerase and cleaved caspase 3. BRD4, BRD3, and BRD2 were degraded in line with reduced cereblon expression in T-ALL cells. ARV-825 had a lower IC50 in T-ALL cells compared with JQ1, dBET1 and OTX015. ARV-825 perturbed the H3K27Ac-Myc pathway and reduced c-Myc protein levels in T-ALL cells according to RNA-seq and ChIP. In the T-ALL xenograft model, ARV-825 significantly reduced tumor growth and led to the dysregulation of Ki67 and cleaved caspase 3. Moreover, ARV-825 inhibited cell proliferation by depleting BET and c-Myc proteins in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: BRD4 indicates a poor prognosis in T-ALL. The BRD4 degrader ARV-825 can effectively suppress the proliferation and promote apoptosis of T-ALL cells via BET protein depletion and c-Myc inhibition, thus providing a new strategy for the treatment of T-ALL.","['Wu, Shuiyan', 'Jiang, You', 'Hong, Yi', 'Chu, Xinran', 'Zhang, Zimu', 'Tao, Yanfang', 'Fan, Ziwei', 'Bai, Zhenjiang', 'Li, Xiaolu', 'Chen, Yanling', 'Li, Zhiheng', 'Ding, Xin', 'Lv, Haitao', 'Du, Xiaoli', 'Lim, Su Lin', 'Zhang, Yongping', 'Huang, Saihu', 'Lu, Jun', 'Pan, Jian', 'Hu, Shaoyan']","['Wu S', 'Jiang Y', 'Hong Y', 'Chu X', 'Zhang Z', 'Tao Y', 'Fan Z', 'Bai Z', 'Li X', 'Chen Y', 'Li Z', 'Ding X', 'Lv H', 'Du X', 'Lim SL', 'Zhang Y', 'Huang S', 'Lu J', 'Pan J', 'Hu S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0292-5141'],"[""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, No.92 Zhongnan Street, SIP, Suzhou, 215003, Jiangsu, China."", ""Intensive Care Unit, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, 215003, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, No.92 Zhongnan Street, SIP, Suzhou, 215003, Jiangsu, China."", ""Intensive Care Unit, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, 215003, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Changshu Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Suzhou, 215506, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, No.92 Zhongnan Street, SIP, Suzhou, 215003, Jiangsu, China."", ""Institute of Pediatric Research, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, No.92 Zhongnan Street, SIP, Suzhou, 215003, China."", ""Institute of Pediatric Research, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, No.92 Zhongnan Street, SIP, Suzhou, 215003, China."", ""Intensive Care Unit, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, 215003, China."", ""Intensive Care Unit, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, 215003, China."", ""Institute of Pediatric Research, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, No.92 Zhongnan Street, SIP, Suzhou, 215003, China."", ""Institute of Pediatric Research, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, No.92 Zhongnan Street, SIP, Suzhou, 215003, China."", ""Institute of Pediatric Research, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, No.92 Zhongnan Street, SIP, Suzhou, 215003, China."", ""Department of Neonatology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, 215003, China."", ""Department of Cardiology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, 215003, China."", ""Division of Human Genetics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA."", ""Department of Internal Medicine, Saint Michael's Medical Center, Newark, NJ, 07102, USA."", ""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, No.92 Zhongnan Street, SIP, Suzhou, 215003, Jiangsu, China."", ""Intensive Care Unit, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, 215003, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, No.92 Zhongnan Street, SIP, Suzhou, 215003, Jiangsu, China."", ""Institute of Pediatric Research, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, No.92 Zhongnan Street, SIP, Suzhou, 215003, China. panjian2008@163.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, No.92 Zhongnan Street, SIP, Suzhou, 215003, Jiangsu, China. hsy139@126.com.""]",['eng'],"['82072767/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81770145/Innovative Research Group Project of the National Natural Science', 'Foundation of China (CN)']",['Journal Article'],20210422,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,PMC8061034,['NOTNLM'],"['ARV-825', 'BRD4', 'C-Myc', 'Pediatric', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",2021/04/24 06:00,2021/04/24 06:01,['2021/04/23 05:32'],"['2020/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/23 05:32 [entrez]', '2021/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-021-01908-w [doi]', '10.1186/s12935-021-01908-w [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2021 Apr 22;21(1):230. doi: 10.1186/s12935-021-01908-w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of dasatinib and nilotinib for newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia patients. METHODS: A decision tree model was developed linking clinical effectiveness (defined as major molecular response) and/or complete cytogenetic response, utility, and cost data over a 12-month period. Patients are recruited from Qatar Cancer Registry. The probability of primary clinical outcome is calculated from DASISION (dasatinib) and ENESTnd (nilotinib) trials. Direct healthcare costs were derived from the national healthcare payer system, whereas adverse effects data were derived from local incident reporting system. RESULTS: In the first-line treatments of chronic myeloid leukemia patients, nilotinib has greater major molecular response (39% nilotinib vs 12% dasatinib) and complete cytogenetic response (24% nilotinib vs 16% dastinib) response outcomes, and more adverse effects than dasatinib (13.3% vs 4%). Moreover, nilotinib is more cost-effective with annual costs (USD63,589.59) and after 12 months of follow-up. Despite the lower acquisition annual cost of dasatinib (USD59,486.30), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of nilotinib (vs dasatinib) per major molecular response/complete cytogenetic response achieved was USD15,481.10 per year. There were no cases in both arms that progressed to accelerated or blast phase. At a threshold of 3 times gross domestic product per capita of Qatar and according to World Health Organization recommendation, the nilotinib use is still cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Upfront therapy of chronic myeloid leukemia-chronic phase patients by nilotinib plan appears to be more cost-effective than dasatinib.","['Adel, Ahmad', 'Abushanab, Dina', 'Hamad, Anas', 'Abdulla, Mohammad', 'Izham, Mohamed', 'Yassin, Mohamed']","['Adel A', 'Abushanab D', 'Hamad A', 'Abdulla M', 'Izham M', 'Yassin M']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1144-8076'],"['Pharmacy Department, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, HMC, Doha, Qatar.', 'Pharmacy Department, Women Wellness and Research Center, HMC, Doha, Qatar.', 'Pharmacy Department, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, HMC, Doha, Qatar.', 'Hematology Department, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, HMC, Doha, Qatar.', 'College of Pharmacy, QU Health, 61780Qatar University, Doha, Qatar.', 'Hematology Department, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, HMC, Doha, Qatar.', 'College of Medicine, 61780Qatar University, Doha, Qatar.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Cancer Control,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,9438457,PMC8204580,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'dasatinib', 'leukemia', 'nilotinib', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2021/04/24 06:00,2021/11/05 06:00,['2021/04/23 05:26'],"['2021/04/23 05:26 [entrez]', '2021/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/10732748211001796 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Control. 2021 Jan-Dec;28:10732748211001796. doi: 10.1177/10732748211001796.,20211104,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*economics/*therapeutic use', '*Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Dasatinib/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*economics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Qatar', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to evaluate incidence, clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of pediatric APL in Korea. Materials and Methods: Seventy-nine pediatric APL patients diagnosed from January 2009 to December 2016 in 16 tertiary medical centers in Korea were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Of 801 acute myeloid leukemia children, 79 (9.9%) were diagnosed with APL. The median age at diagnosis was 10.6 years (range, 1.3 to 18.0). Male and female ratio was 1:0.93. Thirty patients (38.0%) had white blood cell (WBC) count greater than 10x109/L at diagnosis. All patients received induction therapy consisting of all-trans retinoic acid and chemotherapy. Five patients (6.6%) died during induction chemotherapy and 66 patients (86.8%) achieved complete remission (CR) after induction chemotherapy. The causes of death were three intracranial hemorrhage, one cerebral infarction, and one sepsis. Five patients (7.1%) suffered a relapse during or after maintenance chemotherapy. The estimated 4-year event-free survival and overall survival (OS) rates were 82.1%+/-4.4%, 89.7%+/-5.1%, respectively. The 4-year OS was significantly higher in patients with initial WBC < 10x109/L than in those with initial WBC >/= 10x109/L (p=0.020). CONCLUSION: This study showed that the CR rates and survival outcomes in Korean pediatric APL patients were relatively good. The initial WBC count was the most important prognostic factor and most causes of death were related to serious bleeding in the early stage of treatment.","['Park, Kyung Mi', 'Yoo, Keon Hee', 'Kim,

Despite major advances in the treatment of STS, patients are often refractory to conventional radiotherapy, leading to poor prognosis. Enhancement of sensitivity to radiotherapy would therefore improve the clinical outcome of STS patients. We previously revealed that the tumor-specific, replication-competent oncolytic adenovirus OBP-301 kills human sarcoma cells. In this study, we investigated the radiosensitizing effect of OBP-301 in human STS cells. The in vitro antitumor effect of OBP-301 and ionizing radiation in monotherapy or combination therapy was assessed using highly radiosensitive (RD-ES and SK-ES-1) and moderately radiosensitive (HT1080 and NMS-2) STS cell lines. The expression of markers for apoptosis and DNA damage were evaluated in STS cells after treatment. The therapeutic potential of combination therapy was further analyzed using SK-ES-1 and HT1080 cells in subcutaneous xenograft tumor models. The combination of OBP-301 and ionizing radiation showed a synergistic antitumor effect in all human STS cell lines tested, including those that show different radiosensitivity. OBP-301 was found to enhance irradiation-induced apoptosis and DNA damage via suppression of anti-apoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1), which was expressed at higher levels in moderately radiosensitive cell lines. The combination of OBP-301 and ionizing radiation showed a more profound antitumor effect compared to monotherapy in SK-ES-1 (highly radiosensitive) and HT1080 (moderately radiosensitive) subcutaneous xenograft tumors. OBP-301 is a promising antitumor reagent to improve the therapeutic potential of radiotherapy by increasing radiation-induced apoptosis in STS.","['Omori, Toshinori', 'Tazawa, Hiroshi', 'Yamakawa, Yasuaki', 'Osaki, Shuhei', 'Hasei, Joe', 'Sugiu, Kazuhisa', 'Komatsubara, Tadashi', 'Fujiwara, Tomohiro', 'Yoshida, Aki', 'Kunisada, Toshiyuki', 'Urata, Yasuo', 'Kagawa, Shunsuke', 'Ozaki, Toshifumi', 'Fujiwara, Toshiyoshi']","['Omori T', 'Tazawa H', 'Yamakawa Y', 'Osaki S', 'Hasei J', 'Sugiu K', 'Komatsubara T', 'Fujiwara T', 'Yoshida A', 'Kunisada T', 'Urata Y', 'Kagawa S', 'Ozaki T', 'Fujiwara T']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4658-1050', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4790-933X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1775-850X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5377-6051']","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Center for Innovative Clinical Medicine, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Materials for Musculoskeletal Reconstruction, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Oncolys BioPharma, Inc., Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Minimally Invasive Therapy Center, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210422,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC8061981,,,2021/04/23 06:00,2021/10/05 06:00,['2021/04/22 17:33'],"['2021/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/22 17:33 [entrez]', '2021/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0250643 [doi]', 'PONE-D-21-00286 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2021 Apr 22;16(4):e0250643. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0250643. eCollection 2021.,20211004,['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)'],IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'DNA Damage/radiation effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncolytic Virotherapy', '*Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Sarcoma/metabolism/pathology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,,,,,"['Y.

We conclude that economic considerations strongly influence therapy decisions in CML. Whether this should be so and what impact it has on outcomes is also considered. Absent definitive data proving which therapy strategy is best allowing economic considerations to operate may not be as unreasonable or unethical as it appears. In some settings, it may be the best approach. However, because TKIs markedly prolong survival and may even cure some persons with CML, TKI therapy should be available to everyone with CML.","['Jiang, Qian', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Gale, Robert Peter']","['Jiang Q', 'Larson RA', 'Gale RP']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9156-1676'],"['Peking University Peoples Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing, China.', 'University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Immunology and Inflammation, Centre for Haematology Research, Imperial College London, London, SW7 2AZ, UK. robertpetergale@alumni.ucla.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210422,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'Economic influences on theraphy', 'Therapy decisions in CML']",2021/04/23 06:00,2021/11/06 06:00,['2021/04/22 12:24'],"['2020/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/06 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/22 12:24 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00432-021-03607-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-021-03607-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2021 Dec;147(12):3693-3698. doi: 10.1007/s00432-021-03607-5.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impacts of early-onset EBV viremia in acute leukemia (AL) patients who underwent allo-HSCT with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)-containing myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen. Two hundred and ninety-six patients were included between January 2013 and December 2015. In 126 patients (42.6%) who developed early-onset EBV viremia, with a median time of 48 (range 18~99) days after allo-HSCT. The cumulative incidence of EBV viremia at 30 and 90 days after allo-HSCT were 4.1 and 39.9%, respectively. Prognostic analysis showed that the adjusted overall survival in early-EBV(pos) group was significantly lower than early-EBV(neg) group within the first 26.7 months after allo-HSCT [hazard ratio (HR), 1.63, P = 0.012], but significantly higher than those afterward (after 26.7 months: HR 0.11, P = 0.035); for the adjusted event-free survival, early-EBV(pos) group was significantly inferior in early-EBV(pos) group within the first 10.8 months after transplantation (HR: 1.55, P = 0.042), and this adverse effect was not detected any more after 10.8 months (HR: 0.58, P = 0.107). Compared with early-EBV(neg) group after adjusting by aGVHD and CMV viremia, HR for death from transplant-related mortality was 2.78-fold higher in patients with early-EBV viremia in piecewise constant Cox analysis (P = 0.006), and this adverse effect was not detected any more after the cut-point time (HR: 0.67, P = 0.361). No differences in terms of relapse and relapse mortality were observed between early-EBV(pos) and early-EBV(neg) group (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the impacts on transplant outcomes of early-EBV viremia were time-dependent, which may help to optimize management strategies for early-EBV viremia after allo-HSCT, especially in AL patients with ATG-containing MAC regimen.","['Ke, Peng', 'Zhang, Xinyou', 'Liu, Songbai', 'Zhu, Qian', 'Ma, Xiao', 'Chen, Feng', 'Tang, Xiaowen', 'Han, Yue', 'Fu, ZhengZheng', 'Chen, Suning', 'Wu,

Outcomes in patients with spliceosome mutations treated with hypomethylating agents in combination with venetoclax (HMA+VEN) remains unknown. The primary objective was to compare outcomes in patients with spliceosome mutations vs wild-type patients treated with HMA+VEN. Secondary objectives included analysis of the mutational landscape of the spliceosome cohort and assessing the impact of co-occurring mutations. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of patients treated with HMA+VEN-based regimens at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. A total of 119 patients (spliceosome mutated n = 39 [SRSF2, n = 24; SF3B1, n = 8; U2AF1, n = 7]; wild-type, n = 80) were included. Similar responses were observed between spliceosome and wild-type cohorts for composite complete response (CRc; 79% vs 75%, P = .65), and measurable residual disease-negative CRc (48% vs 60%, P = .34). Median overall survival for spliceosome vs wild-type patients was 35 vs 14 months (P = .58), and was not reached; 35 months and 8 months for patients with SRSF2, SF3B1, and U2AF1 mutations, respectively. IDH2 mutations were enriched in patients with SRSF2 mutations and associated with favorable outcomes (1- and 2-year overall survival [OS] of 100% and 88%). RAS mutations were enriched in patients with U2AF1 mutations and associated with inferior outcomes (median OS, 8 months). Comparable outcomes were observed between patients with vs without spliceosome mutations treated with HMA+VEN regimens, with specific co-mutation pairs demonstrating favorable outcomes.","['Lachowiez, Curtis A', 'Loghavi, Sanam', 'Furudate, Ken', 'Montalban-Bravo, Guillermo', 'Maiti, Abhishek', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Daver, Naval', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Sasaki, Koji', 'Alvarado, Yesid', 'Yilmaz, Musa', 'Short, Nicholas J', 'Chien, Kelly', 'Ohanian, Maro', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Takahashi, Koichi', 'Konopleva, Marina Y', 'DiNardo, Courtney D']","['Lachowiez CA', 'Loghavi S', 'Furudate K', 'Montalban-Bravo G', 'Maiti A', 'Kadia T', 'Daver N', 'Borthakur G', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Sasaki K', 'Alvarado Y', 'Yilmaz M', 'Short NJ', 'Chien K', 'Ohanian M', 'Pierce S', 'Patel KP', 'Jabbour E', 'Ravandi F', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Takahashi K', 'Konopleva MY', 'DiNardo CD']",,"['Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Aomori, Japan.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC8095152,,,2021/04/23 06:00,2021/06/01 06:00,['2021/04/22 12:20'],"['2021/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/22 12:20 [entrez]', '2021/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(21)00277-9 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020004173 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2021 Apr 27;5(8):2173-2183. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020004173.,20210531,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Splicing Factor U2AF)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation', '*Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors', 'Splicing Factor U2AF/genetics', 'Sulfonamides']",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We review our experience with venetoclax-based regimens in 14 newly diagnosed (frontline [FL]) and 17 relapsed/refractory (R/R) post-MPN-AML patients. Venetoclax was used in combination with hypomethylating agents in 58% of cases and in 19% with intensive chemotherapy (treatment including cytarabine >/=1 g/m2 or CPX-351); the remaining patients received cladribine and low-dose cytarabine or isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 inhibitors. The median dose of venetoclax during the initial cycle was 100 mg in all patients (range, 50-800 mg) and 200 mg (range, 100-800 mg) for FL patients. The venetoclax dose was adjusted when used concomitantly with azole antifungal agents. In FL patients, complete remission with and without count recovery in 6 patients (median duration of 6.4 months) and partial remission in 1 patient was noted, with a median overall survival of 7 months. In R/R patients, no formal responses were seen, with a median overall survival of 3 months. Hematologic toxicities and adverse events were frequent; 83% of patients developed grade 3 or higher infection during the initial cycle. Severe hemorrhagic complications were observed in 14 patients, including 6 cases of intracranial and subdural hemorrhage. Overall 4-week and 8-week mortality were 10% and 32%, respectively.

However, there are few studies regarding its epidemiology and treatment patterns in Asian countries. METHODS: To investigate CLL/SLL in Asian populations, we identified CLL/SLL patients diagnosed during 2006 to 2015 from the Taiwan Cancer Registry Database and estimated the incidence. Further, patients diagnosed during 2008 to 2015 were included for the analysis of treatment patterns and survivals. Treatments for CLL/SLL were retrieved from the Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database and survival data from the National Death Registry. RESULTS: In total, 1497 patients who were older than 20 years and had newly diagnosed CLL/SLL during 2006-2015 were identified. The age-standardized incidence rates of CLL/SLL (0.36 per 100 000 persons in 2006, and 0.54 in 2015) increased during the 10-year period. The sex ratio was ranged from 1.21 to 2.63 with male predominant during 2006 and 2015. For the analysis of treatment patterns (n = 1236), 72.8% patients received chemotherapies. The median duration between the diagnosis and start of treatments was 27 days, and monotherapy of chlorambucil, bendamustine or cyclophosphamide was the most common regimen in initial treatments. The median follow-up duration for the patients receiving therapies was 29.6 months, and 45.0% patients experienced relapse or refractory. In patients with relapse/refractory CLL/SLL, 34.1% received rituximab-containing chemotherapies. Three hundred and ninety-nine (32.3%) patients received intensive treatments, and 175 (43.9%) of them received rituximab-containing chemotherapies. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 61%, and age was an important prognostic factor for CLL/SLL patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first population-based study in Asia and provides comprehensive evidence of epidemiology, treatment patterns and survivals of CLL/SLL in an Asian population.","['Ko, Bor-Sheng', 'Chen, Li-Ju', 'Huang, Huai-Hsuan', 'Chen, Ho-Min', 'Hsiao, Fei-Yuan']","['Ko BS', 'Chen LJ', 'Huang HH', 'Chen HM', 'Hsiao FY']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7965-7579', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3098-6371', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1660-9120']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Hematological Oncology, National Taiwan University Cancer Center, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Health Data Research Center, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Pharmacy, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Health Data Research Center, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Pharmacy, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Pharmacy, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'School of Pharmacy, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['AbbVie Biopharmaceuticals GmbH Taiwan Branch'],['Journal Article'],20210529,England,Int J Clin Pract,International journal of clinical practice,9712381,,,,2021/04/23 06:00,2021/07/24 06:00,['2021/04/22 07:03'],"['2020/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/22 07:03 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijcp.14258 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Pract. 2021 Aug;75(8):e14258. doi: 10.1111/ijcp.14258.

SUMMARY: A 52-year-old malnourished male with a medical history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for obesity developed acute myelogenous leukemia and underwent allogeneic HSCT approximately 17 months later. He was admitted 1 month after HSCT for failure to thrive and initiated on parenteral nutrition due to worsening diarrhea and suspected gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease (GI GVHD). During admission, the patient was continued on daily oral posaconazole for antifungal prophylaxis and was found to have subtherapeutic posaconazole and deficient vitamin levels, likely secondary to his gastrojejunostomy and increased gastric transit time. The oral posaconazole was altered to twice-daily dosing in an effort to increase serum drug levels and prevent IFIs. CONCLUSION: Patients with a history of gastric bypass are at increased risk for malabsorption of oral posaconazole and nutrients, especially following HSCT with suspected GI GVHD.","['Highsmith, Emily A', 'Doan, Vi P', 'Canada, Todd W']","['Highsmith EA', 'Doan VP', 'Canada TW']",,"['Department of Pharmacy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Am J Health Syst Pharm,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,9503023,PMC8083209,['NOTNLM'],"['*gastric bypass', '*hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*intestinal absorption', '*posaconazole']",2021/04/23 06:00,2021/09/30 06:00,['2021/04/22 06:49'],"['2021/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/30 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/22 06:49 [entrez]']","['6245082 [pii]', '10.1093/ajhp/zxab164 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2021 Jul 9;78(14):1282-1286. doi: 10.1093/ajhp/zxab164.,20210929,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)']",IM,"['Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', '*Gastric Bypass/adverse effects', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Triazoles']","['(c) American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2021.

However, approximately 30% of newly diagnosed and the majority of relapsed patients do not achieve remission with ven/aza. We previously reported that ven/aza efficacy is based on eradication of AML stem cells through a mechanism involving inhibition of amino acid metabolism, a process which is required in primitive AML cells to drive oxidative phosphorylation. Herein we demonstrate that resistance to ven/aza occurs via up-regulation of fatty acid oxidation (FAO), which occurs due to RAS pathway mutations, or as a compensatory adaptation in relapsed disease. Utilization of FAO obviates the need for amino acid metabolism, thereby rendering ven/aza ineffective. Pharmacological inhibition of FAO restores sensitivity to ven/aza in drug resistant AML cells. We propose inhibition of FAO as a therapeutic strategy to address ven/aza resistance.","['Stevens, Brett M', 'Jones, Courtney L', 'Pollyea, Daniel A', 'Culp-Hill, Rachel', ""D'Alessandro, Angelo"", 'Winters, Amanda', 'Krug, Anna', 'Abbott, Diana', 'Goosman, Madeline', 'Pei, Shanshan', 'Ye, Haobin', 'Gillen, Austin E', 'Becker, Michael W', 'Savona, Michael R', 'Smith, Clayton', 'Jordan, Craig T']","['Stevens BM', 'Jones CL', 'Pollyea DA', 'Culp-Hill R', ""D'Alessandro A"", 'Winters A', 'Krug A', 'Abbott D', 'Goosman M', 'Pei S', 'Ye H', 'Gillen AE', 'Becker MW', 'Savona MR', 'Smith C', 'Jordan CT']",,"['Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Divsion of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Informatics, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'RNA Bioscience Initiative, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, James P.

The present study evaluates the anticancer potential of black pepper and its main constituent, i.e. alkaloid piperine, against human leukemia cell line, K-562 cells. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis confirmed the presence of piperine in black pepper extract. The methanolic extract of black pepper (BP-M) and pure piperine (PIP) showed a strong cytotoxic effect against this cell line. Both BP-M and PIP generated apoptotic bodies in K-562 cells and caused nuclear condensation as visualized by fluorescent microscopy, which was further confirmed by flow cytometry analysis. BP-M and PIP also generated reactive oxygen species in K-562 cells as established by flow cytometry. The translation of Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9 genes was found to be upregulated with subsequent downregulation of Bcl-2 gene. The anti-proliferative effect of both BP-M and PIP was also observed by trypan blue staining and was further confirmed by the downregulated expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The molecular docking studies showed the binding of PIP with PCNA and Bcl-2 and supported the in vitro findings. The docking studies also proposed the binding of PIP to ADP binding pocket of Apaf-1 protein. Taken together, these findings signify the anticancer potential of both black pepper and PIP, thus proposing black pepper as a potent nutraceutical for preventing the progression of chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Banerjee, Somesh', 'Katiyar, Parul', 'Kumar, Vijay', 'Saini, Shashank Sagar', 'Varshney, Ritu', 'Krishnan, Vengadesan', 'Sircar, Debabrata', 'Roy, Partha']","['Banerjee S', 'Katiyar P', 'Kumar V', 'Saini SS', 'Varshney R', 'Krishnan V', 'Sircar D', 'Roy P']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1943-3079'],"['Molecular Endocrinology Laboratory, Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India.', 'Molecular Endocrinology Laboratory, Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India.', 'Laboratory of Structural Microbiology, Regional Centre for Biotechnology, Faridabad 121001, Haryana, India.', 'Plant Molecular Biology Laboratory, Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India.', 'Molecular Endocrinology Laboratory, Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India.', 'Laboratory of Structural Microbiology, Regional Centre for Biotechnology, Faridabad 121001, Haryana, India.', 'Plant Molecular Biology Laboratory, Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India.', 'Molecular Endocrinology Laboratory, Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210218,England,Toxicol Res (Camb),Toxicology research,101587950,PMC8045589,['NOTNLM'],"['black pepper', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'intrinsic apoptosis pathway', 'piperine', 'reactive oxygen species']",2021/04/23 06:00,2021/04/23 06:01,['2021/04/22 06:45'],"['2020/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/02/18 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/04/22 06:45 [entrez]', '2021/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1093/toxres/tfab001 [doi]', 'tfab001 [pii]']",epublish,Toxicol Res (Camb). 2021 Feb 18;10(2):169-182. doi: 10.1093/toxres/tfab001. eCollection 2021 Mar.,,,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

The PCI group also had fewer brain metastases per mouse at 4 weeks (p=0.03) and 8 weeks (p=0.006) versus the unirradiated control as well as a lower metastatic burden (p=0.01). Irradiation given either before tumor-cell injection or 3-6 weeks afterward had no significant effect on brain metastases compared to the unirradiated control. These results underscore the importance of timing for irradiating subclinical disease. Clinical whole brain strategies to target subclinical brain disease as safely as possible may warrant further study.","['Smith, Daniel L', 'Debeb, Bisrat G', 'Diagaradjane, Parmeswaran', 'Larson, Richard', 'Kumar, Swaminathan', 'Ning, Jing', 'Lacerda, Lara', 'Li, Li', 'Woodward, Wendy A']","['Smith DL', 'Debeb BG', 'Diagaradjane P', 'Larson R', 'Kumar S', 'Ning J', 'Lacerda L', 'Li L', 'Woodward WA']",,"['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Morgan Welch Inflammatory Breast Cancer Research Program and Clinic, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Morgan Welch Inflammatory Breast Cancer Research Program and Clinic, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Morgan Welch Inflammatory Breast Cancer Research Program and Clinic, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Morgan Welch Inflammatory Breast Cancer Research Program and Clinic, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, UTHealth Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Morgan Welch Inflammatory Breast Cancer Research Program and Clinic, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Morgan Welch Inflammatory Breast Cancer Research Program and Clinic, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Morgan Welch Inflammatory Breast Cancer Research Program and Clinic, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210313,United States,Genes Cancer,Genes & cancer,101516546,PMC8045965,['NOTNLM'],"['brain metastasis', 'breast cancer', 'prophylactic cranial irradiation']",2021/04/23 06:00,2021/04/23 06:01,['2021/04/22 06:45'],"['2020/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/22 06:45 [entrez]', '2021/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/genesandcancer.212 [doi]', '212 [pii]']",epublish,Genes Cancer. 2021 Mar 13;12:28-38. doi: 10.18632/genesandcancer.212. eCollection 2021.,,,,,['Copyright: (c) 2021 Smith et al.'],,,,,['CONFLICT OF INTEREST The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report a case of secondary HL in a patient with CML treated with dasatinib as a third-line treatment. Patient Information: A 64-year-old male was diagnosed with CML and initially treated with imatinib and then with nilotinib due to resistance. Finally, the patient experienced cardiovascular complications, and dasatinib was introduced. After 19 months of treatment, the patient experienced enlargement of lymph nodes that formed packs on the neck. Interventions: Based on histopathological examination of the lymph nodes, a diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma - mixed cellularity was established. The patient was successfully treated with 4 cycles of AVD (adriamycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) chemotherapy. Outcomes: Complete metabolic remission of Hodgkin lymphoma is currently sustained, and the molecular response to dasatinib at a reduced dose of 50 mg daily corresponds with a deep molecular response. Conclusion: In this report, we demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the combination of dasatinib and AVD regimens in coexisting CML and HL. This case report emphasizes the importance of insightful evaluation and differential diagnosis in cases of lymphadenopathy during CML treatment.","['Paczkowska, Edyta', 'Janowski, Michal', 'Karpinska, Katarzyna', 'Rylow, Malgorzata', 'Zdziarska, Barbara', 'Poncyljusz, Wojciech', 'Machalinski, Boguslaw']","['Paczkowska E', 'Janowski M', 'Karpinska K', 'Rylow M', 'Zdziarska B', 'Poncyljusz W', 'Machalinski B']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7052-9741', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5173-5635']","['Department of General Pathology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology with Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University Hospital No. 1 of Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology with Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University Hospital No. 1 of Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Pathomorphology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology with Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University Hospital No. 1 of Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology with Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University Hospital No. 1 of Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Diagnostic Imaging and Interventional Radiology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of General Pathology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210412,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,PMC8053603,['NOTNLM'],"['Hodgkin lymphoma', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'dasatinib', 'lymphadenopathy', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2021/04/23 06:00,2021/04/23 06:01,['2021/04/22 06:42'],"['2021/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/22 06:42 [entrez]', '2021/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S300320 [doi]', '300320 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2021 Apr 12;14:2497-2503. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S300320. eCollection 2021.,,,,,['(c) 2021 Paczkowska et al.'],,,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, their applications are rigorously restricted by the limited secretion competence of cells. Therefore, strategies to enhance the production and functions of exosomes are warranted. Studies have shown that nanomaterials can significantly enhance the effects of cells and exosomes in intercellular communication; however, how palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) enhance exosome release in human leukemia monocytic cells (THP-1) remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to address the effect of PdNPs on exosome biogenesis and release in THP-1 cells. Methods: Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation and ExoQuick(TM) and characterized by dynamic light scattering, nanoparticle tracking analysis system, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, EXOCET(TM) assay, and fluorescence polarization. The expression levels of exosome markers were analyzed via quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: PdNP treatment enhanced the biogenesis and release of exosomes by inducing oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, apoptosis, and immunomodulation. The exosomes were spherical in shape and had an average diameter of 50-80 nm. Exosome production was confirmed via total protein concentration, exosome counts, acetylcholinesterase activity, and neutral sphingomyelinase activity. The expression levels of TSG101, CD9, CD63, and CD81 were significantly higher in PdNP-treated cells than in control cells. Further, cytokine and chemokine levels were significantly higher in exosomes isolated from PdNP-treated THP-1 cells than in those isolated from control cells. THP-1 cells pre-treated with N-acetylcysteine or GW4869 showed significant decreases in PdNP-induced exosome biogenesis and release. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that PdNPs stimulate exosome biogenesis and release and simultaneously increase the levels of cytokines and chemokines by modulating various physiological processes. Our findings suggest a reasonable approach to improve the production of exosomes for various therapeutic applications.","['Gurunathan, Sangiliyandi', 'Kang, Min-Hee', 'Jeyaraj, Muniyandi', 'Kim, Jin-Hoi']","['Gurunathan S', 'Kang MH', 'Jeyaraj M', 'Kim JH']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9924-8433', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4402-7064', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1232-5307']","['Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210415,New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,PMC8055296,['NOTNLM'],"['biogenesis', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'exosomes', 'human leukemia monocytic cells', 'oxidative stress', 'palladium nanoparticles']",2021/04/23 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2021/04/22 06:42'],"['2021/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/22 06:42 [entrez]', '2021/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S305269 [doi]', '305269 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2021 Apr 15;16:2849-2877. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S305269. eCollection 2021.,20210510,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Benzylidene Compounds)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (GW 4869)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '5TWQ1V240M (Palladium)', 'EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcholinesterase/metabolism', 'Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzylidene Compounds/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', '*Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Exosomes/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunomodulation/*drug effects', 'Leukemia/blood/*pathology', 'Metal Nanoparticles/*toxicity/ultrastructure', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Palladium/*toxicity', 'Particle Size', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/metabolism', 'THP-1 Cells']",['(c) 2021 Gurunathan et al.'],,,,,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rescue of integrase (IN)-deficient HIV-1 replication by Tax results from the strong activation of transcription from the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter on episomal HIV-1 DNA, an effect that is closely correlated with the recruitment of activating epigenetic marks, such as H3Ac, and depletion of repressive epigenetic marks, such as H3K9me3, from chromatinized unintegrated proviruses. In addition, activation of transcription from unintegrated HIV-1 DNA coincides with the recruitment of NF-kappaB to the two NF-kappaB binding sites found in the HIV-1 LTR enhancer. Here, we report that the recruitment of NF-kappaB to unintegrated viral DNA precedes, and is a prerequisite for, Tax-induced changes in epigenetic marks, so that an IN(-) HIV-1 mutant lacking both LTR NF-kappaB sites is entirely nonresponsive to Tax and fails to undergo the epigenetic changes listed above. Interestingly, we found that induction of Tax expression at 24 h postinfection, when unintegrated HIV-1 DNA is already fully repressed by inhibitory chromatin modifications, is able to effectively reverse the epigenetic silencing of that DNA and rescue viral gene expression. Finally, we report that heterologous promoters introduced into IN-deficient HIV-1-based vectors are transcriptionally active even in the absence of Tax and do not increase their activity when the HIV-1 promoter and enhancer, located in the LTR U3 region, are deleted, as has been recently proposed. IMPORTANCE Integrase-deficient expression vectors based on HIV-1 are becoming increasingly popular as tools for gene therapy in vivo due to their inability to cause insertional mutagenesis. However, many IN(-) lentiviral vectors are able to achieve only low levels of gene expression, and methods to increase this low level have not been extensively explored. Here, we analyzed how the HTLV-1 Tax protein is able to rescue the replication of IN(-) HIV-1 in T cells, and we describe IN(-) lentiviral vectors, lacking any inserted origin of replication, that are able to express a heterologous gene effectively.","['Irwan, Ishak D', 'Cullen, Bryan R']","['Irwan ID', 'Cullen BR']",,"['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],"['U54 AI150470/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21-AI157616/HHS | NIH | National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases', '(NIAID)', 'R21 AI157616/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U54-AI150470/HHS | NIH | National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases', '(NIAID)', 'P30 AI064518/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-AI064518/HHS | NIH | National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases', '(NIAID)']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20210610,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC8315925,['NOTNLM'],"['*NF-kappaB', '*Tax', '*chromatin', '*epigenetics', '*integrase']",2021/04/23 06:00,2021/08/26 06:00,['2021/04/22 06:04'],"['2021/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/26 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/22 06:04 [entrez]']","['JVI.00285-21 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00285-21 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2021 Jun 10;95(13):e0028521. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00285-21.

DNA methylation was assessed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We performed a fixed-effects meta-analysis of the two samples. 34 CpGs were associated with AMI. Only 12 of them were available in two independent cohort studies (n ~ 1800 and n ~ 2500) with incident coronary and cardiovascular disease (CHD and CVD, respectively). The Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used in those two studies. Four of the 12 CpGs were validated in association with incident CHD: AHRR-mapping cg05575921, PTCD2-mapping cg25769469, intergenic cg21566642 and MPO-mapping cg04988978. We then assessed whether methylation risk scores based on those CpGs improved the predictive capacity of the Framingham risk function, but they did not. Finally, we aimed to study the causality of those associations using a Mendelian randomization approach but only one of the CpGs had a genetic influence and therefore the results were not conclusive. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified 34 CpGs related to AMI. These loci highlight the relevance of smoking, lipid metabolism, and inflammation in the biological mechanisms related to AMI. Four were additionally associated with incident CHD and CVD but did not provide additional predictive information.","['Fernandez-Sanles, Alba', 'Sayols-Baixeras, Sergi', 'Subirana, Isaac', 'Senti, Mariano', 'Perez-Fernandez, S', 'de Castro Moura, Manuel', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Marrugat, Jaume', 'Elosua, Roberto']","['Fernandez-Sanles A', 'Sayols-Baixeras S', 'Subirana I', 'Senti M', 'Perez-Fernandez S', 'de Castro Moura M', 'Esteller M', 'Marrugat J', 'Elosua R']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8235-0095'],"['Cardiovascular Epidemiology and Genetics Research Group, REGICOR Study Group, IMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute), Dr Aiguader 88, 08003, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Pompeu Fabra University (UPF), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Medical Research Council (MRC) Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'Cardiovascular Epidemiology and Genetics Research Group, REGICOR Study Group, IMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute), Dr Aiguader 88, 08003, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'CIBER Cardiovascular Diseases (CIBERCV), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Epidemiology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Cardiovascular Epidemiology and Genetics Research Group, REGICOR Study Group, IMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute), Dr Aiguader 88, 08003, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'CIBER Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.', 'Pompeu Fabra University (UPF), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Cardiovascular Epidemiology and Genetics Research Group, REGICOR Study Group, IMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute), Dr Aiguader 88, 08003, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'CIBER Cardiovascular Diseases (CIBERCV), Madrid, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'CIBER Oncology (CIBERONC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Physiological Sciences Department, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Barcelona (UB), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Cardiovascular Epidemiology and Genetics Research Group, REGICOR Study Group, IMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute), Dr Aiguader 88, 08003, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'CIBER Cardiovascular Diseases (CIBERCV), Madrid, Spain.', 'Cardiovascular Epidemiology and Genetics Research Group, REGICOR Study Group, IMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute), Dr Aiguader 88, 08003, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. relosua@imim.es.', 'CIBER Cardiovascular Diseases (CIBERCV), Madrid, Spain. relosua@imim.es.', 'Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, University of Vic-Central University of Catalonia (UVic-UCC), Vic, Catalonia, Spain. relosua@imim.es.']",['eng'],"['PI18/00017/Instituto de Salud Carlos III', 'PI15/00051/Instituto de Salud Carlos III', 'PI12/00232/Instituto de Salud Carlos III', 'CIBERCV/Instituto de Salud Carlos III', 'CIBERONC/Instituto de Salud Carlos III', 'IFI14/0007/Instituto de Salud Carlos III', 'CIBERCV/Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ES)', ""SLT002/16/00088/Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca"", ""2017SGR946/Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca"", 'SLT002/16/00088/Departament de Salut, Generalitat de Catalunya', 'BES-2014-069718/Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad', 'N01-HC-25195/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (US)', 'HHSN2682015000001/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (US)', 'NO1WH22110/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '24152M 32100-2/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '32105-6/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '32108-9/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '32111-13/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '32115/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '32118/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '32119/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '32122/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '42107-26/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '42129-32/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '44221/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210421,Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,PMC8061080,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cardiovascular disease', '*DNA methylation', '*Epigenome-wide association study', '*Myocardial infarction', '*Predictive biomarkers']",2021/04/23 06:00,2021/04/23 06:00,['2021/04/22 05:43'],"['2021/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/22 05:43 [entrez]', '2021/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13148-021-01078-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s13148-021-01078-6 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2021 Apr 21;13(1):86. doi: 10.1186/s13148-021-01078-6.,,,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several methods effectively identify gene sets in which individual genes have simple monotonic relationships with categorical, quantitative, or censored event-time variables. Some distance-based methods, such as distance correlations, may detect complex non-monotone associations of a gene-set with a quantitative variable that elude other methods. However, the distance correlations have yet to be generalized to associate gene-sets with categorical and censored event-time endpoints. Also, there is a need to determine which genes empirically drive the significance of an association of a gene set with an endpoint. RESULTS: We develop gene-set distance analysis (GSDA) by generalizing distance correlations to evaluate the association of a gene set with categorical and censored event-time variables. We also develop a backward elimination procedure to identify a subset of genes that empirically drive significant associations. In simulation studies, GSDA more effectively identified complex non-monotone gene-set associations than did six other published methods. In the analysis of a pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) data set, GSDA was the only method to discover that event-free survival (EFS) was associated with the 56-gene AML pathway gene-set, narrow that result down to 5 genes, and confirm the association of those 5 genes with EFS in a separate validation cohort. These results indicate that GSDA effectively identifies and characterizes complex non-monotonic gene-set associations that are missed by other methods. CONCLUSION: GSDA is a powerful and flexible method to detect gene-set association with categorical, quantitative, or censored event-time variables, especially to detect complex non-monotonic gene-set associations.

Within the proliferation niches of lymph nodes, bone marrow, and secondary lymphoid organs, a variety of phenotypically and functionally altered cell types, including T cells, natural killer cells, monocytes/macrophages, endothelial and mesenchymal stroma cells, provide crucial survival signals, along with CLL-cellinduced suppression of antitumor immune responses. The B-cell receptor pathway plays a pivotal role in mediating the interaction between CLL cells and the TME. However, an increasing number of additional components of the multifactorial TME are being discovered. Although the majority of therapeutic strategies employed in CLL hitherto have focused on targeting the leukemic cells, emerging evidence implies that modulation of microenvironmental cells and CLL-TME interactions by novel therapeutic agents significantly affect their clinical efficacy. Thus, improving our understanding of CLL-TME interactions and how they are affected by current therapeutic agents may improve and guide treatment strategies. Identification of novel TME interactions may also pave the road for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the TME. In this review, we summarize current evidence on the effects of therapeutic agents on cells and interactions within the TME. With a growing demand for improved and personalized treatment options in CLL, this review aims at inspiring future exploration of smart drug combination strategies, translational studies, and novel therapeutic targets in clinical trials.","['Svanberg, Rebecka', 'Janum, Sine', 'Patten, Piers E M', 'Ramsay, Alan G', 'Niemann, Carsten U']","['Svanberg R', 'Janum S', 'Patten PEM', 'Ramsay AG', 'Niemann CU']",,"['Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen.', ""Department of Clinical Haemato-oncology, Bartholomew's Hospital, Barts Health Trust, London."", ""School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London, London."", ""School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London, London."", 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen. carsten.utoft.niemann@regionh.dk.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210901,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC8409023,,,2021/04/23 06:00,2021/10/28 06:00,['2021/04/22 04:05'],"['2020/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/22 04:05 [entrez]']",['10.3324/haematol.2020.268037 [doi]'],epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Sep 1;106(9):2312-2324. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2020.268037.,20211027,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it has been suggested that cancer cells rewire their metabolism to adopt low nutrient level for survival and proliferation. Although glutamine is a non-essential amino acid and can be synthesized de novo, many cancer cells including malignant hematopoietic cells have been indicated to be addicted to glutamine. This study aimed to investigate proliferation of leukemia cell lines in glutamine deprived conditions. Materials and Methods: Cell proliferation of K562, NB-4 and HL-60 cells were determined calculating cell numbers in normal vs low glutamine media. Changes in mRNA expressions were investigated using qRT-PCR. GS encoding GLUL gene was knocked out (KO) in HL-60 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 method, protein expression was evaluated with immunoblotting. Results: Proliferation of all cell lines were decreased in glutamine deprived medium. GS protein expression was increased in glutamine limited medium although mRNA level did not change. Increased protein expression was confirmed with inhibition of new protein synthesis by treating cells with cycloheximide. To further investigate the role of GS protein, GS encoding GLUL gene was knocked out (KO) in HL-60 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 method. GS KO cells less proliferated compared to control cells in glutamine limited medium. Conclusion: Our results indicates that upregulated GS protein expression is responsible for glutamine addiction of leukemia cell lines. Exploiting the genetic and metabolic mechanisms responsible for GS protein expression could identify new anti-cancer drug targets.","['Yucel, Burcu', 'Ada, Saniye']","['Yucel B', 'Ada S']",,"['Istanbul Medeniyet University, Medical Faculty, Department of Medical Biology, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Istanbul Medeniyet University, Medical Faculty, Department of Medical Biochemistry, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210422,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,,['NOTNLM'],"['Crispr/cas9', 'glutamine limitation', 'glutamine synthetase', 'leukemia']",2021/04/23 06:00,2021/04/23 06:00,['2021/04/22 02:27'],"['2021/04/22 02:27 [entrez]', '2021/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4274/tjh.galenos.2021.2021.0054 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Turk J Haematol. 2021 Apr 22. doi: 10.4274/tjh.galenos.2021.2021.0054.,,,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunohistochemical and molecular findings suggest that HOCT is an entity distinct from both oncocytoma and chromophobe carcinoma. Although uncertainty persists regarding the factors predisposing to the development of HOCT, experimental findings suggest that it may arise due to the effect of toxins or in association with chronic kidney failure. The potential role of prior renal lymphoma in the development of oncocytosis has not hitherto been examined. We present a morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular analysis of an HOCT arising from renal oncocytosis in conjunction with CLL affecting the kidney. The findings suggest that this tumor belongs to a family of similar neoplasms including oncocytoma, the eosinophilic variant of chromophobe renal-cell carcinoma (CRCC), and low-grade oncocytic tumor, even though these neoplasms may arise from different precursor lesions. HOCT and oncocytosis revealed the same immunohistochemical profile consistent on positivity for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), cytokeratin 7 (Ck7), E-cadherin, CAM 5.2 and negativity for Pax-8, vimentin, renal-cell carcinoma (RCC) antigen, CD117, racemase, progesterone receptor, and CD10. The Ki-67 proliferation index was <1%. Molecular analysis of the tumor revealed the AKT3 gene mutation variant, classified as probably pathogenic, together with FOS1 gene amplification and no copy number variations (CNVs).

MPN-AP and MPN-BP are characterized by 10-19% and >/=20% blasts, respectively. MPN-AP/BP portend a dismal prognosis with no established conventional treatment. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the sole modality associated with long-term survival. SUMMARY: MPN-AP/BP has a markedly different mutational profile from de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In MPN-AP/BP, TP53 and IDH1/2 are more frequent, whereas FLT3 and DNMT3A are rare. Higher incidence of leukemic transformation has been associated with the most aggressive MPN subtype, myelofibrosis (MF); other risk factors for leukemic transformation include rising blast counts above 3-5%, advanced age, severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, increasing bone marrow fibrosis, type 1 CALR-unmutated status, lack of driver mutations (negative for JAK2, CALR, or MPL genes), adverse cytogenetics, and acquisition of >/=2 high-molecular risk mutations (ASXL1, EZH2, IDH1/2, SRSF2, and U2AF1Q157). The aforementioned factors have been incorporated in several novel prognostic scoring systems for MF. Currently, elderly/unfit patients with MPN-AP/BP are treated with hypomethylating agents with/without ruxolitinib; these regimens appear to confer comparable benefit to intensive chemotherapy but with lower toxicity. Retrospective studies in patients who acquired actionable mutations during MPN-AP/BP showed positive outcomes with targeted AML treatments, such as IDH1/2 inhibitors, and require further evaluation in clinical trials. Key Messages: Therapy for MPN-AP patients represents an unmet medical need. MF patients, in particular, should be appropriately stratified regarding their prognosis and the risk for transformation. Higher-risk patients should be monitored regularly and treated prior to progression to MPN-BP. MPN-AP patients may be treated with hypomethylating agents alone or in combination with ruxolitinib; also, patients can be provided with the option to enroll in rationally designed clinical trials exploring combination regimens, including novel targeted drugs, with an ultimate goal to transition to transplant.","['Shahin, Omar A', 'Chifotides, Helen T', 'Bose, Prithviraj', 'Masarova, Lucia', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Shahin OA', 'Chifotides HT', 'Bose P', 'Masarova L', 'Verstovsek S']",,"['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210421,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,PMC8458218,['NOTNLM'],"['Accelerated phase myeloproliferative neoplasms', 'Blast phase myeloproliferative neoplasms', 'Myelofibrosis', 'Myeloproliferative neoplasms', 'Post-myeloproliferative neoplasm acute myeloid leukemia']",2021/04/22 06:00,2021/11/18 06:00,['2021/04/21 20:17'],"['2020/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/04/21 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/18 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/21 20:17 [entrez]']","['000512929 [pii]', '10.1159/000512929 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2021;144(5):484-499. doi: 10.1159/000512929.

Here, we show that the transcription factor WT1 forms a major node in the rewired mutation-specific gene regulatory networks of multiple AML subtypes. WT1 is frequently either mutated or upregulated in AML, and its expression is predictive for relapse. The WT1 protein exists as multiple isoforms. For two main AML subtypes, we demonstrate that these isoforms exhibit differential patterns of binding and support contrasting biological activities, including enhanced proliferation. We also show that WT1 responds to oncogenic signaling and is part of a signaling-responsive transcription factor hub that controls AML growth. WT1 therefore plays a central and widespread role in AML biology.","['Potluri, Sandeep', 'Assi, Salam A', 'Chin, Paulynn S', 'Coleman, Dan J L', 'Pickin, Anna', 'Moriya, Shogo', 'Seki, Naohiko', 'Heidenreich, Olaf', 'Cockerill, Peter N', 'Bonifer, Constanze']","['Potluri S', 'Assi SA', 'Chin PS', 'Coleman DJL', 'Pickin A', 'Moriya S', 'Seki N', 'Heidenreich O', 'Cockerill PN', 'Bonifer C']",,"['Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B152TT, UK.

The identification of antibody-epitope binding sites is then of great interest to many emerging medical and bioanalytical applications, particularly to design monoclonal antibodies (mAb) mimics taking advantage of amino acid residues involved in the binding. Among relevant antibodies, the monoclonal antibody rituximab has received significant attention as it is exploited to treat several cancers including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, as well as some autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. The binding of rituximab to the targeted cells occurs via the recognition of the CD20 epitope. A crystallographic study has shown that the binding area, named paratope, is located at the surface of rituximab. Combining the SPOT method and the complementary surface plasmon resonance technique allowed us to detect an extended recognition domain buried in the pocket of the rituximab Fab formed by four beta-sheets. More generally, the present study offers a comprehensive approach to identify antibody-epitope binding sites.","['Bar, Laure', 'Nguyen, Christophe', 'Galibert, Mathieu', 'Santos-Schneider, Francisco', 'Aldrian, Gudrun', 'Dejeu, Jerome', 'Lartia, Remy', 'Coche-Guerente, Liliane', 'Molina, Franck', 'Boturyn, Didier']","['Bar L', 'Nguyen C', 'Galibert M', 'Santos-Schneider F', 'Aldrian G', 'Dejeu J', 'Lartia R', 'Coche-Guerente L', 'Molina F', 'Boturyn D']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2434-2959', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0028-6670', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2530-0299']","['Universite Grenoble-Alpes, CNRS, DCM UMR 5250, 570 rue de la chimie, CS 40700, 38058 Grenoble Cedex 9, France.', 'Sys2Diag, CNRS-ALCEDIAG, Cap delta/Parc Euromedecine, 1682 rue de la Valsiere, CS 61003, 34184 Montpellier Cedex 4, France.', 'Universite Grenoble-Alpes, CNRS, DCM UMR 5250, 570 rue de la chimie, CS 40700, 38058 Grenoble Cedex 9, France.', 'Sys2Diag, CNRS-ALCEDIAG, Cap delta/Parc Euromedecine, 1682 rue de la Valsiere, CS 61003, 34184 Montpellier Cedex 4, France.', 'Sys2Diag, CNRS-ALCEDIAG, Cap delta/Parc Euromedecine, 1682 rue de la Valsiere, CS 61003, 34184 Montpellier Cedex 4, France.', 'Universite Grenoble-Alpes, CNRS, DCM UMR 5250, 570 rue de la chimie, CS 40700, 38058 Grenoble Cedex 9, France.', 'Universite Grenoble-Alpes, CNRS, DCM UMR 5250, 570 rue de la chimie, CS 40700, 38058 Grenoble Cedex 9, France.', 'Universite Grenoble-Alpes, CNRS, DCM UMR 5250, 570 rue de la chimie, CS 40700, 38058 Grenoble Cedex 9, France.', 'Sys2Diag, CNRS-ALCEDIAG, Cap delta/Parc Euromedecine, 1682 rue de la Valsiere, CS 61003, 34184 Montpellier Cedex 4, France.', 'Universite Grenoble-Alpes, CNRS, DCM UMR 5250, 570 rue de la chimie, CS 40700, 38058 Grenoble Cedex 9, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210421,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,,,,2021/04/22 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2021/04/21 17:08'],"['2021/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/21 17:08 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.analchem.1c00960 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2021 May 4;93(17):6865-6872. doi: 10.1021/acs.analchem.1c00960.

Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) involves treatment of the entire CNS subarachnoid space and is occasionally used as a last-resort palliative therapy for LMD. METHODS: This review examined literature describing the role of CSI for LMD from solid and hematologic malignancies in adults. A search for studies published until September 1, 2020 was conducted using PubMed database. RESULTS: A total of 262 unique articles were identified. Thirteen studies were included for analysis in which a total of 275 patients were treated with CSI for LMD. Median age at time of irradiation was 43 years, and most patients had KPS score of 70 and higher. The most common cancers resulting in LMD were acute lymphocytic leukemia, breast cancer, and acute myelogenous leukemia. Median CSI dose was 30 Gy and 18% of patients were treated with proton radiation. 52% of patients had stable-to-improved neurologic symptoms. Median overall survival for the entire cohort was 5.3 months. Patients treated with marrow-sparing proton radiation had median OS of 8 months. The most common treatment toxicities were hematologic and gastrointestinal events. CONCLUSIONS: Despite advances in systemic and radiation therapies, LMD remains a devastating end-stage complication of some malignancies. Treatment-related toxicities can be a significant barrier to CSI delivery. In select patients with LMD, marrow-sparing proton CSI may provide safer palliation of symptoms and prolong survival.","['Maillie, L', 'Salgado, L R', 'Lazarev, S']","['Maillie L', 'Salgado LR', 'Lazarev S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4397-9103'],"['Department of Radiation Oncology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Elmhurst Hospital, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. stanislav.lazarev@mountsinai.org.', 'New York Proton Center, New York, NY, USA. stanislav.lazarev@mountsinai.org.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",20210421,Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,,['NOTNLM'],"['Craniospinal irradiation', 'Leptomeningeal disease', 'Proton therapy']",2021/04/22 06:00,2021/12/29 06:00,['2021/04/21 12:24'],"['2021/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/29 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/21 12:24 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12094-021-02615-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s12094-021-02615-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2021 Oct;23(10):2109-2119. doi: 10.1007/s12094-021-02615-8.

We retrospectively analyzed 319 patients with newly diagnosed AML (127 with IDH1, 135 with IDH2R140, and 57 with IDH2R172 mutations) treated with IC in 3 Acute Leukemia French Association prospective trials. In each IDH subgroup, we analyzed the prognostic impact of clinical and genetic covariates, and the role of HSCT. In patients with IDH1 mutations, the presence of NPM1 mutations was the only variable predicting improved overall survival (OS) in multivariate analysis (P < .0001). In IDH2R140-mutated AML, normal karyotype (P = .008) and NPM1 mutations (P = .01) predicted better OS. NPM1 mutations were associated with better disease-free survival (DFS; P = .0009), whereas the presence of DNMT3A mutations was associated with shorter DFS (P = .0006). In IDH2R172-mutated AML, platelet count was the only variable retained in the multivariate model for OS (P = .002). Among nonfavorable European LeukemiaNet 2010-eligible patients, 71 (36%) underwent HSCT in first complete remission (CR1) and had longer OS (P = .03) and DFS (P = .02) than nontransplanted patients.

Clearance of circulating disease, B-cell aplasia (BCA), and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) are used to observe CAR T-cell function, given the lack of commercial CAR T-cell measurement assays. We investigated the utility of common hematology laboratory parameters in 166 patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) who were treated with CAR T-cell therapy targeting CD19. CAR T-cell infusion was followed by disappearance of circulating blasts in 86% of patients at a median of 6 days. After a lag phase, there was a rapid expansion in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) in the second week that coincided with the appearance of atypical lymphocytes. The expansion phase was followed by a contraction phase with a concomitant decrease in atypical lymphocytes. In vitro CAR T-cell studies showed similar kinetics and morphological changes. Peak ALC and overall expansion was greater in sustained responders compared with that in nonresponders. Patients with early loss of BCA and those with eventual CD19+ minimal residual disease/relapse showed lower overall lymphocyte expansion compared with the controls. Pleomorphic lymphocytosis was noted in the cerebrospinal fluid at post-CAR time points. We conclude that lymphocyte counts and differential can also be used to evaluate CAR T-cell expansion after infusion, along with BCA and CRS. This is the first report to characterize the morphology of CAR T cells and determine the utility of lymphocyte kinetics.","['Faude, Sophia', 'Wei, Jane', 'Muralidharan, Kavitha', 'Xu, Xiaoming', 'Wertheim, Gerald', 'Paessler, Michele', 'Bhoj, Vijay G', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'Maude, Shannon L', 'Rheingold, Susan R', 'Pillai, Vinodh']","['Faude S', 'Wei J', 'Muralidharan K', 'Xu X', 'Wertheim G', 'Paessler M', 'Bhoj VG', 'Grupp SA', 'Maude SL', 'Rheingold SR', 'Pillai V']",,"['University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; and.', ""Division of Hematopathology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; and.', ""Division of Hematopathology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; and.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; and.', ""Division of Oncology, Cancer Immunotherapy Program, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", ""Division of Oncology, Cancer Immunotherapy Program, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", ""Division of Oncology, Cancer Immunotherapy Program, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", ""Division of Hematopathology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; and.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA214278/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA232361/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC8095130,,,2021/04/22 06:00,2021/06/01 06:00,['2021/04/21 12:16'],"['2020/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/21 12:16 [entrez]', '2021/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(21)00271-8 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020004038 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2021 Apr 27;5(8):2128-2136. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020004038.,20210531,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphocyte Count', '*Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell', 'Recurrence', 'T-Lymphocytes']",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review is meant to summarize the latest literature in the diagnostic testing and interpretation and offer a stepwise diagnostic approach for a patient presenting with monocytosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Basic studies have highlighted the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity in the monocyte compartment. Studies, both translational and clinical, have provided insights into why monocytosis occurs and how to distinguish the different etiologies. Flow cytometry studies have illustrated that monocyte repartitioning can distinguish chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, a prototypical neoplasm with monocytosis from other reactive or neoplastic causes. In summary, we provide an algorithmic approach to the diagnosis of a patient presenting with monocytosis and expect this document to serve as a reference guide for clinicians.","['Mangaonkar, Abhishek A', 'Tande, Aaron J', 'Bekele, Delamo I']","['Mangaonkar AA', 'Tande AJ', 'Bekele DI']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2458-9887'],"['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. mangaonkar.abhishek@mayo.edu.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210420,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,PMC8057007,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia', '*Classical', '*Intermediate', '*Monocytes', '*Monocytosis', '*Non-classical']",2021/04/22 06:00,2021/08/31 06:00,['2021/04/21 06:54'],"['2021/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/31 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/21 06:54 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-021-00618-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-021-00618-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2021 Jun;16(3):267-275. doi: 10.1007/s11899-021-00618-4.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to play key roles in different types of cancer, including OSCC. It was previously reported that lncRNA deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 1 (DLEU1) is notably upregulated in OSCC; however, the role of DLEU1 in OSCC remains unclear. Gene and protein expression levels in OSCC cells were detected by reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR and western blotting, respectively, in the present study. A Transwell assay was performed to measure cell migration and invasion. Flow cytometry was used to detect cell apoptosis, and the dualluciferase reporter assay was applied to confirm the interaction between DLEU1, microRNA (miR)1495p and CDK6 in OSCC cells. DLEU1 expression was negatively associated with the survival rate of patients with OSCC. In addition, silencing of DLEU1 notably inhibited the proliferation of OSCC cells by inducing apoptosis. Meanwhile, DLEU1 directly bound to miR1495p, and CDK6 was found to be the direct target of miR1495p. Furthermore, DLEU1 knockdowninduced inhibition of OSCC cell proliferation was significantly reversed by the miR1495p antagomir. Knockdown of lncRNA DLEU1 reversed the proliferation of OSCC cells via regulation of the miR1495p/CDK6 axis. Thus, DLEU1 may serve as a novel target for treating OSCC.","['Lv, Tianzhu', 'Liu, Hongjing', 'Wu, Yadong', 'Huang, Wentao']","['Lv T', 'Liu H', 'Wu Y', 'Huang W']",,"['Department of Emergency General, The Affiliated Stomatological Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou 550025, P.R.

These high prices raise concerns for patient access and the sustainability of healthcare systems. We aimed to estimate the costs and budget impact associated with CAR T-cell therapies for current and future indications in hematological cancers from 2019 to 2029. We focused on the former France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom (EU-5) and the Netherlands. We conducted a review of list prices, health technology assessment reports, budget impact analysis dossiers, and published cost-effectiveness analyses. We forecasted the 10-year health expenditures on CAR T-cells for several hematological cancers in selected European Union countries. Nine cost-effectiveness studies were identified and list prices for CAR T-cell therapies ranged between 307 200 EUR and 350 000 EUR. Estimated additional costs for pre- and post-treatment were 50 359 EUR per patient, whereas the incremental costs of CAR T-cell therapy (when compared with care as usual) ranged between 276 086 EUR and 328 727 EUR. We estimated market entry of CAR T-cell therapies for chronic mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, and acute myeloid leukemia in 2021, 2022, 2022, 2022, and 2025, respectively. Cumulative expenditure estimates for existing and future indications from 2019 to 2029 were on average 28.5 billion EUR, 32.8 billion EUR, and 28.9 billion EUR when considering CAR T-cell therapy costs only, CAR T-cell therapy costs including pre- and post-treatment, and incremental CAR T-cell therapy costs, respectively. CAR T-cell therapies seem to be promising treatment options for hematological cancers but the financial burden on healthcare systems in the former EU-5 and the Netherlands will contribute to a substantial rise in healthcare expenditure in the field of hematology.","['Heine, Renaud', 'Thielen, Frederick W', 'Koopmanschap, Marc', 'Kersten, Marie Jose', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Jaeger, Ulrich', 'Sonneveld, Pieter', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Smand, Carin', 'Uyl-de Groot, Carin A']","['Heine R', 'Thielen FW', 'Koopmanschap M', 'Kersten MJ', 'Einsele H', 'Jaeger U', 'Sonneveld P', 'Sierra J', 'Smand C', 'Uyl-de Groot CA']",,"['Erasmus School of Health Policy and Management, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Erasmus School of Health Policy and Management, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Erasmus School of Health Policy and Management, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam and LYMMCARE (Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam), Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Department of Haematology, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital de la Santa Creu I Sant Pau, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma of Barcelona, Spain.', 'European Hematology Association, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Erasmus School of Health Policy and Management, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Institute for Medical Technology Assessment, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210128,United States,Hemasphere,HemaSphere,101740619,PMC8051992,,,2021/04/22 06:00,2021/04/22 06:01,['2021/04/21 06:45'],"['2020/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/21 06:45 [entrez]', '2021/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/22 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1097/HS9.0000000000000524 [doi]'],epublish,Hemasphere. 2021 Jan 28;5(2):e524. doi: 10.1097/HS9.0000000000000524. eCollection 2021 Feb.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

However, the analytical performances of targeted RNA sequencing have not been extensively described in diagnostic samples. Using a targeted panel of 1385 cancer-related genes in a series of 100 diagnosis samples and 8 controls, we detected all the already known fusion transcripts and also discovered unknown and/or unsuspected fusion transcripts in 12 samples. Regarding the analysis of transcriptomic profiles, we show that targeted RNA sequencing is performant to discriminate acute lymphoblastic leukemia entities driven by different oncogenic translocations. Additionally, we show that 86% of the mutations identified at the DNA level are also detectable at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level, except for nonsense mutations that are subjected to mRNA decay. We conclude that targeted RNA sequencing might improve the diagnosis of hematological malignancies. Standardization of the preanalytical steps and further refinements of the panel design and of the bioinformatical pipelines will be an important step towards its use in standard diagnostic procedures.","['Hayette, Sandrine', 'Grange, Beatrice', 'Vallee, Maxime', 'Bardel, Claire', 'Huet, Sarah', 'Mosnier, Isabelle', 'Chabane, Kaddour', 'Simonet, Thomas', 'Balsat, Marie', 'Heiblig, Mael', 'Tigaud, Isabelle', 'Nicolini, Franck E', 'Mareschal, Sylvain', 'Salles, Gilles', 'Sujobert, Pierre']","['Hayette S', 'Grange B', 'Vallee M', 'Bardel C', 'Huet S', 'Mosnier I', 'Chabane K', 'Simonet T', 'Balsat M', 'Heiblig M', 'Tigaud I', 'Nicolini FE', 'Mareschal S', 'Salles G', 'Sujobert P']",,"[""Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hopital Lyon Sud, Service d'hematologie biologique, Pierre-Benite, France."", 'Cancer Research Center of Lyon, INSERM U1052 UMR CNRS 5286, Equipe labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, Universite de Lyon, France.', 'French group of CML, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.', ""Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hopital Lyon Sud, Service d'hematologie biologique, Pierre-Benite, France."", 'Hospices Civils de Lyon, Plateforme de sequencage NGS-HCL, cellule bioinformatique, Bron, France.', 'Hospices Civils de Lyon, Plateforme de sequencage NGS-HCL, cellule bioinformatique, Bron, France.', 'Universite de Lyon, Universite Lyon 1, CNRS, Laboratoire de Biometrie et Biologie Evolutive UMR 5558, Lyon, France.', ""Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hopital Lyon Sud, Service d'hematologie biologique, Pierre-Benite, France."", 'Cancer Research Center of Lyon, INSERM U1052 UMR CNRS 5286, Equipe labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, Universite de Lyon, France.', ""Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hopital Lyon Sud, Service d'hematologie biologique, Pierre-Benite, France."", ""Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hopital Lyon Sud, Service d'hematologie biologique, Pierre-Benite, France."", 'Hospices Civils de Lyon, Plateforme de sequencage NGS-HCL, cellule bioinformatique, Bron, France.', ""Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hopital Lyon Sud, Service d'hematologie clinique, Pierre-Benite, France."", ""Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hopital Lyon Sud, Service d'hematologie clinique, Pierre-Benite, France."", ""Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hopital Lyon Sud, Service d'hematologie biologique, Pierre-Benite, France."", 'French group of CML, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.', 'French group of CML, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.', 'Hematology Department and INSERM U1052, CRCL, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Lyon, INSERM U1052 UMR CNRS 5286, Equipe labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, Universite de Lyon, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Lyon, INSERM U1052 UMR CNRS 5286, Equipe labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, Universite de Lyon, France.', ""Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hopital Lyon Sud, Service d'hematologie clinique, Pierre-Benite, France."", ""Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hopital Lyon Sud, Service d'hematologie biologique, Pierre-Benite, France."", 'Cancer Research Center of Lyon, INSERM U1052 UMR CNRS 5286, Equipe labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, Universite de Lyon, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210127,United States,Hemasphere,HemaSphere,101740619,PMC8051993,,,2021/04/22 06:00,2021/04/22 06:01,['2021/04/21 06:45'],"['2020/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/21 06:45 [entrez]', '2021/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/22 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1097/HS9.0000000000000522 [doi]'],epublish,Hemasphere. 2021 Jan 27;5(2):e522. doi: 10.1097/HS9.0000000000000522. eCollection 2021 Feb.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 the Author(s).

Three cases (Case 1, 2, 3) were insensitive to conventional therapy and inhibitors with high-level MRD on days 19 and 46, but they all achieved complete remission at the molecular level with Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy regardless of primary resistance or recurrence. Although remission was initially achieved for Case 4, chemotherapeutics was not sensitive after recurrence. However, CAR-T cell therapy gave him the chance to obtain complement remission again. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with fever, chills, acute kidney injury, hypotension and capillary leak syndrome and CAR-T related encephalopathy syndrome (CRE) with seizures and encephaledema occurred after CAR-T cell therapy, but symptoms disappeared with effective intensive care. Overall, CAR-T cell therapy enabled the patients to achieve complement remission with controllable adverse events.

The heterogenic clinical course of CLL mainly depends on different pathogenetic mechanisms which appears in a form of variable biological and clinical features. These features allow stratification of patients into subsets with different outcomes. Patients and Methods: We evaluated the DAT as a prognostic marker in 120 CLL patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy. Clinical and laboratory features, treatment response, and survival outcomes of CLL patients were assessed in relation to their DAT test status. Additionally, the English literature was extensively reviewed regarding the prognostic impact of a positive DAT in CLL. Results: DAT positivity was detected in 36 patients (30%) and was associated advanced disease staging (P = 0.03). No correlations were found with other clinical, laboratory, or biological factors such as ZAP-70 or CD38. Both a positive DAT and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >2 were predictors for non-response to first-line treatment in the multivariate analysis (OR = 0.3, 95% CI: 0.12-0.8 and OR = 0.2, 95% CI: 0.08-0.8, respectively). The five-year progression-free survival was significantly lower in the DAT-positive group (P = 0.004). No significant association was found with overall survival (P = 0.2). Sixteen reports analyzing more than 11,000 patients were identified in our review.

NPM1-mutated AML has been recognized as distinct entity in the 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of lympho-haematopoietic neoplasms. WHO criteria allow recognition of this leukaemia entity and its distinction from AML with myelodysplasia-related changes, AML with BCR-ABL1 rearrangement and AML with RUNX1 mutations. Nevertheless, controversial issues include the percentage of blasts required for the diagnosis of NPM1-mutated AML and whether cases of NPM1-mutated myelodysplasia and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia do exist. Evaluation of NPM1 and FLT3 status represents a major pillar of the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) genetic-based risk stratification model. Moreover, NPM1 mutations are particularly suitable for assessing measurable residual disease (MRD) since they are frequent, stable at relapse and do not drive clonal haematopoiesis. Ideally, combining monitoring of MRD with the ELN prognostication model can help to guide therapeutic decisions. Here, we provide examples of instructive cases of NPM1-mutated AML, in order to provide criteria for the appropriate diagnosis and therapy of this frequent leukaemia entity.","['Falini, Brunangelo', 'Sciabolacci, Sofia', 'Falini, Lorenza', 'Brunetti, Lorenzo', 'Martelli, Maria Paola']","['Falini B', 'Sciabolacci S', 'Falini L', 'Brunetti L', 'Martelli MP']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7198-5965', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9139-1729']","['Institute of Haematology, Centro Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche (CREO), Ospedale S.

However, there is few data concerning the evolution and the optimal treatment of these rare associations. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 57-year-old immunocompromised woman, who was treated for chronic lymphocytic leukemia 3 years prior to admission, was hospitalized with abdominal pain revealing severe acute pancreatitis. The day after admission, a pruritic rash appeared on her face, trunk, and limbs, sparing the palmoplantar regions. At the same time, fever, thrombocytopenia (27 x 109/L), major hyperferritinemia (11,063 mug/mL), hypertriglyceridemia (2.56 mmol/L) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (1441 IU/L) suggested HLH. DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis of chickenpox (varicella) was established. Primary VZV infection was then confirmed: cutaneous and plasma VZV polymerase chain reactions were positives, VZV serology was negative for IgG. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with aciclovir was started intravenously after the onset of the rash, for a total of 10 days. A 48-h surveillance in intensive care was carried out. OUTCOMES: Acute pancreatitis and biological abnormalities evolved favorably under aciclovir. Platelet count was normalized 6 days after admission to hospital. LESSONS: A favorable outcome of primary VZV infection associated with severe acute pancreatitis and probable HLH in an immunocompromised patient is possible with aciclovir alone.","['Berar, Antoine', 'Ardois, Samuel', 'Walter-Moraux, Patricia', 'Jegonday, Marc-Antoine', 'Henriot, Basile']","['Berar A', 'Ardois S', 'Walter-Moraux P', 'Jegonday MA', 'Henriot B']",,"['CHU Rennes, Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Rennes.', 'CHU Rennes, Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Rennes.', 'CH Rene Pleven, Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Dinan.', 'CHU Rennes, Department of Radiology, Rennes.', 'CH Rene Pleven, Department of Internal Medicine, Dinan.', 'CH Broussais, Department of Internal Medicine, Saint-Malo, France.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,PMC8078430,,,2021/04/22 06:00,2021/04/27 06:00,['2021/04/21 06:20'],"['2020/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/21 06:20 [entrez]', '2021/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000025351 [doi]', '00005792-202104230-00012 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2021 Apr 23;100(16):e25351. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000025351.,20210426,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 3, Human/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host/*immunology', 'Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic/*immunology/virology', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancreatitis/*immunology/virology', 'Varicella Zoster Virus Infection/*immunology/virology']","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

Thus, we aimed to investigate whether anemia increases the risk of cancer. METHODS: Adult individuals who underwent a standardized medical examination during 2002 and 2003 in South Korea were included, and their cancer status was evaluated between January 2004 and December 2015 (12 years) as a primary endpoint. Anemia was defined as serum hemoglobin levels of <12 and <13 g/dL for women and men, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 454,304 adults were included in the final analysis. Among them, 41,947 (9.2%) and 412,357 (90.8%) individuals constituted the anemia and control groups, respectively. After propensity score matching, a total of 83,886 individuals (41,943 per group) were included in the analysis. Cox regression revealed that the risk of cancer in the anemia group was 3% higher than that in the control group (HR, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.05; P = 0.023). Specifically, relative to the control group, the anemia group was at an increased risk of gastric (HR, 1.29), esophageal (HR, 1.37), lung (HR, 1.14), and thyroid cancers (HR, 1.14), neoplasms of breast and genital organs (HR, 1.12), and lymphoma or leukemia (HR, 1.63). CONCLUSIONS: Anemia was independently associated with an increased overall risk of cancer. Further research is required to clarify the associated mechanism. IMPACT: Anemia was independently associated with an increased overall risk of cancer in the South Korean population.","['Oh, Tak Kyu', 'Song, In-Ae']","['Oh TK', 'Song IA']",,"['Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea. songoficu@outlook.kr.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210420,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,,,2021/04/22 06:00,2021/04/22 06:00,['2021/04/21 06:16'],"['2020/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/11 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/22 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/21 06:16 [entrez]']","['1055-9965.EPI-20-1840 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-20-1840 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2021 Jul;30(7):1440-1448. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-20-1840.

The toxic lesions caused by daunorubicin induce various modes of cell death, including apoptosis. Apoptosis is highly regulated programmed cell death that can be initiated mainly via two pathways, through death receptors (extrinsic) or involvement of the mitochondria (intrinsic). Induction of apoptosis via these pathways has been alluded following treatment with daunorubicin, but never compared in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia over a time course. METHODS: This study investigated the mechanisms of daunorubicin induced apoptosis in the treatment of CCRF-CEM, MOLT-4 (acute T-lymphoblastic leukaemia) and SUP-B15 (acute B-lymphoblastic leukaemia) cells. Cells were treated with daunorubicin for 4 h, and then placed in recovery medium (without daunorubicin) for 4 h, 12 h and 24 h. Apoptotic response was analysing using annexin-V expression, caspase activity, mitochondrial membrane potential change and an array to detect 43 apoptotic proteins. RESULTS: Daunorubicin induced apoptosis in all leukemic cell lines, but with different levels and duration of response. Both apoptosis levels and caspase activity increased after four hours recovery then declined in CCRF-CEM and MOLT-4 cells. However, SUP-B15 cells displayed initially comparable levels but remained elevated over the 24 h assessment period. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential occurred in both MOLT-4 and CCRF-CEM cells but not in SUP-B15 cells. Expression of apoptotic proteins, including Bcl-2, Bax, caspase 3 and FADD, indicated that daunorubicin potentially induced both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis in both CCRF-CEM and MOLT-4 cells, but only extrinsic apoptosis in SUP-B15 cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes variations in sensitivities and timing of apoptotic responses in different leukaemia cell lines. These differences could be attributed to the lack of functional p53 in coordinating the cells response following cytotoxic treatment with daunorubicin, which appears to delay apoptosis and utilises alternative signalling mechanisms that need to be further explored.","['Al-Aamri, Hussain Mubarak', 'Irving, Helen R', 'Bradley, Christopher', 'Meehan-Andrews, Terri']","['Al-Aamri HM', 'Irving HR', 'Bradley C', 'Meehan-Andrews T']",,"['Department of Pharmacy and Biomedical Science, La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science (LIMS), La Trobe University, P.O.

Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) is a potential chemotherapeutic agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), but the effectiveness is affected by potential cardiotoxicity. Researchers have been trying to find out novel modalities to manage the adverse effects of As2O3. In our study, the antioxidant molecule eugenol showed protective action against the destructive impact of As2O3 on cardiomyocytes (H9c2) without compromising the anti-cancer property As2O3 on leukemia cells (HL-60). We have studied the interaction between arsenic and eugenol in physiological and acidic pH to understand the molecular mechanism of differential action of As2O3 in the presence of eugenol using NMR spectroscopy. The study observed that at physiological pH, arsenic and eugenol interact to form an inactive product, positively affecting H9c2 cardiomyocytes.

In a multicenter nationwide study, we assessed 41 patients who were treated with post-transplant TKIs (sorafenib, n = 23, midostaurin, n = 18). The majority also received TKIs pre-transplant (n = 32, 79%). After a median follow up of 10 months post-transplant (range 3-53.6), 29 patients (71%) were alive and in complete remission. Similar results were seen in a subgroup analysis of pre-transplant TKI recipients (78%). In Univariate analysis, HCT-CI score < 4 and Type of TKI (sorafenib versus midostaurin) predicted longer overall survival. Seventeen patients (41%) suffered from side effects and seven patients (17%) stopped TKI therapy due to adverse events. Overall, our data suggest that post-transplant use of TKIs is safe and effective in an era of their widespread use prior to AlloSCT.","['Shimony, Shai', 'Yeshurun, Moshe', 'Wolach, Ofir', 'Ram, Ron', 'Rozovski, Uri', 'Shargian, Liat', 'Zukerman, Tsila', 'Amit, Odelia', 'Bar-On, Yael', 'Krayem, Baher', 'Avni, Batya', 'Peretz, Galit', 'Raanani, Pia', 'Pasvolsky, Oren']","['Shimony S', 'Yeshurun M', 'Wolach O', 'Ram R', 'Rozovski U', 'Shargian L', 'Zukerman T', 'Amit O', 'Bar-On Y', 'Krayem B', 'Avni B', 'Peretz G', 'Raanani P', 'Pasvolsky O']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7245-9652', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8662-0707', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6429-148X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6204-977X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9193-0059']","['Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, and Rappaport Faculty of Medicine - Technion, Haifa, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, and Rappaport Faculty of Medicine - Technion, Haifa, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Hadassah Medical Center and Hebrew University Faculty of Medicine, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Soroka Medical center and Faculty of Medicine, Beer Sheva, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study']",20210421,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*FLT3 inhibitors', '*post-transplantation maintenance']",2021/04/22 06:00,2021/11/03 06:00,['2021/04/21 05:35'],"['2021/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/03 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/21 05:35 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2021.1913145 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2021 Oct;62(10):2475-2481. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2021.1913145.

METHODS: This ecological study was performed using an exploratory mixed design. The study population consists of 3769 children with ALL who were reported in the National Cancer Registry Program of Iran from 2006 to 2014. Data analysis was conducted using Mann-Whitney U, joinpoint regression analysis, Global Moran's I and Anselin Local Moran's I. RESULTS: The average annual incidence rate of ALL was 2.25 per 100000 children under 15 years of age during the study period, which was 1.37 times higher in males. The average annual percentage change (AAPC) of the disease was 7.1%, which is higher than that of developed countries. The incidence of ALL was higher in spring and summer and its peak incidence was at the age of 2-5. Spatial autocorrelation of the ALL was 0.358 and significant (P value <0.001). The high-risk cluster of ALL was identified in Fars and Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad provinces and the low-risk cluster in Kermanshah, Zanjan and Kurdistan provinces. CONCLUSION: The incidence of ALL is on rise in Iranian children and appropriate healthcare services are required to prevent new cases of this disease in high-risk areas.","['Rahimi Pordanjani, Sajjad', 'Kavousi, Amir', 'Mirbagheri, Babak', 'Shahsavani, Abbas', 'Etemad, Koorosh']","['Rahimi Pordanjani S', 'Kavousi A', 'Mirbagheri B', 'Shahsavani A', 'Etemad K']",,"['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health and Safety, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Workplace Health Promotion Research Center, Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health and Safety, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Center for Remote Sensing and GIS Research, Faculty of Earth Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Environmental and Occupational Hazards Control Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Environmental Health Engineering, School of Public Health and Safety, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health and Safety, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210301,Iran,Arch Iran Med,Archives of Iranian medicine,100889644,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Children', '*Ecological', '*Leukemia', '*Seasonal variation', '*Spatial autocorrelation']",2021/04/22 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2021/04/21 05:30'],"['2020/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/21 05:30 [entrez]', '2021/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.34172/aim.2021.34 [doi]'],epublish,Arch Iran Med. 2021 Mar 1;24(3):224-232. doi: 10.34172/aim.2021.34.,20211112,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Spatio-Temporal Analysis']","['(c) 2021 The Author(s).

The abnormal activation of JAK2/STAT3/MCL-1 and NF-kappaB has been confirmed as the main reason for the development of CRPC. We previously found that beta-elemonic acid (beta-EA) as a natural triterpene has potential anti-inflammatory and anti-osteosarcoma effects with lower toxicity. But it remains unknown whether it had effects on CRPC. The present research in vitro and in vivo systematically investigates anti-cancer effects and mechanisms of beta-EA on human CRPC. beta-EA treatment resulted in apoptotic cell death in human PCa cells by mitochondrial apoptotic pathways (including up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, and Bax or down-regulation of Bcl-2). Besides, beta-EA at relatively lower levels inhibited colony-forming, the migration and invasion potential of PCa cells, indicating its anti-proliferation and anti-metastasis activities. After exploring the potential mechanism, our results suggested that it subsequently inhibited the activation of JAK2/STAT3/MCL-1 and NF-kappaB signaling pathway by the administration of beta-EA. The silencing of NF-kappaB/p65, JAK2 and STAT3, respectively, increased the sensitivity of the PCa cells to beta-EA induced apoptosis. Moreover, beta-EA exhibited a strong affinity with its essential proteins JAK2, RELA/p65, NF-kappaBIalpha/IkappaBalpha by molecular docking analysis. Importantly, beta-EA retards tumor growth in a murine xenograft model, consistent with our study in vitro. Taken together, findings from this study reveal for the first time the potential role and mechanisms of beta-EA on CRPC.","['Bao, Xiaowen', 'Zhu, Jianwei', 'Ren, Chaoxing', 'Zhao, Ang', 'Zhang, Mingya', 'Zhu, Zhiming', 'Lu, Xuanzhao', 'Zhang, Yuning', 'Li, Xiaotian', 'Sima, Xinyu', 'Li, Jiaqi', 'Zhang, Qi', 'Ma, Bo']","['Bao X', 'Zhu J', 'Ren C', 'Zhao A', 'Zhang M', 'Zhu Z', 'Lu X', 'Zhang Y', 'Li X', 'Sima X', 'Li J', 'Zhang Q', 'Ma B']",,"[""School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450001, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, 210009, People's Republic of China.

Here, we identified aberrant ZAP70 expression as a common feature in a broad range of B cell malignancies. We validated SYK as the kinase that sets the thresholds for negative selection of autoreactive and premalignant clones. When aberrantly expressed in B cells, ZAP70 competes with SYK at the BCR signalosome and redirects SYK from negative selection to tonic PI3K signaling, thereby promoting B cell survival. In genetic mouse models for B-ALL and B-CLL, conditional expression of Zap70 accelerated disease onset, while genetic deletion impaired malignant transformation. Inducible activation of Zap70 during B cell development compromised negative selection of autoreactive B cells, resulting in pervasive autoantibody production. Strict segregation of the two kinases is critical for normal B cell selection and represents a central safeguard against the development of autoimmune disease and B cell malignancies.","['Sadras, Teresa', 'Martin, Mickael', 'Kume, Kohei', 'Robinson, Mark E', 'Saravanakumar, Supraja', 'Lenz, Gal', 'Chen, Zhengshan', 'Song, Joo Y', 'Siddiqi, Tanya', 'Oksa, Laura', 'Knapp, Anne Marie', 'Cutler, Jevon', 'Cosgun, Kadriye Nehir', 'Klemm, Lars', 'Ecker, Veronika', 'Winchester, Janet', 'Ghergus, Dana', 'Soulas-Sprauel, Pauline', 'Kiefer, Friedemann', 'Heisterkamp, Nora', 'Pandey, Akhilesh', 'Ngo, Vu', 'Wang, Lili', 'Jumaa, Hassan', 'Buchner, Maike', 'Ruland, Jurgen', 'Chan, Wing-Chung', 'Meffre, Eric', 'Martin, Thierry', 'Muschen, Markus']","['Sadras T', 'Martin M', 'Kume K', 'Robinson ME', 'Saravanakumar S', 'Lenz G', 'Chen Z', 'Song JY', 'Siddiqi T', 'Oksa L', 'Knapp AM', 'Cutler J', 'Cosgun KN', 'Klemm L', 'Ecker V', 'Winchester J', 'Ghergus D', 'Soulas-Sprauel P', 'Kiefer F', 'Heisterkamp N', 'Pandey A', 'Ngo V', 'Wang L', 'Jumaa H', 'Buchner M', 'Ruland J', 'Chan WC', 'Meffre E', 'Martin T', 'Muschen M']",,"['Center of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, Yale Cancer Center, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA; Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'CNRS UPR 3572 ""Immunopathology and Therapeutic Chemistry,"" Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology (IBMC), Strasbourg, France; Department of Clinical Immunology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France.', 'Center of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, Yale Cancer Center, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Center of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, Yale Cancer Center, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Tampere Center for Child Health Research, Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University, Tampere, Finland.', 'CNRS UPR 3572 ""Immunopathology and Therapeutic Chemistry,"" Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology (IBMC), Strasbourg, France.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Center of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, Yale Cancer Center, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Center of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, Yale Cancer Center, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, USA; Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Pathobiochemistry, Technical University of Munich, Klinikum rechts der Isar, 81675 Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Systems Biology, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'CNRS UPR 3572 ""Immunopathology and Therapeutic Chemistry,"" Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology (IBMC), Strasbourg, France; Department of Clinical Immunology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France.', 'Mammalian Cell Signaling Laboratory, Department of Vascular Cell Biology, Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Systems Biology, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Pathobiochemistry, Technical University of Munich, Klinikum rechts der Isar, 81675 Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Pathobiochemistry, Technical University of Munich, Klinikum rechts der Isar, 81675 Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.

One major point of intervention for potential prevention of chronic GVHD occurs at the time of transplantation when acute donor anti-recipient immune responses first set the events in motion that result in chronic GVHD. After transplantation, additional insults causing tissue injury can incite aberrant immune responses and loss of tolerance, further contributing to chronic GVHD. Points of intervention are actively being identified so that chronic GVHD initiation pathways can be targeted without affecting immune function. The major objective in the field is to continue basic studies and to translate what is learned about etiopathology to develop targeted prevention strategies that decrease the risk of morbid chronic GVHD without increasing the risks of cancer relapse or infection. Development of strategies to predict the risk of developing debilitating or deadly chronic GVHD is a high research priority. This working group recommends further interrogation into the mechanisms underpinning chronic GVHD development, and we highlight considerations for future trial design in prevention trials.","['Williams, Kirsten M', 'Inamoto, Yoshihiro', 'Im, Annie', 'Hamilton, Betty', 'Koreth, John', 'Arora, Mukta', 'Pusic, Iskra', 'Mays, Jacqueline W', 'Carpenter, Paul A', 'Luznik, Leo', 'Reddy, Pavan', 'Ritz, Jerome', 'Greinix, Hildegard', 'Paczesny, Sophie', 'Blazar, Bruce R', 'Pidala, Joseph', 'Cutler, Corey', 'Wolff, Daniel', 'Schultz, Kirk R', 'Pavletic, Steven Z', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Martin, Paul J', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Sarantopoulos, Stefanie']","['Williams KM', 'Inamoto Y', 'Im A', 'Hamilton B', 'Koreth J', 'Arora M', 'Pusic I', 'Mays JW', 'Carpenter PA', 'Luznik L', 'Reddy P', 'Ritz J', 'Greinix H', 'Paczesny S', 'Blazar BR', 'Pidala J', 'Cutler C', 'Wolff D', 'Schultz KR', 'Pavletic SZ', 'Lee SJ', 'Martin PJ', 'Socie G', 'Sarantopoulos S']",,"[""Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology Oncology, University of Pittsburgh, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'BMT and Leukemia Section, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Divsion of Hematology and Oncology, University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Clinical Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Division of Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplantation & Cellular Therapy, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Immunotherapy, H.

But the future of stored CB units should be to extend their use in updated transplant approaches and develop new CB applications. Thus, CBT will require a coordinated, multicentric, review of transplantation methods and an upgrade and realignment of banking resources and operations. Significant improvements have already been proposed to support the clinical perspective including definition of the cellular threshold for engraftment, development of transplantation methods for adult patients, engraftment acceleration with single cell expansion and homing technologies, personalised protocols to improve efficacy, use of adoptive cell therapy to mitigate delayed immune reconstitution, and further enhancement of the graft-versus-leukaemia effect using advanced therapies. The role of CB banks in improving transplantation results are also critical by optimizing the collection, processing, storage and characterization of CB units, and improving reproducibility, efficiency and cost of banking. But future developments beyond transplantation are needed. This implies the extension from transplantation banks to banks that support cell therapy, regenerative medicine and specialized transfusion medicine. This new ""CB banking 2.0"" concept will require promotion of international scientific and technical collaborations between bank specialists, clinical investigators and transplant physicians.","['Querol, Sergio', 'Rubinstein, Pablo', 'Madrigal, Alejandro']","['Querol S', 'Rubinstein P', 'Madrigal A']",,"['Cell Therapy Services and Cord Blood Bank, Catalan Blood and Tissue Bank, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Emeritus Scientist, New York Blood Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'UCL Cancer Institute, Royal Free NHS Trust UCL, London, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210420,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CB banks', '*cell and advanced therapies', '*cryopreserved cord blood', '*haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation', '*specialised transfusion']",2021/04/21 06:00,2021/12/24 06:00,['2021/04/20 12:29'],"['2021/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/20 12:29 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.17468 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2021 Nov;195(4):507-517. doi: 10.1111/bjh.17468.

Previous work has shown that miR-124-3p leads to malignant progression of cancer including cell apoptosis, migration, invasion, drug resistance, and also recovers neural function, affects adipogenic differentiation, facilitates wound healing through control of various target genes. miR-124-3p has been mainly previously characterized as a tumor suppressor regulating tumorigenesis and progression in several cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), gastric cancer (GC), bladder cancer, ovarian cancer (OC), and leukemia, as a tumor promotor in breast cancer (BC), and it has been also widely studied in a variety of neurological diseases, like Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and cardiovascular diseases, ulcerative colitis (UC), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To lay the groundwork for future therapeutic strategies, in this review we mainly focus on the most recent years of literature on the functions of miR-124-3p in related major cancers, as well as its downstream target genes. Although current work as yet provides an incomplete picture, miR-124-3p is still worthy of more attention as a practical and effective clinical biomarker.","['Li, Qian', 'Liu, Shuqing', 'Yan, Jinsong', 'Sun, Ming-Zhong', 'Greenaway, Frederick T']","['Li Q', 'Liu S', 'Yan J', 'Sun MZ', 'Greenaway FT']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6125-6710'],"['Department of Biotechnology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Dalian Medical University, 9 West Section, Lvshun Southern Road, Dalian, 116044, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Dalian Key Laboratory of Hematology, Diamond Bay Institute of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, 116027, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Dalian Medical University, 9 West Section, Lvshun Southern Road, Dalian, 116044, China. lsqsmz@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Dalian Key Laboratory of Hematology, Diamond Bay Institute of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, 116027, China. lsqsmz@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Dalian Key Laboratory of Hematology, Diamond Bay Institute of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, 116027, China.', 'Department of Biotechnology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Dalian Medical University, 9 West Section, Lvshun Southern Road, Dalian, 116044, China. smzlsq@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Dalian Key Laboratory of Hematology, Diamond Bay Institute of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, 116027, China. smzlsq@163.com.', 'Carlson School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Clark University, Worcester, MA, 01610, USA.']",['eng'],['81672737/National Natural Science Foundation of China'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210420,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Disease', 'Function', 'Mechanism', 'miR-124-3p']",2021/04/21 06:00,2021/06/10 06:00,['2021/04/20 12:26'],"['2021/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/10 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/20 12:26 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11033-021-06347-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s11033-021-06347-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2021 Apr;48(4):3579-3591. doi: 10.1007/s11033-021-06347-4.

We aimed to investigate the associations between childhood leukemia and perinatal characteristics including birth order, birth interval to older siblings, parental age, birth weight, and multiple birth. METHODS: We identified cases diagnosed between 1981 and 2015 and born in Switzerland between 1969 and 2015 from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry and randomly sampled five controls per case from national birth records matched on date of birth, sex, and municipality of residence at birth. We used conditional logistic regression to investigate associations between perinatal characteristics and leukemia at ages 0-15 and 0-4 years, and the subtypes acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RESULTS: The study included 1,403 cases of leukemia. We observed increased risks associated with high birth weight (adjusted OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.12-1.69) and multiple birth (1.89, 1.24-2.86). These associations were similar for ALL and stronger for leukemia at ages 0-4 years. For AML, we observed an increased risk for higher birth order (3.08, 0.43-22.03 for fourth or later born children). We found no associations with other perinatal characteristics. CONCLUSION: This register-based case-control study adds to the existing evidence of a positive association between high birth weight and risk of childhood leukemia. Furthermore, it suggests children from multiple births are at an increased risk of leukemia.","['Lupatsch, Judith E', 'Kreis, Christian', 'Konstantinoudis, Garyfallos', 'Ansari, Marc', 'Kuehni, Claudia E', 'Spycher, Ben D']","['Lupatsch JE', 'Kreis C', 'Konstantinoudis G', 'Ansari M', 'Kuehni CE', 'Spycher BD']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5273-1954', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7493-9334', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9649-6498', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8957-2002', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1430-5695']","['Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Mittelstrasse 43, 3012, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Medicine, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Mittelstrasse 43, 3012, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Mittelstrasse 43, 3012, Bern, Switzerland.', 'MRC Centre of Environment and Health, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'CANSEARCH Research Laboratory, Department of Paediatrics, Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Geneva University, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Onco-Hematology Unit, Department of Women, Child and Adolescent, Geneva University Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Mittelstrasse 43, 3012, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Mittelstrasse 43, 3012, Bern, Switzerland. ben.spycher@ispm.unibe.ch.']",['eng'],"['3049-08-2012/Krebsforschung Schweiz', '3515-08-2014/Krebsforschung Schweiz', '4012-08-2016/Krebsforschung Schweiz', '4592-08-2018/Krebsliga Schweiz', 'PZ00P3_147987/Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen', 'Forschung']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20210420,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,PMC8184536,['NOTNLM'],"['Birth weight', 'Epidemiology', 'Maternal age', 'Parity', 'Paternal age', 'Twins']",2021/04/21 06:00,2021/07/13 06:00,['2021/04/20 12:26'],"['2020/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/20 12:26 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10552-021-01423-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s10552-021-01423-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2021 Jul;32(7):713-723. doi: 10.1007/s10552-021-01423-3.

The best predictor of MJON was cumulative oral glucocorticoid dose. Risk of MJON was 12-fold higher in patients who had a second risk factor for osteonecrosis. Further research is needed into strategies for prevention of MJON. INTRODUCTION: Osteonecrosis (ON) is a debilitating musculoskeletal condition in which bone cell death can lead to mechanical failure. When multiple joints are affected, pain and disability are compounded. Glucocorticoid treatment is one of the most common predisposing factors for ON. This study investigated risk factors for ON involving multiple joints (MJON) among glucocorticoid-treated patients. METHODS: Fifty-five adults with glucocorticoid-induced ON were prospectively enrolled. MJON was defined as ON in >/= three joints. Route, dose, duration, and timing of glucocorticoid treatment were assessed. RESULTS: Mean age of enrolled subjects was 44 years, 58% were women. Half had underlying conditions associated with increased ON risk: systemic lupus erythematosus (29%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (11%), HIV (9%), and alcohol use (4%). Mean daily oral dose of glucocorticoids was 29 mg. Average cumulative oral dose was 30 g over 5 years. The best predictor of MJON was cumulative oral glucocorticoid dose. For each increase of 1,000 mg, risk of MJON increased by 3.2% (95% CI 1.03, 1.67). Glucocorticoid exposure in the first 6 months of therapy, peak dose (oral or IV), and mean daily dose did not independently increase risk of MJON. The risk of MJON was 12-fold in patients who had a second risk factor (95% CI 3.2, 44.4). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with glucocorticoid-induced ON, cumulative oral dose was the best predictor of multi-joint disease; initial doses of IV and oral glucocorticoids did not independently increase risk. Further research is needed to better define optimal strategies for prevention and treatment of MJON.","['Krez, A', 'Lane, J', 'Heilbronner, A', 'Park-Min, K-H', 'Kaneko, K', 'Pannellini, T', 'Mintz, D', 'Hansen, D', 'McMahon, D J', 'Kirou, K A', 'Roboz, G', 'Desai, P', 'Bockman, R S', 'Stein, E M']","['Krez A', 'Lane J', 'Heilbronner A', 'Park-Min KH', 'Kaneko K', 'Pannellini T', 'Mintz D', 'Hansen D', 'McMahon DJ', 'Kirou KA', 'Roboz G', 'Desai P', 'Bockman RS', 'Stein EM']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9337-3417'],"['Endocrinology Service, Hospital for Special Surgery, 535 East 70th Street, New York, NY, USA.', 'Metabolic Bone Disease Service, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY, 10021, USA.', 'Metabolic Bone Disease Service, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY, 10021, USA.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY, USA.', 'Endocrinology Service, Hospital for Special Surgery, 535 East 70th Street, New York, NY, USA.', 'Metabolic Bone Disease Service, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY, 10021, USA.', 'Arthritis and Tissue Degeneration Program, David Z.

Autophagy is a prosurvival process that allows for cells to adapt to a variety of stressors. Blocking autophagy pharmacologically by using mechanistically distinct inhibitors induced apoptosis and prevented colony formation in primary human AML cells. The most effective inhibitor, bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1), also prevented the in vivo maintenance of AML LSCs in NSG mice. To understand why Baf A1 exerted the most dramatic effects on LSC survival, we evaluated mitochondrial function. Baf A1 reduced mitochondrial respiration and stabilized PTEN-induced kinase-1 (PINK-1), which initiates autophagy of mitochondria (mitophagy). Interestingly, with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine, levels of enhanced cell death and reduced mitochondrial respiration phenocopied the effects of Baf A1 only when cultured in hypoxic conditions that mimic the marrow microenvironment (1% O2). This indicates that increased efficacy of autophagy inhibitors in inducing AML cell death can be achieved by concurrently inducing mitochondrial damage and mitophagy (pharmacologically or by hypoxic induction) and blocking mitochondrial degradation. In addition, prolonged exposure of AML cells to hypoxia induced autophagic flux and reduced chemosensitivity to cytarabine (Ara-C), which was reversed by autophagy inhibition. The combination of Ara-C with Baf A1 also decreased tumor burden in vivo. These findings demonstrate that autophagy is critical for mitochondrial homeostasis and survival of AML cells in hypoxia and support the development of autophagy inhibitors as novel therapeutic agents for AML.","['Dykstra, Kaitlyn M', 'Fay, Hannah R S', 'Massey, Ashish C', 'Yang, Neng', 'Johnson, Matthew', 'Portwood, Scott', 'Guzman, Monica L', 'Wang, Eunice S']","['Dykstra KM', 'Fay HRS', 'Massey AC', 'Yang N', 'Johnson M', 'Portwood S', 'Guzman ML', 'Wang ES']",,"['Department of Medicine and.', 'Department of Medicine and.', 'Department of Immunology, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, and.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY; and.', 'Department of Medicine and.', 'Roanoke College, Salem, VA.', 'Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, and.', 'Department of Medicine and.', 'Department of Immunology, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY.']",['eng'],"['R21 CA158728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 OD016450/OD/NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC8095145,,,2021/04/21 06:00,2021/06/01 06:00,['2021/04/20 12:18'],"['2020/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/20 12:18 [entrez]', '2021/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(21)00260-3 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002666 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2021 Apr 27;5(8):2087-2100. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002666.,20210531,,IM,"['Animals', 'Autophagy', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria', 'Stem Cells', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we find a set of splicing events that alter the expression of a subset of AML-associated genes independent of known somatic mutations. In particular, aberrant splicing triples the number of patients with reduced functional EZH2 compared with that predicted by somatic mutation alone. In addition, we unexpectedly find that the nonsense-mediated decay factor DHX34 exhibits widespread alternative splicing in sporadic AML, resulting in a premature stop codon that phenocopies the loss-of-function germline mutations observed in familial AML. Together, these results demonstrate that classical mutation analysis underestimates the burden of functional gene disruption in AML and highlight the importance of assessing the contribution of alternative splicing to gene dysregulation in human disease.","['Rivera, Osvaldo D', 'Mallory, Michael J', 'Quesnel-Vallieres, Mathieu', 'Chatrikhi, Rakesh', 'Schultz, David C', 'Carroll, Martin', 'Barash, Yoseph', 'Cherry, Sara', 'Lynch, Kristen W']","['Rivera OD', 'Mallory MJ', 'Quesnel-Vallieres M', 'Chatrikhi R', 'Schultz DC', 'Carroll M', 'Barash Y', 'Cherry S', 'Lynch KW']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2460-7996', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9945-8123', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3092-7427', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7890-8815', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5622-3735', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3005-5048']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Graduate Group in Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104; yosephb@upenn.edu cherrys@pennmedicine.upenn.edu klync@pennmedicine.upenn.edu.', 'Department of Computer and Information Sciences, School of Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104; yosephb@upenn.edu cherrys@pennmedicine.upenn.edu klync@pennmedicine.upenn.edu.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104; yosephb@upenn.edu cherrys@pennmedicine.upenn.edu klync@pennmedicine.upenn.edu.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.']",['eng'],"['U01 CA232563/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI140539/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM128096/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI150246/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 GM118048/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI122749/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC8054020,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*DHX34', '*EZH2', '*alternative splicing', '*cancer']",2021/04/21 06:00,2021/11/27 06:00,['2021/04/20 09:37'],"['2021/04/20 09:37 [entrez]', '2021/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/27 06:00 [medline]']","['2014967118 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.2014967118 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2021 Apr 13;118(15). pii: 2014967118. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2014967118.,20211126,"['EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DHX34 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay', 'RNA Helicases/genetics/metabolism']",,,,,,['The authors declare no competing interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated before and 30 days after initiation of chemotherapy from 20 patients with advanced PDAC. Regulatory T cells (FoxP3+) and immune checkpoints (PD-1 and TIM-3) were analyzed by flow cytometry and immunological changes were correlated with clinical outcome. RESULTS: Heterogeneous changes during chemotherapy were observed in circulating T-cell subpopulations with a pronounced effect on PD-1+ CD4+/CD8+ T cells. An increase in FoxP3+ or PD-1+ T cells had no significant effect on survival. An increase in TIM3+/CD8+ (but not TIM3+/CD4+) T cells was associated with a significant inferior outcome: median progression-free survival in the subgroup with an increase of TIM-3+/CD8+ T cells was 6.0 compared to 14.0 months in patients with a decrease/no change (p = 0.026); corresponding median overall survival was 13.0 and 20.0 months (p = 0.011), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Chemotherapy with FOLFIRNOX or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel induces variable changes in circulating T-cell populations that may provide prognostic information in PDAC.","['Sams, L',

We therefore classified lymphomas-occurring in a cohort of 21 adult CVID patients during a 17-year period at our center-according to the 2016 WHO classification and characterized the local and systemic immunological context RESULTS: The median time between the onset of CVID and lymphoma was 14 years. Patients showed a high prevalence of preceding immune dysregulation: lymphadenopathy (n = 13, 62%), splenomegaly (n = 18, 86%), autoimmune cytopenia (n = 14, 67%), and gastrointestinal involvement (n = 15, 71%). The entities comprised extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (n = 6), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (n = 7), plasmablastic lymphoma (n = 1), classic Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 4, including three cases with germline CTLA4 mutations), T cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (n = 2), and peripheral T cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (n = 1), but no follicular lymphoma. An Epstein-Barr virus association was documented in eight of 16 investigated lymphomas. High expression of PDL1 by tumor cells in five and of PDL1 and PD1 by tumor-infiltrating macrophages and T cells in 12 of 12 investigated lymphomas suggested a tolerogenic immunological tumor environment. CONCLUSION: In summary, a diverse combination of specific factors like genetic background, chronic immune activation, viral trigger, and impaired immune surveillance contributes to the observed spectrum of lymphomas in CVID. In the future, targeted therapies, e.g., PD1/PDL1 inhibitors in CVID associated lymphomas with a tolerogenic environment may improve therapy outcome.","['Wehr, Claudia', 'Houet, Leonora', 'Unger, Susanne', 'Kindle, Gerhard', 'Goldacker, Sigune', 'Grimbacher, Bodo', 'Caballero Garcia de Oteyza, Andres', 'Marks, Reinhard', 'Pfeifer, Dietmar', 'Nieters, Alexandra', 'Proietti, Michele', 'Warnatz, Klaus', 'Schmitt-Graeff, Annette']","['Wehr C', 'Houet L', 'Unger S', 'Kindle G', 'Goldacker S', 'Grimbacher B', 'Caballero Garcia de Oteyza A', 'Marks R', 'Pfeifer D', 'Nieters A', 'Proietti M', 'Warnatz K', 'Schmitt-Graeff A']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1172-865X'],"['Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Immunodeficiency, Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency (CCI), Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'FREEZE Biobank, Center for Biobanking, Medical Center and Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Immunodeficiency, Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Breisacher Str. 115, 79106, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Immunodeficiency, Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency (CCI), Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'DZIF - German Center for Infection Research, Satellite Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'CIBSS - Centre for Integrative Biological Signalling Studies, Albert-Ludwigs University, Freiburg, Germany.', 'RESIST - Cluster of Excellence 2155 to Hanover Medical School, Satellite Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'FREEZE Biobank, Center for Biobanking, Medical Center and Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany. klaus.warnatz@uniklinik-freiburg.de.', 'Division of Immunodeficiency, Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Breisacher Str. 115, 79106, Freiburg, Germany. klaus.warnatz@uniklinik-freiburg.de.', 'University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210419,Netherlands,J Clin Immunol,Journal of clinical immunology,8102137,PMC8310845,['NOTNLM'],"['*CTLA4', '*Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)', '*Hodgkin lymphoma (HL)', '*diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)', '*lymphoma', '*marginal zone lymphoma (MZL)']",2021/04/21 06:00,2021/04/21 06:00,['2021/04/20 06:43'],"['2020/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/21 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/20 06:43 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10875-021-01016-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s10875-021-01016-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Immunol. 2021 Aug;41(6):1250-1265. doi: 10.1007/s10875-021-01016-4.

Many controversies remain around diagnosis influencing prognostic and therapeutic implications relating to this unique leukemia subset. RECENT FINDINGS: The 2016 WHO classification includes more clear and restrictive diagnostic criteria for AEL. Primary acute erythroid leukemia is associated with complex and high-risk karyotypes including chromosomes 5q and 7q abnormalities. Mutational data shows that AEL is characterized by far lower NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutation rates and higher mutational rates in TP53 compared with other AML subtypes. Hypomethylating agents have shown therapeutic value in AEL. In this article, we discuss the evolving diagnostic concepts of erythroleukemia, genomics, clinical outcome, and promising therapeutic targets through an appraisal of the current literature.","['Weinberg, Olga K', 'Arber, Daniel A']","['Weinberg OK', 'Arber DA']",,"['Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, BioCenter, 2230 Inwood Rd, EB03.220G, Dallas, TX, 75235, USA.

We identified 969 individuals (415 MBL and 554 Rai 0 CLL; median age, 64 years; 65% men) seen at Mayo Clinic between 1 January 2001 and 1 October 2018, and ascertained time to first therapy (TTFT) and overall survival (OS). After a median follow up of 7 years, the risk of disease progression needing therapy was 2.9%/y for MBL (median, not reached) and 5%/y for Rai 0 CLL (median, 10.4 years). Among patients with low, intermediate, and high/very high-risk CLL-IPI risk groups, the estimated 5-year risk of TTFT was 13.5%, 30%, and 58%, respectively, P< .0001 (c-statistic = 0.69); and the estimated 5-year OS was 96.3%, 91.5%, and 76%, respectively, P< .0001 (c-statistic = 0.65). In a multivariable analysis of absolute B-cell count with individual factors of the CLL-IPI, the absolute B-cell count was associated with shorter TTFT (hazard ratio [HR] for each 10 x 109/L increase: 1.31; P< .0001) and shorter OS (HR: 1.1; P = .02). The OS of the entire cohort was similar to that of the age- and sex-matched general population of Minnesota (P = .17), although Rai 0 CLL patients with high and very high-risk CLL-IPI score had significantly shorter OS (P= .01 and P= .0001, respectively). The results of this study demonstrate the ability of CLL-IPI to predict time from diagnosis to first treatment (an end point not affected by therapy) in a large cohort of patients whose only manifestation of disease is a circulating clonal lymphocyte population.","['Parikh, Sameer A', 'Rabe, Kari G', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Ding, Wei', 'Leis, Jose F', 'Kenderian, Saad S', 'Muchtar, Eli', 'Wang, Yucai', 'Koehler, Amber B', 'Schwager, Susan M', 'Lesnick, Connie E', 'Kleinstern, Geffen', 'Van Dyke, Daniel', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Braggio, Esteban', 'Slager, Susan L', 'Shanafelt, Tait D']","['Parikh SA', 'Rabe KG', 'Kay NE', 'Call TG', 'Ding W', 'Leis JF', 'Kenderian SS', 'Muchtar E', 'Wang Y', 'Koehler AB', 'Schwager SM', 'Lesnick CE', 'Kleinstern G', 'Van Dyke D', 'Hanson CA', 'Braggio E', 'Slager SL', 'Shanafelt TD']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3221-7314', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7313-1875', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5951-5055', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2210-2174', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1576-8341', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2539-040X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3860-4830']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Biomedical Statistics & Informatics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, AZ.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine and.', 'School of Public Health, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; and.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, AZ.', 'Division of Biomedical Statistics & Informatics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA197120/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA235026/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC8288657,,,2021/04/21 06:00,2021/07/31 06:00,['2021/04/20 06:39'],"['2020/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/07/15 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/20 06:39 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(21)00887-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020009813 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2021 Jul 15;138(2):149-159. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020009813.,20210730,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*immunology', 'Lymphocytosis/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,['Blood. 2021 Jul 15;138(2):106-107.

Despite recent advances in treatments with intensified chemotherapy regimens, relapse rates and associated morbidities remain high. In this context, metabolic dependencies have emerged as a druggable opportunity for the treatment of leukemia. Here, we tested the antileukemic effects of MB1-47, a newly developed mitochondrial uncoupling compound. MB1-47 treatment in T-ALL cells robustly inhibited cell proliferation via both cytostatic and cytotoxic effects as a result of compromised mitochondrial energy and metabolite depletion, which severely impaired nucleotide biosynthesis. Mechanistically, acute treatment with MB1-47 in primary leukemias promoted adenosine monophosphate-activated serine/threonine protein kinase (AMPK) activation and downregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, stalling anabolic pathways that support leukemic cell survival. Indeed, MB1-47 treatment in mice harboring either murine NOTCH1-induced primary leukemias or human T-ALL patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) led to potent antileukemic effects with a significant extension in survival without overlapping toxicities. Overall, our findings demonstrate a critical role for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in T-ALL and uncover MB1-47-driven mitochondrial uncoupling as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of this disease.","['da Silva-Diz, Victoria', 'Cao, Bin', 'Lancho, Olga', 'Chiles, Eric', 'Alasadi, Amer', 'Aleksandrova, Maya', 'Luo, Shirley', 'Singh, Amartya', 'Tao, Hanlin', 'Augeri, David', 'Minuzzo, Sonia', 'Indraccolo, Stefano', 'Khiabanian, Hossein', 'Su, Xiaoyang', 'Jin, Shengkan', 'Herranz, Daniel']","['da Silva-Diz V', 'Cao B', 'Lancho O', 'Chiles E', 'Alasadi A', 'Aleksandrova M', 'Luo S', 'Singh A', 'Tao H', 'Augeri D', 'Minuzzo S', 'Indraccolo S', 'Khiabanian H', 'Su X', 'Jin S', 'Herranz D']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1508-2999', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5819-4715', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3354-607X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6082-1597', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0789-8311', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8081-1396', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5979-7232', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1768-5969']","['Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.', 'Center for Systems and Computational Biology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Basic and Translational Oncology Unit, Veneto Institute of Oncology-Scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Healthcare (IOV-IRCCS), Padova, Italy.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.', 'Center for Systems and Computational Biology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ; and.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.', 'Department of Medicine, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ.']",['eng'],"['R00 CA197869/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA236936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA072720/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AA027050/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA216604/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC8525334,,,2021/04/21 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/04/20 06:39'],"['2020/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/10/14 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/20 06:39 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(21)00891-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020008955 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2021 Oct 14;138(15):1317-1330. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020008955.,20211207,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Uncoupling Agents)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Uncoupling Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,['2022/10/14 00:00'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although response rates are high and durable disease control is common, longer-term follow-up of patients with relapsed and refractory disease, especially in the presence of TP53 aberrations, demonstrates frequent disease resistance and progression. Although the understanding of venetoclax resistance remains incomplete, progressive disease is typified by oligoclonal leukemic populations with distinct resistance mechanisms, including BCL2 mutations, upregulation of alternative BCL2 family proteins, and genomic instability. Although most commonly observed in heavily pretreated patients with disease refractory to fludarabine and harboring complex karyotype, Richter transformation presents a distinct and challenging manifestation of venetoclax resistance. For patients with progressive CLL after venetoclax, treatment options include B-cell receptor pathway inhibitors, allogeneic stem cell transplantation, chimeric antigen receptor T cells, and venetoclax retreatment for those with disease relapsing after time-limited therapy. However, data to inform clinical decisions for these patients are limited.

In this study, we identified a distinct subgroup of immature acute leukemias characterized by a broadly variable phenotype, covering acute myeloid leukemia (AML, M0 or M1), T/myeloid mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (T/M MPAL), and early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL). Rearrangements at 14q32/BCL11B are the cytogenetic hallmark of this entity. In our screening of 915 hematological malignancies, there were 202 AML and 333 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL: 58, ETP; 178, non-ETP; 8, T/M MPAL; 89, not otherwise specified). We identified 20 cases of immature leukemias (4% of AML and 3.6% of T-ALL), harboring 4 types of 14q32/BCL11B translocations: t(2,14)(q22.3;q32) (n = 7), t(6;14)(q25.3;q32) (n = 9), t(7;14)(q21.2;q32) (n = 2), and t(8;14)(q24.2;q32) (n = 2). The t(2;14) produced a ZEB2-BCL11B fusion transcript, whereas the other 3 rearrangements displaced transcriptionally active enhancer sequences close to BCL11B without producing fusion genes. All translocations resulted in the activation of BCL11B, a regulator of T-cell differentiation associated with transcriptional corepressor complexes in mammalian cells. The expression of BCL11B behaved as a disease biomarker that was present at diagnosis, but not in remission. Deregulation of BCL11B co-occurred with variants at FLT3 and at epigenetic modulators, most frequently the DNMT3A, TET2, and/or WT1 genes. Transcriptome analysis identified a specific expression signature, with significant downregulation of BCL11B targets, and clearly separating BCL11B AL from AML, T-ALL, and ETP-ALL. Remarkably, an ex vivo drug-sensitivity profile identified a panel of compounds with effective antileukemic activity.","['Di Giacomo, Danika', 'La Starza, Roberta', 'Gorello, Paolo', 'Pellanera, Fabrizia', 'Kalender Atak, Zeynep', 'De Keersmaecker, Kim', 'Pierini, Valentina', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Arniani, Silvia', 'Moretti, Martina', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'De Santis, Giovanna', 'Roti, Giovanni', 'Matteucci, Caterina', 'Bassan, Renato', 'Vandenberghe, Peter', 'Aerts, Stein', 'Cools, Jan', 'Bornhauser, Beat', 'Bourquin, Jean-Pierre', 'Piazza, Rocco', 'Mecucci, Cristina']","['Di Giacomo D', 'La Starza R', 'Gorello P', 'Pellanera F', 'Kalender Atak Z', 'De Keersmaecker K', 'Pierini V', 'Harrison CJ', 'Arniani S', 'Moretti M', 'Testoni N', 'De Santis G', 'Roti G', 'Matteucci C', 'Bassan R', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Aerts S', 'Cools J', 'Bornhauser B', 'Bourquin JP', 'Piazza R', 'Mecucci C']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4761-8169', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7420-9531', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9553-4819', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4719-1935', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6626-5843', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4198-9620', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1623-0148']","['Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'KU Leuven and Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University Centre for Cancer, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', '""Seragnoli"" Institute, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'UOC of Hematology, Avellino, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', ""Ospedale dell'Angelo, Venice, Italy."", 'University Hospital Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'VIB Center for Brain & Disease Research, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven-VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', ""University Children's Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland; and."", ""University Children's Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland; and."", 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC8513670,,,2021/04/21 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/04/20 06:38'],"['2020/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/20 06:38 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(21)00895-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020010510 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2021 Sep 2;138(9):773-784. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020010510.,20211203,"['0 (BCL11B protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Repressor Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics']",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,['Blood. 2021 Sep 2;138(9):741-743.

The pandemic period from 1/3/2020 to 31/7/2020 was compared with the same period in 2019. Overall, in 2020 there was a 2.4% reduction in the number of allo-HCT cases compared to 2019. Interestingly, this deflection did not affect the acute leukemia cases (+5.7% in 2020). The use of peripheral blood-derived stem cells (+10.7%) and cryopreservation (97.4% of the centers) was highly adopted in 2020. Despite the sanitary emergency, almost all of the surveyed centers declared no impact of SARS-CoV2 pandemic on the transplant timing and outcomes, and the sanitary policy was positively evaluated by the majority of centers. The emergency measures ensured that only a minority of the allo-HCT patients had been infected by SARS-CoV2; however, a mortality of 42.1% among the allo-HCT patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was recorded. This survey gives us the information that the GITMO Group reacted positively to the pandemic. Thanks to the emergency strategies, the Italian allo-HCT activity continued safely, showing only a minor deflection and offering the same probability of cure to the transplanted patients.","['Russo, Domenico', 'Polverelli, Nicola', 'Malagola, Michele', 'Farina, Mirko', 'Leoni, Alessandro', 'Bernardi, Simona', 'Mammoliti, Sonia', 'Sacchi, Nicoletta', 'Martino, Massimo', 'Ciceri, Fabio']","['Russo D', 'Polverelli N', 'Malagola M', 'Farina M', 'Leoni A', 'Bernardi S', 'Mammoliti S', 'Sacchi N', 'Martino M', 'Ciceri F']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6297-9697', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2980-9028', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3987-419X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0873-0123']","['Unit of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Cell Therapies and Hematology Research Program, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy. domenico.russo@unibs.it.', 'Unit of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Cell Therapies and Hematology Research Program, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy. nicola.polverelli@unibs.it.', 'Unit of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Cell Therapies and Hematology Research Program, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Unit of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Cell Therapies and Hematology Research Program, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Unit of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Cell Therapies and Hematology Research Program, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Unit of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Cell Therapies and Hematology Research Program, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologica AIL (CREA), ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'GITMO Trials Office, Genova, Italy.', 'Italian Bone Marrow Donor Registry, Galliera Hospital, Genova, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, Clinical Section, Department of Hemato-Oncology and radiotherapy, Grande Ospedale Metropolitano ""Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli"", Reggio Calabria, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210419,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,PMC8054130,,,2021/04/21 06:00,2021/09/07 06:00,['2021/04/20 06:27'],"['2021/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/03/09 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/20 06:27 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-021-01287-w [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-021-01287-w [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2021 Sep;56(9):2272-2275. doi: 10.1038/s41409-021-01287-w.

There were 57 patients undergoing allo-HSCT at the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University from July 2017 to October 2019. They were divided into control(16 patients) and ruxolitinib (41 patients) groups. For aGVHD prophylaxis, the control group received post-transplantation cyclophosphamide, antithymocyte globulin-Fresenius, cyclosporine A, and mycophenolate mofetil, while in the ruxolitinib group, ruxolitinib 5 mg/d in adults or 0.07-0.1 mg/(kg d) in children was administered from the day of neutrophil engraftment to 100 days post-transplantation based on control group. We found 55 patients had successful reconstitution of hematopoiesis; No significant difference was found in cGVHD, hemorrhagic cystitis, pulmonary infection, intestinal infection, Epstein-Barr virus infection, cytomegalovirus infection, relapse, death, and nonrelapse mortality. The incidences of aGVHD (50 vs. 22%, P = 0.046) and grade II-IV aGVHD (42.9 vs. 12.2%, P = 0.013) were significantly higher in the control group than in the ruxolitinib group. No significant differences were observed in overall survival (P = 0.514), disease-free survival (P = 0.691), and cumulative platelet transfusion within 100 days post-transplantation between two groups. This suggests early application of ruxolitinib can reduce the incidence and severity of aGVHD and patients are well tolerated.","['Zhang, Binglei', 'Chen, Lingyun', 'Zhou, Jian', 'Zu, Yingling', 'Gui, Ruirui', 'Li, Zhen', 'Wang, Juan', 'Yu, Fengkuan', 'Zhang, Yanli', 'Zhao, Huifang', 'Ji, Zhenyu', 'Song, Yongping']","['Zhang B', 'Chen L', 'Zhou J', 'Zu Y', 'Gui R', 'Li Z', 'Wang J', 'Yu F', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhao H', 'Ji Z', 'Song Y']",,"['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, 450000, Henan, China.', 'Henan Academy of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450000, Henan, China.', 'School of Basic Medical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450000, Henan, China.', 'Academy of Medical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450000, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, 450000, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, 450000, Henan, China. zhoujiandoctor@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, 450000, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, 450000, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, 450000, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, 450000, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, 450000, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, 450000, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, 450000, Henan, China.', 'Henan Academy of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450000, Henan, China. jizhenyu@zzu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, 450000, Henan, China. songyongping001@126.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210419,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC8055912,,,2021/04/21 06:00,2021/11/09 06:00,['2021/04/20 06:24'],"['2020/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/20 06:24 [entrez]', '2021/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-021-88080-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-021-88080-3 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2021 Apr 19;11(1):8501. doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-88080-3.,20211108,"['0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitriles/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tissue Donors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) are the major immune-mediated complications after alloHSCT. However, there is controversy whether neurologic complications after alloHSCT might represent manifestations of GvHD. We report three patients who acquired distinct, severe immune-mediated peripheral or central nervous system diseases after alloHSCT without other, concomitant GvHD manifestations. One patient had been diagnosed with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and two patients with high risk myelodysplastic syndrome. Patient #1 presented as LGI1- and GAD-IgG positive immune-mediated encephalitis, patient #2 was diagnosed with MOG-IgG positive encephalomyelitis, and patient #3 had chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy associated with SSA(Ro)-IgG positive Sjogren's syndrome. 100% donor chimerism was detectable in the peripheral blood in all three. The specific antibodies were undetectable in donors' and patients' blood before alloHSCT suggesting that the antibodies had arisen from the transplanted donor immune system. Early intensive immunotherapy led to improvement of clinical symptoms and stability of the neurological disease, however, at the cost of losing the graft-versus-malignancy effect in one patient. In conclusion, we provide evidence of isolated, severe allo-immune diseases of the peripheral and central nervous system as complications of alloHSCT (""neuro-GvHD""). Interdisciplinary surveillance and thorough diagnostic work-up are needed for early diagnosis and treatment of neuro-immunologic complications after alloHSCT to improve the otherwise poor outcome.","['Hummert, Martin W', 'Stadler, Michael', 'Hambach, Lothar', 'Gingele, Stefan', 'Bredt, Martin', 'Wattjes, Mike P', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Venturini, Letizia', 'Mohn, Nora', 'Stangel, Martin', 'Trebst, Corinna', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Wegner, Florian', 'Skripuletz, Thomas']","['Hummert MW', 'Stadler M', 'Hambach L', 'Gingele S', 'Bredt M', 'Wattjes MP', 'Gohring G', 'Venturini L', 'Mohn N', 'Stangel M', 'Trebst C', 'Ganser A', 'Wegner F', 'Skripuletz T']",,"['Department of Neurology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany. huemmert.martin@mh-hannover.de.', 'Department of Clinical Neuroimmunology and Neurochemistry, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. huemmert.martin@mh-hannover.de.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Neurology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Neuroimmunology and Neurochemistry, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Hannover Medical School, Institute for Pathology, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Neurology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Neuroimmunology and Neurochemistry, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Neurology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Neuroimmunology and Neurochemistry, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Neurology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Neuroimmunology and Neurochemistry, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Neurology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Neuroimmunology and Neurochemistry, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Neurology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Neuroimmunology and Neurochemistry, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20210419,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC8055885,,,2021/04/21 06:00,2021/11/11 06:00,['2021/04/20 06:15'],"['2021/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/20 06:15 [entrez]', '2021/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-021-87989-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-021-87989-z [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2021 Apr 19;11(1):8527. doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-87989-z.,20211110,['0 (Antibodies)'],IM,"['Antibodies/*adverse effects', 'Cell Line', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/*etiology', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/*etiology', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides coding for proteins, the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of retroviral antisense genes have also been found to regulate transcription directly. Thus, it has been proposed that retroviruses likely localize their antisense mRNAs to the nucleus in order to regulate nuclear events; however, this opposes the coding function of retroviral antisense mRNAs that requires a cytoplasmic localization for protein translation. Here, we provide direct evidence that retroviral antisense mRNAs are localized predominantly in the nuclei of infected cells. The retroviral 3' LTR induces inefficient polyadenylation and nuclear retention of antisense mRNA. We further reveal that retroviral antisense RNAs retained in the nucleus associate with chromatin and have transcriptional regulatory function. While HTLV-1 antisense mRNA is recruited to the promoter of C-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CCR4) and enhances transcription from it to support the proliferation of HTLV-1-infected cells, HIV-1 antisense mRNA is recruited to the viral LTR and inhibits sense mRNA expression to maintain the latency of HIV-1 infection. In summary, retroviral antisense mRNAs are retained in nucleus, act like long noncoding RNAs instead of mRNAs, and contribute to viral persistence.","['Ma, Guangyong', 'Yasunaga, Jun-Ichirou', 'Shimura, Kazuya', 'Takemoto, Keiko', 'Watanabe, Miho', 'Amano, Masayuki', 'Nakata, Hirotomo', 'Liu, Benquan', 'Zuo, Xiaorui', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Ma G', 'Yasunaga JI', 'Shimura K', 'Takemoto K', 'Watanabe M', 'Amano M', 'Nakata H', 'Liu B', 'Zuo X', 'Matsuoka M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2003-7201', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7939-2080', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0516-9502', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0473-754X']","['Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China; gma@cpu.edu.cn mamatsu@kumamoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto 860-8556, Japan.', 'Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto 860-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto 860-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto 860-8556, Japan.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan; gma@cpu.edu.cn mamatsu@kumamoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto 860-8556, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC8092383,['NOTNLM'],"['*ASP', '*HBZ', '*HIV-1', '*HTLV-1', '*RNA-FISH']",2021/04/21 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/04/20 05:54'],"['2021/04/20 05:54 [entrez]', '2021/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['2014783118 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.2014783118 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2021 Apr 27;118(17). pii: 2014783118. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2014783118.,20211207,"['0 (ASP protein, HIV-1)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/genetics', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Human Immunodeficiency Virus Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Antisense/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Latency/*genetics', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",,,,,,['The authors declare no competing interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ibrutinib, a standard treatment for CLL, inhibits not only Bruton tyrosine kinase of the B-cell receptor signaling pathway, but also IL2-inducible kinase of the TCR signaling pathway. T-cell polarization and activation are affected by ibrutinib, but it is unknown whether T cells contribute to clinical response. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: High-throughput TCRbeta sequencing was performed in 77 longitudinal samples from 26 patients with CLL treated with ibrutinib. TCRbeta usage in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and granzyme B expression were assessed by flow cytometric analysis. Antitumor cytotoxicity of T cells expanded with autologous CLL cells or with antigen-independent anti-CD3/CD28/CD137 beads was tested. RESULTS: The clonality of the TCR repertoire increased at the time of response. With extended treatment, TCR clonality remained stable in patients with sustained remission and decreased in patients with disease progression. Expanded clonotypes were rarely shared between patients, indicating specificity for private antigens. Flow cytometry demonstrated a predominance of CD8(+) cells among expanded clonotypes. Importantly, bulk T cells from responding patients were cytotoxic against autologous CLL cells in vitro and selective depletion of major expanded clonotypes reduced CLL cell killing. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CLL, established T-cell responses directed against tumor are suppressed by disease and reactivated by ibrutinib.See related commentary by Zent, p. 4465.","['Baptista, Maria Joao', 'Baskar, Sivasubramanian', 'Gaglione, Erika M', 'Keyvanfar, Keyvan', 'Ahn, Inhye E', 'Wiestner, Adrian', 'Sun, Clare']","['Baptista MJ', 'Baskar S', 'Gaglione EM', 'Keyvanfar K', 'Ahn IE', 'Wiestner A', 'Sun C']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4831-3105', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3717-287X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8498-4729']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Lymphoid Neoplasms, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland. clare.sun@nih.gov wiestnea@nhlbi.nih.gov.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland. clare.sun@nih.gov wiestnea@nhlbi.nih.gov.']",['eng'],['Z99 HL999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20210419,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,PMC8364883,,,2021/04/21 06:00,2021/04/21 06:00,['2021/04/20 05:53'],"['2020/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/02/15 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/21 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/20 05:53 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-20-4894 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-4894 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2021 Aug 15;27(16):4624-4633. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-4894.

However, the mechanisms underlying the deregulation of signaling pathways in leukemia cells are unclear. To identify genes capable of independently supporting cytokine-independent growth, we employed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss-of-function screen in GM-CSF-dependent human AML TF-1 cells. More than 182 genes (p < 0.01) were found to suppress the cytokine-independent growth of TF-1 cells. Among the top hits, genes encoding key factors involved in sialylation biosynthesis were identified; these included CMAS, SLC35A1, NANS, and GNE. Knockout of either CMAS or SLC35A1 enabled cytokine-independent proliferation and survival of AML cells. Furthermore, NSG (NOD/SCID/IL2Rgamma(-/-)) mice injected with CMAS or SLC35A1-knockout TF-1 cells exhibited a shorter survival than mice injected with wild-type cells. Mechanistically, abrogation of sialylation biosynthesis in TF-1 cells induced a strong activation of ERK signaling, which sensitized cells to MEK inhibitors but conferred resistance to JAK inhibitors. Further, the surface level of alpha2,3-linked sialic acids was negatively correlated with the sensitivity of AML cell lines to MEK/ERK inhibitors. We also found that sialylation modulated the expression and stability of the CSF2 receptor. Together, these results demonstrate a novel role of sialylation in regulating oncogenic transformation and drug resistance development in leukemia. We propose that altered sialylation could serve as a biomarker for targeted anti-leukemic therapy.","['Lee, Dong-Hee', 'Kang, Seong-Ho', 'Choi, Da-Som', 'Ko, Minkyung', 'Choi, Eunji', 'Ahn, Hyejin', 'Min, Hophil', 'Oh, Soo Jin', 'Lee, Myeong Sup', 'Park, Yoon', 'Jin, Hyung-Seung']","['Lee DH', 'Kang SH', 'Choi DS', 'Ko M', 'Choi E', 'Ahn H', 'Min H', 'Oh SJ', 'Lee MS', 'Park Y', 'Jin HS']",,"['Department of Convergence Medicine, Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Center for Theragnosis, Biomedical Research Institute, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Convergence Medicine, Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Center for Theragnosis, Biomedical Research Institute, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Convergence Medicine, Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Convergence Medicine, Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Doping Control Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Convergence Medicine, Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Medicine, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Center for Theragnosis, Biomedical Research Institute, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Seoul, South Korea.

However, the impact of CARD11 deficiency on human B-cell development, signaling, and function is incompletely understood. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the cellular, immunological, and biochemical basis of disease for 2 unrelated patients who presented with profound CID associated with viral and fungal respiratory infections, interstitial lung disease, and severe colitis. METHODS: Patients underwent next-generation sequencing, immunophenotyping by flow cytometry, signaling assays by immunoblot, and transcriptome profiling by RNA-sequencing. RESULTS: Both patients carried identical novel pathogenic biallelic loss-of-function variants in CARD11 (c.2509C>T; p.Arg837 *) leading to undetectable protein expression. This variant prevented CBM complex formation, severely impairing the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and MALT1 paracaspase activity in B and T cells. This functional defect resulted in a developmental block in B cells at the naive and type 1 transitional B-cell stage and impaired circulating T follicular helper cell (cTFH) development, which was associated with impaired antibody responses and absent germinal center structures on lymph node histology. Transcriptomics indicated that CARD11-dependent signaling is essential for immune signaling pathways involved in the development of these cells. Both patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantations, which led to functional normalization. CONCLUSIONS: Complete human CARD11 deficiency causes profound CID by impairing naive/type 1 B-cell and cTFH cell development and abolishing activation of MALT1 paracaspase, NF-kappaB, and JNK activity. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation functionally restores impaired signaling pathways.","['Lu, Henry Y', 'Sharma, Mehul', 'Sharma, Ashish A', 'Lacson, Atilano', 'Szpurko, Ashley', 'Luider, Joanne', 'Dharmani-Khan, Poonam', 'Shameli, Afshin', 'Bell, Peter A', 'Guilcher, Gregory M T', 'Lewis, Victor A', 'Vasquez, Marta Rojas', 'Desai, Sunil', 'McGonigle, Lyle', 'Murguia-Favela, Luis', 'Wright, Nicola A M', 'Sergi, Consolato', 'Wine, Eytan', 'Overall, Christopher M', 'Suresh, Sneha', 'Turvey, Stuart E']","['Lu HY', 'Sharma M', 'Sharma AA', 'Lacson A', 'Szpurko A', 'Luider J', 'Dharmani-Khan P', 'Shameli A', 'Bell PA', 'Guilcher GMT', 'Lewis VA', 'Vasquez MR', 'Desai S', 'McGonigle L', 'Murguia-Favela L', 'Wright NAM', 'Sergi C', 'Wine E', 'Overall CM', 'Suresh S', 'Turvey SE']",,"[""Department of Pediatrics, British Columbia Children's Hospital, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; Experimental Medicine Program, Faculty of Medicine, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."", ""Department of Pediatrics, British Columbia Children's Hospital, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; Experimental Medicine Program, Faculty of Medicine, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."", 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio; Department of Pathology, Emory University, Atlanta, Ga.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', ""Section of Oncology/Bone Marrow Therapy, Departments of Oncology and Pediatrics, Alberta Children's Hospital, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."", 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Calgary, Alberta Precision Laboratories, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Calgary, Alberta Precision Laboratories, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Calgary, Alberta Precision Laboratories, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Centre for Blood Research, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; Department of Oral Biological and Medical Sciences, Faculty of Dentistry, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', ""Section of Oncology/Bone Marrow Therapy, Departments of Oncology and Pediatrics, Alberta Children's Hospital, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."", ""Section of Oncology/Bone Marrow Therapy, Departments of Oncology and Pediatrics, Alberta Children's Hospital, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Immunology, Hematology, Oncology and Palliative Care (iHOPE), University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Immunology, Hematology, Oncology and Palliative Care (iHOPE), University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of General and Community Pediatrics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', ""Section of Pediatric Hematology-Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, Alberta Children's Hospital, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."", ""Section of Pediatric Hematology-Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, Alberta Children's Hospital, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Department of Pediatrics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Centre for Blood Research, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; Department of Oral Biological and Medical Sciences, Faculty of Dentistry, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Immunology, Hematology, Oncology and Palliative Care (iHOPE), University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', ""Department of Pediatrics, British Columbia Children's Hospital, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; Experimental Medicine Program, Faculty of Medicine, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Defibrotide as a contender.,1948-1958,10.1111/jth.15343 [doi],"BACKGROUND: The vascular endothelium plays a key role in sepsis pathophysiology and the associated organ dysfunction. METHODS: We evaluated endothelial function in an experimental in vitro model of sepsis, using endothelial cells grown in the presence of serum from patients with septic syndromes (sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock), noninfectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (NI-SIRS) and healthy volunteers. Experiments were performed in the absence and presence of defibrotide (DF) (100 microg/ml) to evaluate its potential protective effect. RESULTS: After exposure to patients' sera, there was a progressive endothelial cell activation in correlation with sepsis severity, with a proinflammatory and prothrombotic phenotype, exhibiting significantly increased expression of adhesion receptors at the surface (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, p < .05 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, p < .05); higher production and release to the extracellular matrix (ECM) of von Willebrand factor (p < .001); augmented thrombogenicity of the ECM toward platelets (p < .001); and increased phosphorylation of intracellular p38MAPK. DF prevented these changes in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Markers of endothelial damage increased progressively in association with the severity of septic syndromes. The endothelium is therefore an important therapeutic target to prevent complications of sepsis. DF shows promising potential to modulate the endothelial damage associated with sepsis and may constitute a pharmacological tool to decrease its sequelae including multiorgan failure.","['Fernandez, Sara', 'Palomo, Marta', 'Molina, Patricia', 'Diaz-Ricart, Maribel', 'Escolar, Gines', 'Tellez, Adrian', 'Segui, Ferran', 'Ventosa, Helena', 'Torramade-Moix, Sergi', 'Rovira, Montserrat', 'Carreras, Enric', 'Nicolas, Josep M', 'Castro, Pedro']","['Fernandez S', 'Palomo M', 'Molina P', 'Diaz-Ricart M', 'Escolar G', 'Tellez A', 'Segui F', 'Ventosa H', 'Torramade-Moix S', 'Rovira M', 'Carreras E', 'Nicolas JM', 'Castro P']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1122-0052', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4409-9607', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6118-8970']","['Medical Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology, Pathology Department, CDB, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Barcelona Endothelium Team, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology, Pathology Department, CDB, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology, Pathology Department, CDB, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Barcelona Endothelium Team, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology, Pathology Department, CDB, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Barcelona Endothelium Team, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Medical Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Medical Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Medical Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology, Pathology Department, CDB, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Barcelona Endothelium Team, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Department of Haematology, Institute of Haematology and Oncology, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Barcelona Endothelium Team, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Medical Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Medical Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210515,England,J Thromb Haemost,Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,101170508,,['NOTNLM'],"['*defibrotide', '*endothelial cells', '*endothelium', '*sepsis', '*septic shock']",2021/04/20 06:00,2021/08/10 06:00,['2021/04/19 17:29'],"['2021/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/19 17:29 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jth.15343 [doi]'],ppublish,J Thromb Haemost. 2021 Aug;19(8):1948-1958. doi: 10.1111/jth.15343.

Improper mitosis may lead to aneuploidy which is found in many types of tumors. As a key mediator in mitosis, the dysregulated expression of BUBs has been proven to be highly associated with various malignancies, such as leukemia, gastric cancer, breast cancer, and liver cancer. However, bioinformatic analysis has not been applied to explore the role of the BUBs in sarcomas. Herein, we investigate the transcriptional and survival data of BUBs in patients with sarcomas using Oncomine, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, LinkedOmics, and the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. We found that the expression levels of BUB1, BUB1B and BUB3 were higher in sarcoma samples and cell lines than in normal controls. Survival analysis revealed that the higher expression levels of BUB1, BUB1B and BUB3 were associated with lower overall and disease-free survival in patients with sarcomas. This study implies that BUB1, BUB1B and BUB3 are potential treatment targets for patients with sarcomas and are new biomarkers for the prognosis of sarcomas.","['Long, Zeling', 'Wu, Tong', 'Tian, Qunyan', 'Carlson, Luke A', 'Wang, Wanchun', 'Wu, Gen']","['Long Z', 'Wu T', 'Tian Q', 'Carlson LA', 'Wang W', 'Wu G']",,"['Department of Orthopedics, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210419,United States,Aging (Albany NY),Aging,101508617,PMC8148488,['NOTNLM'],"['*budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles', '*oncogene', '*sarcoma']",2021/04/20 06:00,2021/07/27 06:00,['2021/04/19 17:19'],"['2021/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/19 17:19 [entrez]']","['202944 [pii]', '10.18632/aging.202944 [doi]']",ppublish,Aging (Albany NY). 2021 Apr 19;13(9):12395-12409. doi: 10.18632/aging.202944.

SPRED proteins comprise an N-terminal EVH-1 domain, a central c-Kit-binding domain, and C-terminal SROUTY domain. They negatively regulate signaling from tyrosine kinases to the Ras-MAPK pathway. SPRED1 binds directly to both c-KIT and to the RasGAP, neurofibromin, whose function is completely dependent on this interaction. Loss-of-function mutations in SPRED1 occur in human cancers and cause the developmental disorder, Legius syndrome. Genetic ablation of SPRED genes in mice leads to behavioral problems, dwarfism, and multiple other phenotypes including increased risk of leukemia. In this review, we summarize and discuss biochemical, structural, and biological functions of these proteins including their roles in normal cell growth and differentiation and in human disease.","['Lorenzo, Claire', 'McCormick, Frank']","['Lorenzo C', 'McCormick F']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0352-3398', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6619-7120']","['Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94158, USA.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94158, USA.']",['eng'],"['T32 GM007810/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197709/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,PMC7608746,['NOTNLM'],"['*Legius syndrome', '*NF1', '*Ras-MAPK', '*SPROUTY', '*signal transduction']",2021/04/20 06:00,2021/06/11 06:00,['2021/04/19 17:18'],"['2021/04/19 17:18 [entrez]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['34/21-22/1410 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.341222.120 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2020 Nov 1;34(21-22):1410-1421. doi: 10.1101/gad.341222.120.,20210610,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Growth and Development/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Domains', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*physiology']",['(c) 2020 Lorenzo and McCormick; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While long-term immunosurveillance is among the most important requirements for durable remissions in leukemia and a major potential benefit of immunotherapy, the exact determinants of CAR-T cell persistence remain elusive. Furthermore, it is less clear that long-term persistence is required for durable remission in lymphoma.

PROCEDURE: This retrospective analysis examined VOD/SOS risk and clinical outcomes in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia who received myeloablative alloHCT in 2008-2011 with (n = 148) and without (n = 348; controls) prior GO exposure and were reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. RESULTS: Cumulative incidences (95% confidence interval [CI]) of VOD/SOS and severe VOD/SOS, respectively, at 100 days were 16% (11-23%) and 8% (4-13%) for GO-exposed patients and 10% (7-13%) and 3% (2-5%) for controls. With a median follow-up of approximately 7 years, the 5-year adjusted overall survival probability (95% CI) after alloHCT was 51% (43-58%) and 55% (50-60%) for GO-exposed patients and controls, respectively; three (4%) and one (<1%) deaths were attributed to VOD/SOS. In multivariate analyses, GO exposure was observed to be associated with an increased risk of VOD/SOS at 100 days, but was not associated with overall survival, disease-free survival, relapse, or nonrelapse mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that GO treatment prior to alloHCT in pediatric patients may increase the risk of VOD/SOS but not death.","['Duncan, Christine', 'St Martin, Andrew', 'Perez, Waleska S', 'Steinert, Patricia', 'Zhang, Mei-Jie', 'Chirnomas, Deborah', 'Hoang, Caroline J', 'Loberiza, Fausto R Jr', 'Saber, Wael']","['Duncan C', 'St Martin A', 'Perez WS', 'Steinert P', 'Zhang MJ', 'Chirnomas D', 'Hoang CJ', 'Loberiza FR Jr', 'Saber W']",,"[""Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", 'CIBMTR(R) (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'CIBMTR(R) (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'CIBMTR(R) (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'CIBMTR(R) (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Institute for Health and Equity, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Pfizer Inc, New York, New York, USA.', 'Pfizer Inc, New York, New York, USA.', 'Pfizer Inc, New York, New York, USA.', 'CIBMTR(R) (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.']",['eng'],['U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210419,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,PMC8324076,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*gemtuzumab ozogamicin', '*hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*pediatric', '*sinusoidal obstruction syndrome', '*veno-occlusive disease']",2021/04/20 06:00,2021/04/20 06:00,['2021/04/19 12:32'],"['2021/03/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/08/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/19 12:32 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.29067 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Aug;68(8):e29067. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29067.

However, delivery of the Cas9 protein and single-guide RNA (sgRNA) into target cells can be technically challenge. Classical viral vectors, such as those derived from lentiviruses (LVs) or adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), allow for efficient delivery of transgenes coding for the Cas9 protein and its associated sgRNA in many primary cells and in vivo. Nevertheless, these vectors can suffer from drawbacks such as integration of the transgene in the target cell genome, a limited cargo capacity, and long-term expression of the Cas9 protein and guide RNA in target cells. To overcome some of these problems, a delivery vector based on the murine Leukemia virus (MLV) was developed to package the Cas9 protein and its associated guide RNA in the absence of any coding transgene. By fusing the Cas9 protein to the C-terminus of the structural protein Gag from MLV, virus-like particles (VLPs) loaded with the Cas9 protein and sgRNA (named ""Nanoblades"") were formed. Nanoblades can be collected from the culture medium of producer cells, purified, quantified, and used to transduce target cells and deliver the active Cas9/sgRNA complex. Nanoblades deliver their ribonucleoprotein (RNP) cargo transiently and rapidly in a wide range of primary and immortalized cells and can be programmed for other applications, such as transient transcriptional activation of targeted genes, using modified Cas9 proteins. Nanoblades are capable of in vivo genome-editing in the liver of injected adult mice and in oocytes to generate transgenic animals. Finally, they can be complexed with donor DNA for ""transfection-free"" homology-directed repair. Nanoblade preparation is simple, relatively low-cost, and can be easily carried out in any cell biology laboratory.","['Mangeot, Philippe E', 'Guiguettaz, Laura', 'Sohier, Thibault J M', 'Ricci, Emiliano P']","['Mangeot PE', 'Guiguettaz L', 'Sohier TJM', 'Ricci EP']",,"['CIRI, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie Univ Lyon, Inserm, U1111, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR5308, ENS de Lyon, F-69007, Lyon, France; philippe.mangeot@inserm.fr.', 'LBMC, Laboratoire de Biologie et Modelisation de la Cellule Univ Lyon, ENS de Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5239, INSERM, U1210, Lyon, 69007, France.', 'LBMC, Laboratoire de Biologie et Modelisation de la Cellule Univ Lyon, ENS de Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5239, INSERM, U1210, Lyon, 69007, France.', 'LBMC, Laboratoire de Biologie et Modelisation de la Cellule Univ Lyon, ENS de Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5239, INSERM, U1210, Lyon, 69007, France; emiliano.ricci@ens-lyon.org.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",20210331,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,,,,2021/04/20 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2021/04/19 12:16'],"['2021/04/19 12:16 [entrez]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/62245 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2021 Mar 31;(169). doi: 10.3791/62245.,20210510,"['0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', 'EC 3.1.- (CRISPR-Associated Protein 9)']",IM,"['CRISPR-Associated Protein 9/*genetics', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*genetics', 'Transfection']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This group of transcriptional cofactors regulates gene transcription by acting as a key ""connector"" or ""scaffold"" in transcription complexes. All LMOs, including LMO1, are important players in the process of tumorigenesis. Unique biological features of LMO1 distinct from other LMO members, such as its tissue-specific expression patterns, interacting proteins, and transcriptional targets, have been increasingly recognized. Studies indicated that LMO1 plays a critical oncogenic role in various types of cancers, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, neuroblastoma, gastric cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer. The molecular mechanisms underlying such functions of LMO1 have also been investigated, but they are currently far from being fully elucidated. Here, we focus on reviewing the current findings on the role of LMO1 in tumorigenesis, the mechanisms of its oncogenic action, and the mechanisms that drive its aberrant activation in cancers. We also briefly review its roles in the development process and non-cancer diseases. Finally, we discuss the remaining questions and future investigations required for promoting the translation of laboratory findings to clinical applications, including cancer diagnosis and treatment.","['Zhao, Guo-Fa', 'Du, Li-Qin', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Jia, You-Chao']","['Zhao GF', 'Du LQ', 'Zhang L', 'Jia YC']",,"['Department of Medical Oncology, Hebei Key Laboratory of Cancer Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy, Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University, Baoding, Hebei 071000, China.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Texas State University, San Marcos, TX 78666, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Hebei Key Laboratory of Cancer Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy, Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University, Baoding, Hebei 071000, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Hebei Key Laboratory of Cancer Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy, Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University, Baoding, Hebei 071000, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210416,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,PMC8116020,,,2021/04/20 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2021/04/19 08:49'],"['2021/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/19 08:49 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CM9.0000000000001487 [doi]', '00029330-202105050-00003 [pii]']",epublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2021 Apr 16;134(9):1017-1030. doi: 10.1097/CM9.0000000000001487.,20210514,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Carcinogenesis/genetics', '*DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', '*LIM Domain Proteins/genetics', 'Male', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Chinese Medical Association, produced by Wolters Kluwer,', 'Inc. under the CC-BY-NC-ND license.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, it's important to monitor and evaluate the immune status before and after treatments. METHODS: Flow cytometry is the best technology to perform immune monitoring, because it can detect immune cells using small amount of sample in a short time. The whole blood is the ideal sample for immune status monitoring, since it includes almost all the immune cells and it's relatively easy to obtain and less invasive than bone marrow or lymph node. RESULTS: Here we developed and validated a 10-color panel with only four tubes containing 29 antibodies to monitor 90 immune cell subsets in 2 ml whole blood samples. The major immune cell populations detected by our panel included T cell subsets (CD3(+) total T, Th, Tc, Treg, CD8(hi) , CD8(low) , alphabetaTCR, gammadeltaTCR, naive, and memory T), T cell activation markers (CD25, CD69, and HLA-DR) and one immune checkpoint PD1, B cell subsets (B1, switched memory, non-switched, naive B, and CD27(-) IgD(-) B cells), neutrophils, basophils, four monocytic cell subsets, dendritic cells (pDCs and mDCs), and four NK cell subsets. These panels of antibodies had been applied to monitor immune status (percentage and absolute number) in total 303 cases with various diseases, such as leukemia (AML, CML, MM, and ALL), lymphoma (B cells and NK/T cells), cancers (colon, lung, prostate, and breast), immune deficiencies, and autoimmune diseases. CONCLUSION: We provided proof of feasibility for clinical monitoring immune status and guiding immunotherapy by multicolor flow cytometry testing.","['Wang, Weiwei', 'Li, Haibo', 'Zhang, Lihua', 'Jiang, Wenli', 'Shen, Lisong', 'Fan, Guang']","['Wang W', 'Li H', 'Zhang L', 'Jiang W', 'Shen L', 'Fan G']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6849-1406'],"['Department of Clinical laboratory, Xinhua hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University of Medicine School, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Department of Clinical laboratory, Xinhua hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University of Medicine School, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Clinical laboratory, Xinhua hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University of Medicine School, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Clinical laboratory, Xinhua hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University of Medicine School, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.']",['eng'],"['81301788/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'Shanghai Medicine&Health Development Foundation/Shanghai Youth Medical Talent', 'Training Program for Clinical Laboratory']",['Journal Article'],20210418,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,['NOTNLM'],"['clinical monitoring', 'human peripheral blood', 'immune cell subsets', 'immune status', 'immunotherapy', 'multicolor flow cytometry']",2021/04/20 06:00,2021/11/30 06:00,['2021/04/19 06:58'],"['2021/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/30 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/19 06:58 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13541 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2021 Oct;43(5):1132-1144. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13541.

We found that CDKN2A (p16), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and mediator of senescence, was increased in cholangiocytes of patients with PSC and from a PSC mouse model (multidrug resistance 2; Mdr2 (-/-)). Given that recent data suggest that a reduction of senescent cells is beneficial in different diseases, we hypothesised that inhibition of cholangiocyte senescence would ameliorate disease in Mdr2 (-/-) mice. Methods: We used 2 novel genetic murine models to reduce cholangiocyte senescence: (i) p16(Ink4a) apoptosis through targeted activation of caspase (INK-ATTAC)xMdr2 (-/-), in which the dimerizing molecule AP20187 promotes selective apoptotic removal of p16-expressing cells; and (ii) mice deficient in both p16 and Mdr2. Mdr2 (-/-) mice were also treated with fisetin, a flavonoid molecule that selectively kills senescent cells. p16, p21, and inflammatory markers (tumour necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, IL-1beta, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1]) were measured by PCR, and hepatic fibrosis via a hydroxyproline assay and Sirius red staining. Results: AP20187 treatment reduced p16 and p21 expression by ~35% and ~70% (p >0.05), respectively. Expression of inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and MCP-1) decreased (by 60%, 40%, and 60%, respectively), and fibrosis was reduced by ~60% (p >0.05). Similarly, p16 (-/-) xMdr2 (-/-) mice exhibited reduced p21 expression (70%), decreased expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta (60%), and MCP-1 (65%) and reduced fibrosis (~50%) (p >0.05) compared with Mdr2 (-/-) mice. Fisetin treatment reduced expression of p16 and p21 (80% and 90%, respectively), TNF-alpha (50%), IL-1beta (50%), MCP-1 (70%), and fibrosis (60%) (p >0.05). Conclusions: Our data support a pathophysiological role of cholangiocyte senescence in the progression of PSC, and that targeted removal of senescent cholangiocytes is a plausible therapeutic approach. Lay summary: Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a fibroinflammatory, incurable biliary disease. We previously reported that biliary epithelial cell senescence (cell-cycle arrest and hypersecretion of profibrotic molecules) is an important phenotype in primary sclerosing cholangitis. Herein, we demonstrate that reducing the number of senescent cholangiocytes leads to a reduction in the expression of inflammatory, fibrotic, and senescence markers associated with the disease.","['Alsuraih, Mohammed', ""O'Hara, Steven P"", 'Woodrum, Julie E', 'Pirius, Nicholas E', 'LaRusso, Nicholas F']","['Alsuraih M', ""O'Hara SP"", 'Woodrum JE', 'Pirius NE', 'LaRusso NF']",,"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, and the Mayo Clinic Center for Cell Signaling in Gastroenterology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, and the Mayo Clinic Center for Cell Signaling in Gastroenterology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, and the Mayo Clinic Center for Cell Signaling in Gastroenterology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, and the Mayo Clinic Center for Cell Signaling in Gastroenterology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 DK084567/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK057993/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20210127,Netherlands,JHEP Rep,JHEP reports : innovation in hepatology,101761237,PMC8044431,['NOTNLM'],"['ALP, alkaline phosphatase', 'AP, AP20187', 'Apoptosis resistance', 'BCL2, B cell lymphoma 2', 'Bcl-xL, B-cell lymphoma-extra large', 'Biliary epithelial cell', 'CCA, cholangiocarcinoma', 'CKI, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor', 'Cellular senescence', 'Cholestatic liver disease', 'Col.1A, collagen 1A', 'D, dasatinib', 'EVs, extracellular vesicles', 'FKBP-Casp8, FK506-binding-protein-caspase 8', 'IF, immunofluorescence', 'INK-ATTAC, p16Ink4a apoptosis through targeted activation of caspase', 'IR, irradiation', 'MCL1, myeloid cell leukemia 1', 'MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1', 'MMP, matrix metalloproteinase', 'NHC, normal human cholangiocyte', 'PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis', 'Primary sclerosing cholangitis', 'Q, quercetin', 'RT, reverse transcription', 'SA-beta-gal, senescence-associated beta-gal', 'SASP, senescence-associated secretory phenotype', 'Senescence-associated secretory phenotype', 'Senolytics', 'TNF, tumour necrosis factor', 'WT, wild-type', 'mdr2, multidrug-resistance 2', 'qPCR, quantitative PCR', 'alpha-SMA, alpha-smooth muscle actin', 'beta-Gal, beta-galactosidase']",2021/04/20 06:00,2021/04/20 06:01,['2021/04/19 06:41'],"['2020/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/01/11 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/19 06:41 [entrez]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.jhepr.2021.100250 [doi]', 'S2589-5559(21)00026-4 [pii]']",epublish,JHEP Rep. 2021 Jan 27;3(3):100250. doi: 10.1016/j.jhepr.2021.100250. eCollection 2021 Jun.,,,,,['(c) 2021 The Authors.'],,,,,"['The authors have no conflict of interest related to the manuscript.

HbF sustains oxygen delivery to tissues until birth, when beta-globin replaces gamma-globin, leading to the formation of alpha2beta2 tetramers (HbA). However, in different benign and pathological conditions, HbF is expressed in adult cells, as it happens in the hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin, in anemias and in some leukemias. The molecular basis of gamma-globin differential expression in the fetus and of its inappropriate activation in adult cells is largely unknown, although in recent years, a few transcription factors involved in this process have been identified.

Herein, we evaluated the tumor inhibitory properties of the human Wharton's jelly stem cells (hWJSCs) co-culture (hWJSC-CC) and their extracts, namely, the hWJSC-conditioned medium (hWJSC-CM; 100%) and hWJSC-lysate (hWJSC-L; 15 mug/ml), on a CML cell line K562 in vitro. The hWJSCs expressed mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-related cluster of differentiation (CD) markers and demonstrated mesodermal tissue differentiation potential. The cell metabolic activity showed a mean maximal decrease in the K562 cells by 49.12, 41.98, and 68.80% following treatment with the hWJSC-CC, hWJSC-CM, and hWJSC-L, respectively, at 72 h. The sub-G1 population in the cell cycle was decreased by 3.2, 4.5, and 3.8% following treatment with the hWJSC-CC, hWJSC-CM, and hWJSC-L, whereas the G2/M cell population was increased by 13.7 and 12.5% with the hWJSC-CM and hWJSC-L, respectively, at 48 h. Annexin V-allophycocyanin (APC) assay showed an increase in the apoptotic cells by 4.0, 3.9, and 4.5% at 48 h. The expression of pro-apoptotic BAX and CASP3 genes were increased, whereas BIRC5 (Survivin) was decreased compared with the control. The pro-inflammation-related genes, namely, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12A, were decreased, whereas the anti-inflammatory genes, namely, IL-4 and IL-10, were increased following treatment with the hWJSC-CC, hWJSC-CM, and hWJSC-L at 48 h. Multiplex bead-based cytokine assay also demonstrated decreases in the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-12) and an increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) compared with the control. The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 showed an increase with the hWJSC-CC and decreases with both the hWJSC-CM and the hWJSC-L. The hWJSCs and their extracts inhibited the K562 cells by causing cell cycle arrest and inducing apoptosis via the soluble cellular factors. However, an in vivo evaluation is necessary to unravel the true potential of the hWJSCs and their extracts before its use in CML inhibition.","['Huwaikem, Muneerah A H', 'Kalamegam, Gauthaman', 'Alrefaei, Ghadeer', 'Ahmed, Farid', 'Kadam, Roaa', 'Qadah, Talal', 'Sait, Khalid H W', 'Pushparaj, Peter N']","['Huwaikem MAH', 'Kalamegam G', 'Alrefaei G', 'Ahmed F', 'Kadam R', 'Qadah T', 'Sait KHW', 'Pushparaj PN']",,"['Department of Medical Laboratory Technology, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Technology, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, University of Tabuk, Tabuk, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Technology, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Stem Cells Unit, Centre of Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research (CEGMR), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Biology Department, Faculty of Sciences, University of Jeddah, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Embryonic and Cancer Stem Cell Research Group, King Fahad Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Technology, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Stem Cells Unit, Centre of Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research (CEGMR), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Technology, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Stem Cells Unit, Centre of Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research (CEGMR), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Technology, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Technology, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Stem Cells Unit, Centre of Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research (CEGMR), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210318,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,PMC8044948,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'cell cycle', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'cytokines', 'gene expression', ""human Wharton's jelly stem cells""]",2021/04/20 06:00,2021/04/20 06:01,['2021/04/19 06:32'],"['2020/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/19 06:32 [entrez]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.614988 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Mar 18;9:614988. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.614988. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Huwaikem, Kalamegam, Alrefaei, Ahmed, Kadam, Qadah, Sait and', 'Pushparaj.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is related to resistance to glucocorticoids and chemotherapy; however, the reported prognosis of T-ALL with SET-CAN/NUP214 fusion is diverse, and the optimal treatment option remains undetermined. Here, we present the treatment process of an illuminating case of T-ALL with SET-CAN/NUP214 fusion. The patient showed early resistance to routine VICLP chemotherapy (at 15(th) day, 79.2% blasts), but the leukemia burden was significantly reduced after 28-day induction chemotherapy (18.85% blasts), even though she still didn't achieve complete remission (CR) after a second course of high-dose methotrexate (3 g/m2) and pegaspargase. Ex vivo drug sensitivity screening using a panel of 165 kinds of cytotoxic drugs, targeted therapy drugs, combination chemotherapy drugs, etc., was conducted on the refractory leukemia cells, which showed extensive resistance to various regimens. Surprisingly, AML-like scheme DAE scheme (daunorubicin + cytarabine + etoposide) and carfilzomib showed the highest ex vivo inhibition rate. The patient received DAE regimen chemotherapy, and finally achieved complete remission and received allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). According to our own findings and a literature survey, we found that T-ALL patients with SET-CAN/NUP214 fusion usually shows early resistance to chemotherapy, but they have a delayed response, and the CR rate is not compromised; thus, a chemotherapy regimen featuring a 28-day long course, such as that used in GRAALL 2003 or 2005, is recommended for induction therapy. For refractory patients, AML-like therapy such as DAE or CLAG in combination with asparaginase may be beneficial. In addition, carfilzomib may be a useful therapeutic drug and is worthy of further study. Allo-HSCT improves prognosis and we recommend HSCT if possible. Additional chromosomal or molecular events may affect the prognosis, and further investigation is needed. We believe that through proper treatment, the prognosis of patients with SET-CAN/NUP214 fusion can be greatly improved, at least not worse than that of other T-ALL patients.","['Lin, Na', 'Liu, Zhenghua', 'Li, Yan', 'Yan, Xiaojing', 'Wang, Lei']","['Lin N', 'Liu Z', 'Li Y', 'Yan X', 'Wang L']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210326,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC8044795,['NOTNLM'],"['SET-CAN/NUP214 fusion', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'prognosis', 'treatment']",2021/04/20 06:00,2021/04/20 06:01,['2021/04/19 06:32'],"['2021/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/19 06:32 [entrez]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.651494 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Mar 26;11:651494. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.651494. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Lin, Liu, Li, Yan and Wang.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, a proportion of patients are still not cured with available therapeutic options, thus efforts devoted to studying and identifying new potential druggable targets are warranted. B-cell receptor stimulation triggers a complex cascade of signaling events that eventually drives the activation of downstream transcription factors including Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT). In this review, we summarize the literature on the expression and function of NFAT family members in CLL where NFAT is not only overexpressed but also constitutively activated; NFAT controls B-cell anergy and targeting this molecule using specific inhibitors impacts on CLL cell viability. Next, we extend our analysis on other mature B-cell lymphomas where a distinct pattern of expression and activation of NFAT is reported. We discuss the therapeutic potential of strategies aimed at targeting NFAT in B-cell malignancies not overlooking the fact that NFAT may play additional roles regulating the inflammatory microenvironment.","['Sana, Ilenia', 'Mantione, Maria Elena', 'Angelillo, Piera', 'Muzio, Marta']","['Sana I', 'Mantione ME', 'Angelillo P', 'Muzio M']",,"['Division of Experimental Oncology, San Raffaele Hospital IRCCS, Milano, Italy.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, San Raffaele Hospital IRCCS, Milano, Italy.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, San Raffaele Hospital IRCCS, Milano, Italy.', 'Lymphoma Unit, Department of Onco-Hematology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, San Raffaele Hospital IRCCS, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210401,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC8047411,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell receptor', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'lymphoid malignancies', 'lymphoma', 'nuclear factor of activated T cells']",2021/04/20 06:00,2021/04/20 06:01,['2021/04/19 06:32'],"['2021/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/19 06:32 [entrez]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.651057 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Apr 1;11:651057. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.651057. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Sana, Mantione, Angelillo and Muzio.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, in the case of solid tumor treatment, CAR T cell therapies have not yielded encouraging results mainly due to challenges such as the formidable network of the tumor microenvironments (TME) that operates in a suppressive fashion resulting in CAR T cell dysfunction. In this review, we tend to shine a light on emerging strategies and solutions for addressing the mentioned barriers. These solutions might dramatically help shorten the gap between a successful clinical outcome and the hope for it.","['Safarzadeh Kozani, Pooria', 'Safarzadeh Kozani, Pouya', 'Rahbarizadeh, Fatemeh', 'Khoshtinat Nikkhoi, Shahryar']","['Safarzadeh Kozani P', 'Safarzadeh Kozani P', 'Rahbarizadeh F', 'Khoshtinat Nikkhoi S']",,"['Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Paramedicine, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Medical Biotechnology Research Center, School of Nursing, Midwifery, and Paramedicine, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Research and Development Center of Biotechnology, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ, United States.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210401,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC8047470,['NOTNLM'],"['adoptive cell therapy', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'immunotherapy', 'solid tumors', 'toxicities', 'tumor microenvironment']",2021/04/20 06:00,2021/04/20 06:01,['2021/04/19 06:32'],"['2020/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/19 06:32 [entrez]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.627549 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Apr 1;11:627549. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.627549. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Safarzadeh Kozani, Safarzadeh Kozani, Rahbarizadeh and', 'Khoshtinat Nikkhoi.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite advances in treatment, brain tumors remain a leading cause of death in pediatric cancer patients and survivors often suffer from life-long consequences of side effects of therapy. The 5-year survival rates, however, vary widely by tumor type, ranging from over 90% in more benign tumors to as low as 20% in the most aggressive forms such as glioblastoma. Even within historically defined tumor types such as medulloblastoma, molecular analysis identified biologically heterogeneous subgroups each with different genetic alterations, age of onset and prognosis. Besides molecularly driven patient stratification to tailor disease risk to therapy intensity, such a diversity demonstrates the need for more precise and disease-relevant pediatric brain cancer models for research and drug development. Here we give an overview of currently available in vitro and in vivo pediatric brain tumor models and discuss the opportunities that new technologies such as 3D cultures and organoids that can bridge limitations posed by the simplicity of monolayer cultures and the complexity of in vivo models, bring to accommodate better precision in drug development for pediatric brain tumors.","['Li, Zhiqin', 'Langhans, Sigrid A']","['Li Z', 'Langhans SA']",,"['Nemours Biomedical Research, Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE, United States.', 'Nemours Biomedical Research, Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE, United States.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210401,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC8047472,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'glioma', 'in vitro models', 'in vivo models', 'medulloblastoma', 'pediatrics', 'preclinical models']",2021/04/20 06:00,2021/04/20 06:01,['2021/04/19 06:32'],"['2020/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/19 06:32 [entrez]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.620831 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Apr 1;11:620831. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.620831. eCollection 2021.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2021 Li and Langhans.'],,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

NK cell activity is driven by signals received through ligands binding activating or inhibitory receptors. Their activity towards elimination of transformed or virally infected cells can be mediated through MICA, MICB and ULBP ligands binding the activating receptor NKG2D. Given the efficiency of NK cells, potential target cells developed multiple protecting mechanisms to overcome NK cells killing on various levels of biogenesis of NKG2D ligands. Targeted cells can degrade ligand transcripts via microRNAs or modify them at protein level to prevent their presence at cell surface via shedding, with added benefit of shed ligands to desensitize NKG2D receptor and avert the threat of destruction via NK cells. NK cells and their activity are also indispensable during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, crucial treatment option for patients with malignant disease, including acute myeloid leukemia. Function of both NKG2D and its ligands is strongly affected by polymorphisms and particular allelic variants, as different alleles can play variable roles in ligand-receptor interaction, influencing NK cell function and HSCT outcome differently. For example, role of amino acid exchange at position 129 in MICA or at position 98 in MICB, as well as the role of other polymorphisms leading to different shedding of ligands, was described. Finally, match or mismatch between patient and donor in NKG2D ligands affect HSCT outcome. Having the information beyond standard HLA typing prior HSCT could be instrumental to find the best donor for the patient and to optimize effects of treatment by more precise patient-donor match. Here, we review recent research on the NKG2D/NKG2D ligand biology, their regulation, description of their polymorphisms across the populations of patients with AML and the influence of particular polymorphisms on HSCT outcome.","['Machuldova, Alena', 'Holubova, Monika', 'Caputo, Valentina S', 'Cedikova, Miroslava', 'Jindra, Pavel', 'Houdova, Lucie', 'Pitule, Pavel']","['Machuldova A', 'Holubova M', 'Caputo VS', 'Cedikova M', 'Jindra P', 'Houdova L', 'Pitule P']",,"['Laboratory of Tumor Biology and Immunotherapy, Biomedical Center, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University, Pilsen, Czechia.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Biology and Immunotherapy, Biomedical Center, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University, Pilsen, Czechia.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital Pilsen, Pilsen, Czechia.', 'Hugh & Josseline Langmuir Center for Myeloma Research, Center for Hematology, Department of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Biology and Therapy Laboratory, School of Applied Sciences, London South Bank University, London, United Kingdom.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Biology and Immunotherapy, Biomedical Center, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University, Pilsen, Czechia.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital Pilsen, Pilsen, Czechia.', 'NTIS, Faculty of Applied Sciences, University of West Bohemia, Pilsen, Czechia.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Biology and Immunotherapy, Biomedical Center, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University, Pilsen, Czechia.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University, Pilsen, Czechia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20210330,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC8044845,['NOTNLM'],"['*MICA', '*MICB', '*ULBP', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*hematopoietic stem cell transplant', '*natural killer group 2 member D', '*polymorphism']",2021/04/20 06:00,2021/09/25 06:00,['2021/04/19 06:21'],"['2021/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/19 06:21 [entrez]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.651751 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Mar 30;12:651751. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.651751. eCollection 2021.,20210924,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (MHC class I-related chain A)', '0 (MICB antigen)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)']",IM,"['Disease-Free Survival', 'Donor Selection/methods', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Ligands', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precision Medicine/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Machuldova, Holubova, Caputo, Cedikova, Jindra, Houdova and', 'Pitule.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A possible mechanism of resistance to hypomethylating agents (HMAs) is the upregulation of the expression of inhibitory checkpoint receptors and their ligands, making the combination of HMAs and immune checkpoint blockade therapy a rational approach. Although the safety of anti-programmed cell death protein (PD)-1 antibodies for patients with post-allo-HSCT remains a complicated issue, the preliminary clinical result of combining azacitidine with anti-PD-1 antibodies is encouraging; however, the safety and efficacy of this approach need further investigation. Case Presentation: We reported a case of treated secondary (ts)-AML in a patient who received tislelizumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) in combination with azacitidine. The patient relapsed after allo-HSCT and was previously exposed to HMAs-based therapy. The patient received tislelizumab for compassionate use. After the combination treatment, the patient achieved complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery, negative minimal residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry (FCM), and negative Wilms' tumor protein 1 (WT1). However, the patient successively developed serious immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and graft vs. host disease (GVHD) and eventually died from complications of GVHD. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first case to report the combined use of tislelizumab and azacitidine to treat relapsed AML posttransplantation. This report highlights the safety concerns of using an anti-PD-1 antibody in combination with azacitidine after allo-HSCT, especially the risk of GVHD, and provides a basis for future studies.","['Yao, Sun', 'Jianlin, Chen', 'Zhuoqing, Qiao', 'Yuhang, Li', 'Jiangwei, Hu', 'Guoliang, Hu', 'Hongmei, Ning', 'Bin, Zhang', 'Liangding, Hu']","['Yao S', 'Jianlin C', 'Zhuoqing Q', 'Yuhang L', 'Jiangwei H', 'Guoliang H', 'Hongmei N', 'Bin Z', 'Liangding H']",,"[""Department of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."", 'Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Therapy and Transformation Research, Beijing, China.', ""Department of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."", 'Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Therapy and Transformation Research, Beijing, China.', ""Department of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210401,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC8047076,['NOTNLM'],"['*GvHD', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*hypomethylating agents', '*immune checkpoint blockade', '*post-transplantation relapse']",2021/04/20 06:00,2021/09/21 06:00,['2021/04/19 06:21'],"['2020/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/19 06:21 [entrez]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.639217 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Apr 1;12:639217. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.639217. eCollection 2021.,20210920,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0KVO411B3N (tislelizumab)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Azacitidine/adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Yao, Jianlin, Zhuoqing, Yuhang, Jiangwei, Guoliang, Hongmei,', 'Bin and Liangding.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

T cell receptor beta chain constant region 1 (TRBC1) is partially expressed in subsets of normal T cells. However, the immunotherapy of T lymphocyte tumors is rarely validated in clinical trials. Here, we aim to explore whether TRBC1 is a promising target for the immunotherapy of T lymphocyte tumors. This study examined TRBC1 expression in 25 healthy bone marrow samples, 39 patients with T-lineage acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL), 4 patients with mature T cell neoplasms, and 5 patients suspected with mature T cell neoplasms with evidence of T cell neoplasia. Moreover, the expression of TRBC1 was evaluated by flow cytometry and through PCR detection of TCR gene rearrangements. The expression of monophasic TRBC1 was identified in all 25 normal bone marrows (23.83% +/- 2.74% positive rate). The expression of TRBC1 was positive in 5 patients (12.8%) among the 39 T-ALL patients. TRBC1 was partially expressed in 1 patient (25%) with T cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (T-NHL) and in 1 patient (20%) suspected to have T-NHL. Healthy donors showed a pattern of partial expression and patients with T-lymphocyte tumors showed a polytypic TRBC1 expression pattern.

This is a prospective cohort study conducted at Hiwa Cancer Hospital in Sulaimani city and Nanakali Hospital in Erbil city-Kurdistan Iraq from March 2012 to August 2017. The main characteristics of adult ALL patients, type of therapy and risk factors were analyzed to assess their impact on treatment outcome and survival status. A total of 109 adult ALL patients were included with a median age of 24 years and male to female ratio of 1.7:1. B-ALL accounted for 76.1% of the cases, while the rest were T-ALL. BCR-ABL rearrangement was encountered in 12% of B-ALL. Complete remission (CR) rate was 81.7%, the overall 5 year survival (OS) was 38%, Relapse Free 5 year Survival (RFS) was 49%. Younger adults (< 35 years) had significantly higher CR rates and OS compared to the older group (P < 0.001 each). On the other hand, gender, high leucocyte count >/= 50x10(9)/L, immunophenotype (including B and T ALL subtypes), and clinical risk status did not predict a poor outcome. Multivariate analysis revealed that only age < 35 years and BCR-ABL rearrangement were significantly associated with better OS. Despite some limitations, the outcomes of Iraqi adult ALL is comparable to those reported in Western developed countries, with particularly favorable outcomes in younger patients. The need to improve outcome in adult ALL remains an important priority in our country as it is throughout the world.","['Mohammed, Dyna Jaza', 'Jalal, Sana Dlawar', 'Yassin, Ahmed Khudair', 'Mohammed, Ali Ibrahim', 'Al-Allawi, Nasir Abdulsalam']","['Mohammed DJ', 'Jalal SD', 'Yassin AK', 'Mohammed AI', 'Al-Allawi NA']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6025-9802'],"['Department of Hematology, Hewa Hemato-onology Hospital, Sulaimani, Iraq.', 'Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, University of Sulaimani, Sulaimani, Iraq.grid.440843.f', 'Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Hawler Medical University, Erbil, Iraq.grid.412012.40000 0004 0417 5553', 'Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, University of Sulaimani, Sulaimani, Iraq.grid.440843.f', 'Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, University of Duhok, Duhok, Iraq.grid.413095.a0000 0001 1895 1777']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200903,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,PMC8012463,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Adults', 'Iraq', 'Outcome', 'Survival']",2021/04/20 06:00,2021/04/20 06:01,['2021/04/19 06:17'],"['2019/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/04/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/04/19 06:17 [entrez]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-020-01345-1 [doi]', '1345 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2021 Apr;37(2):264-270. doi: 10.1007/s12288-020-01345-1.

As epigenetic is the major cause of AML pathogenesis, this study aimed at investigating LKB1, SHMT1, and GLDC gene expression levels in acute myeloid leukemia patients. The present study was conducted on LKB1, SHMT1, and GLDC gene expression levels in 60 de novo AML samples and 30 normal controls using real-time RT-PCR. The results showed that LKB1 and SHMT1 have respectively a significantly lower (P < 0.05) and higher (P < 0.05) expression level than that of normal controls. Furthermore, the correlation between LKB1 with SHMT1 and GLDC was significant and positive (P value: 0.015, r: 0.299). Positive findings confirm that metabolic pathways alongside the LKB1 association drive the epigenetic axis and its substrate production. Therefore, it can be concluded that the newly-discovered pathway in the pathogenesis of this disease provides new insights into the design of therapeutic targets.","['Mezginejad, Fateme', 'Mohammadi, Mohammad Hossein', 'Khadem, Parinaz', 'Farsani, Mehdi Allahbakhshian']","['Mezginejad F', 'Mohammadi MH', 'Khadem P', 'Farsani MA']",,"['Laboratory Hematology & Blood Banking, Department of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.grid.411600.2', 'Laboratory Hematology & Blood Banking, Department of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.grid.411600.2', 'HSCT Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.grid.411600.2', 'Laboratory Hematology & Blood Banking, Department of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.grid.411600.2', 'Laboratory Hematology & Blood Banking, Department of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.grid.411600.2', 'HSCT Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.grid.411600.2', 'Department of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Darband St, Qods Sq, Tehran, Iran.grid.411600.2']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200814,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,PMC8012466,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'GLDC', 'LKB1', 'SHMT1']",2021/04/20 06:00,2021/04/20 06:01,['2021/04/19 06:17'],"['2020/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/04/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/04/19 06:17 [entrez]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-020-01329-1 [doi]', '1329 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2021 Apr;37(2):249-255. doi: 10.1007/s12288-020-01329-1.

Several studies have shown that lncRNAs play a pivotal role in the initiation, maintenance, and progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which could make them a promising candidate in the diagnosis and treatment of leukemia. Acute Megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) is a rare form of AML with a poor prognosis and low survival. It has been reported that lncRNA MIR100HG is involved several types of malignancies. In the present study, MIR100HG was downregulated in a human acute megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line (M-07e) using Antisense LNA GapmeRs. In order to assess the expression level of MIR100HG, cell viability, apoptosis, and necrosis (late apoptosis), quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Methyl-thiazol Tetrazolium assay, AnnexinV, and propidium iodide staining was performed at different time points after the transfection. In addition, the expression level of TGFbeta was evaluated by qRT-PCR. Our results revealed that inhibition of MIR100HG might serve as a new method for inhibition of the proliferation of AMKL cells and therefore, could be a promising approach in medicine for targeted therapy in AMKL.","['Bagheri, Parisa', 'Sharifi, Mohammadreza', 'Ghadiri, Ava']","['Bagheri P', 'Sharifi M', 'Ghadiri A']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1538-9034'],"['Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Science, Isfahan, 81744-176 Iran.grid.411036.10000 0001 1498 685X', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Science, Isfahan, 81744-176 Iran.grid.411036.10000 0001 1498 685X', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Science, Isfahan, 81744-176 Iran.grid.411036.10000 0001 1498 685X']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200724,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,PMC8012473,['NOTNLM'],"['Antisense LNA gapmeR', 'Apoptosis', 'MIR100HG', 'Megakaryoblastic leukemia', 'TGFbeta']",2021/04/20 06:00,2021/04/20 06:01,['2021/04/19 06:17'],"['2020/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/04/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/04/19 06:17 [entrez]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-020-01324-6 [doi]', '1324 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2021 Apr;37(2):232-239. doi: 10.1007/s12288-020-01324-6.

Pseudohyperkalemia is defined as a difference between serum and plasma potassium concentration of more than 0.4 meq/L with serum values on the higher side when both the samples are obtained at the same time, remain at room temperature and are tested within 1 h of sample collection. Given the implication of basing medical decisions on falsely elevated potassium levels, timely identification of the entity of pseudohyperkalemia and differentiating it from true hyperkalemia becomes utmost important. Here we present a case report of a 36 year old female admitted with a provisional diagnosis of pyrexia of unknown origin with hepatosplenomegaly and anaemia under evaluation. During hospital stay her potassium levels in whole blood, serum and plasma reportedly differed significantly. An abnormal WBC count beyond assay range was reported and during subsequent investigations this lead to a peripheral smear being advised and diagnosis revealed chronic lymphoblastic leukaemia with blast crisis and 86% blast cells. In patients with leukocytosis and thrombocytosis, pseudohyperkalemia may exist in the absence of electrocardiogram changes or other clinical manifestations of true hyperkalemia thus leading to reevaluation of potassium values in serum, plasma and whole blood to arrive at the true picture.","['Mahto, Mala', 'Kumar, Mukunda', 'Kumar, Sushil', 'Banerjee, Ayan']","['Mahto M', 'Kumar M', 'Kumar S', 'Banerjee A']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0445-6972'],"['Department of Biochemistry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences Patna, Phulwarisharif, Patna, Bihar 801507 India.grid.413618.90000 0004 1767 6103', 'Department of Biochemistry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences Patna, Phulwarisharif, Patna, Bihar 801507 India.grid.413618.90000 0004 1767 6103', 'Department of Biochemistry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences Patna, Phulwarisharif, Patna, Bihar 801507 India.grid.413618.90000 0004 1767 6103', 'Department of Biochemistry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences Patna, Phulwarisharif, Patna, Bihar 801507 India.grid.413618.90000 0004 1767 6103']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20200514,India,Indian J Clin Biochem,Indian journal of clinical biochemistry : IJCB,8708303,PMC7994497,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'Leukocytosis thrombocytosis', 'Pseudohyperkalemia', 'Reverse pseudohyperkalemia']",2021/04/20 06:00,2021/04/20 06:01,['2021/04/19 06:17'],"['2020/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/04/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/04/19 06:17 [entrez]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12291-020-00889-3 [doi]', '889 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Clin Biochem. 2021 Apr;36(2):235-238. doi: 10.1007/s12291-020-00889-3.

Few studies have been conducted on interventions to improve adherence. The authors conducted a systematic review to explore studies that examined the impact of strategies to improve TKI adherence among individuals with CML. METHODS: The first 2 authors completed a systematic literature review according to the guidelines in Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Studies (n=2633) conducted between 1980 and 2019 were identified through 3 databases and examined for inclusion/exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were identified which met the eligibility criteria. The studies only examined adherence to imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib. Ten of the 14 used large data sets (commercial health insurance plans or Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results [SEER] data) for analysis. The majority of the studies used a cohort design. Adherence was defined and measured in a variety of ways with most studies using 80% or higher as adequate adherence. Strategies not focused on health care costs used a multidisciplinary team approach. CONCLUSION: Development of evidence to improve treatment adherence to TKIs for CML have relied on large data sets rather than prospective trials. Current studies lack patient focused interventions.","['Heiney, Sue P', 'Sorrell, McKenzie', 'Sheng, Jingxi', 'Adams, Swann A', 'Nelson, Kathy', 'Nguyen, Lan A', 'Edwards, Amy', 'Wickersham, Karen E']","['Heiney SP', 'Sorrell M', 'Sheng J', 'Adams SA', 'Nelson K', 'Nguyen LA', 'Edwards A', 'Wickersham KE']",,"['College of Nursing.', 'Prisma Health-Midlands/USC School of Medicine Columbia, Internal Medicine Residency Program.', 'Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC.', 'College of Nursing.', 'College of Nursing.', 'Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, Arnold School of Public Health.', 'College of Nursing.', 'College of Nursing.', 'Thomas Cooper Library, University of South Carolina.', 'College of Nursing.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",,United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,,,,2021/04/20 06:00,2021/06/29 06:00,['2021/04/19 06:11'],"['2021/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/29 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/19 06:11 [entrez]']","['10.1097/COC.0000000000000818 [doi]', '00000421-202106000-00011 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 2021 Jun 1;44(6):291-298. doi: 10.1097/COC.0000000000000818.,20210625,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['*Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/economics/enzymology/psychology', 'Medication Adherence/*psychology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/economics/*therapeutic use']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Since DNA methylation has been implicated in the regulation of viral infections and the immune system, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify candidate loci regulated by this epigenetic mark that could be involved in the onset of COVID-19 in patients without comorbidities. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 407 confirmed COVID-19 patients </= 61 years of age and without comorbidities, 194 (47.7%) of whom had mild symptomatology that did not involve hospitalization and 213 (52.3%) had a severe clinical course that required respiratory support. The set of cases was divided into discovery (n = 207) and validation (n = 200) cohorts, balanced for age and sex of individuals. We analysed the DNA methylation status of 850,000 CpG sites in these patients. FINDINGS: The DNA methylation status of 44 CpG sites was associated with the clinical severity of COVID-19. Of these loci, 23 (52.3%) were located in 20 annotated coding genes. These genes, such as the inflammasome component Absent in Melanoma 2 (AIM2) and the Major Histocompatibility Complex, class I C (HLA-C) candidates, were mainly involved in the response of interferon to viral infection. We used the EWAS-identified sites to establish a DNA methylation signature (EPICOVID) that is associated with the severity of the disease. INTERPRETATION: We identified DNA methylation sites as epigenetic susceptibility loci for respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. These candidate biomarkers, combined with other clinical, cellular and genetic factors, could be useful in the clinical stratification and management of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2.

Treatment of relapsed/refractory (R/R) T-ALL/T-LBL is challenging with very few therapeutic options. AREAS COVERED: This report provides a concise review on the efficacy and safety of nelarabine monotherapy in adults with R/R T-ALL and T-LBL. EXPERT OPINION: Nelarabine is approved for the treatment of adults with R/R T-ALL/T-LBL in the setting of third or more line of therapy. Hematological and neurological toxicities are the most frequent adverse events. Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are common, however with treatment-related deaths accounting only for 1-2% of patients. Neurological toxicity is typically characterized by a reversible peripheral neuropathy, usually mild or moderate and without treatment delay. Other neurological (somnolence and depressed level of consciousness) or extra-neurological adverse events are uncommon and rarely severe. In conclusion, nelarabine is a well tolerated and effective salvage therapy in patients with R/R T-ALL/T-LBL and has acquired an important role as a bridge-therapy to allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","['Candoni, Anna', 'Lazzarotto, Davide', 'Petruzzellis, Giuseppe']","['Candoni A', 'Lazzarotto D', 'Petruzzellis G']",,"['Division of Hematology and SCT, Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Friuli Centrale (ASUFC), University Hospital of Udine (Italy).', 'Division of Hematology and SCT, Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Friuli Centrale (ASUFC), University Hospital of Udine (Italy).', 'Division of Hematology and SCT, Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Friuli Centrale (ASUFC), University Hospital of Udine (Italy).']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210517,England,Expert Opin Drug Saf,Expert opinion on drug safety,101163027,,['NOTNLM'],"['Nelarabine', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'lymphoblastic lymphoma', 'neurotoxicity']",2021/04/20 06:00,2021/08/14 06:00,['2021/04/19 05:28'],"['2021/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/19 05:28 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14740338.2021.1919621 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Saf. 2021 Jul;20(7):751-756. doi: 10.1080/14740338.2021.1919621.

Altered level of consciousness, seizure, and stroke-like manifestations are among the most common presentations. MRI of the brain in an early stage is consistent with white matter leukoencephalopathy. There are no specific guidelines for the treatment of such a syndrome. An elevated cerebrospinal fluid (csf) adenosine concentration causes vasodilatation in the brain and leads to cerebral ischemia, which may be reduced by aminophylline infusion. The study is a retrospective data analysis in which electronic data records of 30 patients, collected from September 2017 - August 2019. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of aminophylline in IT-MTX induced neurotoxicity. Aminophylline infusion was used in 30 patients with IT-MTX neurotoxicity. Twenty-five patients (83.33%) showed dramatic improvement of neurologic signs and symptoms within 48 hours. Aminophylline was, hence, coined as a salvageable therapy. No noticeable side effects were observed during treatment with aminophylline infusion.

When TKI therapy is addressed appropriately, it can lead to an optimal molecular response in the majority of CML patients and a life expectancy that approaches that of the general population. However, lifelong TKI therapy may have consequences, including chronic, mostly low-grade, adverse events that can substantially impact patients' quality of life, adherence to therapy and, consequently, success of treatment. In the last few years, several groups have demonstrated that approximately 50% of chronic phase CML patients (CP-CML) who have achieved a stable deep molecular response (DMR) can stop therapy without suffering molecular relapse. Nowadays, treatment-free remission (TFR) has a significant role in the management of CML and should be considered in selected motivated patients that fulfill well-defined requirements to maximize the probability of successful discontinuation of TKI therapy.","['Cerveira, Nuno', 'Bizarro, Susana', 'Teixeira, Manuel R', 'Mariz, Jose M']","['Cerveira N', 'Bizarro S', 'Teixeira MR', 'Mariz JM']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5098-3840'],"['Servico de Genetica, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia do Porto, Rua Dr. Antonio Bernardino de Almeida, 4200-072, Porto, Portugal. nuno.cerveira@ipoporto.min-saude.pt.', 'Servico de Genetica, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia do Porto, Rua Dr. Antonio Bernardino de Almeida, 4200-072, Porto, Portugal.', 'Servico de Genetica, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia do Porto, Rua Dr. Antonio Bernardino de Almeida, 4200-072, Porto, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas, Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Servico de Hematologia, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia do Porto, Porto, Portugal.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210417,United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*TKI discontinuation', '*Treatment discontinuation', '*Treatment-free remission']",2021/04/19 06:00,2021/04/19 06:00,['2021/04/18 21:01'],"['2021/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/18 21:01 [entrez]', '2021/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11864-021-00851-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s11864-021-00851-2 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2021 Apr 17;22(6):49. doi: 10.1007/s11864-021-00851-2.,,,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arsenic metabolites including inorganic arsenic and methylated arsenic could lead to different toxicity and curative effect. This study aims to establish a method to determine arsenic species in red blood cells (RBCs), clarify the distribution characteristics of arsenic species in RBCs. METHODS: Steady state blood samples were collected from 97 APL patients. H2O2 and HClO4 were used to release the hemoglobin bounding arsenic and precipitate protein. Arsenite (iAs(III)), arsenate (iAs(V)), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA(V)) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)) in plasma and RBCs were detected by HPLC-HG-AFS. Free and bound arsenic species in RBCs were separated by 30 kDa molecular mass cutoff filters and determined to evaluate hemoglobin binding capacity of different arsenic species. RESULTS: The method was validated with accuracy ranged from 84.75% to 104.13%. Arsenic species in RBCs followed the trend iAs > MMA > DMA (p < 0.01), while the concentration of DMA was significantly higher than iAs and MMA in plasma (p < 0.01). The correlation between iAs concentration in plasma and corresponding RBCs arsenic level was weak. And the concentrations of DMA and MMA in plasma were moderately positive correlated with those in RBCs. Hemoglobin-binding ratios of iAs, MMA and DMA were all over 70 %. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we provided a reliable method to determine arsenic species in RBCs of APL patients treated with ATO by HPLC-HG-AFS. It was confirmed that the concentration of DMA is the highest in plasma, while MMA is the most predominant methylated arsenic in RBCs. High affinity of MMA with human Hb was responsible for the accumulation of arsenic in RBCs of APL patients.","['Guo, Sixun', 'Wang, Xinyu', 'Gao, Chunlu', 'Wu, Zhiqiang', 'Chen, Hongzhu', 'Lin, Liwang', 'Guo, Meihua', 'Gao, Yanhui', 'Hai, Xin']","['Guo S', 'Wang X', 'Gao C', 'Wu Z', 'Chen H', 'Lin L', 'Guo M', 'Gao Y', 'Hai X']",,"['Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, 23 You-Zheng Street, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, 23 You-Zheng Street, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, 23 You-Zheng Street, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, 23 You-Zheng Street, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, 23 You-Zheng Street, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, 23 You-Zheng Street, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, 23 You-Zheng Street, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Center for Endemic Disease Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Key Lab of Etiology and Epidemiology, Education Bureau of Heilongjiang Province & National Health Commission (23618504), Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, 23 You-Zheng Street, Harbin, 150001, China.

Although JAK/STAT pathway gene mutation, such as STAT3/STAT5B, is the dominant driver in the proliferation of LGLL, immune abnormality remains an unsolved puzzle in the pathogenesis. METHODS: By means of bioinformatic method through the GEO dataset GSE39838, we performed the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, as well as protein-protein interaction network (PPI) module calculation. RESULTS: As a consequence, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in immune regulation were detected to be related with LGLL, including C1QA, C1QC and CD163 etc. Among all the DEGs, 147 genes were up-regulated, while the number of down-regulated genes was 1,296. In the KEGG pathway of LGLL, infection and immunity were the primary alteration, including tuberculosis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, meticulous experiments are required to validate. CONCLUSIONS: To sum up, dysimmunity might be another internal anomaly of LGLL, thus it is a reminder that immune regulation of LGLL should be paid more attention. Moreover, immune microenvironment studies in LGLL covering T, B, and NK cells probably contribute to the molecular pathology, aiming to contribute to the molecular pathology of the LGLL. Additionally, pharmaceutical development directed at immune molecules might be pre-dictive of targeted therapy era in LGLL.","['Lu, Guang', 'Du, Jun', 'Mou, Weiwei', 'Hu, Jing', 'Han, Xin-le']","['Lu G', 'Du J', 'Mou W', 'Hu J', 'Han XL']",,,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,,,,2021/04/19 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2021/04/18 17:09'],"['2021/04/18 17:09 [entrez]', '2021/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/Clin.Lab.2020.200819 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2021 Apr 1;67(4). doi: 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2020.200819.,20210621,,IM,"['*Computational Biology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural', '*Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A series of new N-(4-(substituted)-3-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl) isobutyramides (8a-t) and their N-ethyl analogous (9a-t) were synthesized and characterized. The inhibitory potential of the synthesized compounds on the viability of three human cancer cell lines HEP3BPN 11 (liver), MDA-MB 453 (breast), and HL 60 (leukemia) were assessed. Among all the compounds 8 L, 8q, 9n and 9p showed higher inhibitory activity on the viability of HL 60 than the standard methotrexate. These lead molecules were then tested for their potential to inhibit the activity of proangiogenic cytokines. The compound 9n showed significantly better inhibition against two cytokines viz. TNFalpha and Leptin as compared to the standard suramin, while 9p has activity comparable to suramin against IGF1, VEGF, FGFb, and Leptin. The 8q is found to be strong antiangiogenic agent against IGF1, VEGF and TGFbeta; while 8 L has showed activity against TNFalpha, VEGF, and Leptin inhibition. Furthermore antioxidant potential of 8a-t and 9a-t compounds was screened using DPPH, OH and SOR radical scavenging activities. The OH radical scavenging activity of 8c and DPPH activities of 9n as well as 9o are significant as compared to respective standards ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol. The 8c, 9p and 9 h have also exhibited potential antioxidant activity. Additionally, we present in silico molecular docking data to provide the structural rationale of observed TNFalpha inhibition against newly synthesized compounds. Overall, the synthesized flutamide derivatives have not only anticancer activity, but also possess dual inhibitory effect (anti-angiogenesis and antioxidant) and hence can act as a promising avenue to develop further anticancer agents.","['Sawant, Ajay S', 'Kamble, Sonali S', 'Pisal, Parshuram M', 'Sawant, Sanjay S', 'Hese, Shrikant V', 'Bagul, Kamini T', 'Pinjari, Rahul V', 'Kamble, Vinod T', 'Meshram, Rohan J', 'Gacche, Rajesh N']","['Sawant AS', 'Kamble SS', 'Pisal PM', 'Sawant SS', 'Hese SV', 'Bagul KT', 'Pinjari RV', 'Kamble VT', 'Meshram RJ', 'Gacche RN']",,"['School of Chemical Sciences, Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University, Nanded-431 606, MS, India.', 'Gramin Science (Vocational) College, Vishnupuri, Nanded-431 606, MS, India.', 'School of Chemical Sciences, Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University, Nanded-431 606, MS, India.', 'School of Chemical Sciences, Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University, Nanded-431 606, MS, India.', 'DD Bhoyar College of Arts and Science Mouda, Nagpur, 441104, MS, India.', 'Bioinformatics Centre, Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune, 411007, India.', 'School of Chemical Sciences, Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University, Nanded-431 606, MS, India.', 'Organic Chemistry Research Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Institute of Science, Nagpur, MS, India.

This study is aimed to explore the role and downstream mechanism of lncRNA LINC01003 in MM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Xenograft tumor assay was used to assess the function of LINC01003 in MM in vivo. The mRNA expression levels of LINC01003, miR-33a-5p, and PIM1 were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cell viability was examined by MTT assay. Relative protein levels of apoptosis-related factors (Bcl-2 and Bax) and proviral integration site of the Moloney leukemia virus kinase 1 (PIM1) were detected via western blot. Adhesion-related proteins were measured by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the levels of adhesion-related proteins. Besides, the target relation among LINC01003, miR-33a-5p and PIM1 was tested via dual-luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: Low expression of LINC01003 was observed in MM cell lines and peripheral blood samples of MM patients. Both LINC01003 up-regulation and miR-33a-5p down-regulation repressed cell viability and adhesion, and promoted apoptosis of MM cells. Moreover, LINC01003 suppressed the growth of xenograft tumor in mice. We then identified miR-33a-5p as a downstream target of LINC01003, and confirmed that PIM1 was a direct target gene of miR-33a-5p. Both high expression of miR-33a-5p and low expression of PIM1 reversed the suppressive effects of LINC01003 overexpression on cell adhesion and viability, and the promoting effect on apoptosis in MM cells. CONCLUSION: LINC01003 functioned as a sponge of miR-33a-5p to inhibit the development MM by regulating PIM1 expression.","['Wu, Linlin', 'Xia, Liang', 'Chen, Xiaowen', 'Ruan, Min', 'Li, Lingling', 'Xia, Ruixiang']","['Wu L', 'Xia L', 'Chen X', 'Ruan M', 'Li L', 'Xia R']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, No. 218, Jixi Road, Shushan District, Hefei City, Anhui Province, 230032, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, No. 218, Jixi Road, Shushan District, Hefei City, Anhui Province, 230032, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, No. 218, Jixi Road, Shushan District, Hefei City, Anhui Province, 230032, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, No. 218, Jixi Road, Shushan District, Hefei City, Anhui Province, 230032, China.', ""Department of Hematology of Anhui No.2 Provincial People's Hospital, No. 1868, Dangshan Road, Hefei City, Anhui Province, 230041, China."", 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, No. 218, Jixi Road, Shushan District, Hefei City, Anhui Province, 230032, China.

We previously demonstrated that Proviral Insertion site in Maloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) kinases, specifically PIM3, are overexpressed in human hepatoblastoma cells and function to promote tumorigenesis. We aimed to use CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing with dual gRNAs to introduce large inactivating deletions in the PIM3 gene and achieve stable PIM3 knockout in the human hepatoblastoma cell line, HuH6. PIM3 knockout of hepatoblastoma cells led to significantly decreased proliferation, viability, and motility, inhibited cell-cycle progression, decreased tumor growth in a xenograft murine model, and increased animal survival. Analysis of RNA sequencing data revealed that PIM3 knockout downregulated expression of pro-migratory and pro-invasive genes and upregulated expression of genes involved in apoptosis and differentiation. Furthermore, PIM3 knockout decreased hepatoblastoma cancer cell stemness as evidenced by decreased tumorsphere formation, decreased mRNA abundance of stemness markers, and decreased cell surface expression of CD133, a marker of hepatoblastoma stem cell-like cancer cells. Reintroduction of PIM3 into PIM3 knockout cells rescued the malignant phenotype. Successful CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of PIM3 kinase in human hepatoblastoma cells confirmed the role of PIM3 in promoting hepatoblastoma tumorigenesis and cancer cell stemness.","['Marayati, Raoud', 'Stafman, Laura L', 'Williams, Adele P', 'Bownes, Laura V', 'Quinn, Colin H', 'Markert, Hooper R', 'Easlick, Juliet L', 'Stewart, Jerry E', 'Crossman, David K', 'Mroczek-Musulman, Elizabeth', 'Beierle, Elizabeth A']","['Marayati R', 'Stafman LL', 'Williams AP', 'Bownes LV', 'Quinn CH', 'Markert HR', 'Easlick JL', 'Stewart JE', 'Crossman DK', 'Mroczek-Musulman E', 'Beierle EA']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2848-3927', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7853-3948', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9698-5614', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0981-169X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4613-0527']","['Division of Pediatric Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, 35233, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, 35233, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, 35233, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, 35233, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, 35233, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, 35233, USA.', 'Division of Transplantation, Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, 35233, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, 35233, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, 35233, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, The Children's Hospital of Alabama, Birmingham, AL, 35233, USA."", 'Division of Pediatric Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, 35233, USA. elizabeth.beierle@childrensal.org.']",['eng'],"['T32 CA183926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA013148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA013148/U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | National Institutes of', 'Health (NIH)', 'P30 AR048311/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA091078/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32GM008361/U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | National Institutes of', 'Health (NIH)', 'T32 GM008361/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI027767/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA229102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20210416,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,PMC8521561,,,2021/04/18 06:00,2021/04/18 06:00,['2021/04/17 05:59'],"['2020/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2022/10/16 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/04/17 05:59 [entrez]', '2021/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41417-021-00334-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41417-021-00334-4 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Cancer Gene Ther. 2021 Apr 16. pii: 10.1038/s41417-021-00334-4. doi: 10.1038/s41417-021-00334-4.,,,IM,,,,,['NIHMS1688156'],['2022/10/16 00:00'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the effect of depth of clinical response, including incomplete count recovery (CRi) and/or measurable residual disease (MRD), in patients from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation Research (CIBMTR) registry. We identified 2492 adult patients (1799 CR and 693 CRi) who underwent alloHCT between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2015. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Multivariable analysis was performed to adjust for patient-, disease-, and transplant-related factors. Baseline characteristics were similar. Patients in CRi compared to those in CR had an increased likelihood of death (HR: 1.27; 95% confidence interval: 1.13-1.43). Compared to CR, CRi was significantly associated with increased non-relapse mortality (NRM), shorter disease-free survival (DFS), and a trend toward increased relapse. Detectable MRD was associated with shorter OS, shorter DFS, higher NRM, and increased relapse compared to absence of MRD. The deleterious effects of CRi and MRD were independent. In this large CIBMTR cohort, survival outcomes differ among AML patients based on depth of CR and presence of MRD at the time of alloHCT. Further studies should focus on optimizing post-alloHCT outcomes for patients with responses less than CR.","['Percival, Mary-Elizabeth', 'Wang, Hai-Lin', 'Zhang, Mei-Jie', 'Saber, Wael', 'de Lima, Marcos', 'Litzow, Mark', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Abdel-Azim, Hisham', 'Adekola, Kehinde', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Bacher, Ulrike', 'Badawy, Sherif M', 'Beitinjaneh, Amer', 'Bejanyan, Nelli', 'Bhatt, Vijaya', 'Byrne, Michael', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves', 'Castillo, Paul', 'Chao, Nelson', 'Chhabra, Saurabh', 'Copelan, Edward', 'Cutler, Corey', 'DeFilipp, Zachariah', 'Dias, Ajoy', 'Diaz, Miguel Angel', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Farhadfar, Nosha', 'Frangoul, Haydar A', 'Freytes, Cesar O', 'Gale, Robert Peter', 'Ganguly, Siddhartha', 'Gowda, Lohith', 'Grunwald, Michael', 'Hossain, Nasheed', 'Kamble, Rammurti T', 'Kanakry, Christopher G', 'Kansagra, Ankit', 'Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A', 'Krem, Maxwell', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Lee, Jong Wook', 'Liesveld, Jane L', 'Lin, Richard', 'Liu, Hongtao', 'McGuirk, Joseph', 'Munker, Reinhold', 'Murthy, Hemant S', 'Nathan, Sunita', 'Nishihori, Taiga', 'Olsson, Richard F', 'Palmisiano, Neil', 'Passweg, Jakob R', 'Prestidge, Tim', 'Ringden, Olov', 'Rizzieri, David A', 'Rybka, Witold B', 'Savoie, Mary Lynn', 'Schultz, Kirk R', 'Seo, Sachiko', 'Sharma, Akshay', 'Solh, Melhem', 'Strair, Roger', 'van der Poel, Marjolein', 'Verdonck, Leo F', 'Yared, Jean A', 'Weisdorf, Daniel', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M']","['Percival ME', 'Wang HL', 'Zhang MJ', 'Saber W', 'de Lima M', 'Litzow M', 'Kebriaei P', 'Abdel-Azim H', 'Adekola K', 'Aljurf M', 'Bacher U', 'Badawy SM', 'Beitinjaneh A', 'Bejanyan N', 'Bhatt V', 'Byrne M', 'Cahn JY', 'Castillo P', 'Chao N', 'Chhabra S', 'Copelan E', 'Cutler C', 'DeFilipp Z', 'Dias A', 'Diaz MA', 'Estey E', 'Farhadfar N', 'Frangoul HA', 'Freytes CO', 'Gale RP', 'Ganguly S', 'Gowda L', 'Grunwald M', 'Hossain N', 'Kamble RT', 'Kanakry CG', 'Kansagra A', 'Kharfan-Dabaja MA', 'Krem M', 'Lazarus HM', 'Lee JW', 'Liesveld JL', 'Lin R', 'Liu H', 'McGuirk J', 'Munker R', 'Murthy HS', 'Nathan S', 'Nishihori T', 'Olsson RF', 'Palmisiano N', 'Passweg JR', 'Prestidge T', 'Ringden O', 'Rizzieri DA', 'Rybka WB', 'Savoie ML', 'Schultz KR', 'Seo S', 'Sharma A', 'Solh M', 'Strair R', 'van der Poel M', 'Verdonck LF', 'Yared JA', 'Weisdorf D', 'Sandmaier BM']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7016-951X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8568-4522', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8607-9404', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0194-7338', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2513-0533', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2813-1729', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9117-8696', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7994-8974', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5407-9875', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3278-655X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6901-0782', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7394-5185', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1159-5607', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0834-7880', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0539-4796', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7920-4265', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2621-7924', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4078-5001', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6092-1536', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0396-5804', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0001-6438', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4308-2152', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3281-2081', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3766-5623', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5346-6299', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8078-8579', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9767-9739']","['Division of Hematology, University of Washington and Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA. mperciva@seattlecca.org.', 'CIBMTR(R) (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'CIBMTR(R) (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Institute for Health and Equity, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'CIBMTR(R) (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Seidman Cancer Center, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Transplant Center, Mayo Clinic Rochester, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', ""Division of Hematology, Oncology and Blood & Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA."", 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine and Robert H.

Instead, cortical thymocytes express non-peptide presenting MHC molecules like CD1d and MR1, and promote the selection of PLZF(+) iNKT and MAIT cells, respectively. Here, we report an inducible class-I transactivator mouse that enables the expression of peptide presenting MHC I molecules in different cell types. We show that MHC I expression in DP thymocytes leads to expansion of peptide specific PLZF(+) innate-like (PIL) T cells. Akin to iNKT cells, PIL T cells differentiate into three functional effector subsets in the thymus, and are dependent on SAP signaling. We demonstrate that PIL and NKT cells compete for a narrow niche, suggesting that the absence of peptide-MHC on DP thymocytes facilitates selection of non-peptide specific lymphocytes.","['Georgiev, Hristo', 'Peng, Changwei', 'Huggins, Matthew A', 'Jameson, Stephen C', 'Hogquist, Kristin A']","['Georgiev H', 'Peng C', 'Huggins MA', 'Jameson SC', 'Hogquist KA']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1369-960X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9137-1146', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9963-5687']","['Center for Immunology and Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA.', 'Institute of Immunology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, D-30625, Germany.', 'Center for Immunology and Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA.', 'Center for Immunology and Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA.', 'Center for Immunology and Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA.', 'Center for Immunology and Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA. hogqu001@umn.edu.']",['eng'],['R37 AI039560/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210416,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,PMC8052364,,,2021/04/18 06:00,2021/05/04 06:00,['2021/04/17 05:44'],"['2020/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/17 05:44 [entrez]', '2021/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-021-22589-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-021-22589-z [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2021 Apr 16;12(1):2308. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-22589-z.,20210503,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NLRC5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology/*metabolism', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mucosal-Associated Invariant T Cells/immunology', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/immunology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/metabolism', 'Thymocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/*immunology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We integrate these results with other multi-individual genomic readouts, revealing coordinated effects of PU.1 binding variants on the local chromatin state, enhancer-promoter contacts and downstream gene expression, and providing a functional interpretation for 27 genes underlying immune traits. Collectively, these results demonstrate the functional role of PU.1 and its target enhancers in neutrophil transcriptional control and immune disease susceptibility.","['Watt, Stephen', 'Vasquez,

Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are needed to target SLFN11-deficient cancers. To that effect, we conducted a drug screen with the NCATS mechanistic drug library of 1,978 compounds in isogenic SLFN11-knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) leukemia cell lines. Here we report that TAK-243, a first-in-class ubiquitin activating enzyme UBA1 inhibitor in clinical development, causes preferential cytotoxicity in SLFN11-KO cells; this effect is associated with claspin-mediated DNA replication inhibition by CHK1 independently of ATR. Additional analyses showed that SLFN11-KO cells exhibit consistently enhanced global protein ubiquitylation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, unfolded protein response (UPR), and protein aggregation. TAK-243 suppressed global protein ubiquitylation and activated the UPR transducers PERK, phosphorylated eIF2alpha, phosphorylated IRE1, and ATF6 more effectively in SLFN11-KO cells than in WT cells. Proteomic analysis using biotinylated mass spectrometry and RNAi screening also showed physical and functional interactions of SLFN11 with translation initiation complexes and protein folding machinery. These findings uncover a previously unknown function of SLFN11 as a regulator of protein quality control and attenuator of ER stress and UPR. Moreover, they suggest the potential value of TAK-243 in SLFN11-deficient tumors. SIGNIFICANCE: This study uncovers that SLFN11 deficiency induces proteotoxic stress and sensitizes cancer cells to TAK-243, suggesting that profiling SLFN11 status can serve as a therapeutic biomarker for cancer therapy.","['Murai, Yasuhisa', 'Jo, Ukhyun', 'Murai, Junko', 'Jenkins, Lisa M', 'Huang, Shar-Yin N', 'Chakka, Sirisha', 'Chen, Lu', 'Cheng, Ken', 'Fukuda, Shinsaku', 'Takebe, Naoko', 'Pommier, Yves']","['Murai Y', 'Jo U', 'Murai J', 'Jenkins LM', 'Huang SN', 'Chakka S', 'Chen L', 'Cheng K', 'Fukuda S', 'Takebe N', 'Pommier Y']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3305-1248', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2826-1355', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1245-1338', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5790-4954']","['Developmental Therapeutics Branch and Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.', 'Developmental Therapeutics Branch and Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University, Tsuruoka, Yamagata, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Cell Biology, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Developmental Therapeutics Branch and Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, Functional Genomics Laboratory, NIH, Rockville, Maryland.', 'National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, Functional Genomics Laboratory, NIH, Rockville, Maryland.', 'National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, Functional Genomics Laboratory, NIH, Rockville, Maryland.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.', 'Developmental Therapeutics Branch and Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Developmental Therapeutics Branch and Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland. pommier@nih.gov.']",['eng'],['Z01 BC006150/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20210416,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,PMC8178208,,,2021/04/18 06:00,2021/11/05 06:00,['2021/04/17 05:39'],"['2020/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/05 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/17 05:39 [entrez]']","['0008-5472.CAN-20-2694 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-2694 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2021 Jun 1;81(11):3067-3078. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-2694.

CD52- T cells emerge under alemtuzumab selection pressure. We sought to investigate the phenotype and function of the CD52- T cell fraction and related their presence to clinical outcome. We obtained longitudinal peripheral blood samples from 67 consecutive patients undergoing allo-HSCT between 2013-2016. Forty-seven patients (70%) had a myeloid disease (acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome) whereas 20 patients had lymphoid disease. All patients received in vivo alemtuzumab (10 mg/d from day -5 for 5 days) as part of their conditioning protocol. Sixty-three (94%) received reduced-intensity conditioning chemotherapy, whereas 4 (6%) received a myeloablative regimen. All patients received post-transplantation cyclosporine A for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Six (9%) also received methotrexate, whereas 2 (3%) patients also received mycophenolate mofetil. Overall survival at 2 years was 68%, and relapse-free survival was 48%. Twenty-none percent of patients experienced acute GVHD (grade 2 or above), and 15% developed chronic GVHD. CD52- T cells were detectable in 66 of 67 consecutive patients. CD52- T cells demonstrated low binding of fluorescent aerolysin, indicating downregulation of the glycophosphatidylinositol anchor, although we did not detect any mutations in the PIG-A gene as is typically seen in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. CD52- T cells were almost exclusively CD4(+) and exhibited a dominant memory phenotype with only small numbers of CD25(+) CD127(low) Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. CD52- T cells exhibited alloreactive specificity in vitro and have a distinct TCR repertoire to CD52+ T cells. Early after allo-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the presence of a significant population of CD52- T cells (comprising >51% of the T cell fraction) was found to be an independent risk factor for acute GvHD. This was confirmed in a validation cohort of 28 patients obtained between 2017-2018. These data suggest that the CD52- T cell fraction may represent a residual ""footprint"" of an early CD4+ T cell alloreactive response and may have been rescued from alemtuzumab-mediated lysis by antigen engagement in vivo. These data help to delineate the nature of T cell escape from alemtuzumab surveillance and contribute to increasing interest in the importance of CD4+ T cells in alloreactive immune responses, which could help inform immunotherapy protocols.","['Kinsella, Francesca A', 'Inman, Charlotte F', 'Croft, Wayne', 'Zuo, Jianmin', 'Pearce, Hayden', 'Barbieri, Sara', 'Craddock, Charles', 'Malladi, Ram', 'Moss, Paul']","['Kinsella FA', 'Inman CF', 'Croft W', 'Zuo J', 'Pearce H', 'Barbieri S', 'Craddock C', 'Malladi R', 'Moss P']",,"['Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Studies, University of Birmingham and Birmingham Health Partners, Birmingham, United Kingdom; Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth NHS Foundation Trust and Birmingham Health Partners, Birmingham, United Kingdom.

In most healthy somatic tissues, DUX4 is heavily repressed by multiple genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, and its aberrant expression is linked to facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) where it has been extensively studied. Recently, DUX4 expression has been implicated in oncogenesis, although this is much less explored. In this review, we discuss multiple levels of control of DUX4 expression, including enhancer-promoter interactions, DNA methylation, histone modifications, noncoding RNAs, and telomere positioning effect. We also connect disparate data on intrachromosomal contacts involving DUX4 and emphasize the feedback loops in DUX4 regulation. Finally, we bridge data on DUX4 in FSHD and cancer and discuss prospective approaches for future FSHD therapies and the potential outcomes of DUX4 inhibition in cancer.","['Karpukhina, Anna', 'Tiukacheva, Eugenia', 'Dib, Carla', 'Vassetzky, Yegor S']","['Karpukhina A', 'Tiukacheva E', 'Dib C', 'Vassetzky YS']",,"['UMR 9018, CNRS, Universite Paris Saclay, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif F-94805, France; Koltzov Institute of Developmental Biology, Moscow 117334, Russia; Faculty of Bioengineering and Bioinformatics, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow 119991, Russia.', 'UMR 9018, CNRS, Universite Paris Saclay, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif F-94805, France.', 'UMR 9018, CNRS, Universite Paris Saclay, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif F-94805, France; Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305-510, USA.', 'UMR 9018, CNRS, Universite Paris Saclay, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif F-94805, France; Koltzov Institute of Developmental Biology, Moscow 117334, Russia.

Considering the main function of GMFG in actin remodeling, which is vital for immune response, angiogenesis, cell division and motility, GMFG is supposed to have important roles in tumor development, while up to now, only two studies described the role of GMFG in cancers. By investigating the clinical values of GMFG using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and the functional mechanisms of GMFG through analyses of Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichments, this study was aimed to better understand the impact of GMFG in pan-cancers and to draw more attentions for the future research of GMFG. METHODS: RNA-seq and clinical data of cancer patients were collected from TCGA and analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier methods. GO and KEGG analyses were conducted using the online tools from the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). RESULTS: Compared to the corresponding normal samples, GMFG was significantly upregulated in glioblastoma (GBM), kidney clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), lower grade glioma (LGG), acute myeloid leukemia (LAML), and pancreatic cancer (PAAD), testicular cancer (TGCT), but was downregulated in kidney chromophobe (KICH), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) (P < 0.05 for all). High expression of GMFG predicted worse OS in GBM (HR = 1.5, P = 0.017), LGG (HR = 2.2, P < 0.001), LUSC (HR = 1.4, P = 0.022) and ocular melanomas (UVM) (HR = 7, P < 0.001), as well as worse DFS in LGG (HR = 1.8, P < 0.001) and prostate cancer (PRAD) (HR = 1.9, P = 0.004). In contrast, high expression of GMFG was associated with better OS in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) (HR = 0.59, P < 0.001) and thymoma (THYM) (HR = 0.098, P = 0.031), as well as better DFS in bile duct cancer (CHOL) (HR = 0.2, P = 0.003). GMFG was mainly involved in the immune response, protein binding and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathways, and was positively associated with multiple immunomodulators in most cancers. CONCLUSION: Our study preliminarily identified that GMFG may cause different survivals for different cancers through modulating tumor progression, immune response status and tissue-specific tumor microenvironment (TME).","['Lan, Aihua', 'Ren, Chunxia', 'Wang, Xiaoling', 'Tong, Guoqing', 'Yang, Gong']","['Lan A', 'Ren C', 'Wang X', 'Tong G', 'Yang G']",,"[""Central Laboratory, the Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200240, China."", 'Center for Reproductive Medicine, Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, 200120, China.', 'Center for Reproductive Medicine, Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, 200120, China.', 'Center for Reproductive Medicine, Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, 200120, China. drivftongguoqing@hotmail.com.', ""Central Laboratory, the Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200240, China. yanggong@fudan.edu.cn."", 'Cancer Institute, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Department of Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai, 200032, China. yanggong@fudan.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210417,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC8052856,['NOTNLM'],"['Bioinformatics', 'Cancer', 'Glia maturation factor-gamma', 'Immune response', 'Survival', 'Tumor microenvironment']",2021/04/18 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2021/04/17 05:22'],"['2021/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/17 05:22 [entrez]', '2021/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-021-08163-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-021-08163-2 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2021 Apr 17;21(1):423. doi: 10.1186/s12885-021-08163-2.,20210510,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Glia Maturation Factor)', '0 (glia maturation factor gamma)']",IM,"['*Biomarkers, Tumor', '*Computational Biology/methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Ontology', 'Glia Maturation Factor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunomodulation/genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Organ Specificity', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Microenvironment/genetics/immunology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this picture is not as colorful when it comes to the treatment of solid tumors mainly due to the lack of definitive tumor antigens, as well as the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments and poor CAR-T infiltration. The recent developments in bioinformatics and cell biology, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, have offered silver linings in the subject of tumor antigen discovery. In the current review, we summarize the development of some CAR-T therapies that target novel tumor antigens, rather than the traditionally CAR-T-targeted ones, and briefly discuss the clinical antitumor achievements of those evaluated in patients, so far. Furthermore, we propose some tumor antigens that might someday be therapeutically beneficial while targeted by CAR-Ts based on the experimental evaluations of their specific monoclonal antibodies.","['Safarzadeh Kozani, Pooria', 'Safarzadeh Kozani, Pouya', 'Rahbarizadeh, Fatemeh']","['Safarzadeh Kozani P', 'Safarzadeh Kozani P', 'Rahbarizadeh F']",,"['Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Paramedicine, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran; Student Research Committee, Medical Biotechnology Research Center, School of Nursing, Midwifery, and Paramedicine, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran; Research and Development Center of Biotechnology, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.

This opens a new way to regulate the cellular protein homeostasis, especially for disease-related proteins. In this work, we designed and synthesized a series of MDM2 degraders based on ligands that were readily prepared by a four-component Ugi reaction. After extensive optimization based on anti-proliferation and MDM2 degradation, WB214 was identified as the most potent anti-proliferative agent in various leukemia cell lines. Surprisingly, our mechanistic investigations indicated that WB214 not only effectively induced the degradation of MDM2, but also led to the degradation of p53. Further studies revealed that WB214 degraded MDM2 as a molecular glue. WB214 and its related analogues did not bind to MDM2 in the p53 binding region and MDM2 was discovered as a novel neo-substrate of the E3 ligase cereblon. Finally, we found that WB214 could potently degrade GSPT1, which could rationalize the inhibition of cell growth. A selective degrader for GSPT1 over MDM2 was then developed through systematically varying different motifs.","['Wang, Bo', 'Liu, Jin', 'Tandon, Ira', 'Wu, Suzhen', 'Teng, Peng', 'Liao, Jianhua', 'Tang, Weiping']","['Wang B', 'Liu J', 'Tandon I', 'Wu S', 'Teng P', 'Liao J', 'Tang W']",,"['School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53705, USA.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53705, USA.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53705, USA; Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology Training Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53705, USA.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53705, USA.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53705, USA.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53705, USA.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53705, USA; Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53705, USA.

However, work remains to ensure that solutions are rigorous, valid, and reproducible. In this paper, we evaluate best practices for dissimilarity matrix calculation and clustering on mixed-type, clinical data. METHODS: We simulate clinical data to represent problems in clinical trials, cohort studies, and EHR data, including single-type datasets (binary, continuous, categorical) and 4 data mixtures. We test 5 single distance metrics (Jaccard, Hamming, Gower, Manhattan, Euclidean) and 3 mixed distance metrics (DAISY, Supersom, and Mercator) with 3 clustering algorithms (hierarchical (HC), k-medoids, self-organizing maps (SOM)). We quantitatively and visually validate by Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and silhouette width (SW). We applied our best methods to two real-world data sets: (1) 21 features collected on 247 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and (2) 40 features collected on 6000 patients admitted to an intensive care unit. RESULTS: HC outperformed k-medoids and SOM by ARI across data types. DAISY produced the highest mean ARI for mixed data types for all mixtures except unbalanced mixtures dominated by continuous data. Compared to other methods, DAISY with HC uncovered superior, separable clusters in both real-world data sets. DISCUSSION: Selecting an appropriate mixed-type metric allows the investigator to obtain optimal separation of patient clusters and get maximum use of their data. Superior metrics for mixed-type data handle multiple data types using multiple, type-focused distances. Better subclassification of disease opens avenues for targeted treatments, precision medicine, clinical decision support, and improved patient outcomes.","['Coombes, Caitlin E', 'Liu, Xin', 'Abrams, Zachary B', 'Coombes, Kevin R', 'Brock, Guy']","['Coombes CE', 'Liu X', 'Abrams ZB', 'Coombes KR', 'Brock G']",,"['The Ohio State University College of Medicine, 370 W 9th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.

The survival analysis revealed that mRNA expression of E2F2, KRAS and FLI1 was negatively correlated with hsa-miR-155-5p and these targets were significantly associated with poor overall survival. Furthermore, an overlap between CML-related genes and hsa-miR-155-5p target genes was revealed using competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks analysis.

Despite the important role of selective autophagy in the life-long maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), cancer progression, and chemoresistance, the relationship between LICs and selective autophagy remains to be fully elucidated. Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), also known as p62, is a selective autophagy receptor for the degradation of ubiquitinated substrates, and its loss impairs leukemia progression in AML mouse models. In this study, we evaluated the underlying mechanisms of mitophagy in the survival of LICs with XRK3F2, a p62-ZZ inhibitor. We demonstrated that XRK3F2 selectively impaired LICs but spared normal HSCs in both mouse and patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) AML models. Mechanistically, we observed that XRK3F2 blocked mitophagy by inhibiting the binding of p62 with defective mitochondria. Our study not only evaluated the effectiveness and safety of XRK3F2 in LICs, but also demonstrated that mitophagy plays an indispensable role in the survival of LICs during AML development and progression, which can be impaired by blocking p62.","['Li, Yinghui', 'Li, Yafang', 'Yin, Jingjing', 'Wang, Chaoqun', 'Yang, Ming', 'Gu, Jiali', 'He, Mei', 'Xu, Hui', 'Fu, Weichao', 'Zhang, Wenshan',

Among cases of CMML, > 90% have gene mutations, primarily involving TET2 (~ 60%), ASXL1 (~ 40%), SRSF2 (~ 50%), and the RAS pathways (~ 30%). These gene mutations are associated with both the clinical phenotypes and the prognosis of CMML, special CMML variants and pre-phases of CMML. Cytogenetic abnormalities and the size of genome are also associated with prognosis. Meanwhile, cases with ASXL1, DNMT3A, NRAS, SETBP1, CBL and RUNX1 mutations may have inferior prognoses, but only ASXL1 mutations were confirmed to be independent predictors of the patient outcome and were included in three prognostic models. Novel treatment targets related to the various gene mutations are emerging. Therefore, this review provides new insights to explore the correlations among gene mutations, clinical phenotypes, prognosis, and novel drugs in CMML.","['Jian, J', 'Qiao, Y', 'Li, Y', 'Guo, Y', 'Ma, H', 'Liu, B']","['Jian J', 'Qiao Y', 'Li Y', 'Guo Y', 'Ma H', 'Liu B']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4331-2138'],"['The First Clinical Medical College, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', ""Institute of Hematology, Xi'an Central Hospital, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", 'The First Clinical Medical College, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'The First Clinical Medical College, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'The First Clinical Medical College, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China. mahaizhen-2008@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Lanzhou University, 1 Donggangxilu street, Lanzhou, Gansu, China. mahaizhen-2008@163.com.', 'The First Clinical Medical College, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China. liubeiff@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Lanzhou University, 1 Donggangxilu street, Lanzhou, Gansu, China. liubeiff@163.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210416,Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', 'Gene mutations', 'Novel drugs', 'Prognosis']",2021/04/17 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/04/16 12:19'],"['2020/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/16 12:19 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12094-021-02585-x [doi]', '10.1007/s12094-021-02585-x [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2021 Sep;23(9):1731-1742. doi: 10.1007/s12094-021-02585-x.

Whilst the cumulative effect of exposure to conventional cardiovascular risk factors is important, recent evidence highlights clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminant potential (CHIP) as a further key risk factor. CHIP reflects the accumulation of somatic, potentially pro-leukaemic gene mutations within haematopoietic stem cells over time. The most common mutations associated with CHIP and CVD occur in genes that also play central roles in the regulation of inflammation. While CHIP carriers have a low risk of haematological malignant transformation (<1% per year), their relative risk of mortality is increased by 40% and this reflects an excess of cardiovascular events. Evidence linking CHIP, inflammation and atherosclerotic disease has recently become better defined. However, there is a paucity of information about the role of CHIP in the development and progression of heart failure, particularly heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). While systemic inflammation plays a role in the pathophysiology of both heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction (EF), it may be of greater relevance in the pathophysiology of HFpEF, which is also strongly associated with ageing. This review describes CHIP and its pathogenetic links with ageing, inflammation and CVD, while providing insight into its putative role in HFpEF.","['Mooney, Leanne', 'Goodyear, Carl S', 'Chandra, Tamir', 'Kirschner, Kristina', 'Copland, Mhairi', 'Petrie, Mark C', 'Lang, Ninian N']","['Mooney L', 'Goodyear CS', 'Chandra T', 'Kirschner K', 'Copland M', 'Petrie MC', 'Lang NN']",,"['BHF Glasgow Cardiovascular Research Centre, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K.', 'Institute of Immunity, Infection and Inflammation, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K.', 'The Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinburgh, U.K.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute for Cancer Science, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute for Cancer Science, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K."", 'BHF Glasgow Cardiovascular Research Centre, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K.', 'BHF Glasgow Cardiovascular Research Centre, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Clin Sci (Lond),"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",7905731,PMC8055963,['NOTNLM'],"['*ageing', '*atherosclerosis', '*cardiovascular disease', '*clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential', '*heart failure']",2021/04/17 06:00,2021/10/02 06:00,['2021/04/16 12:16'],"['2021/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/16 12:16 [entrez]', '2021/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['228383 [pii]', '10.1042/CS20200306 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Sci (Lond). 2021 Apr 16;135(7):991-1007. doi: 10.1042/CS20200306.,20211001,,IM,"['Aging', '*Cardiovascular Diseases', '*Clonal Hematopoiesis', '*Heart Failure', 'Humans', '*Inflammation', 'Risk Factors', 'Stroke Volume']",['(c) 2021 The Author(s).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine in patients with CLL. We evaluated humoral immune responses to the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine in patients with CLL and compared responses with those obtained in age-matched healthy control subjects. Patients received 2 vaccine doses, 21 days apart, and antibody titers were measured by using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay after administration of the second dose. In a total of 167 patients with CLL, the antibody response rate was 39.5%. A comparison between 52 patients with CLL and 52 sex- and aged-matched healthy control subjects revealed a significantly reduced response rate among patients (52% vs 100%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio, 0.010; 95% confidence interval, 0.001-0.162; P < .001). The response rate was highest in patients who obtained clinical remission after treatment (79.2%), followed by 55.2% in treatment-naive patients and 16.0% in patients under treatment at the time of vaccination. In patients treated with either Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors or venetoclax +/- anti-CD20 antibody, response rates were considerably low (16.0% and 13.6%). None of the patients exposed to anti-CD20 antibodies <12 months before vaccination responded. In a multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of response were younger age, female sex, lack of currently active treatment, immunoglobulin G levels >/=550 mg/dL, and immunoglobulin M levels >/=40 mg/dL. In conclusion, antibody-mediated response to the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in patients with CLL is markedly impaired and affected by disease activity and treatment.

Severe allergic reactions lead to substitution of further PEG-asparaginase with Erwinia. Erwinia is associated with more frequent dosing, increased expense, and limited availability. Premedication may reduce rates of allergic reactions. PROCEDURES: This Markov model evaluated the cost-effectiveness of three strategies: premedication plus therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), TDM alone, and no premedication or TDM. We modeled two scenarios: a standard-risk (SR) B-ALL patient receiving two asparaginase doses and a high-risk (HR) patient receiving seven asparaginase doses. The model incorporated costs of asparaginase, premedication, TDM and clinic visits, and lost parental wages associated with each additional Erwinia dose. We incorporated a five-year time horizon with a societal perspective. Outcomes were Erwinia substitutions avoided and differences in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses evaluated model uncertainty. RESULTS: In both scenarios, premedication was the least costly strategy. In SR and HR scenarios, premedication with monitoring resulted in 8% and 7% fewer changes to Erwinia compared with monitoring alone and 3% and 2% fewer changes compared with no premedication/monitoring, respectively. Premedication resulted in the most QALYs gained in the SR patients. Individual variation of model inputs did not change premedication/monitoring favorability for either scenario. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, premedication/monitoring was favored in >87% of iterations in both scenarios. CONCLUSION: Compared with other strategies, premedication use and asparaginase level monitoring in children with B-ALL is potentially cost-saving.","['McCormick, Meghan', 'Lapinski, Jillian', 'Friehling, Erika', 'Smith, Kenneth']","['McCormick M', 'Lapinski J', 'Friehling E', 'Smith K']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3633-6369'],"['University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', ""C.S.

CASE DESCRIPTION: We reported an exceptional case of a child with relapsed Ph-like ALL with IKZF1 gene deletion treated with high-dose ruxolitinib as monotherapy, after multi-agent chemotherapy. He remains in continued MRD-negative leukemia remission with full donor chimerism at 12 months post-HSCT. DISCUSSION: The circumstance that makes our case featured is the usage of ruxolitinib as monotherapy. This report, we believe, is a pioneering report for a frequent disease with a high risk of failure for the outcome.","['Bayram, Nihan', 'Yaman, Yontem', 'Ozdilli, Kursat', 'Telhan, Leyla', 'Nepesov, Serdar', 'Bilgen, Hulya', 'Elli, Murat', 'Behar, Sude Sema', 'Anak, Sema']","['Bayram N', 'Yaman Y', 'Ozdilli K', 'Telhan L', 'Nepesov S', 'Bilgen H', 'Elli M', 'Behar SS', 'Anak S']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9688-5223', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9710-8653', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7129-5024', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0037-7636', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4551-5433', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7424-8688', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0476-5452', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9629-0783', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8489-7449']","['Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Istanbul Medipol University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Istanbul Medipol University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Istanbul Medipol University- Medical Biology, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Istanbul Medipol University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Immunology, Istanbul Medipol University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Hematology, Istanbul Medipol University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Istanbul Medipol University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Medical Faculty Student, Istanbul Medipol University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Istanbul Medipol University, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210416,Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,,['NOTNLM'],"['JAK inhibitors', 'Philadelphia-like ALL', 'refractory ALL', 'stem cell transplantation']",2021/04/17 06:00,2021/04/17 06:00,['2021/04/16 06:55'],"['2021/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/16 06:55 [entrez]']",['10.1111/petr.14024 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2021 Jun;25(4):e14024. doi: 10.1111/petr.14024.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of gynecological cancer patients who were diagnosed at facilities participating in the Gynecologic Oncology Trial and Investigation Consortium and started only taxane/platinum therapy as chemotherapy between 2002 and 2006. RESULTS: The site of the primary lesion was the ovary in 124, endometrium in 37, and uterine cervix in 4. The regimen of chemotherapy was paclitaxel (T) + carboplatin (C) therapy in 134 and others in 31 patients. The cumulative incidence was 2.4% (4/165), and the incidence was 2.9/1,000 person-years. All four cases were acute myeloid leukemia. The average total doses of T and C in patients without TRL were 1,693 (SD 1,050) and 4,170 (SD 2,423) mg. For TRL patients, the total T and C doses were, respectively, 1,555 and 3,540 mg, 1,620 and 4,200 mg, 2,130 and 4,700 mg, 3,220 mg and 8,310 mg. The fourth patient received additional 2,415 mg of docetaxel and 2,155 mg of nedaplatin. The intervals from the primary chemotherapy to the onset of TRL were 27, 34, 67, and 114 months. Three patients had no evidence of ovarian cancer. Three patients died of TRL at 4 days, 5 months, and 11 months, one patient remained in remission at 25 months after diagnosis of TRL. CONCLUSION: Patients receiving taxane/platinum therapy should undergo long-term follow-up with attention to the development of TRL, even if the gynecologic malignant cancer is in remission.","['Sakurai, Manabu', 'Satoh, Toyomi', 'Nakamura, Yuko', 'Takei, Yuji', 'Takahashi, Suzuyo', 'Fujiwara, Hiroyuki', 'Nakamura, Kazuto', 'Kanuma, Tatsuya', 'Fujiwara, Keiichi', 'Suzuki, Mitsuaki']","['Sakurai M', 'Satoh T', 'Nakamura Y', 'Takei Y', 'Takahashi S', 'Fujiwara H', 'Nakamura K', 'Kanuma T', 'Fujiwara K', 'Suzuki M']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8541-4290'],"['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Japan.', 'Department of Gynecology, Gunma Prefectural Cancer Center, Ohta, Japan.', 'Department of Gynecology, Gunma Prefectural Cancer Center, Ohta, Japan.', 'Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Saitama Medical University International Medical Center, Hidaka, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, SHIN-YURIGAOKA General Hospital, Kawasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210415,Australia,J Obstet Gynaecol Res,The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,9612761,,['NOTNLM'],"['gynecologic neoplasm', 'platinum', 'taxane', 'treatment-related cancer']",2021/04/17 06:00,2021/07/06 06:00,['2021/04/16 06:55'],"['2021/02/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/06 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/16 06:55 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jog.14760 [doi]'],ppublish,J Obstet Gynaecol Res. 2021 Jul;47(7):2500-2508. doi: 10.1111/jog.14760.

DIC is common in patients with acute leukemia, with prevalence ranging from 17 to 100% in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and 8.5 to 25% in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-APL acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The pathophysiology is complex and varies between the leukemia subtypes, and is not fully reflected by the laboratory markers currently used to classify DIC. Similarly, the clinical consequence of DIC in acute leukemia also varies across the types of leukemia. DIC is primarily associated with bleeding in APL, while thrombosis is the dominant phenotype in ALL and non-APL AML. The cornerstone of managing DIC is the treatment of the underlying disease, as exemplified by the important role of early administration of all-trans retinoic acid in APL. Other aspects of management focus on supportive care aimed at minimizing the risk of bleeding, via transfusion of blood products. The use of blood products is more liberal in APL, due to the hemorrhagic phenotype and unacceptably high rates of early hemorrhagic death. This review will focus on the pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical implications, and the management of DIC in patients across the spectrum of acute leukemias.","['Ten Cate, Hugo', 'Leader, Avi']","['Ten Cate H', 'Leader A']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine and Thrombosis Expert Center, Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'CARIM School for Cardiovascular Diseases, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'CARIM School for Cardiovascular Diseases, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Hematology Institute, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210415,Germany,Hamostaseologie,Hamostaseologie,8204531,,,,2021/04/17 06:00,2021/10/29 06:00,['2021/04/16 06:50'],"['2021/04/16 06:50 [entrez]', '2021/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/a-1393-8302 [doi]'],ppublish,Hamostaseologie. 2021 Apr;41(2):120-126. doi: 10.1055/a-1393-8302.

A variety of alterations drive MYC expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and enforced MYC expression in hematopoietic progenitors is sufficient to induce AML. Here we report that AML and myeloid progenitor cell growth and survival rely on MYC-directed suppression of Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Notably, although originally identified as an oncogene, TFEB functions as a tumor suppressor in AML, where it provokes AML cell differentiation and death. These responses reflect TFEB control of myeloid epigenetic programs, by inducing expression of isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) and IDH2, resulting in global hydroxylation of 5-methycytosine. Finally, activating the TFEB-IDH1/IDH2-TET2 axis is revealed as a targetable vulnerability in AML. Thus, epigenetic control by a MYC-TFEB circuit dictates myeloid cell fate and is essential for maintenance of AML.","['Yun, Seongseok', 'Vincelette, Nicole D', 'Yu, Xiaoqing', 'Watson, Gregory W', 'Fernandez, Mario R', 'Yang, Chunying', 'Hitosugi, Taro', 'Cheng, Chia-Ho', 'Freischel, Audrey R', 'Zhang, Ling', 'Li, Weimin', 'Hou, Hsinan', 'Schaub, Franz X', 'Vedder, Alexis R', 'Cen, Ling', 'McGraw, Kathy L', 'Moon, Jungwon', 'Murphy, Daniel J', 'Ballabio, Andrea', 'Kaufmann, Scott H', 'Berglund, Anders E', 'Cleveland, John L']","['Yun S', 'Vincelette ND', 'Yu X', 'Watson GW', 'Fernandez MR', 'Yang C', 'Hitosugi T', 'Cheng CH', 'Freischel AR', 'Zhang L', 'Li W', 'Hou H', 'Schaub FX', 'Vedder AR', 'Cen L', 'McGraw KL', 'Moon J', 'Murphy DJ', 'Ballabio A', 'Kaufmann SH', 'Berglund AE', 'Cleveland JL']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7343-1635', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4900-7145', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0393-3530']","['Department of Malignant Hematology, H.

Studies suggested that ivosidenib may inhibit the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the present study, we explored RNAs and their potential regulatory mechanisms by which ivosidenib treats NSCLC cells. We used MTT assays, Transwell assays, and flow cytometry to measure the anti-tumor effects of ivosidenib in NSCLC cells. We performed whole transcriptome sequencing to determine differentially expressed mRNAs (DE-mRNAs) and non-coding RNAs (ncRNA). We used GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses to identify the functions and potential mechanisms. According to miRNA target interactions, we constructed a competing endogenous network. Ivosidenib inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and migration of NSCLC cells and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. We identified 212 DE-mRNAs, four DE-miRNAs, and 206 DE-lncRNAs in ivosidenib-treated NSCLC cells compared to untreated NSCLC cells. DE-mRNAs were significantly enriched in the cancer-associated pathways, including the TGF-beta signaling pathway, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, the MAPK signaling pathway, the Rap1 signaling pathway, and cell adhesion molecules. Based on the competing endogenous RNA hypothesis, we constructed lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks to elucidate the regulatory relationships between mRNA and ncRNA. We found that qRT-PCR results showed corresponding expression trends of differential genes with sequencing data. Our results provide insights into the molecular basis of ivosidenib suppression of NSCLC.","['Wu, Juan', 'Chen, Ru', 'Shen, Huiqing', 'Yan, Ting', 'Qian, Yu', 'Zhang, Yaping', 'Huang, Zhuoya', 'Kong, Pengzhou', 'Pang, Min', 'Zhang, Xinri']","['Wu J', 'Chen R', 'Shen H', 'Yan T', 'Qian Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Huang Z', 'Kong P', 'Pang M', 'Zhang X']",,"['Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Pathology & Shanxi Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research on Esophageal Cancer, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Pathology & Shanxi Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research on Esophageal Cancer, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Pathology & Shanxi Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research on Esophageal Cancer, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210330,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC8042334,['NOTNLM'],"['RNA-seq', 'bioinformatic analysis', 'ceRNA', 'ivosidenib', 'non-small cell lung cancer']",2021/04/17 06:00,2021/04/17 06:01,['2021/04/16 06:39'],"['2020/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/16 06:39 [entrez]', '2021/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.626605 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Mar 30;11:626605. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.626605. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Wu, Chen, Shen, Yan, Qian, Zhang, Huang, Kong, Pang and Zhang.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor lysis syndrome is seen in patients with aggressive malignancies and high tumor burden. More frequently, it occurs in individuals with hematologic malignancies such as high-grade lymphomas (such as Burkitt lymphoma) and leukemia (such as acute lymphocytic leukemia). It also, albeit less commonly, can be seen in patients with widespread solid tumors that are rapidly proliferating and are markedly sensitivity to antineoplastic therapy. Tumor lysis syndrome is usually preceded by cancer-directed therapy; however, the syndrome can present spontaneously prior to the individual receiving malignancy-directed treatment. We reported a man with metastatic salivary duct carcinoma who had cutaneous metastases that presented as carcinoma hemorrhagiectoides. Microscopic examination demonstrated that the metastatic tumor cells had infiltrated and replaced the entire dermis. After the patient received his first dose of antineoplastic therapy, he had an excellent response and the cutaneous metastases developed into ulcers; we hypothesize that most of the dermis, which had been replaced by tumor cells, disappeared as a result of the therapeutic response, and the overlying epidermis became necrotic and shed, leaving an ulcer. His dramatic response to treatment prompted us to propose a new classification of tumor lysis syndrome, which should include the systemic form of the condition as well as the new variant: cutaneous tumor lysis syndrome. We anticipate that, with improvement in targeted therapies, there may be an increase in therapy-associated cutaneous tumor lysis syndrome.","['Cohen, Philip R', 'Prieto, Victor G', 'Kurzrock, Razelle']","['Cohen PR', 'Prieto VG', 'Kurzrock R']",,"['Dermatology, San Diego Family Dermatology, National City, USA.', 'Pathology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.', 'Center for Personalized Cancer Therapy, University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210311,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,PMC8038896,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'carcinoma', 'cutaneous', 'hematologic', 'lysis', 'malignancy', 'metastatic', 'solid', 'syndrome', 'tumor']",2021/04/17 06:00,2021/04/17 06:01,['2021/04/16 06:38'],"['2021/04/16 06:38 [entrez]', '2021/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.13816 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Mar 11;13(3):e13816. doi: 10.7759/cureus.13816.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021, Cohen et al.']",,,,,"['Funded in part by the Joan and Irwin Jacobs Fund and by the National Cancer', 'Institute grant P30 CA016672 (RK).']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIHA is associated with viral infections, autoimmune disorders, immunodeficiencies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and pregnancy. AIHA has predictive properties and may be a harbinger of future lymphoproliferative disorders in up to 20% of AIHA cases. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) has been associated with lymphoproliferative disorders particularly chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Rarely is it seen in Hodgkin disease. In the following report, we describe the presentation of AIHA, ultimately resulting in the diagnosis of nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma (stage III). From the limited reports and reviews available, it is understood that advanced Hodgkin (stage III or IV) of nodular sclerosis (NS) or mixed cellularity (MC) types portend a stronger affiliation to AIHA. The majority of AIHA-associated Hodgkin lymphoma presents as stage III or IV disease with the hemolysis being the presenting symptom, as in this case. The mainstay of AIHA therapy has been corticosteroids; however, this first-line regimen appears to be less effective when treating AIHA in the setting of HL. The exact mechanism of AIHA related to HL is unclear, and it may be thought to be that tumor cell produced autoantibodies. Other hypotheses include paraneoplastic phenomena or more, perhaps immunity to tumor cells may cross-react with antigens on the red cells. Although these mechanisms require further investigation, the relationship of the AIHA and HL represents a piece to a larger puzzle between autoimmune disorders and lymphoproliferative conditions.","['Burley, Nicholas B', 'Dy, Paul S', 'Hande, Suraj', 'Kalantri, Shreyas', 'Mohindroo, Chirayu', 'Miller, Kenneth']","['Burley NB', 'Dy PS', 'Hande S', 'Kalantri S', 'Mohindroo C', 'Miller K']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5860-1648', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6263-1391', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3328-7445', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6871-024X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5825-3356', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5047-9177']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210331,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,PMC8026303,,,2021/04/17 06:00,2021/04/17 06:01,['2021/04/16 06:38'],"['2021/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/16 06:38 [entrez]', '2021/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2021/5580823 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2021 Mar 31;2021:5580823. doi: 10.1155/2021/5580823. eCollection 2021.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2021 Nicholas B.

Dleu2 may serve a role in modulating the downstream effects-mediated by alternative splicing of its multiple exons. However, the proportional expression of these alternative splicing populations of the Dleu2 exons is currently unknown. To determine how Dleu2 could be affected by alternative splicing, a series of alternative splicing primer sets were designed to investigate which transcripts were preferentially activated when Dleu2 was targeted for downregulation or upregulation. A specific Dleu2 small interfering RNA that targeted an exon upstream of the tumor suppressor microRNA site significantly knocked down Dleu2 expression across all the primer sets used, which targeted 13 different alternative splicing transcripts over 5 different promoter sites in the mouse liver cell line, AML-12. Similarly, 50 microM Resveratrol led to significant upregulation of Dleu2 in 11 alternative splicing transcripts. These results show that Dleu2 is capable of successful modulation across alternative splicing transcripts that can be screened, and also that Resveratrol can be a potential nutraceutical, which may potentially lead to novel approaches in the use of lncRNA Dleu2 for diagnostics and regulation.","['Kay, Matthew Krivacka', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Choudhury, Mahua']","['Kay MK', 'Zhang J', 'Choudhury M']",,"['Irma Lerma Rangel College of Pharmacy, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, TX 77843, USA.', 'Irma Lerma Rangel College of Pharmacy, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, TX 77843, USA.', 'Irma Lerma Rangel College of Pharmacy, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, TX 77843, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210401,England,Biomed Rep,Biomedical reports,101613227,PMC8042668,['NOTNLM'],"['Resveratrol', 'alternative splicing', 'long non-coding RNA deleted in leukemia 2 gene']",2021/04/17 06:00,2021/04/17 06:01,['2021/04/16 06:37'],"['2020/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/16 06:37 [entrez]', '2021/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/br.2021.1426 [doi]', 'BR-0-0-01426 [pii]']",ppublish,Biomed Rep. 2021 Jun;14(6):50. doi: 10.3892/br.2021.1426.

However, to our knowledge, there were very limited studies on how Bru-34 affected airway inflammation. Thus, in this present study, the effects and potential mechanisms of Bru-34 on allergic airway inflammation were examined both in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that Bru-34 attenuated the allergic airway inflammation in mice, with significant decreasing of the inflammatory cells and mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and attenuation of the histopathological alterations in the lung tissues. In addition, Bru-34 significantly inhibited the release of inflammatory cytokines in antigen induced rat basophilic leukemia -2H3 (RBL-2H3) cells. What's more, Bru-34 significantly decreased the expression of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), p-Syk, cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), p-cPLA2, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and p-NF-kappaB both in allergic mice lung tissue and antigen induced RBL-2H3 cells. Furthermore, the collaborative effects of Bru-34 with inhibitors against Syk, cPLA2, and NF-kappaB, showed that Syk was an important target of Bru-34, and cPLA2 and NF-kappaB played important roles in the coordinated inflammatory response. In conclusion, Bru-34 could significantly modulate the allergic airway inflammation, and its potential mechanism was revealed at least partially via down-regulating of Syk-cPLA2 -NF-kappaB signaling.","['Ding, Yasi', 'Tang, Weibin', 'Pei, Fei', 'Fu, Lixia', 'Ma, Pei', 'Bai, Jinye', 'Lin, Mingbao', 'Liu, Yunbao', 'Hou, Qi']","['Ding Y', 'Tang W', 'Pei F', 'Fu L', 'Ma P', 'Bai J', 'Lin M', 'Liu Y', 'Hou Q']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Institute of Materia Medica, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Institute of Materia Medica, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Institute of Materia Medica, Beijing, China.', 'National Medical Products Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Institute of Materia Medica, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Institute of Materia Medica, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Institute of Materia Medica, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Institute of Materia Medica, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Institute of Materia Medica, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210330,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,PMC8042380,['NOTNLM'],"['Bru-34', 'allergic airway inflammation', 'cytoplasmic phospholipase A2', 'nuclear factor-kappaB', 'spleen tyrosine kinase']",2021/04/17 06:00,2021/04/17 06:01,['2021/04/16 06:34'],"['2020/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/16 06:34 [entrez]', '2021/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2021.587417 [doi]', '587417 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2021 Mar 30;12:587417. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2021.587417. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Ding, Tang, Pei, Fu, Ma, Bai, Lin, Liu and Hou.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Assessing the activity of 12 pegRNAs at 179 predicted off-target sites, we detected only low frequencies of off-target edits (0.00~0.23%). Whole-genome sequencing of 29 PE-treated rice plants confirmed that PEs do not induce genome-wide pegRNA-independent off-target single-nucleotide variants or small insertions/deletions.

Here, by conducting a comprehensive analysis, based on information theory, of differences in methylation stochasticity in samples from patients with paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), we show that ALL epigenomes are stochastic and marked by increased methylation entropy at specific regulatory regions and genes. By integrating DNA methylation and single-cell gene-expression data, we arrived at a relationship between methylation entropy and gene-expression variability, and found that epigenetic changes in ALL converge on a shared set of genes that overlap with genetic drivers involved in chromosomal translocations across the disease spectrum.

However, there is no systematic information or guideline available on the methods to assess physical performance and function in this population. The purpose was to systematically compile and describe assessments of physical performance and function in patients and survivors of pediatric cancer, including cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, speed, balance, flexibility, functional mobility, gait and motor performance test batteries. METHODS: We searched the databases PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Cochrane Database and performed abstract and full-text selection of 2619 articles according to the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews. Information on patients characteristics, assessments, information on validity and reliability, and relevant references was extracted. RESULTS: In summary, 63 different assessments were found in 149 studies including 11639 participants. Most studies evaluated cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength with the majority conducted off treatment. Some outcomes (e.g. speed) and diagnoses (e.g. neuroblastoma) were severely underrepresented. With the exception of gait, leukemia patients represented the largest group of individuals tested. CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient data and patient heterogeneity complicate uniform recommendations for assessments. Our results support researchers and practitioners in selecting appropriate assessment to meet their specific research questions or individual daily practice needs. IMPACT: This systematic review includes 149 studies and provides a comprehensive summary of 63 assessments to evaluate cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, speed, balance, flexibility, functional mobility, gait or motor performance test batteries in patients and survivors of pediatric cancer. We present the most studied fields within the pediatric cancer population, which are cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength, off treatment phase, and leukemia patients. We propose research priorities by identification of subgroups in terms of cancer type, phase of treatment, and outcome of interest that are underrepresented in studies currently available.","['Sontgerath, Regine', 'Daggelmann, Julia', 'Kesting, Sabine V', 'Rueegg, Corina S', 'Wittke, Torge-Christian', 'Reich, Simon', 'Eckert, Katharina G', 'Stoessel, Sandra', 'Chamorro-Vina, Carolina', 'Wiskemann, Joachim', 'Wright, Peter', 'Senn-Malashonak, Anna', 'Oschwald, Vanessa', 'Till, Anne-Marie', 'Gotte, Miriam']","['Sontgerath R', 'Daggelmann J', 'Kesting SV', 'Rueegg CS', 'Wittke TC', 'Reich S', 'Eckert KG', 'Stoessel S', 'Chamorro-Vina C', 'Wiskemann J', 'Wright P', 'Senn-Malashonak A', 'Oschwald V', 'Till AM', 'Gotte M']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0841-8738'],"['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Hemostaseology, University Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Sports Medicine, Institute of Cardiology and Sports Medicine, German Sport University Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute of Preventive Pediatrics, Department of Sport and Health Sciences, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', ""Kinderklinik Munchen Schwabing, TUM School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics and Children's Cancer Research Center, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany."", 'Oslo Centre for Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Krukenberg Cancer Center, University Medicine Halle (Saale), Halle, Germany.', 'Working Group Exercise Oncology Division of Medical Oncology, University Clinic Heidelberg and National Centre for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Health Management & Public Health, IST University of Applied Sciences Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Childhood Cancer Center, University Medical Center Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Faculty of Kinesiology, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Working Group Exercise Oncology Division of Medical Oncology, University Clinic Heidelberg and National Centre for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Sport, Health Sciences and Social Work, Oxford Brookes University, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Hemostaseology, Goethe University Clinic Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Sports Medicine, Institute of Cardiology and Sports Medicine, German Sport University Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Lubeck, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Essen, Pediatrics III, Essen, Germany. miriam.goette@uk-essen.de.']",['eng'],,['Systematic Review'],20210415,United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,,,,2021/04/17 06:00,2021/04/17 06:00,['2021/04/16 06:27'],"['2021/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/02/26 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/16 06:27 [entrez]', '2021/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41390-021-01523-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41390-021-01523-5 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Pediatr Res. 2021 Apr 15. pii: 10.1038/s41390-021-01523-5. doi: 10.1038/s41390-021-01523-5.,,,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They have recently been considered as ideal vehicles for drug-delivery systems, and immune cells are suggested as a potential source for drug-loaded EVs. In this study, we investigated the possibility of neutrophils as a source for drug-loaded EVs. Neutrophil-like differentiated human promyelocytic leukemia cells (dHL-60) produced massive amounts of EVs within 1 h. The dHL-60 cells are also easily loaded with various cargoes such as antibiotics (penicillin), anticancer drug (paclitaxel), chemoattractant (MCP-1), miRNA, and Cas9. The EVs derived from the dHL-60 cells showed efficient incorporation of these cargoes and significant effector functions, such as bactericidal activity, monocyte chemotaxis, and macrophage polarization. Our results suggest that neutrophils or neutrophil-like promyelocytic cells could be an attractive source for drug-delivery EVs.","['Kim, Jun-Kyu', 'Youn, Young-Jin', 'Lee, Yu-Bin', 'Kim, Sun-Hwa', 'Song, Dong-Keun', 'Shin, Minsang', 'Jin, Hee Kyung', 'Bae, Jae-Sung', 'Shrestha, Sanjeeb', 'Hong, Chang-Won']","['Kim JK', 'Youn YJ', 'Lee YB', 'Kim SH', 'Song DK', 'Shin M', 'Jin HK', 'Bae JS', 'Shrestha S', 'Hong CW']",,"['Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, 680 Gukchaebosang-ro, Daegu, 41944, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, 680 Gukchaebosang-ro, Daegu, 41944, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, 680 Gukchaebosang-ro, Daegu, 41944, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, 680 Gukchaebosang-ro, Daegu, 41944, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, Hallym University, Chuncheon, 24252, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, 41944, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Animal Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, 41944, Republic of Korea.', ""KNU Alzheimer's Disease Research Institute, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, 41566, Republic of Korea."", 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, 680 Gukchaebosang-ro, Daegu, 41944, Republic of Korea.', ""KNU Alzheimer's Disease Research Institute, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, 41566, Republic of Korea."", 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, 680 Gukchaebosang-ro, Daegu, 41944, Republic of Korea. sanjeebs2012@gmail.com.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, 680 Gukchaebosang-ro, Daegu, 41944, Republic of Korea. cwhong@knu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210415,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC8050327,,,2021/04/17 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2021/04/16 06:25'],"['2020/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/16 06:25 [entrez]', '2021/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-021-87891-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-021-87891-8 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2021 Apr 15;11(1):8289. doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-87891-8.,20211115,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Penicillins)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL2/administration & dosage', '*Drug Delivery Systems', '*Extracellular Vesicles', '*Granulocyte Precursor Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage', 'Penicillins/administration & dosage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic analysis, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing have identified primary structural alterations in T-PLL, including inversion, translocation and copy number variation. Recurrent somatic mutations were also identified in genes encoding chromatin regulators and those in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Epigenetic alterations are the hallmark of many cancers. However, genome-wide epigenomic profiles have not been reported in T-PLL, limiting the mechanistic study of its carcinogenesis. We hypothesize epigenetic mechanisms also play a key role in T-PLL pathogenesis. To systematically test this hypothesis, we generated genome-wide maps of regulatory regions using H3K4me3 and H3K27ac ChIP-seq, as well as RNA-seq data in both T-PLL patients and healthy individuals. We found that genes down-regulated in T-PLL are mainly associated with defense response, immune system or adaptive immune response, while up-regulated genes are enriched in developmental process, as well as WNT signaling pathway with crucial roles in cell fate decision. In particular, our analysis revealed a global alteration of regulatory landscape in T-PLL, with differential peaks highly enriched for binding motifs of immune related transcription factors, supporting the epigenetic regulation of oncogenes and genes involved in DNA damage response and T-cell activation. Together, our work reveals a causal role of epigenetic dysregulation in T-PLL.","['Tian, Shulan', 'Zhang, Henan', 'Zhang, Pan', 'Kalmbach, Michael', 'Lee, Jeong-Heon', 'Ordog, Tamas', 'Hampel, Paul J', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Witzig, Thomas E', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Klee, Eric W', 'Slager, Susan L', 'Yan, Huihuang', 'Ding, Wei']","['Tian S', 'Zhang H', 'Zhang P', 'Kalmbach M', 'Lee JH', 'Ordog T', 'Hampel PJ', 'Call TG', 'Witzig TE', 'Kay NE', 'Klee EW', 'Slager SL', 'Yan H', 'Ding W']",,"['Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. tian.shulan@mayo.edu.', 'Department of Urology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Information Management and Analytics, Department of Information Technology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Illinois Informatics Institute, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA.', 'Division of Information Management and Analytics, Department of Information Technology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Experimental Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Biomedical Engineering, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.

An Ets2 mutant model (Ets2(db1/db1)), which lacks the DNA-binding domain, was previously reported to exhibit embryonic lethality caused by a trophoblast abnormality. This phenotype could be rescued by tetraploid complementation, resulting in pups with wavy hair and curly whiskers. Here, we generated new Ets2 mutant models with a frame-shift mutation in exon 8 using the CRISPR/Cas9 method. Homozygous mutants could not be obtained by natural mating as embryonic development stopped before E8.5, as previously reported. When we rescued them by tetraploid complementation, these mice did not exhibit wavy hair or curly whisker phenotypes. Our newly generated mice exhibited exon 8 skipping, which led to in-frame mutant mRNA expression in the skin and thymus but not in E7.5 Ets2(em1/em1) embryos. This exon 8-skipped Ets2 mRNA was translated into protein, suggesting that this Ets2 mutant protein complemented the Ets2 function in the skin. Our data implies that novel splicing variants incidentally generated after genome editing may complicate the phenotypic analysis but may also give insight into the new mechanisms related to biological gene functions.","['Kishimoto, Yuki', 'Nishiura, Iori', 'Hirata, Wataru', 'Yuri, Shunsuke', 'Yamamoto, Nami', 'Ikawa, Masahito', 'Isotani, Ayako']","['Kishimoto Y', 'Nishiura I', 'Hirata W', 'Yuri S', 'Yamamoto N', 'Ikawa M', 'Isotani A']",,"['Division of Biological Science, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama-cho, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0192, Japan.', 'Division of Biological Science, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama-cho, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0192, Japan.', 'Division of Biological Science, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama-cho, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0192, Japan.', 'Division of Biological Science, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama-cho, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0192, Japan.', 'Division of Biological Science, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama-cho, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0192, Japan.', 'Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, 3-1 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.', 'Division of Biological Science, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama-cho, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0192, Japan. isotani@bs.naist.jp.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210415,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC8050053,,,2021/04/17 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2021/04/16 06:19'],"['2020/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/16 06:19 [entrez]', '2021/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-021-87751-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-021-87751-5 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2021 Apr 15;11(1):8297. doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-87751-5.,20211115,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Embryo Loss/genetics/pathology', 'Embryonic Development/genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Frameshift Mutation/*genetics', 'Gene Editing/methods', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-2/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Skin/metabolism', 'Trophoblasts/pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

G4-PAMAM is cytotoxic due to its positive charges. However, its cytotoxicity could increase in cancer cells due to the excessive intracellular negative charges in these cells. Furthermore, this work reports G4-PAMAM chemical structural characterization using UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS (LC-MS) by electrospray ionization to measure its population according to its positive charges. Additionally, the antiproliferative effects and intracellular localization were explored in the HMC-1 and K-562 cell lines by confocal microscopy. The LC-MS results show that G4-PAMAM generated multivalent mass spectrum values, and its protonated terminal amino groups produced numerous positive charges, which allowed us to determine its exact mass despite having a high molecular weight.

However, patients showing sustained clinical responses after CAR.CD19-T treatment show increased infection risk due to compromised B-lymphocyte recovery. Mature B cell-derived malignancies express monoclonal immunoglobulins bearing either kappa- or lambda-light chains. We initially constructed CAR-T targeting the kappa-light-chain (CAR.kappa) and established a clinical study with it. After optimizing the CAR molecule, cells developed CAR-T targeting the lambda-light chain (CAR.lambda) and we explored their antitumor activity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using Iglambda(+) lymphoma cell lines and patient-derived Iglambda(+) CLL cells, we evaluated the in vitro tumor cytotoxicity and cytokine profiles of CAR.lambda. We also assessed the in vivo efficacy of CAR.lambda in xenograft Iglambda(+) lymphoma models including a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) of mantle cell lymphoma, and the effects of lambda- or kappa-light chain-specific CAR-T on normal B lymphocytes in a humanized murine model. RESULTS: CAR.lambda demonstrated antitumor effects against Iglambda(+) lymphoma cells and patient-derived CLL cells in vitro, and in vivo in xenograft and PDX Iglambda(+) lymphoma murine models. Antitumor activity of CAR.lambda was superimposable to CAR.CD19. Furthermore, we demonstrated in the humanized murine model that lambda- or kappa-light chain-specific CAR-T cells only depleted the corresponding targeted light chain-expressing normal B cells, while sparing the reciprocal light chain carrying B cells. CONCLUSIONS: Adoptive transfer of CAR.lambda and CAR.kappa-T cells represents a useful and alternative modality to CAR.CD19-T cells in treating mature B-cell malignancies with minimal impact on humoral immunity.See related commentary by Jain and Locke, p. 5736.","['Ranganathan, Raghuveer', 'Shou, Peishun', 'Ahn, Sarah', 'Sun, Chuang', 'West, John', 'Savoldo, Barbara', 'Dotti, Gianpietro']","['Ranganathan R', 'Shou P', 'Ahn S', 'Sun C', 'West J', 'Savoldo B', 'Dotti G']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7685-7471', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6156-0699']","['Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina. raghuveer.ranganathan@med.usc.edu gdotti@med.unc.edu.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina. raghuveer.ranganathan@med.usc.edu gdotti@med.unc.edu.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA193140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA243543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20210415,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,PMC8575489,,,2021/04/17 06:00,2021/04/17 06:00,['2021/04/16 05:53'],"['2020/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/08 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/05/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/16 05:53 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-20-2754 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-2754 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2021 Nov 1;27(21):5951-5960. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-2754.

Lifitegrast 5% (Xiidra@, Novartis), a new immunosuppressive eye drop, was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of severe dry eye and is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency. In France, lifitegrast has been approved by the French authorities for temporary use in refractory dry eye syndrome resistant to tear substitutes and topical cyclosporine. To date, serious complications have been reported only exceptionally. In this article, we report the case of a 65-year-old patient with a medical history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) diagnosed in 2015 who received a first matched related donor transplant. In 2019, this patient developed chronic GVH involving the skin, oral mucosa and eye. Despite taking topical and systemic medications for 3 months, the patient did not report relief of ocular symptoms. Therefore, lifitegrast was prescribed. To our knowledge, we report the first case of corneal perforation in which evisceration was required following treatment with topical lifitegrast for chronic GVH. In the case presented here, it can be assumed that the underlying mechanisms leading to corneal perforation are multifactorial. Using drug accountability criteria, lifitegrast appears to be strongly associated with the development of bacterial keratitis and corneal perforation.","['Ferrete, T', 'Rocher, F', 'Elmaleh, V', 'Loschi, M', 'Tieulie, N', 'Baillif, S', 'Martel, A']","['Ferrete T', 'Rocher F', 'Elmaleh V', 'Loschi M', 'Tieulie N', 'Baillif S', 'Martel A']",,"['Ophthalmology department, University Hospital of Nice, 30, voie Romaine, 06000 Nice, France.

Therefore, targeting Bcl-2 with venetoclax has been suggested as an attractive strategy for inducing apoptosis in AML LSCs. However, the selective inhibition of Bcl-2 in AML often leads to upregulation of Mcl-1, another dominant anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein conferring venetoclax resistance. METHODS: We assessed the combined effect of venetoclax and arsenic trioxide (ATO) on leukaemic cell viability, apoptosis, combination index, and cell cycle in the human LSC-like KG1 and KG1a cells. The synergistic effect of venetoclax and ATO on apoptosis was also examined in primary CD34(+) and CD34(+)CD38(-) LSCs from the bone marrow (BM) of AML patients, and compared with those from healthy donors. RESULTS: Venetoclax efficiently impaired cell viability and dose-dependently promoted apoptosis when combined with ATO; their synergism was aptly represented by the combination index. The combination of venetoclax and ATO impaired cell cycle progression by restricting cells within the sub-G1 phase and facilitating caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death associated with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, while sparing healthy BM haematopoietic stem cells. Mechanistically, ATO mitigated venetoclax-induced upregulation of Mcl-1 by the inhibition of AKT and ERK, along with activation of GSK-3beta. This led to the Mcl-1 destabilisation, triggering Noxa and Bim to facilitate apoptosis and the consequent activation of the apoptosis executioner protein Bak. Moreover, the combination promoted phosphorylation of ATM, Chk2, p38, and H2AX, indicating an active DNA damage response. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the synergistic, preferential antileukaemic effects of venetoclax and ATO on LSCs, providing a rationale for preclinical and clinical trials by combining these agents already being used in clinical practice to treat acute leukaemia.","['Cho, Hyunsoo', 'Jang, Ji Eun', 'Eom, Ju-In', 'Jeung, Hoi-Kyung', 'Chung, Haerim', 'Kim, Jin Seok', 'Cheong, June-Won', 'Min, Yoo Hong']","['Cho H', 'Jang JE', 'Eom JI', 'Jeung HK', 'Chung H', 'Kim JS', 'Cheong JW', 'Min YH']",,"['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea. jieun120@yuhs.ac.', 'Avison Biomedical Research Center, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea.', 'Avison Biomedical Research Center, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea. minbrmmd@yuhs.ac.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210415,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,PMC8051086,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukaemia', 'Apoptosis', 'Arsenic trioxide', 'Venetoclax']",2021/04/17 06:00,2021/04/17 06:01,['2021/04/16 05:40'],"['2021/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/16 05:40 [entrez]', '2021/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40164-021-00221-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s40164-021-00221-6 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2021 Apr 15;10(1):28. doi: 10.1186/s40164-021-00221-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chrysin has anti-cancer, anti-viral, anti-diabetic, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, and renoprotective as well as gastrointestinal, respiratory, reproductive, ocular, and skin protective effects through modulating signaling pathway involved in apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. In the current review, we discussed the emerging cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying therapeutic indications of chrysin in various cancers. Online databases comprising Scopus, PubMed, Embase, ProQuest, Science Direct, Web of Science, and the search engine Google Scholar were searched for available and eligible research articles. The search was conducted by using MeSH terms and keywords in title, abstract, and keywords. In conclusion, experimental studies indicated that chrysin could ameliorate cancers of the breast, gastrointestinal tract, liver and hepatocytes, bladder, male and female reproductive systems, choroid, respiratory tract, thyroid, skin, eye, brain, blood cells, leukemia, osteoblast, and lymph. However, more studies are needed to enhance the bioavailability of chrysin and evaluate this agent in clinical trial studies.","['Talebi, Marjan', 'Talebi, Mohsen', 'Farkhondeh, Tahereh', 'Simal-Gandara, Jesus', 'Kopustinskiene, Dalia M', 'Bernatoniene, Jurga', 'Samarghandian, Saeed']","['Talebi M', 'Talebi M', 'Farkhondeh T', 'Simal-Gandara J', 'Kopustinskiene DM', 'Bernatoniene J', 'Samarghandian S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5461-9579'],"['Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, 1991953381, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX, 76019, USA.', 'Food Safety Net Services (FSNS), San Antonio, TX, 78216, USA.', 'Cardiovscular Diseases Research Center, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran.', 'Nutrition and Bromatology Group, Department of Analytical and Food Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Vigo, Ourense Campus, 32004, Ourense, Spain.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Technologies, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical Academy, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Sukileliu pr. 13, 50161, Kaunas, Lithuania.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Technologies, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical Academy, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Sukileliu pr. 13, 50161, Kaunas, Lithuania.', 'Noncommunicable Diseases Research Center, Neyshabur University of Medical Sciences, Neyshabur, Iran. samarghandians1@nums.ac.ir.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210415,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,PMC8050922,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Cancer', 'Chrysin', 'Flavonoids', 'Inflammation', 'Metastasis', 'Oxidative stress', 'Proliferation', 'Transcription factors']",2021/04/17 06:00,2021/04/17 06:01,['2021/04/16 05:37'],"['2020/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/16 05:37 [entrez]', '2021/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-021-01906-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12935-021-01906-y [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2021 Apr 15;21(1):214. doi: 10.1186/s12935-021-01906-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MCMs can model survival data comprising of statistically cured (patients in long-term remission) and uncured patients. Materials & methods: Models were fit to patient-level data corresponding to individual treatment arms. Results: Visual inspection showed that MCMs fit the clinical data best. Survival modeling with MCMs showed that treatment with GO + SC versus SC alone results in higher statistical cure rates for event-free survival (rates: 26-35% vs 21-23%) and overall survival (rates: 48-52% vs 38-44%).

Methods: 1 in circlePeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 30 patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic anemia (R/R B-ALL) who accepted CD19 CAR-T cell therapy and six healthy volunteers were collected. 2 in circleThe residual leukemia cells were analyzed by flow cytometry in the system after the PBMCs of R/R B-ALL patients were sorted by CD3 magnetic beads. 3 in circle CD3(+) T cells from patients and healthy volunteers were transfected with CD19 CAR and CD22 CAR lentivirus to prepare CD19 CAR-T and CD22 CAR-T cells. 4 in circleThe Nalm-6 cell line was resuscitated and the Nalm-6 cells with CD19 CAR lentivirus were transfected to prepare CD19 CAR-Nalm-6 cells. The patient's primary ALL cells were transfected with CD19 CAR lentivirus at the same time. The transfection rates were analyzed by flow cytometer, the cell proliferation was analyzed by the CCK-8 method, and the cell-killing activities were detected by the lactate dehydrogenase method. Results: 1 in circle Among the 30 R/R B-ALL patients who received CD19 CAR-T cell therapy, two patients had 2.04% and 3.32% residual leukemia cells in CD3(+) T cells. After 4 days in culture, the residual leukemia cells disappeared and could not be detected by a flow cytometer with prolonged cultivation in vitro. 2 in circle The proliferation of CD19 CAR-Nalm-6 cells was higher than that of the Nalm-6 cells. 3 in circle The killing activity of the CD19 CAR-T cells on Nalm-6 cells was higher than that of the CD19 CAR-Nalm6 cells at a target ratio of 1ratio1 on 24, 48, 72 h, respectively. The cytotoxicity of CD22 CAR-T cells on CD19 CAR-Nalm-6 cells was significantly higher than that of CD19 CAR-T cells. 4 in circle The cytotoxicity of CD22 CAR-T alone on CD19 CAR-Nalm-6 cells was higher than that of CD19 CAR-T combined with CD22 CAR-T at the same target ratio. Conclusion: The residual leukemia cells in the culture system in the preparation of CD19 CAR-T cells may lead to the introduction of CD19 CAR into leukemia cells and results in the failure of the CD19 CAR-T cell therapy.

Methods: A retrospective study (n=280) was performed. MRD was determined using multiparameter flow cytometry and RQ-PCR. Results: MRD analysis with MFC and RQ-PCR of the BCR-ABL fusion transcript showed a strong correlation before transplantation. The positive rates of MRD detected by MFC and RQ-PCR before transplantation were 25.7% (72/280) and 60.7% (170/280) , respectively. MFC MRD-positive (MRDpos) Ph(+) ALL patients had a higher 3 year cumulative incidences of relapse (CIR) than did MFC MRD-negative (MRDneg) Ph(+) ALL patients (23.6%vs 8.6%; P<0.001) . However, the RQ-PCR MRDpos group had similar rates of 3 year OS, LFS, and NRM compared with those in the RQ-PCR MRDneg group. Moreover, patients with RQ-PCR MRD >/=1% experienced higher 3 year CIR (23.1%vs 11.4%; P=0.032) , lower LFS (53.8%vs 74.4%; P=0.015) , and OS (57.7% vs 79.1%; P=0.009) compared with the RQ-PCR MRD<1% group. Multivariate analyses confirmed the association of MFC MRD status and RQ-PCR MRD >/=1% with outcomes (P<0.05) . The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) , and negative predictive value (NPV) of MFC detection MRD to predict recurrence were 48.50%, 77.56%, 23.62%, and 87.16%, respectively. Moreover, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 23.00%, 88.59%, 17.15%, and 91.84%, respectively, when RQ-PCR MRD >/=1% was used to predict recurrence. Additionally, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 54.29%, 73.88%, 45.7% and 91.87%, respectively, when MRD-positive status before transplantation (MFC MRDpos or RQ-PCR MRD >/=1%) was used to predict recurrence after transplantation. Conclusions: Both MFC and RQ-PCR detection of pretransplant MRD levels can predict the prognosis of Ph(+) B-ALL patients receiving allogeneic HSCT. MFC MRD-positive status before transplantation is the risk factor of leukemia recurrence after transplantation. The combined use of the two methods (MFC MRDpos or RQ-PCR MRD >/=1%) can improve the sensitivity, PPV, and NPV of predicting recurrence and help to better screen high-risk patients for intervention, thereby improving clinical efficacy.","['Wang, X Y', 'Chang, Y J', 'Liu, Y R', 'Qin, Y Q', 'Xu, L P', 'Wang, Y', 'Zhang, X H', 'Yan, C H', 'Sun, Y Q', 'Huang, X J', 'Zhao, X S']","['Wang XY', 'Chang YJ', 'Liu YR', 'Qin YQ', 'Xu LP', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang XH', 'Yan CH', 'Sun YQ', 'Huang XJ', 'Zhao XS']",,"[""Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],"['81670175, 81870137/National Natural Science Foundation of China']",['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,PMC8071672,['NOTNLM'],"['Flow cytometry', 'Leukemia, lymphocytic, acute', 'Minimal residual disease', 'RQ-PCR']",2021/04/16 06:00,2021/04/20 06:00,['2021/04/15 22:08'],"['2021/04/15 22:08 [entrez]', '2021/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2021.02.005 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2021 Feb 14;42(2):116-123. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2021.02.005.,20210419,,IM,"['Flow Cytometry', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, B-Cell', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prognosis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: This prospective, single-arm, and open clinical study enrolled 30 adult Ph(+) ALL patients who were newly diagnosed and treated from January 2016 to April 2018 in the center of this study. Standard induction chemotherapy was given for 4 weeks. However, dasatinib (100 mg/d) was continuously administered from day 8 until the end of the whole therapy in the induction therapy. Patients who are available for allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) received transplantation when the disease was evaluated as complete remission. Results: All 30 patients achieved hematological complete remission (HCR) after the induction chemotherapy, and 70.0% (21/30) of them achieved the accumulated molecular complete remission (MCR) . The patients were followed up with a median follow-up time of 37.8 months (32.0-46.6) . The 3 year overall survival (OS) and 3 year hematological relapse-free survival (HRFS) were 68.1% and 61.6%, respectively. Moreover, 63.3% and 43.3% of the patients achieved molecular major remission and MCR, respectively. Consequently, 60.0% of the patients achieved MCR until 6 months. The patients who achieved MCR within 6 months had superior OS (P=0.004) , HRFS (P=0.049) , and event-free survival (EFS; P=0.001) . Fifteen patients (50.0%) received SCT at the first HCR. However, HRFS (P=0.030) and EFS (P=0.010) in the SCT group were better than those in the chemotherapy group. Conclusions: The regimen of dasatinib combined with a multi-agent chemotherapy was proven safe and effective in the treatment of newly diagnosed adult Ph(+) ALL patients.

Family-oriented rehabilitation programs (FOR) focus on long-term consequences and support families in returning to daily life. The objectives of this study were to describe rehabilitation goals and goal attainment, to analyze the relationship between physical functioning and physical well-being and to examine predictors of changes in physical functioning during the FOR. METHODS: In a prospective observational study, statements of physicians regarding rehabilitation goals, goal achievement and physical functioning of 175 children (<18 years of age at the time of diagnosis of leukemia or central nervous system tumor) at the beginning and the end of a FOR were analyzed. The physical well-being of the patients was assessed from a parent and child perspective. Correlation coefficients were calculated to analyze the relation between physical functioning and physical well-being. Predictors of changes in physical functioning were examined with a multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: The most frequently mentioned rehabilitation goals were the increase of physical functioning and the integration into the peer group. Overall, the goal achievement ranged from 82 to 100%. Physical functioning improved significantly during the FOR. A significant positive correlation between the physician's assessment of physical functioning and the parental assessment of physical well-being could be found at the beginning of the FOR. According to the regression model, female gender of the child and a longer time since diagnosis were associated with a lower change in physical functioning. Furthermore, a higher degree of physical consequential damages was associated with a larger change. CONCLUSIONS: The 4-week multimodal rehabilitation program of the FOR addressed various physical and psychosocial burdens and was accompanied by a significant improvement of the physical functioning of childhood cancer patients. The change in physical functioning was associated with different sociodemographic and medical factors (eg, sex). The consideration of these factors could help with optimizing the program.","['Peikert, Mona L', 'Inhestern, Laura', 'Krauth, Konstantin A', 'Bergelt, Corinna']","['Peikert ML', 'Inhestern L', 'Krauth KA', 'Bergelt C']",,"['Institut und Poliklinik fur Medizinische Psychologie, Universitatsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf, Deutschland.', 'Institut und Poliklinik fur Medizinische Psychologie, Universitatsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf, Deutschland.', 'Kinderhaus, Klinik Bad Oexen, Bad Oeynhausen, Deutschland.', 'Institut und Poliklinik fur Medizinische Psychologie, Universitatsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf, Deutschland.']",['ger'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20210415,Germany,Rehabilitation (Stuttg),Die Rehabilitation,0401273,,,,2021/04/16 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2021/04/15 20:30'],"['2021/04/15 20:30 [entrez]', '2021/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/a-1361-4970 [doi]'],ppublish,Rehabilitation (Stuttg). 2021 Apr;60(2):124-131. doi: 10.1055/a-1361-4970.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this single center retrospective study, we assessed outcomes of 99 consecutive adult AML patients treated with a risk-adapted strategy with a median follow-up of 35.5 months. RESULTS: We identified 24 (24 %), 55 (56 %) and 20 (20 %) patients classified as favorable-, intermediate-, and adverse- risk group respectively, according to the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2017 classification. Patients either received idarubicin and cytarabine induction chemotherapy with or without FLT3 inhibitors or hypomethylating agents based on age and comorbidity. The complete response (CR) rate was 76 % (82 % and 61 % in patients aged < 60 and >/= 60, respectively). For the whole cohort, the 3-year overall survival (OS) was 53 %, being 62 % and 30 % in patients aged < 60 and >/= 60, respectively. The 3-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 54 %, with 56 % and 45 % in patients aged < 60 and >/= 60, respectively. The 3-year LFS were 58 %, 62 % and 25 % for patients within ELN favorable-, intermediate-, and adverse-risk groups respectively. Twenty-seven (36 %) out of 75 patients with intermediate- and adverse-risk disease underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in first CR with 92 % of them receiving post-transplant maintenance consisting of azacitidine in 19 (76 %) patients or sorafenib in 6 (24 %) patients. Of these patients younger than 60 years, the 3-year OS and LFS were 85 % and 69 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results indicate an improved OS for AML patients especially in intermediate-risk category who were treated with a total therapy consisting of induction chemotherapy followed by allo-HCT and post-transplant maintenance.","['Mohty, Razan', 'Massoud, Radwan', 'Chakhachiro, Zaher', 'Mahfouz, Rami', 'Nassif, Samer', 'El-Cheikh, Jean', 'Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Abou Dalle, Iman']","['Mohty R', 'Massoud R', 'Chakhachiro Z', 'Mahfouz R', 'Nassif S', 'El-Cheikh J', 'Bazarbachi A', 'Abou Dalle I']",,"['Hematology-Oncology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Hematology-Oncology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Hematopathology Division, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Hematopathology Division, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Hematopathology Division, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Hematology-Oncology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Hematology-Oncology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.

This study attempted to investigate the biological role of CRNDE methylation in CLL. The expression and methylation levels of CRNDE in CLL cell lines (MEC-1 and HG3) before or after methylation inhibitor (5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine, 5-Aza-CdR) treatment was detected by quantitative real-time PCR or methylation-Specific PCR. The relationship among CRNDE, miR-28 and NDRG2 was verified by luciferase reporter assay. The effect of CRNDE overexpression and 5-Aza-CdR treatment on cell proliferation and apoptosis of MEC-1 and HG3 cells were assessed by CCK8 and flow cytomery. Compared with normal B lymphocytes, CRNDE was down-regulated and the methylation level of CRNDE was increased in MEC-1 and HG3 cells. Then, 5-Aza-CdR treatment caused an increase of CRNDE expression in MEC-1 and HG3 cells by demethylation. The overexpression or demethylation of CRNDE inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis in MEC-1 and HG3 cells by up-regulating CRNDE expression. Moreover, CRNDE functioned as a competing endogenous RNA to repress miR-28, which controlled its down-stream target NDRG2. CRNDE overexpression inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis via miR-28/NDRG2 axis in CLL. In conclusion, our data elaborated that CRNDE expression was regulated by DNA methylation, and the protective effect of CRNDE on CLL was attributed to the inhibition of proliferation in CLL via miR-28/NDRG2 axis. Thus, this work highlights a novel competing endogenous RNA circuitry involving key regulators of CLL.","['Ni, Jing', 'Hong, Jian', 'Li, Qingsheng', 'Zeng, Qingshu', 'Xia, Ruixiang']","['Ni J', 'Hong J', 'Li Q', 'Zeng Q', 'Xia R']",,"['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, 230022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, 230022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, 230022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, 230022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, 230022, China.

Data from existing retrospective and prospective studies have suggested that high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HCT) may improve the survival in patients with chemosensitive disease, either in the upfront or salvage setting. Auto-HCT is currently recommended to be used as frontline consolidation in peripheral T cell lymphoma not otherwise specified, angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma-anaplastic lymphoma kinase negative, NK/T cell (disseminated), and enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma. However, about one-third of patients never reach transplantation because of early relapse or refractory disease. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), via its immunologic graft-versus-lymphoma effect, has been used to salvage patients with relapsed or refractory disease, resulting in long-term disease-free survival in a fraction of patients. However, the higher risk of transplant-related mortality due to regimen-related toxicities, graft-versus-host disease, and post-transplant infectious complications continues to limit the mainstream adoption of allo-HCT for this disease. Despite that, allo-HCT has been incorporated as part of the frontline treatment for aggressive subtypes of T-NHL, such as gammadelta T cell lymphoma and aggressive NK cell leukemia. Recent attempts to incorporate novel targeted T cell directed therapies into the treatment pathway of T-NHL may enhance treatment response and enable more patients to reach transplant, offering an alternative means of treating this disease.","['Boo, Yang Liang', 'Koh, Liang Piu']","['Boo YL', 'Koh LP']",,"['Department of Hematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, Singapore; Department of Hematology, Hospital Sultanah Aminah, Johor Bahru, Malaysia.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, Singapore; Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.

Furthermore, DTI tractography is adversely affected by incorrect white matter segmentation due to leukoencephalopathy (LE). All these issues need to be addressed. PURPOSE: To propose and evaluate a modified DTI processing pipeline with DIstortion COrrection using pseudo T2 -weighted images (DICOT) to overcome limitations in existing acquisition protocols. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective feasibility. SUBJECTS: DICOT was assessed in simulated data and 84 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients with reversed PE acquired. The pipeline was then tested in 522 scans from 261 ALL patients without a reversed PE acquired. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: A 3 T; diffusion-weighted EPI; 3D magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE). STATISTICAL TESTS: Repeated measures analysis of variance and Tukey post hoc tests were performed to compare fractional anisotropy (FA) values obtained by different methods. ASSESSMENT: FA and corresponding absolute error maps were obtained using TOPUP, DICOT, INVERSION (Inverse contrast Normalization for VERy Simple registratION) and NO CORR (no correction). Each method was assessed by comparing to TOPUP. The pipeline in the ALL patients was evaluated based on the failure rate of the distortion correction using the global correlation values. RESULTS: Using DICOT reduced the mean absolute errors by an average of 32% in FA in simulation datasets. In 84 patients, the error reductions were approximately 15% in FA with DICOT, while it was 5% with INVERSION. No significant differences between the TOPUP and DICOT were observed in FA with P = 0.090/0.894(AP/PA). Only 15 of 516 examinations requiring any additional manual intervention. CONCLUSION: This modified pipeline produced better results than the INVERSION. Furthermore, robust performance was demonstrated in archived patient scans acquired without an inverse PE necessary for TOPUP correction.

We analysed the outcome of children transplanted for FA between 1999 and 2018 in the UK. A total of 94 transplants were performed in 82 patients. Among the donors, 51.2% were matched related donors (MRD) while the remainder were alternative donors. Most patients received a fludarabine-cyclophosphamide (Flu-Cy)-based conditioning regimen (86.6%) and in vivo T-cell depletion with alemtuzumab (69.5%). Five-year overall survival (OS) was 85.4% [70.4-93.2] with MRD, 95.7% [72.9-99.4] with matched unrelated donors (MUD), 44.4% [6.6-78.5] with mismatched unrelated donors (MMUD) and 44.4% [13.6-71.9] with mismatched related donors (MMRD) (P < 0.001). Other factors significantly impacting OS were pre-transplant bone marrow status, source of stem cells, cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus, preparation with Flu-Cy, use of total body irradiation (TBI) and alemtuzumab as serotherapy. In multivariate analysis, absence of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or leukaemia, bone marrow as source of stem cells, cytomegalovirus (CMV) other than +/- (Recipient/Donor) and Flu-Cy were protective factors for five-year OS. Five-year chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD)-free event-free survival was 75.4% with the same risk factors except for CMV serostatus. Five-year non-relapse mortality was 13.8% [7.3-22.3]. Only five patients (6.1%) developed grade II-IV acute GVHD and two patients chronic GVHD.

In particular, there is little information about the surgical aspects of ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) for children. In the present study, the appropriateness of preoperative management and the criteria of our cases were investigated with the aim of establishing a safe OTC procedure. METHODS: A total of 25 girls who underwent OTC from November 2015 through May 2020 were retrospectively analyzed with IRB approval. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 13 (1-17) years. The medical indications were varied (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, brain tumor), and included rare diseases. Seventeen cases (68%) underwent OTC during chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and 21 (84%) had comorbidities. All cases underwent ovarian tissue retrieval (OTR) with laparoscopy, and the median operating time was 64 (36-97) min, with little bleeding. Although two had complications, all patients started treatment on schedule. The median WBC and CRP increases a day after OTR were 0 (- 4400 to + 5200)/microl and 0.21 (- 0.2 to 0.87) mg/dl, respectively, with no complications. CONCLUSION: As long as the preoperative criteria are met, OTC could be possible even for children with a severe blood condition. In such cases, the degrees of the WBC and CRP elevations are useful to assess surgical infection.","['Takae, Seido', 'Furuta, Shigeyuki', 'Keino, Dai', 'Shiraishi, Eriko', 'Iwahata, Yuriko', 'Oyama, Kei', 'Iwahata, Hideyuki', 'Nishiya, Yuri', 'Kawaguchi, Kohei', 'Obayashi, Juma', 'Tanaka, Kunihide', 'Sawada, Shino', 'Suzuki, Yuki', 'Sugishita, Yodo', 'Deura, Imari', 'Horage, Yuki', 'Nagae, Hideki', 'Kondo, Haruhiro', 'Sakamoto, Miki', 'Mori, Tetsuya', 'Kitagawa, Hiroaki', 'Suzuki, Nao']","['Takae S', 'Furuta S', 'Keino D', 'Shiraishi E', 'Iwahata Y', 'Oyama K', 'Iwahata H', 'Nishiya Y', 'Kawaguchi K', 'Obayashi J', 'Tanaka K', 'Sawada S', 'Suzuki Y', 'Sugishita Y', 'Deura I', 'Horage Y', 'Nagae H', 'Kondo H', 'Sakamoto M', 'Mori T', 'Kitagawa H', 'Suzuki N']",,"['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 216-8511, Japan.', ""Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, 2-138-4 Mutsukawa, Minami-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, 232-8555, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 232-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 232-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 216-8511, Japan. nao@marianna-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210414,Germany,Pediatr Surg Int,Pediatric surgery international,8609169,,['NOTNLM'],"['Child cancer patient', 'Fertility preservation', 'Oophorectomy', 'Ovarian tissue cryopreservation', 'Surgical management']",2021/04/16 06:00,2021/07/10 06:00,['2021/04/15 07:37'],"['2020/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/15 07:37 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00383-021-04900-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s00383-021-04900-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Pediatr Surg Int. 2021 Aug;37(8):1021-1029. doi: 10.1007/s00383-021-04900-7.

Here, we aim to discuss the evidence showing a prognostic potential for extracellular vesicles (EV) and their associated microRNAs (miRNAs). RECENT FINDINGS: EV are produced by several cells in the body as a physiological event; however, there is evidence suggesting that an elevated EV concentration is present in the circulation of CLL patients. Moreover, some studies have associated EV concentration with advanced Rai stage and unmutated CLL while others have demonstrated its potential as an independent prognostic factor for TTFT and OS. Finally, some studies have shown that CLL EV shared some dysregulated microRNAs with CLL cells and plasma. On the other hand, it was found that CLL EV has a distinctive microRNA expression profile. Until now, EV-associated miR-155 is the most studied miRNA. Despite methodological diversity and limitations in study design, unanimity in CLL EV concentration behaviour and miRNA content has been found.","['Aguilar-Hernandez, Maria Montserrat', 'Rincon Camacho, Julio Cesar', 'Galicia Garcia, Gabriela']","['Aguilar-Hernandez MM', 'Rincon Camacho JC', 'Galicia Garcia G']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8449-4359'],"['Departamento de Hematologia, Catedra CONACYT, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Avenida Vasco de Quiroga No. 15, Colonia Belisario Dominguez Seccion XVI, Delegacion Tlalpan C.P, 14080, Mexico City, Mexico. mmaguilarhe@conacyt.mx.', 'Departamento de Hematologia, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Avenida Vasco de Quiroga No. 15, Colonia Belisario Dominguez Seccion XVI, Delegacion Tlalpan C.P, 14080, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Hematologia, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Avenida Vasco de Quiroga No. 15, Colonia Belisario Dominguez Seccion XVI, Delegacion Tlalpan C.P, 14080, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210414,United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,,['NOTNLM'],"['*B cell receptor', ""*Bruton's tyrosine kinase"", '*Rai staging system', '*TCL-1 mice', '*Y RNA', '*ZAP-70', '*absolute lymphocyte count', '*argonaute', '*cancer-associated fibroblasts', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*exosomes', '*extracellular vesicles', '*ibrutinib', '*idelalisib', '*immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene (IGHV)', '*miR-155', '*miR-21', '*microRNA', '*monoclonal B lymphocytosis', '*monocytes', '*overall survival', '*phosphoinositide 3-kinase', '*small noncoding RNA', '*time to first treatment']",2021/04/16 06:00,2021/04/16 06:00,['2021/04/15 07:36'],"['2021/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/15 07:36 [entrez]', '2021/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11912-021-01058-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s11912-021-01058-2 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2021 Apr 14;23(6):66. doi: 10.1007/s11912-021-01058-2.,,,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Obtained extracts were characterized in terms to their apigenin and apigenin glucoside composition, as well as antiproliferative potential against tumour cells. Antioxidant activity was determined by two different assays based on different mechanisms showing that autofermented extracts have higher reduction potential. Autofermented extracts prepared by ultrasound and Soxhlet extraction had a stronger impact on the treated carcinoma (HeLa and NCI-H358) and leukemia (K562) cells' growth reduction in comparison to the native extracts, 30-35% greater inhibition at the lowest concentration (0.01 mg/mL), in two observed time points (48 and 72 h). Leukemia cells are more sensitive to all tested extracts. The autofermented CLF extracts with highest antiproliferative efficacy induced morphological changes and apoptosis in the HeLa cells. Obtained results clearly showed that the combination of enzymatic hydrolysis with cavitation phenomenon results in extracts with higher apigenin content and increased biological potential.","['Jukic, Marijana', 'Cvetanovic, Aleksandra', 'Miskovic Spoljaric, Katarina', 'Savic, Sasa', 'Svarc-Gajic, Jaroslava', 'Zekovic, Zoran', 'Glavas-Obrovac, Ljubica']","['Jukic M', 'Cvetanovic A', 'Miskovic Spoljaric K', 'Savic S', 'Svarc-Gajic J', 'Zekovic Z', 'Glavas-Obrovac L']",,,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Slovenia,Acta Chim Slov,Acta chimica Slovenica,101247110,,,,2019/09/01 00:00,2019/09/01 00:01,['2021/04/15 07:36'],"['2021/04/15 07:36 [entrez]', '2019/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/01 00:01 [medline]']",['Jukic-2019-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Acta Chim Slov. 2019 Sep;66(3):560-569.,,,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently established risk stratification guidelines show a moderate predictive accuracy, and newer tools that integrate multiple molecular variables have proven to provide better results. In this report, we aimed to create a new machine learning model of AML survival using gene expression data. We used gene expression data from two publicly available cohorts in order to create and validate a random forest predictor of survival, which we named ST-123. The most important variables in the model were age and the expression of KDM5B and LAPTM4B, two genes previously associated with the biology and prognostication of myeloid neoplasms. This classifier achieved high concordance indexes in the training and validation sets (0.7228 and 0.6988, respectively), and predictions were particularly accurate in patients at the highest risk of death. Additionally, ST-123 provided significant prognostic improvements in patients with high-risk mutations. Our results indicate that survival of patients with AML can be predicted to a great extent by applying machine learning tools to transcriptomic data, and that such predictions are particularly precise among patients with high-risk mutations.","['Mosquera Orgueira, Adrian', 'Peleteiro Raindo, Andres', 'Cid Lopez, Miguel', 'Diaz Arias, Jose Angel', 'Gonzalez Perez, Marta Sonia', 'Antelo Rodriguez,

The aim of the study was to investigate whether hyperuricemia might be an early manifestation of undiagnosed adult leukemia in Taiwan. Methods: A population-based cohort study was conducted to analyze the database of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Program. There were 47708 subjects aged 20 to 84 years with newly diagnosed hyperuricemia as the hyperuricemia group from 2000 to 2013, and 190832 randomly selected subjects without hyperuricemia as the non-hyperuricemia group. The hyperuricemia group and the non-hyperuricemia group were followed for one year to estimate the incidence of new diagnosis of leukemia. Results: The overall incidence of leukemia was 1.32-fold higher in the hyperuricemia group than the non-hyperuricemia group (0.74 versus 0.55 per 10000 person-months, 95% confidence interval 1.28-1.37). The incidence rate ratio of leukemia was statistically higher in the first 3 months of hyperuricemia diagnosis (incidence rate ratio 4.05). Conclusion: Adults with hyperuricemia have a higher incidence of being diagnosed with leukemia than those without hyperuricemia. Hyperuricemia might be an early manifestation of undiagnosed adult leukemia. Clinicians should check the complete blood count with differential to detect the possibility of leukemia when adults present with hyperuricemia.","['Lai, Shih-Wei', 'Lin, Cheng-Li', 'Liao, Kuan-Fu']","['Lai SW', 'Lin CL', 'Liao KF']",,"['College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Family Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Management Office for Health Data, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'College of Medicine, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hepatogastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Taichung Tzu Chi General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200328,China (Republic : 1949- ),Biomedicine (Taipei),BioMedicine,101611451,PMC7608843,['NOTNLM'],"['Taiwan National Health Insurance Program', 'adult', 'hyperuricemia', 'leukemia']",2021/04/16 06:00,2021/04/16 06:01,['2021/04/15 07:22'],"['2019/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/15 07:22 [entrez]', '2021/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.37796/2211-8039.1004 [doi]', 'bmed-10-01-040 [pii]']",epublish,Biomedicine (Taipei). 2020 Mar 28;10(1):40-44. doi: 10.37796/2211-8039.1004. eCollection 2020.,,,,,['(c) the Author(s).'],,,,,['The authors disclose no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: A retrospective descriptive study of oncologic patients aged less than 15 years who were diagnosed with febrile neutropenia in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital was conducted between January 2013 to December 2017. Characteristics and clinical outcomes of febrile neutropenia episodes, causative pathogens, and their antibiotic susceptibilities were recorded. Result: This study included 267 patients with 563 febrile neutropenia episodes. The median (range) age was 5.1 years (1 month-15 years). The most common underlying disease was acute lymphoblastic leukemia (42.7%). Of 563 febrile episodes, there were 192 (34.1%) with microbiologically documented infection. Among these 192 episodes of microbiologically documented infection, there were 214 causative pathogens: 154 bacteria (72%), 32 viruses (15%), 27 fungus (12.6%), and 1 Mycobacterium tuberculosis (0.4%). Gram-negative bacteria (48.6%) accounted for most of the causative pathogens. Twenty-three percent of them were multidrug resistant, and 18% were carbapenem resistant. Among Gram-positive bacterial infection which accounted for 23.4% of all specimens, the proportion of MRSA was 20%. The 2-week mortality rate was 3.7%. Drug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infection caused significant adverse events and mortality compared to nonresistant bacterial infection (p < 0.05). Conclusion: There is high rate of drug-resistant organism infection in pediatric oncology patients in a tertiary-care center in Thailand. Infection with drug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infection was associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Continuous surveillance for the pattern of drug-resistant infections is crucial.","['Jungrungrueng, Thanyathorn', 'Anugulruengkitt, Suvaporn', 'Lauhasurayotin, Supanun', 'Chiengthong, Kanhatai', 'Poparn, Hansamon', 'Sosothikul, Darintr', 'Techavichit, Piti']","['Jungrungrueng T', 'Anugulruengkitt S', 'Lauhasurayotin S', 'Chiengthong K', 'Poparn H', 'Sosothikul D', 'Techavichit P']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1888-1446'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'STAR Clinical Research for Holistic Management in Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'STAR Clinical Research for Holistic Management in Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'STAR Clinical Research for Holistic Management in Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'STAR Clinical Research for Holistic Management in Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'STAR Clinical Research for Holistic Management in Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210329,Egypt,J Pathog,Journal of pathogens,101571433,PMC8021465,,,2021/04/16 06:00,2021/04/16 06:01,['2021/04/15 07:21'],"['2020/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/15 07:21 [entrez]', '2021/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2021/6692827 [doi]'],epublish,J Pathog. 2021 Mar 29;2021:6692827. doi: 10.1155/2021/6692827. eCollection 2021.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2021 Thanyathorn Jungrungrueng et al.'],,,,,['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus, as is HIV, we investigated the possible influence of HTLV-1 on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by use of established atherosclerosis parameters. Methods: The study was done on Iki Island, Fukuoka, an area endemic for HTLV-1. The data of 1,424 residents who reported to an annual health check were available for analysis. Anti-HTLV-1 antibody status and factors associated with atherosclerosis were examined, including maximum intima-media thickness (Max-IMT) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (PWV). Results: HTLV-1 positive participants had significantly higher Max-IMT (1.15 +/- 0.55 vs. 1.08 +/- 0.61 mm, P = 0.04) and PWV (1,760.6 +/- 414.5 vs. 1,657.1 +/- 425.5 cm/s, P < 0.01) values than did those negative. Moreover, in multiple regression analysis (odds ratio: 1.39, P < 0.01) of participants with Max-IMT 1.1 mm or over, HTLV-1 was extracted as an independent factor for the development of atherosclerosis. Conclusion: Our results indicate that HTLV-1 infection confers a high risk of atherosclerosis, although its opposite relation is also possible. It is important to carefully follow the health status of HTLV-1 carriers.","['Takeoka, Hiroaki', 'Sagara, Yasuko', 'Ksashiwagi, Seizaburo', 'Nabeshima, Shigeki']","['Takeoka H', 'Sagara Y', 'Ksashiwagi S', 'Nabeshima S']",,"['General Medicine, Fukuoka University Hospital, 7-45-1 Nanakuma, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka 814-0180, Japan.', 'General Medicine, Kyushu University Hospital, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Quality, Japanese Red Cross Kyushu Block Blood Center, 1-2-1 Kamikoga, Chikushino, Fukuoka 818-8588, Japan.', 'Fukuoka Center, Japanese Red Cross Kyushu Block Blood Center, 1-2-1 Kamikoga, Chikushino, Fukuoka 818-8588, Japan.', 'General Medicine, Fukuoka University Hospital, 7-45-1 Nanakuma, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka 814-0180, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210319,Canada,J Clin Med Res,Journal of clinical medicine research,101538301,PMC8016519,['NOTNLM'],"['Atherosclerosis', 'HTLV-1', 'IMT']",2021/04/16 06:00,2021/04/16 06:01,['2021/04/15 07:19'],"['2021/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/15 07:19 [entrez]', '2021/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.14740/jocmr4457 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Med Res. 2021 Mar;13(3):164-169. doi: 10.14740/jocmr4457.

PIM2 is largely expressed in both leukemia and solid tumors, and it promotes the transcriptional activation of genes involved in cell survival, cell proliferation, and cell-cycle progression. Many tumorigenic signaling molecules have been identified as substrates for PIM2 kinase, and a variety of inhibitors have been developed for its kinase activity, including SMI-4a, SMI-16a, SGI-1776, JP11646 and DHPCC-9. Here, we summarize the signaling pathways involved in PIM2 kinase regulation and PIM2 mechanisms in various neoplastic diseases. We also discuss the current status and future perspectives for the development of PIM2 kinase inhibitors to combat human cancer, and PIM2 will become a therapeutic target in cancers in the future.","['Wang, Yixin', 'Xiu, Jing', 'Ren, Chune', 'Yu, Zhenhai']","['Wang Y', 'Xiu J', 'Ren C', 'Yu Z']",,"['Department of Reproductive Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, Shandong Province, P.R.

Substantial research efforts are underway to develop new targets. The transferrin receptor (TfR) is prevalently expressed on rapidly proliferating tumor cells and holds the potential to be the alternative target. In order to investigate the efficacy and challenges of TfR-targeting on the CAR-based therapy strategy, we generated a TfR-specific CAR and established the TfR-CAR-modified T cells. To take the advantage of TfR being widely shared by multiple tumors, TfR-CAR T cells were assessed against several TfR(+) hematological malignant cell lines. Data showed that TfR-CAR T cells were powerfully potent in killing all these types of cells in vitro and in killing T-ALL cells in vivo. These findings suggest that TfR could be a universal target to broaden and improve the therapeutic efficacy of CAR T cells and warrant further efforts to use these cells as an alternative CAR T cell product for the therapy of hematological malignancies.","['Guo, Zilong', 'Zhang, Yirui', 'Fu, Mingpeng', 'Zhao, Liang', 'Wang, Zhen', 'Xu, Zhuoshuo', 'Zhu, Huifen', 'Lan, Xiaoli', 'Shen, Guanxin', 'He, Yong', 'Lei, Ping']","['Guo Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Fu M', 'Zhao L', 'Wang Z', 'Xu Z', 'Zhu H', 'Lan X', 'Shen G', 'He Y', 'Lei P']",,"['Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine and PET Center, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China."", 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine and PET Center, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210329,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC8039461,['NOTNLM'],"['*T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*alternative target', '*chimeric antigen receptor', '*hematological malignancies', '*transferrin receptor']",2021/04/16 06:00,2021/09/28 06:00,['2021/04/15 07:18'],"['2021/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/15 07:18 [entrez]', '2021/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.652924 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Mar 29;12:652924. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.652924. eCollection 2021.,20210927,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments/genetics/pharmacology', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Mice', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Guo, Zhang, Fu, Zhao, Wang, Xu, Zhu, Lan, Shen, He and Lei.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the outcome for patients with relapsed/refractory ALL remains unsatisfactory, despite the fact that these patients generally receive more intense therapy. Glucocorticoid (GC) resistance is a leading cause of treatment failure and relapse in ALL. Abnormal NR3C1 transcription and/or translation is strongly associated with GC resistance, but the underlying molecular mechanism and the clinical value of NR3C1 alterations with GC resistance in ALL treatment remain unclear. This study applied panel sequencing to 333 newly diagnosed and 18 relapsed ALL samples to characterize the link between NR3C1 and ALL further. We identified NR3C1 mutations in three patients with newly diagnosed ALL (0.9%) and two patients with relapsed ALL (11.1%). Functional analyses revealed that four of these five NR3C1 mutations (p. R477H, p. Y478C, p. P530fs, and p. H726P) were loss-of-function (LoF) mutations. A drug sensitivity test further showed that LoF NR3C1 mutations influence GC resistance. Saturated mutagenesis of hotspot R477 demonstrated the importance of this residue for NR3C1 function. The dominant-negative effect of p. R477C and p. R477S and the non-dominant negative effect of p. R477H and p. Y478C suggests multiple mechanisms underlying GC resistance. Thus, primary or acquired genomic lesions in NR3C1 may play a critical role in GC resistance and contribute to ALL treatment failure and/or relapse.","['Liu, Haiyan', 'Li, Ziping', 'Qiu, Fei', 'Li, Chunjie', 'Lin, Xiaojing', 'He, Yingyi', 'Qian, Maoxiang', 'Song, Yuanbin', 'Zhang, Hui']","['Liu H', 'Li Z', 'Qiu F', 'Li C', 'Lin X', 'He Y', 'Qian M', 'Song Y', 'Zhang H']",,"[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, China."", ""Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, China."", ""Bioinspired Engineering and Biomechanics Center, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, China."", ""Institute of Pediatrics and Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Fudan University, National Children's Medical Center, the Shanghai Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, International Co-laboratory of Medical Epigenetics and Metabolism, Ministry of Science and Technology, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210329,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,PMC8039513,['NOTNLM'],"['NR3C1', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'drug resistance', 'glucocorticoid', 'glucocorticoid receptor']",2021/04/16 06:00,2021/04/16 06:01,['2021/04/15 07:17'],"['2020/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/15 07:17 [entrez]', '2021/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2021.634956 [doi]', '634956 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2021 Mar 29;12:634956. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2021.634956. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Liu, Li, Qiu, Li, Lin, He, Qian, Song and Zhang.']",,,,,"['The authors have declared no competing interests.

This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of cardiac disorders in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) during chemotherapy. A retrospective case study was conducted in children with ALL, for whom electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography (Echo) were regularly assessed before each course of chemotherapy. The cardiac disorders were diagnosed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors associated with cardiac disorders. There were 171 children eligible for the study, and 78 patients (45.61%) were confirmed as having cardiac disorders. The incidence of cardiac disorders was dependent upon the cumulative dose of daunorubicin (DNR) (p = 0.030, OR = 1.553, 95% CI: 1.005-3.108). Four patients (2.34%) presented with palpitation, chest pain, and persistent tachycardia, and they were cured or improved after medical intervention. A total of 74 patients (43.27%) had subclinical cardiac disorders confirmed by ECG or Echo. ECG abnormalities were commonly seen in the induction and continuation treatments, including arrhythmias (26, 15.20%), ST changes (24, 14.04%) and conduction disorders (4, 2.34%). Pericardial effusion (14, 8.19%), left ventricular hypertrophy (11, 6.43%), a widened pulmonary artery (5, 2.92%) and valvular insufficiency (5, 2.92%) suggested by Echo occurred after induction chemotherapy. Therefore, cardiac disorders with clinical manifestations are rare and need early intervention. Subclinical cardiac disorders are common but very hidden in children during ALL chemotherapy. Regular ECG and Echo could help paediatricians to identify and monitor patients with asymptomatic cardiac disorders earlier.","['Yu, Hui', 'Qiu, Yining', 'Yu, Hui', 'Wang, Zhujun', 'Xu, Jiawei', 'Peng, Yun', 'Wan, Xia', 'Wu, Xiaoyan', 'Jin, Runming', 'Zhou, Fen']","['Yu H', 'Qiu Y', 'Yu H', 'Wang Z', 'Xu J', 'Peng Y', 'Wan X', 'Wu X', 'Jin R', 'Zhou F']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210329,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,PMC8039458,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cardiac disorders', 'chemotherapy', 'childhood', 'daunorubicin']",2021/04/16 06:00,2021/04/16 06:01,['2021/04/15 07:17'],"['2020/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/15 07:17 [entrez]', '2021/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2021.598708 [doi]', '598708 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2021 Mar 29;12:598708. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2021.598708. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Yu, Qiu, Yu, Wang, Xu, Peng, Wan, Wu, Jin and Zhou.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explored the associations between number of siblings in the household, birth order and survival from childhood acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). METHODS: In this nationwide register-based study we included all children aged 1-14, diagnosed with ALL and AML between 1991-mid-2015 in Sweden (n = 1692). Using Cox regression models, we estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) according to number of siblings and birth order, adjusting for known prognostic and sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: A tendency towards better ALL survival among children with one, or >/=2, siblings was observed, adjHRs (95% CI): 0.73 (0.49-1.10) and 0.63 (0.40-1.00), respectively. However, this was mainly limited to children with low risk profiles. An indication of better AML survival among children with siblings was seen, adjHRs (95% CI) 0.68 (0.36-1.29) and 0.71 (0.34-1.48) but diminished after adjusting for birth order. CONCLUSION: Our results do not support previous findings that a larger number of siblings is associated with poorer survival. Inconsistencies might be explained by underlying mechanisms that differ between settings, but chance cannot be ruled out.","['Mogensen, Hanna', 'Modig, Karin', 'Talback, Mats', 'Erdmann, Friederike', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Feychting, Maria', 'Tettamanti, Giorgio']","['Mogensen H', 'Modig K', 'Talback M', 'Erdmann F', 'Heyman M', 'Feychting M', 'Tettamanti G']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5195-8065', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9982-3300', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5210-7219']","['Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. hanna.mogensen@ki.se.', 'Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Childhood Cancer Epidemiology, Institute of Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (IMBEI), University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Environment and Lifestyle Epidemiology Branch, International Agency for Research on Cancer, World Health Organization, Lyon, France.', ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", 'Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210414,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,PMC8257570,,,2021/04/16 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/04/15 07:11'],"['2020/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2022/04/14 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/15 07:11 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41416-021-01374-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41416-021-01374-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2021 Jul;125(1):112-118. doi: 10.1038/s41416-021-01374-1.

The secondary objectives were one-year-overall survival rate (OS) and adverse effects. METHODS: This was a retrospective study conducted at Chiang Mai University Hospital. AML patients who achieved complete remission after 7 + 3 induction regimen and received consolidation therapy with either IDAC or HiDAC during January 2015 and January 2018 were eligible. Data about clinical characteristics, efficacy and safety of IDAC and HiDAC regimens were collected. RESULTS: Sixty-two AML patients were enrolled (30 patients in IDAC and 32 patients in the HiDAC regimen). The one-year RFS in the IDAC group was 63.33% and 46.87% in the HiDAC group (P = 0.137). The 1-year OS was 93.33% and 84.37% in the IDAC and HiDAC, respectively (P = 0.691). The duration of grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia was significantly shorter in IDAC than HiDAC (mean duration 14.69 vs. 23.84 days; P = 0.045). There was no significant difference in other parameters including hemoglobin nadir, absolute neutrophil count nadir, platelet nadir, febrile neutropenia, duration of grade 3-4 neutropenia, and duration of hospitalization. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in the one-year RFS and OS between IDAC and HiDAC. The IDAC regimen is an acceptable option for consolidation treatment in AML.","['Tangchitpianvit, Kittisak', 'Rattarittamrong, Ekarat', 'Chai-Adisaksopha, Chatree', 'Piriyakhuntorn, Pokpong', 'Rattanathammethee, Thanawat', 'Hantrakool, Sasinee', 'Tantiworawit, Adisak', 'Norasetthada, Lalita']","['Tangchitpianvit K', 'Rattarittamrong E', 'Chai-Adisaksopha C', 'Piriyakhuntorn P', 'Rattanathammethee T', 'Hantrakool S', 'Tantiworawit A', 'Norasetthada L']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2731-4889', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2223-5711']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Chiang-Mai University', 'consolidation therapy', 'high dose cytarabine', 'intermediate dose cytarabine', 'overall survival', 'relapse-free survival', 'thrombocytopenial']",2021/04/16 06:00,2021/06/08 06:00,['2021/04/15 05:38'],"['2021/04/15 05:38 [entrez]', '2021/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2021.1912949 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2021 Dec;26(1):355-364. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2021.1912949.,20210607,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy/adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate this hypothesis, we apply recent mode of action (MoA) and mechanistic information and modern data science techniques to quantify air benzene-urinary metabolite relationships in a previously studied data set for Tianjin, China factory workers. We find that physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) models and data for Tianjin workers show approximately linear production of benzene metabolites for air benzene (AB) concentrations below about 15 ppm, with modest sublinearity at low concentrations (e.g. below 5 ppm). Analysis of the Tianjin worker data using partial dependence plots reveals that production of metabolites increases disproportionately with increases in air benzene (AB) concentrations above 10 ppm, exhibiting steep sublinearity (J shape) before becoming saturated. As a consequence, estimated cumulative exposure is not an adequate basis for predicting risk. Risk assessments must consider the variability of exposure concentrations around estimated exposure concentrations to avoid over-estimating risks at low concentrations. The same average concentration for a specified duration is disproportionately risky if it has higher variance. Conversely, if chronic inflammation via activation of inflammasomes is a critical event for induction of MDS and other health effects, then sufficiently low concentrations of benzene are predicted not to cause increased risks of inflammasome-mediated diseases, no matter how long the duration of exposure. Thus, we find no evidence that the dose-response relationship is supra-linear at low doses; instead sublinear or zero excess risk at low concentrations is more consistent with the data. A combination of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, Bayesian network (BN) analysis and inference, and partial dependence plots appears a promising and practical approach for applying current data science methods to advance benzene risk assessment.","['Cox, Louis A Jr', 'Ketelslegers, Hans B', 'Lewis, R Jeffrey']","['Cox LA Jr', 'Ketelslegers HB', 'Lewis RJ']",,"['Cox Associates LLC, Denver, CO, USA.', 'Department of Business Analytics, University of Colorado, Denver, CO, USA.', 'Concawe Division, European Petroleum Refiners Association, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Concawe Division, European Petroleum Refiners Association, Brussels, Belgium.', 'ExxonMobil Biomedical Sciences, Inc, Clinton, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210415,England,Crit Rev Toxicol,Critical reviews in toxicology,8914275,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bayesian networks', '*Benzene metabolism', '*Chinese workers', '*PBPK model', '*machine learning', '*supralinearity']",2021/04/16 06:00,2021/08/04 06:00,['2021/04/15 05:37'],"['2021/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/04 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/15 05:37 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10408444.2020.1860903 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Toxicol. 2021 Feb;51(2):95-116. doi: 10.1080/10408444.2020.1860903.

Midostaurin was registered in combination with chemotherapy to treat newly diagnosed AML. Gilteritinib and quizartinib demonstrate effectiveness in a randomized trial in relapsed/refractory AML. Several promising FLT3 inhibitors are being evaluated in clinical research. AREAS COVERED: This review will report the safety of FLT3 inhibitors that are registered for acute myeloid leukemia induction and rescue therapy. EXPERT OPINION: In the near future, it is possible that all the FLT3 positive non M3-AML patients will receive a FLT3 inhibitor. Therapy adherence and strategies to mitigate adverse events must be pursued. The treatment with FLT3 inhibitors may be optimized in terms of toxicities with a rational evaluation of antifungal prophylaxis and concomitant therapy, cardiology monitoring, and keeping in mind rare adverse events. Future studies on unfit patients, special populations, and maintenance settings are warranted, together with post-market studies and real-life experiences. Whenever new FLT3 inhibitors will come to the clinic, we could face a scenario in which profound knowledge of effectiveness, toxicities, and off-target effects will be relevant to choose the best drug for each patient.","['Marconi, Giovanni', 'Giannini, Maria Benedetta', 'Bagnato, Gianmarco', 'Simonetti, Giorgia', 'Cerchione, Claudio', 'Mosquera Orgueira, Adrian', 'Musuraca, Gerardo', 'Martinelli, Giovanni']","['Marconi G', 'Giannini MB', 'Bagnato G', 'Simonetti G', 'Cerchione C', 'Mosquera Orgueira A', 'Musuraca G', 'Martinelli G']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6309-0515'],"['Istituto Romagnolo per Lo Studio Dei Tumori ""Dino Amadori"" - IRST, Meldola (FC), Italy.', 'Istituto Romagnolo per Lo Studio Dei Tumori ""Dino Amadori"" - IRST, Meldola (FC), Italy.', 'Istituto Romagnolo per Lo Studio Dei Tumori ""Dino Amadori"" - IRST, Meldola (FC), Italy.', 'Istituto Romagnolo per Lo Studio Dei Tumori ""Dino Amadori"" - IRST, Meldola (FC), Italy.', 'Istituto Romagnolo per Lo Studio Dei Tumori ""Dino Amadori"" - IRST, Meldola (FC), Italy.', 'Health Research Institute of Santiago De Compostela (IDIS), Santiago De Compostela, Spain.', 'Division of Hematology, Complexo Hospitalario Universitario De Santiago De Compostela (CHUS - SERGAS), Santiago De Compostela, Spain.', 'University of Santiago De Compostela, Santiago De Compostela, Spain.', 'Istituto Romagnolo per Lo Studio Dei Tumori ""Dino Amadori"" - IRST, Meldola (FC), Italy.', 'Istituto Romagnolo per Lo Studio Dei Tumori ""Dino Amadori"" - IRST, Meldola (FC), Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210414,England,Expert Opin Drug Saf,Expert opinion on drug safety,101163027,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'flt3', 'gilteritinib', 'midostaurin', 'quizartinib', 'safety', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2021/04/16 06:00,2021/08/14 06:00,['2021/04/15 05:37'],"['2021/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/15 05:37 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14740338.2021.1913120 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Saf. 2021 Jul;20(7):791-799. doi: 10.1080/14740338.2021.1913120.

Following the approval of the cedazuridine/decitabine combination, ASTX727, as well as development of an oral formulation of azacitidine, CC-486, in the USA in 2020, these agents could gradually replace their injectable counterparts. AREAS COVERED: ASTX727 is approved for the treatment of adult patients with intermediate 1 or high-risk MDS as well as those with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia based on the findings from the ASTX727-01-B and ASCERTAIN trials. Oral azacitidine (CC-486) is approved for maintenance treatment of acute myeloid leukemia after induction chemotherapy for patients unfit for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant based on the findings from the QUAZAR AML-001 trial. EXPERT OPINION: Oral hypomethylating agent formulations have the potential to offer a convenient alternative to injectable hypomethylating agent. However, their current FDA-approved indications are narrow and efficacy needs to be shown in clinical trials before considering use beyond the approved indications. Areas of special interest include: identification of predictive biomarkers for clinical benefit, post-transplant maintenance therapy, and potential combination therapies with other oral agents such as venetoclax, IDH and FLT3 inhibitors.","['Schiffer, Molly', 'Zhao, Jennifer', 'Johnson, Aubrey', 'Lee, Jane', 'Bewersdorf, Jan Philipp', 'Zeidan, Amer M']","['Schiffer M', 'Zhao J', 'Johnson A', 'Lee J', 'Bewersdorf JP', 'Zeidan AM']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3352-0902'],"['Department of Pharmacy, Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Yale University School of Medicine, and Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210428,England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,,['NOTNLM'],"['Azacitidine', 'cedazuridine', 'decitabine', 'oral hypomethylating agent']",2021/04/16 06:00,2021/04/16 06:00,['2021/04/15 05:36'],"['2021/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/15 05:36 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14737140.2021.1918002 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2021 Sep;21(9):989-1002. doi: 10.1080/14737140.2021.1918002.

B-cell lymphoma protein-2 (BCL2) overexpression is a common feature in hematologic malignancies. The selective BCL2 inhibitor, venetoclax (VEN) is used in combination with azacitidine (AZA), a DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi), to treat patients with AML. Despite promising response rates to VEN/AZA, resistance to the agent is common. One identified mechanism of resistance is the upregulation of myeloid cell leukemia-1 protein (MCL1). Pevonedistat (PEV), a novel agent that inhibits NEDD8-activating enzyme, and AZA both upregulate NOXA (PMAIP1), a BCL2 family protein that competes with effector molecules at the BH3 binding site of MCL1. We demonstrate that PEV/AZA combination induces NOXA to a greater degree than either PEV or AZA alone, which enhances VEN-mediated apoptosis. Herein, using AML cell lines and primary AML patient samples ex vivo, including in cells with genetic alterations linked to treatment resistance, we demonstrate robust activity of the PEV/VEN/AZA triplet. These findings were corroborated in preclinical systemic engrafted models of AML. Collectively, these results provide preclinical rational for combining PEV/VEN/AZA as a novel therapeutic approach in overcoming AML resistance current therapies.","['Cojocari, Dan', 'Smith, Brianna N', 'Purkal, Julie J', 'Arrate, Maria P', 'Huska, Jason D', 'Xiao, Yu', 'Gorska, Agnieszka', 'Hogdal, Leah J', 'Ramsey, Haley E', 'Boghaert, Erwin R', 'Phillips, Darren C', 'Savona, Michael R']","['Cojocari D', 'Smith BN', 'Purkal JJ', 'Arrate MP', 'Huska JD', 'Xiao Y', 'Gorska A', 'Hogdal LJ', 'Ramsey HE', 'Boghaert ER', 'Phillips DC', 'Savona MR']",,"['Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, Inc.', 'Department of Pediatrics; Medicine; Program in Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, Inc.', 'Medicine.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, Inc.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, Inc.', 'Medicine.', 'Precision Medicine, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Rd., North Chicago, IL 60064.', 'Medicine; Program in Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, Inc.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie, Inc.', 'Medicine; Program in Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine; Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center; Center for Immunobiology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232. michael.savona@vanderbilt.edu.']",['eng'],"['K12 CA090625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA217834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20210415,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,,,2021/04/16 06:00,2021/04/16 06:00,['2021/04/15 03:35'],"['2020/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/15 03:35 [entrez]', '2021/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3324/haematol.2020.272609 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Haematologica. 2021 Apr 15. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2020.272609.,,,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that quizartinib, a selective and potent FLT3 inhibitor, with azacitidine (AZA) or low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) might improve the outcomes in patients with FLT3-ITD-mutated AML. In this open-label phase I/II trial, patients of any age receiving first-salvage treatment for FLT3-ITD AML or age >60 years with untreated myelodysplastic syndrome or AML were treated with quizartinib plus AZA or LDAC. Seventy-three patients were treated (34 frontline, 39 first-salvage). Among previously untreated patients, composite response (CRc) was achieved in 13/15 (87%, 8 CR, 4 Cri, 1 CRp) treated with quizartinib/AZA and 14/19 (74%, 1 CR, 8 CRi, 5 CRp) in quizartinib/LDAC. The median OS was 19.2 months for quizartinib/AZA and 8.5 months for quizartinib/LDAC cohort; RFS was 10.5 and 6.4 months, respectively.

Although circ_0004136 has been found to play a crucial role in AML, our understanding of its molecular mechanism remains very limited. The levels of circ_0004136, miR-570-3p and tetraspanin 3 (TSPAN3) were determined by quantitative real-time PCR or western blot. Cell viability, migration, invasion, cell cycle and apoptosis were detected using the Cell Counting Kit-8, transwell and flow cytometry assays. Targeted relationships among circ_0004136, miR-570-3p and TSPAN3 were validated by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Our data showed that circ_0004136 could be transmitted by exosomes, and exosomal circ_0004136 was highly expressed in AML serum and cells. Circ_0004136 was unusually stable and mainly localized in the cytoplasm. Circ_0004136 knockdown mediated by exosomes hampered AML cell viability, cell cycle progression, migration and invasion, and promoted cell apoptosis. Moreover, circ_0004136 worked as a sponge of miR-570-3p and TSPAN3 was a functional target of miR-370-3p in AML cells. The suppression of circ_0004136 knockdown mediated by exosomes on AML cell malignant progression was reversed by miR-570-3p downregulation, and the increased miR-570-3p expression hindered the progression of aggressive AML by downregulating TSPAN3. Furthermore, circ_0004136 worked as a miR-570-3p sponge to modulate TSPAN3 expression. Our findings identified a novel regulatory mechanism in which exosome-mediated circ_0004136 knockdown restrained AML cell malignant progression at least partly through targeting the miR-570-3p/TSPAN3 axis, highlighting a novel therapeutic strategy for AML management.","['Bi, Jing', 'Pu, Yuanlin', 'Yu, Xinqiao']","['Bi J', 'Pu Y', 'Yu X']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Central Hospital of Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Enshi, Hubei, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,,,,2021/04/15 06:00,2022/01/15 06:00,['2021/04/14 20:16'],"['2021/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/14 20:16 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CAD.0000000000001068 [doi]', '00001813-900000000-98428 [pii]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2021 Sep 1;32(8):802-811. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000001068.,20220114,"['0 (MIRN570 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Circular)', '0 (Tetraspanins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Exosomes', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*drug effects', 'RNA, Circular/*pharmacology', 'Tetraspanins/*drug effects']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, if deprived of competent progenitors, the thymus can temporarily maintain thymopoiesis autonomously. This bears a heavy cost, because prolongation of thymus autonomy causes leukemia. Here, we show that, at an early stage, thymus autonomy relies on double-negative 3 early (DN3e) thymocytes that acquire stem-cell-like properties. Following competent progenitor deprivation, DN3e thymocytes become long lived, are required for thymus autonomy, differentiate in vivo, and include DNA-label-retaining cells. At the single-cell level, the transcriptional programs of thymopoiesis in autonomy and the steady state are similar. However, a new cell population emerges in autonomy that expresses an aberrant Notch target gene signature and bypasses the beta-selection checkpoint. In summary, DN3e thymocytes have the potential to self-renew and differentiate in vivo if cell competition is impaired, but this generates atypical cells, probably the precursors of leukemia.","['Paiva, Rafael A', 'Sousa, Antonio G G', 'Ramos, Camila V', 'Avila, Mariana', 'Lilue, Jingtao', 'Paixao, Tiago', 'Martins, Vera C']","['Paiva RA', 'Sousa AGG', 'Ramos CV', 'Avila M', 'Lilue J', 'Paixao T', 'Martins VC']",,"['Lymphocyte Development and Leukemogenesis Laboratory, Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Oeiras 2780-156, Portugal.', 'Bioinformatics Unit, Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Oeiras 2780-156, Portugal.', 'Lymphocyte Development and Leukemogenesis Laboratory, Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Oeiras 2780-156, Portugal.', 'Lymphocyte Development and Leukemogenesis Laboratory, Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Oeiras 2780-156, Portugal.', 'Bioinformatics Unit, Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Oeiras 2780-156, Portugal.', 'Quantitative and Digital Science Unit, Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Oeiras 2780-156, Portugal.', 'Lymphocyte Development and Leukemogenesis Laboratory, Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Oeiras 2780-156, Portugal.

Partial epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with metastasis; however, a causal connection needs further unraveling. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing and genetic mouse models to identify the functional roles of partial EMT and epithelial stabilization in PDAC growth and metastasis. A global EMT expression signature identifies approximately 50 cancer cell clusters spanning the epithelial-mesenchymal continuum in both human and murine PDACs. The combined genetic suppression of Snail and Twist results in PDAC epithelial stabilization and increased liver metastasis. Genetic deletion of Zeb1 in PDAC cells also leads to liver metastasis associated with cancer cell epithelial stabilization. We demonstrate that epithelial stabilization leads to the enhanced collective migration of cancer cells and modulation of the immune microenvironment, which likely contribute to efficient liver colonization. Our study provides insights into the diverse mechanisms of metastasis in pancreatic cancer and potential therapeutic targets.","['Carstens, Julienne L', 'Yang, Sujuan', 'Correa de Sampaio, Pedro', 'Zheng, Xiaofeng', 'Barua, Souptik', 'McAndrews, Kathleen M', 'Rao, Arvind', 'Burks, Jared K', 'Rhim, Andrew D', 'Kalluri, Raghu']","['Carstens JL', 'Yang S', 'Correa de Sampaio P', 'Zheng X', 'Barua S', 'McAndrews KM', 'Rao A', 'Burks JK', 'Rhim AD', 'Kalluri R']",,"['Department of Cancer Biology, Metastasis Research Center, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77054, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Metastasis Research Center, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77054, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Metastasis Research Center, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77054, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Metastasis Research Center, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77054, USA.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Metastasis Research Center, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77054, USA.', 'Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48105, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, Division of Cancer Medicine, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77054, USA.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Division of Internal Medicine, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77054, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Metastasis Research Center, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77054, USA; Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

To improve the treatment approaches, new specific molecules are needed.

G4s are considered as targets for the development of anticancer agents. Heterocyclic molecules are well known to target and stabilize G4 structures. Thus, a new series of 2,9-bis[(substituted-aminomethyl)phenyl]-1,10-phenanthroline derivatives (1a-i) was designed, synthesized, and evaluated against five human myeloid leukemia cell lines (K562, KU812, MV4-11, HL60, and U937).

TPW shows up to 10-fold increase in fluorescence upon binding with c-KIT1 G4, but shows weak or no quantifiable binding to other G4s and ds26 DNA. TPW can increase the number of G4-specific antibody (BG4) foci and mark G4 structures in cancer cells.

Thirdhand smoke (THS) is the residual tobacco contamination that remains after the smoke clears. We investigated the effects of THS exposure in utero and during early life in a transgenic Cdkn2a knockout mouse model that is vulnerable to the development of leukemia/lymphoma. Female mice, and their offspring, were exposed from the first day of pregnancy to weaning. Plasma cytokines, body weight and hematologic parameters were measured in the offspring. To investigate THS exposure effects on the development of leukemia/lymphoma, bone marrow (BM) was collected from control and THS-exposed mice and transplanted into BM-ablated recipient mice, which were followed for tumor development for 1 year. We found that in utero and early-life THS exposure caused significant changes in plasma cytokine concentrations and in immune cell populations; changes appeared more pronounced in male mice. Spleen (SP) and BM B-cell populations were significantly lower in THS-exposed mice. We furthermore observed that THS exposure increased the leukemia/lymphoma-free survival in BM transplantation recipient mice, potentially caused by THS-induced B-cell toxicity. A trend towards increased solid tumors in irradiated mice reconstituted with THS-exposed BM stimulates the hypothesis that the immunosuppressive effects of in utero and early-life THS exposure might contribute to carcinogenesis by lowering the host defense to other toxic exposures. Our study adds to expanding evidence that THS exposure alters the immune system and that in utero and early-life developmental periods represent vulnerable windows of susceptibility for these effects.","['Snijders, Antoine M', 'Zhou, Mi', 'Whitehead, Todd P', 'Fitch, Briana', 'Pandey, Priyatama', 'Hechmer, Aaron', 'Huang, Abel', 'Schick, Suzaynn F', 'de Smith, Adam J', 'Olshen, Adam B', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Mao, Jian-Hua', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Kogan, Scott C']","['Snijders AM', 'Zhou M', 'Whitehead TP', 'Fitch B', 'Pandey P', 'Hechmer A', 'Huang A', 'Schick SF', 'de Smith AJ', 'Olshen AB', 'Metayer C', 'Mao JH', 'Wiemels JL', 'Kogan SC']",,"['Biological Systems and Engineering Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, U.S.A.', 'School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, U.S.A.', 'Center for Genetic Epidemiology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, U.S.A.', 'UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA, U.S.A.', 'Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, U.S.A.', 'UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA, U.S.A.', 'Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, U.S.A.', 'Center for Genetic Epidemiology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, U.S.A.', 'UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, U.S.A.', 'School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA, U.S.A.', 'Biological Systems and Engineering Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, U.S.A.', 'Center for Genetic Epidemiology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, U.S.A.', 'UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA, U.S.A.']",['eng'],['P50 ES018172/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,England,Clin Sci (Lond),"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",7905731,PMC8086195,['NOTNLM'],"['*immunology', '*leukemia', '*lymphoma', '*thirdhand smoke']",2021/04/15 06:00,2021/04/15 06:00,['2021/04/14 08:38'],"['2020/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/01 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/14 08:38 [entrez]']","['228332 [pii]', '10.1042/CS20201498 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Sci (Lond). 2021 Apr 30;135(8):1053-1063. doi: 10.1042/CS20201498.,20211022,"['0 (Smoke)', '0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Immune System/*drug effects', 'Leukemia/*etiology/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*etiology/immunology', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Smoke/*adverse effects', 'Tobacco/*adverse effects', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/adverse effects/analysis']","['(c) 2021 The Author(s).

It is important to identify these cases as they show beneficial response to retinoids and favourable prognosis. We herein present a rare case of cryptic APL negative by FISH and conventional cytogenetics but positive for PML-RARA by PCR.","['Arumugam, Jhansi Rani', 'Karthik Bommannan, B K', 'Kalaiyarasi, Jayachandran Perumal', 'Sundersingh, Shirley']","['Arumugam JR', 'Karthik Bommannan BK', 'Kalaiyarasi JP', 'Sundersingh S']",,"['Department of Oncopathology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Adyar, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Oncopathology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Adyar, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Adyar, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Oncopathology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Adyar, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,India,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,7605904,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'cryptic acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha']",2021/04/15 06:00,2021/10/07 06:00,['2021/04/14 08:37'],"['2021/04/14 08:37 [entrez]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJPatholMicrobiol_2021_64_2_406_313288 [pii]', '10.4103/IJPM.IJPM_409_20 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Pathol Microbiol. 2021 Apr-Jun;64(2):406-409. doi: 10.4103/IJPM.IJPM_409_20.,20211006,"['0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (NCAM1 protein, human)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['CD56 Antigen/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Early Detection of Cancer/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha/genetics']",,,,,,['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical characteristics and underlying genetic mutation status of CCTL are poorly understood. From 2012 to 2017, patients pathologically diagnosed with CCTL in our hospital were investigated and analyzed based on clinical manifestations, pathological characteristics, prognosis and full gene mutation status through next generation sequencing (NGS) technology. During a 6-year period, four eligible patients were diagnosed with CCTL through surgical resection and were included in this study. All patients showed solitary nodules or lumps located in the left lung. The average maximum diameter of lesions was 2.5 +/- 1.1 cm. Computed tomography (CT) imaging characteristics of these nodules/lumps demonstrated the features of benign tumors. The hematoxylin-eosin (HE) morphology and immunohistochemistry were consistent with the histopathological features of benign CCTL. Subsequent NGS analysis showed frame shift mutations of F2421/E2419, K1466E mutation, and p. 1450_1456 deletion mutation in mTOR gene in two of four patient samples and amplifications of MCL1 were observed in three of four samples. CCTL is a rare type of primary pulmonary mesenchymal tumor with good prognosis. Preliminary diagnosis on CT is usually sclerosing pneumocytoma. It is still unclear whether the occurrence and development of the disease are related to specific gene mutation. In this study, the genomic findings of frame shift mutation of mTOR genes and amplification of MCL1 gene in CCTL suggest that these mutations might play a role in proliferation of CCTL.","['Wu, Shibo', 'Pan, Deng', 'Chen, Weizhuang', 'Ren, Feng', 'Zheng, Dawei', 'Liu, Kaitai']","['Wu S', 'Pan D', 'Chen W', 'Ren F', 'Zheng D', 'Liu K']",,"['Department of Respiratory Medicine, Lihuili Hospital, Ningbo Medical Center, Ningbo, China.', 'Department of Diagnosis, Ningbo Diagnostic Pathology Center, Ningbo, China.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Lihuili Hospital, Ningbo Medical Center, Ningbo, China.', 'Department of Medical Imaging, Lihuili Hospital, Ningbo Medical Center, Ningbo, China.', 'Department of Cardio-Thoracic, Lihuili Hospital, Ningbo Medical Center, Ningbo, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Lihuili Hospital, Ningbo Medical Center, Ningbo, China.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,India,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,7605904,,['NOTNLM'],"['CT imaging', 'MCL1 mutation', 'mTOR mutation', 'pathology', 'prognosis', 'sugar cell tumor']",2021/04/15 06:00,2021/10/07 06:00,['2021/04/14 08:37'],"['2021/04/14 08:37 [entrez]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJPatholMicrobiol_2021_64_2_362_313331 [pii]', '10.4103/IJPM.IJPM_65_19 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Pathol Microbiol. 2021 Apr-Jun;64(2):362-368. doi: 10.4103/IJPM.IJPM_65_19.,20211006,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '9005-79-2 (Glycogen)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma, Clear Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Female', 'Frameshift Mutation/genetics', 'Gene Amplification/genetics', 'Glycogen/metabolism', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,,,,,['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tracking of increasing quantitative polymerase chain reaction MRD before cytomorphological reappearance of blasts may instigate individual management decisions and has paved the way for development of pre-emptive treatment strategies to substantially delay or perhaps even revert leukaemic regrowth. Traditionally, MRD monitoring is performed using repeated bone marrow aspirations, albeit the current European LeukemiaNet MRD recommendations acknowledge the use of peripheral blood as an alternative source for MRD assessment. Persistent MRD positivity in the bone marrow despite continuous morphological remission is frequent in both core binding factor leukaemias and nucleophosmin 1-mutated AML. In contrast, monthly assessment of MRD in peripheral blood superiorly separates patients with imminent haematological relapse from long-term remitters and may allow pre-emptive therapy of AML relapse.","['Skou, Anne-Sofie', 'Juul-Dam, Kristian Lovvik', 'Ommen, Hans B', 'Hasle, Henrik']","['Skou AS', 'Juul-Dam KL', 'Ommen HB', 'Hasle H']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3859-9544', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0028-8115', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3976-9231']","['Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20210413,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*measurable residual disease', '*molecular relapse', '*pre-emptive therapy', '*quantitative polymerase chain reaction']",2021/04/15 06:00,2021/12/24 06:00,['2021/04/14 06:47'],"['2021/03/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/14 06:47 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.17449 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2021 Nov;195(3):310-327. doi: 10.1111/bjh.17449.

However, despite the high initial response rate, the majority of adult patients with B-ALL progress after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. Data on the natural history, management, and outcome of adult B-ALL progressing after CD19 CAR T cells have not been described in detail. Herein, we report comprehensive data of 38 adult patients with B-ALL who progressed after CD19 CAR T therapy at our institution. The median time to progression after CAR T-cell therapy was 5.5 months. Median survival after post-CAR T progression was 7.5 months. A high disease burden at the time of CAR T-cell infusion was significantly associated with risk of post-CAR T progression. Thirty patients (79%) received salvage treatment of post-CAR T disease progression, and 13 patients (43%) achieved complete remission (CR), but remission duration was short. Notably, 7 (58.3%) of 12 patients achieved CR after blinatumomab and/or inotuzumab administered following post-CAR T failure. Multivariate analysis revealed that a longer remission duration from CAR T cells was associated with superior survival after progression following CAR T-cell therapy. In summary, overall prognosis of adult B-ALL patients progressing after CD19 CAR T cells was poor, although a subset of patients achieved sustained remissions to salvage treatments, including blinatumomab, inotuzumab, and reinfusion of CAR T cells. Novel therapeutic strategies are needed to reduce risk of progression after CAR T-cell therapy and improve outcomes of these patients.","['Wudhikarn, Kitsada', 'Flynn, Jessica R', 'Riviere, Isabelle', 'Gonen, Mithat', 'Wang, Xiuyan', 'Senechal, Brigitte', 'Curran, Kevin J', 'Roshal, Mikhail', 'Maslak, Peter G', 'Geyer, Mark B', 'Halton, Elizabeth F', 'Diamonte, Claudia', 'Davila, Marco L', 'Sadelain, Michel', 'Brentjens, Renier J', 'Park, Jae H']","['Wudhikarn K', 'Flynn JR', 'Riviere I', 'Gonen M', 'Wang X', 'Senechal B', 'Curran KJ', 'Roshal M', 'Maslak PG', 'Geyer MB', 'Halton EF', 'Diamonte C', 'Davila ML', 'Sadelain M', 'Brentjens RJ', 'Park JH']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9528-8681', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8310-6684', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7363-3963', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8683-8477', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5248-9117', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6270-3065', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9031-8025', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2903-5130']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Research Unit in Translational Hematology, Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology.', 'Cell Therapy and Cell Engineering Center.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology.', 'Cell Therapy and Cell Engineering Center.', 'Cell Therapy and Cell Engineering Center.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Pediatrics.', 'Cellular Therapeutics Center.', 'Department of Pediatrics.', 'Hematopathology Service, Department of Pathology.', 'Immunology Laboratory Service, Department of Laboratory Medicine, and.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell College of Medicine, New York, NY.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell College of Medicine, New York, NY.', 'Cellular Therapeutics Center.', 'Cellular Therapeutics Center.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H.

AML with FLT3-ITD usually presents with poor treatment outcomes, high recurrence rate and short overall survival. Currently, polymerase chain reaction and capillary electrophoresis are widely adopted for the clinical detection of FLT3-ITD, whereas the length and mutation frequency of ITD are evaluated using fragment analysis. With the development of sequencing technology and the high incidence of FLT3-ITD mutations, a multitude of bioinformatics tools and pipelines have been developed to detect FLT3-ITD using next-generation sequencing data. However, systematic comparison and evaluation of the methods or software have not been performed. In this study, we provided a comprehensive review of the principles, functionality and limitations of the existing methods for detecting FLT3-ITD.

However, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is also mediated by these cells. Here, we assessed the effect of attenuating TCR-mediated SLP76:ITK interaction in GVL vs. GVHD effects after allo-HSCT. CD8(+) and CD4(+) donor T cells from mice expressing a Y145F mutation in SLP-76 did not cause GVHD but preserved GVL effects against B-ALL cells. SLP76Y145FKI CD8(+) and CD4(+) donor T cells also showed less inflammatory cytokine production and migration to GVHD target organs. We developed a novel peptide to specifically inhibit SLP76:ITK interactions, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of PLCgamma1 and ERK, decreased cytokine production in human T cells, and separation of GVHD from GVL effects. Altogether, our data suggest that inhibiting SLP76:ITK interaction could be a therapeutic strategy to separate GVHD from GVL effects after allo-HSCT treatment.","['Mammadli, Mahinbanu', 'Huang, Weishan', 'Harris, Rebecca', 'Xiong, Hui', 'Weeks, Samuel', 'May, Adriana', 'Gentile, Teresa', 'Henty-Ridilla, Jessica', 'Waickman, Adam T', 'August, Avery', 'Bah, Alaji', 'Karimi, Mobin']","['Mammadli M', 'Huang W', 'Harris R', 'Xiong H', 'Weeks S', 'May A', 'Gentile T', 'Henty-Ridilla J', 'Waickman AT', 'August A', 'Bah A', 'Karimi M']",,"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, 766 Irving Avenue, Weiskotten Hall Suite 2281, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA.', 'Department of Pathobiological Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA 70803, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, 766 Irving Avenue, Weiskotten Hall Suite 2281, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Jiangxi Health Vocational College, Nanchang, 330052, China.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, 766 Irving Avenue, Weiskotten Hall Suite 2281, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, 766 Irving Avenue, Weiskotten Hall Suite 2281, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, translational research, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse NY 13210, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, 766 Irving Avenue, Weiskotten Hall Suite 2281, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, 766 Irving Avenue, Weiskotten Hall Suite 2281, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA.']",['eng'],"['K22 AI130182/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 GM138097/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20210311,United States,iScience,iScience,101724038,PMC8024657,['NOTNLM'],"['Immunology', 'Molecular Biology']",2021/04/15 06:00,2021/04/15 06:01,['2021/04/14 06:37'],"['2020/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/14 06:37 [entrez]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.isci.2021.102286 [doi]', 'S2589-0042(21)00254-6 [pii]']",epublish,iScience. 2021 Mar 11;24(4):102286. doi: 10.1016/j.isci.2021.102286. eCollection 2021 Apr 23.,,,,,['(c) 2021 The Authors.'],,,,,"['A.A. receives research support from 3M Corporation.

One needs to consider rigorous experimental procedures and mathematical models to make the results of this type of test comparable. The present paper will discuss previously published results to further investigate the statistical modeling of the dielectric properties of human blood. The analysis shows that previously published results were related to Modified Weibull (MW) distributions of relaxation times, not Gaussian distributions, as reported. This re-analysis prevents the ill definition of fitting parameters, making sure they present physically justifiable values. Besides, for fluids presenting a Modified Weibull distribution of relaxation times, novel exact and closed-form expressions for the real and imaginary parts of complex permittivities were obtained in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions. Also, a high accuracy approximation was built for the imaginary part of the complex permittivity, creating an easy-to-use alternative expression for practitioners. The new results are used to fit experimental results for human blood, showing that more robust estimators are built for the parameters involved, which can be used as thresholds to classify the dielectric behavior of blood as normal (healthy) or anomalous (sick).","['Sodhi, Charandeep Singh', 'Ozelim, Luan Carlos de Sena Monteiro', 'Rathie, Pushpa Narayan']","['Sodhi CS', 'Ozelim LCSM', 'Rathie PN']",,"['University of Texas at Dallas, Dallas, USA.', 'Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Brasilia, Brasilia, Brazil.', 'Department of Statistics, University of Brasilia, Brasilia, Brazil.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210326,England,Heliyon,Heliyon,101672560,PMC8022844,['NOTNLM'],"['Blood', 'Debye', 'Gaussian distribution', 'Relaxation', 'Weibull distribution']",2021/04/15 06:00,2021/04/15 06:01,['2021/04/14 06:37'],"['2021/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/02 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/14 06:37 [entrez]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06606 [doi]', 'S2405-8440(21)00709-X [pii]']",epublish,Heliyon. 2021 Mar 26;7(3):e06606. doi: 10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06606. eCollection 2021 Mar.,,,,,['(c) 2021 The Authors.'],,,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Importantly, our recent report indicated that thyroid hormone receptor interactor 13 (TRIP13) is a potential new therapeutic target in CLL. In this study, we predicted 20 TRIP13-related genes and found that KIAA0101 is a novel gene that regulates cell proliferation and the cell cycle of CLL cells. Methods: CD19(+) B cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of 26 CLL patients and 6 healthy donors through magnetic cell sorting. Cell proliferation was assessed by the CCK-8 assay. The mRNA and protein levels of genes were examined through RT-qPCR and western blot assays, respectively. Cell cycle and cell apoptosis were measured through Annexin V-based flow cytometry and the caspase 3/7 activity assay. Potential targets of KIAA0101 were identified through microarray analysis. 20 TRIP13 related genes was predicted by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). KIAA0101-regulated functions and molecular pathways were predicted through IPA. Results: KIAA0101 knockdown had the strongest inhibitory effect on CLL cell proliferation among the 20 TRIP13-related genes. KIAA0101 was highly expressed in CD19(+) B cells of CLL patients. KIAA0101 knockdown induced cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis, and inhibited FOXO1, MYD88, and TLR4 expression in CLL cells. Conclusions: Taken together, we demonstrated that KIAA0101 plays a critical role in cell proliferation and the cell cycle of human CLL cells. KIAA0101 knockdown induced cell apoptosis, and reduced FOXO1, MYD88, and TLR4 expression, and may therefore be used as a therapeutic target of CLL.","['Zhang, Qing', 'Yuan, Jingjing', 'Liu, Yanyan', 'Liu, Xingchen', 'Lv, Tianxin', 'Zhou, Keshu', 'Song, Yongping']","['Zhang Q', 'Yuan J', 'Liu Y', 'Liu X', 'Lv T', 'Zhou K', 'Song Y']",,"['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Ann Transl Med,Annals of translational medicine,101617978,PMC8039647,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', 'KIAA0101', 'apoptosis', 'cycle', 'proliferation']",2021/04/15 06:00,2021/04/15 06:01,['2021/04/14 06:35'],"['2021/04/14 06:35 [entrez]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/atm-21-626 [doi]', 'atm-09-06-487 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Transl Med. 2021 Mar;9(6):487. doi: 10.21037/atm-21-626.,,,,,['2021 Annals of Translational Medicine.

However, no effective therapies for SCI currently exist. Methods: To identify and analyze SCI subtypes, we obtained the expression profile data of the 1,057 genes (889 intersection genes) in GSE45550 using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and 14 co-expression gene modules were identified. Next, we filtered out the network degree top 10 (degree >80) genes, considered the final key SCI genes. A multifactor regulatory network (105 interaction pairs), consisting of messenger RNAs (mRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and transcription factors (TFs) was constructed. This network was involved in the co-expression of key genes. We selected the top 10 regulatory factors (degree >4) as core regulators in the multifactor regulatory network. Results: The results of functional enrichment analysis of the target gene expressing the core regulatory factor [1,059] showed that these target genes were enriched in pathways for human cytomegalovirus infection, chronic myeloid leukemia, and pancreatic cancer. Further, we used the key genes in the co-expression network to categorize the SCI samples in GSE45550. The expression levels of the top 6 genes (CCNB2, CCNB1, CKS2, COL5A1, KIF20A, and RACGAP1) may act as potential marker genes for different SCI subtypes. On the basis of these different subtypes, 8 SCI core gene CDK1-associated drugs were also found to provide potential therapeutic options for SCI. Conclusions: These results may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of SCI.","['Chen, Qi', 'Zhao, Ziru', 'Yin, Guoyong', 'Yang, Chuanjun', 'Wang, Danfeng', 'Feng, Zhi', 'Ta, Na']","['Chen Q', 'Zhao Z', 'Yin G', 'Yang C', 'Wang D', 'Feng Z', 'Ta N']",,"['Department of Orthopedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Anting Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Anting Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Anting Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Nursing Management, Anting Hospital, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Ann Transl Med,Annals of translational medicine,101617978,PMC8039699,['NOTNLM'],"['Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)', 'differential gene expression analysis', 'disease subtypes', 'multi-factor regulatory network']",2021/04/15 06:00,2021/04/15 06:01,['2021/04/14 06:35'],"['2021/04/14 06:35 [entrez]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/atm-21-340 [doi]', 'atm-09-06-466 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Transl Med. 2021 Mar;9(6):466. doi: 10.21037/atm-21-340.,,,,,['2021 Annals of Translational Medicine.

Methods: We evaluated whether the detection of promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) can serve as a specific and sensitive marker for PBC diagnosis. Liver biopsies from 26 PBC patients, 20 primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), 37 viral hepatitis, 11 non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and 5 normal patients were investigated after immunostaining with the anti-PML monoclonal PG-M3, IgG1 antibody. Results: Immunoreactivity in bile ducts was expressed by the PML-score (quotient of positive ducts to the total number of portal tracts multiplied by 2). PML-score was higher in PBC as compared to controls (P < 0.001). Using a cutoff of 0.18, PML-score proved highly sensitive (84.6%) and specific (89.7%) for confirming PBC as compared to only 5% of PSC, 9.1% of NASH and 13.5% of viral hepatitis patients (P < 0.001). Irrespective of the underlying disease, patients with PML-score > 0.18 were older (P = 0.007), more often females (P < 0.001) with higher ALP (P < 0.001), gamma-GT (P = 0.001) and IgM (P < 0.001) compared to the patients with PML-score < 0.18. Conclusions: We postulate that a simple PML immunohistochemical test could be sufficient for histopathological discrimination of PBC in problematic cases of undefined cholestatic disorders, including small-duct PSC and AMA-negative PBC cases.","['Papamichalis, Panagiotis A', 'Zachou, Kalliopi', 'Papamichali, Roidoula A', 'Ioannou, Maria', 'Gatselis, Nikolaos K', 'Dalekos, George N', 'Koukoulis, George K']","['Papamichalis PA', 'Zachou K', 'Papamichali RA', 'Ioannou M', 'Gatselis NK', 'Dalekos GN', 'Koukoulis GK']",,"['Department of Pathology, Medical School, University of Thessaly, 41110 Larissa, Greece.', 'Department of Medicine and Research Laboratory of Internal Medicine, National Expertise Center of Greece in Autoimmune Liver Diseases, General University Hospital of Larissa, 41110 Larissa, Greece.', 'Department of Medicine and Research Laboratory of Internal Medicine, National Expertise Center of Greece in Autoimmune Liver Diseases, General University Hospital of Larissa, 41110 Larissa, Greece.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical School, University of Thessaly, 41110 Larissa, Greece.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical School, University of Thessaly, 41110 Larissa, Greece.', 'Department of Medicine and Research Laboratory of Internal Medicine, National Expertise Center of Greece in Autoimmune Liver Diseases, General University Hospital of Larissa, 41110 Larissa, Greece.', 'Department of Medicine and Research Laboratory of Internal Medicine, National Expertise Center of Greece in Autoimmune Liver Diseases, General University Hospital of Larissa, 41110 Larissa, Greece.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical School, University of Thessaly, 41110 Larissa, Greece.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210331,Poland,J Transl Int Med,Journal of translational internal medicine,101673826,PMC8016348,['NOTNLM'],"['anti-PML antibodies', 'anti-nuclear antibodies', 'immunohistochemical staining', 'primary biliary cholangitis', 'primary sclerosing cholangitis']",2021/04/15 06:00,2021/04/15 06:01,['2021/04/14 06:35'],"['2021/04/14 06:35 [entrez]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2478/jtim-2021-0008 [doi]', 'jtim-2021-0008 [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Int Med. 2021 Mar 31;9(1):43-51. doi: 10.2478/jtim-2021-0008. eCollection 2021 Mar.,,,,,"['(c) 2021 Panagiotis A.

Sinonasal involvement in MS is rarer and meagerly studied. Recent prospective studies have underlined the importance of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in disease assessment and relapse detection in extramedullary (EM) AML. Herein, we report a case of MS with sinonasal, orbital, dural, breast, pleural extent of disease with sacral neural foraminal compression. Initial histopathologic and clinicoradiologic features had pointed toward lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on the contrary revealed MS. Although the role of IHC in asserting the diagnosis of MS is remarkable, PET/CT surpasses other modalities in early detection of EM sites of involvement, overall assessment of disease burden, targeting therapy, prognostication, and relapse recognition. Inclusion of PET/CT as a baseline imaging modality can be beneficial in tailoring patient management to improve survival and overall quality of life.","['Mathew, Shema', 'Muthukrishnan, Indirani', 'Simon, Shelley']","['Mathew S', 'Muthukrishnan I', 'Simon S']",,"['Department of Nuclear Medicine and PET/CT, Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine and PET/CT, Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine and PET/CT, Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20200722,Austria,World J Nucl Med,World journal of nuclear medicine,101286955,PMC8034787,['NOTNLM'],"['Immunohistochemistry', 'positron emission tomography in extramedullary acute myeloid leukemia', 'positron emission tomography in myeloid sarcoma', 'sinonasal myeloid sarcoma']",2021/04/15 06:00,2021/04/15 06:01,['2021/04/14 06:32'],"['2020/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/14 06:32 [entrez]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/wjnm.WJNM_36_20 [doi]', 'WJNM-20-109 [pii]']",epublish,World J Nucl Med. 2020 Jul 22;20(1):109-112. doi: 10.4103/wjnm.WJNM_36_20. eCollection 2021 Jan-Mar.,,,,,['Copyright: (c) 2020 World Journal of Nuclear Medicine.'],,,,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed 45 known cancer predisposition genes (CPGs) in germline samples of 202 patients with hematological malignancies (HMs) plus one or more other independent cancer managed at major tertiary medical centers on two different continents. This included 120 patients with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MNs), where the HM occurred after cytotoxic treatment for a first malignancy, and 82 patients with multiple cancers in which the HM was not preceded by cytotoxic therapy (MC-HM). Using American College of Medical Genetics/Association for Molecular Pathology variant classification guidelines, 13% of patients had PGVs, most frequently identified in CHEK2 (17% of PGVs), BRCA1 (13%), DDX41 (13%), and TP53 (7%). The frequency of PGVs in MC-HM was higher than in t-MN, although not statistically significant (18 vs. 9%; p = 0.085). The frequency of PGVs in lymphoid and myeloid HM patients was similar (19 vs. 17.5%; p > 0.9). Critically, patients with PGVs in BRCA1, BRCA2 or TP53 did not satisfy current clinical phenotypic criteria for germline testing. Our data suggest that a personal history of multiple cancers, one being a HM, should trigger screening for PGVs.","['Singhal, Deepak', 'Hahn, Christopher N', 'Feurstein, Simone', 'Wee, Li Yan A',

We have developed a bioinformatic pipeline for the integrated analysis of transcription factor binding and transcriptomic data to identify transposon-derived promoters that are activated in specific diseases and developmental states. We applied this pipeline to a breast cancer model, and found that the L1PA2 transposon subfamily contributes abundant regulatory sequences to co-ordinated transcriptional regulation in breast cancer. Transcription factor profiling demonstrates that over 27% of L1PA2 transposons harbour co-localised binding sites of functionally interacting, cancer-associated transcription factors in MCF7 cells, a cell line used to model breast cancer. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that L1PA2 transposons also contribute transcription start sites to up-regulated transcripts in MCF7 cells, including some transcripts with established oncogenic properties. In addition, we verified the utility of our pipeline on other transposon subfamilies, as well as on leukemia and lung carcinoma cell lines. We demonstrate that the normally quiescent regulatory activities of transposons can be activated and alter the cancer transcriptome. In particular, the L1PA2 subfamily contributes abundant regulatory sequences, and likely plays a global role in modulating breast cancer transcriptional regulation. Understanding the regulatory impact of L1PA2 on breast cancer genomes provides additional insights into cancer genome regulation, and may provide novel biomarkers for disease diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.","['Jiang, Jiayue-Clara', 'Rothnagel, Joseph A', 'Upton, Kyle R']","['Jiang JC', 'Rothnagel JA', 'Upton KR']",,"['School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, The University of Queensland, St Lucia, QLD, 4072, Australia.', 'School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, The University of Queensland, St Lucia, QLD, 4072, Australia.', 'School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, The University of Queensland, St Lucia, QLD, 4072, Australia. k.upton@uq.edu.au.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210413,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC8044218,,,2021/04/15 06:00,2021/11/05 06:00,['2021/04/14 06:09'],"['2020/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/14 06:09 [entrez]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-021-86395-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-021-86395-9 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2021 Apr 13;11(1):8083. doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-86395-9.,20211104,['0 (Transcription Factors)'],IM,"['*Breast Neoplasms', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Transcription Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, low-frequency SNVs are hard to distinguish from sequencing artifacts. While the increasing availability of multi-sample tumor DNA sequencing data holds the potential for more accurate variant calling, there is a lack of high-sensitivity multi-sample SNV callers that utilize these data. Here we report Moss, a method to identify low-frequency SNVs that recur in multiple sequencing samples from the same tumor. Moss provides any existing single-sample SNV caller the ability to support multiple samples with little additional time overhead. We demonstrate that Moss improves recall while maintaining high precision in a simulated dataset. On multi-sample hepatocellular carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia and colorectal cancer datasets, Moss identifies new low-frequency variants that meet manual review criteria and are consistent with the tumor's mutational signature profile. In addition, Moss detects the presence of variants in more samples of the same tumor than reported by the single-sample caller. Moss' improved sensitivity in SNV calling will enable more detailed downstream analyses in cancer genomics.","['Zhang, Chuanyi', 'El-Kebir, Mohammed', 'Ochoa, Idoia']","['Zhang C', 'El-Kebir M', 'Ochoa I']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6359-0904', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1468-2407', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1864-7868']","['Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA.', 'Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA. melkebir@illinois.edu.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA. idoia@illinois.edu.', 'Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Navarra, Tecnun, San Sebastian, Spain. idoia@illinois.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20210413,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,PMC8044184,,,2021/04/15 06:00,2021/04/29 06:00,['2021/04/14 06:01'],"['2020/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/14 06:01 [entrez]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-021-22466-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-021-22466-9 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2021 Apr 13;12(1):2204. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-22466-9.,20210428,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nucleotides)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genomics/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Liver Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Mutation', '*Nucleotides', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",,['figshare/10.6084/m9.figshare.14079953'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that treating BCL-2-dependent neuroblastoma cells with the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax results in apoptosis, but unfortunately partial therapy resistance is observed. The current study describes the identification of drugs capable of resensitizing venetoclax-resistant neuroblastoma cells to venetoclax. To examine these effects, venetoclax resistance was induced in BCL-2-dependent neuroblastoma cell lines KCNR and SJNB12 by continuous exposure to high venetoclax concentrations. Non-resistant and venetoclax-resistant neuroblastoma cell lines were exposed to a 209-compound library in the absence and presence of venetoclax to identify compounds that were more effective in the venetoclax-resistant cell lines under venetoclax pressure. Top hits were further validated in combination with venetoclax using BCL-2-dependent neuroblastoma model systems. Overall, high-throughput drug screening identified the MDM2 inhibitor idasanutlin as a promising resensitizing agent for venetoclax-resistant neuroblastoma cell lines. Idasanutlin treatment induced BAX-mediated apoptosis in venetoclax-resistant neuroblastoma cells in the presence of venetoclax, whereas it caused p21-mediated growth arrest in control cells. In vivo combination treatment showed tumor regression and superior efficacy over single-agent therapies in a BCL-2-dependent neuroblastoma cell line xenograft and a patient-derived xenograft. However, xenografts less dependent on BCL-2 were not sensitive to venetoclax-idasanutlin combination therapy. This study demonstrates that idasanutlin can overcome resistance to the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax in preclinical neuroblastoma model systems, which supports clinical development of a treatment strategy combining the two therapies.","['Vernooij, Lindy', 'Bate-Eya, Laurel T', 'Alles, Lindy K', 'Lee, Jasmine Y', 'Koopmans, Bianca', 'Jonus, Hunter C', 'Schubert, Nil A', 'Schild, Linda', 'Lelieveld, Daphne', 'Egan, David A', 'Kerstjens, Mark', 'Stam, Ronald W', 'Koster, Jan', 'Goldsmith, Kelly C', 'Molenaar, Jan J', 'Dolman, M Emmy M']","['Vernooij L', 'Bate-Eya LT', 'Alles LK', 'Lee JY', 'Koopmans B', 'Jonus HC', 'Schubert NA', 'Schild L', 'Lelieveld D', 'Egan DA', 'Kerstjens M', 'Stam RW', 'Koster J', 'Goldsmith KC', 'Molenaar JJ', 'Dolman MEM']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1835-6297', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5427-5710', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6971-5387', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0890-7585']","['Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center at the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center at the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Cell Biology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Cell Biology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Oncogenomics, Amsterdam UMC, location AMC, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center at the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands. memdolman@gmail.com.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Center, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],['91716482/None'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210413,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,PMC7611269,,,2021/04/15 06:00,2021/04/15 06:00,['2021/04/14 05:53'],"['2020/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/14 05:53 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-20-0666 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-20-0666 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2021 Jun;20(6):1161-1172. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-20-0666.

A timely diagnosis of infections can have a major impact on outcomes. Tools that help rule out infectious causes of fever can decrease antibiotic use, toxicities, hospitalization costs, and potentially decrease antibiotic resistance in the long term. We retrospectively evaluated the ability of cell-free DNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing in the timely identification of pathogenic microorganisms and its impact on the antimicrobial management of immunocompromised patients with hematologic malignancies. In the period between 2018 to 2020, 95 samples were reviewed, of which 31 adult patients (32 tests) had hematologic malignancies or were recipients of SCT. The NGS tests were performed in the following patients: (a) patients with prolonged fever and negative conventional tests, (b) persistent fever despite positive conventional test and appropriate antimicrobials, and (c) fever-free patients with imaging suspicious for infection. The median time from fever to NGS sampling was 5 days (range, 1-28). The median time to NGS results was 2 days (range, 1-6). The NGS resulted in an escalation of antibiotics in 28% of cases (9/32) and de-escalation of antibiotics in 31% of cases (10/32). Overall, NGS testing changed management in nearly 59% (19/32) of patients. The sensitivity and specificity of NGS to detect clinically significant infection was 80% and 58%, respectively. The test identified uncommon and difficult to diagnose organisms such as Nocardia, Legionella, Toxoplasma and Pneumocystis jirovecii resulting in rapid antimicrobial interventions. In conclusion, in patients with HM or SCT recipients, microbial cell-free DNA sequencing allowed rapid and actionable treatment. This strategy can target appropriate antibiotic use, avoid overtreatment, and potentially decrease the hospital length-of-stay.","['Yu, James', 'Diaz, Juan D', 'Goldstein, Steven C', 'Patel, Rushang D', 'Varela, Juan C', 'Reyenga, Caralyn', 'Smith, Megan', 'Smith, Tori', 'Balls, Jason', 'Ahmad, Sarfraz', 'Mori, Shahram']","['Yu J', 'Diaz JD', 'Goldstein SC', 'Patel RD', 'Varela JC', 'Reyenga C', 'Smith M', 'Smith T', 'Balls J', 'Ahmad S', 'Mori S']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, AdventHealth Cancer Institute, Orlando, Florida.', 'Section of Infectious Disease, AdventHealth Cancer Institute, Orlando, Florida.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Center, AdventHealth Cancer Institute, Orlando, Florida.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Center, AdventHealth Cancer Institute, Orlando, Florida.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Center, AdventHealth Cancer Institute, Orlando, Florida.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Center, AdventHealth Cancer Institute, Orlando, Florida.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Center, AdventHealth Cancer Institute, Orlando, Florida.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Center, AdventHealth Cancer Institute, Orlando, Florida.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Center, AdventHealth Cancer Institute, Orlando, Florida.', 'Gynecologic Oncology Program, AdventHealth Cancer Institute, Orlando, Florida.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Center, AdventHealth Cancer Institute, Orlando, Florida.

The current study demonstrates that APP signals to the nucleus causing the generation of aggregates consisting of its adapter protein FE65, the histone acetyltransferase TIP60 and the tumour suppressor proteins p53 and PML. APP C-terminal (APP-CT50) complexes co-localize and co-precipitate with p53 and PML. The PML nuclear body generation is induced and fusion occurs over time depending on APP signalling and STED imaging revealed active gene expression within the complex. We further show that the nuclear aggregates of APP-CT50 fragments together with PML and FE65 are present in the aged human brain but not in cerebral organoids differentiated from iPS cells. Notably, human Alzheimer's disease brains reveal a highly significant reduction of these nuclear aggregates in areas with high plaque load compared to plaque-free areas of the same individual. Based on these results we conclude that APP-CT50 signalling to the nucleus takes place in the aged human brain and is involved in the pathophysiology of AD.","['Marks, David', 'Heinen, Natalie', 'Bachmann, Lisa', 'Meermeyer, Sophia', 'Werner, Michelle', 'Gallego, Lucia', 'Hemmerich, Peter', 'Bader, Verian', 'Winklhofer, Konstanze F', 'Schroder, Elisabeth', 'Knauer, Shirley K', 'Muller, Thorsten']","['Marks D', 'Heinen N', 'Bachmann L', 'Meermeyer S', 'Werner M', 'Gallego L', 'Hemmerich P', 'Bader V', 'Winklhofer KF', 'Schroder E', 'Knauer SK', 'Muller T']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0173-3412'],"['Department of Molecular Biochemistry, Cell Signalling, Faculty of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Biochemistry, Cell Signalling, Faculty of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Biochemistry, Cell Signalling, Faculty of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Biochemistry, Cell Signalling, Faculty of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Biochemistry, Cell Signalling, Faculty of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Biochemistry, Cell Signalling, Faculty of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute On Aging Research, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Pathobiochemistry, Medical Faculty, Ruhr-University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Pathobiochemistry, Medical Faculty, Ruhr-University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Biology II, Center of Medical Biotechnology (ZMB), University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Biology II, Center of Medical Biotechnology (ZMB), University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Biochemistry, Cell Signalling, Faculty of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany. thorsten.t.mueller@rub.de.', 'Institute of Psychiatric Phenomics and Genomics (IPPG), University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany. thorsten.t.mueller@rub.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210413,England,Acta Neuropathol Commun,Acta neuropathologica communications,101610673,PMC8042982,['NOTNLM'],"['*3D culture', '*APP-CT50', ""*Alzheimer's disease"", '*Amyloidogenic plaques', '*HSV', '*Human brain', '*IPSC-derived cerebral organoids', '*Nuclear complexes', '*PML', '*Viral defence']",2021/04/15 06:00,2021/11/11 06:00,['2021/04/14 05:42'],"['2021/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/14 05:42 [entrez]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40478-021-01174-x [doi]', '10.1186/s40478-021-01174-x [pii]']",epublish,Acta Neuropathol Commun. 2021 Apr 13;9(1):66. doi: 10.1186/s40478-021-01174-x.,20211110,"['0 (Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hippocampus/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Organoids', 'Plaque, Amyloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Fabaceae) has many therapeutic properties and anticancer potential. OBJECTIVE: The cytotoxic activities of standardized extracts and a fraction from fenugreek seeds and their compounds (sapogenins, flavone C-glycosides, alkaloid trigonelline) against human cancer SKOV-3, HeLa and MOLT-4 cells were evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fenugreek seeds were extracted with 70% methanol (A) or water (B). Furthermore, the seeds were purified with petroleum ether and chloroform and next extracted with methanol to obtain fraction (C). The quantitative analysis of saponins and flavonoids in the extracts was done with HPLC methods. The extracts (5-120 microg/mL) and compounds (1-50 microg/mL) were tested on the cells by MTT assay and RTCA system. The effect of a fraction on ROS production, mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase-3/7 activity in HeLa and SKOV-3 cells was also evaluated by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The strongest cytotoxic activity on cancer cells showed the fraction C (IC50 was 3.91 +/- 0.03 for HeLa, 3.97 +/- 0.07 for SKOV-3, and 7.75 +/- 0.37 for MOLT-4) with the highest content of steroidal saponins (163.18 +/- 11.03 mug/mg) and flavone C-glycosides (820.18 +/- 0.05 mug/mg). The fraction significantly increased ROS production (up to four times higher than in keratinocytes as control) and caspases activity in the cells. The examined flavonoids did not exhibit the cytotoxic activity in contrast to yamogenin, tigogenin, and diosgenin. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results complement the data on the cytotoxic activity of Foenugraeci Semen and synergistic effect of flavonoids and saponins complex contained in the plant.","['Stefanowicz-Hajduk, Justyna', 'Krol-Kogus, Barbara', 'Sparzak-Stefanowska, Barbara', 'Kimel, Katarzyna', 'Ochocka, J Renata', 'Krauze-Baranowska, Miroslawa']","['Stefanowicz-Hajduk J', 'Krol-Kogus B', 'Sparzak-Stefanowska B', 'Kimel K', 'Ochocka JR', 'Krauze-Baranowska M']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8904-7774', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5003-9048', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9658-0553', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6112-4707', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4424-3667', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0344-7401']","['Department of Biology and Pharmaceutical Botany, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy with Medicinal Plants Garden, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy with Medicinal Plants Garden, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy with Medicinal Plants Garden, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Biology and Pharmaceutical Botany, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy with Medicinal Plants Garden, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Pharm Biol,Pharmaceutical biology,9812552,PMC8057092,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer cells', 'RTCA', 'Trigonella foenum-graecum', 'flavone C-glycosides', 'steroidal saponins']",2021/04/15 06:00,2021/11/19 06:00,['2021/04/14 05:30'],"['2021/04/14 05:30 [entrez]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/13880209.2021.1903047 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Biol. 2021 Dec;59(1):424-437. doi: 10.1080/13880209.2021.1903047.,20211118,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Saponins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'HaCaT Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Plant Extracts/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Saponins/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Secondary Metabolism', 'Seeds', 'Trigonella/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/drug therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Primary HLH (pHLH) has hereditary genetic defects, and secondary HLH (sHLH) is caused by a variety of underlying diseases. Here, we report the case of a patient with aggressive natural killer cell leukemia and HLH-related gene defects who achieved long-term survival after treatment. A 20-year-old man presented to our hospital with symptoms of fever and fatigue. Investigations revealed splenomegaly, cytopenia, hyperferritinemia, hypofibrinogenemia, elevated levels of soluble CD25 (sCD25), and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow. Bone marrow flow cytometry showed 23.4% abnormal natural killer cells, the cells were CD2, CD7, CD16, CD94, NKG2A positive, met the diagnosis of aggressive NK-Cell leukemia. Investigation of the patient's pedigree revealed that mutations of pHLH-related genes (LYST and UNC13D) were inherited from his father and mother, but neither of the parents had the disease. The patient received hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT), after which he achieved complete remission. As of 2020-10-19, the patient's survival has exceeded 3 years, and he has returned to his normal life. A variety of factors contribute to the onset of HLH, and this case gives greater insight into the etiology of HLH. Allogeneic HSCT is a key treatment for HLH patients with underlying genetic mutations.","['Zhuo, Weibin', 'Hao, Dan', 'Tong, Yong', 'Wu, Wei', 'Bao, Shijie', 'Huang, Kaikai', 'Ling, Yu', 'Zhu, Huamin', 'Sun, Zhiqiang']","['Zhuo W', 'Hao D', 'Tong Y', 'Wu W', 'Bao S', 'Huang K', 'Ling Y', 'Zhu H', 'Sun Z']",,"['Department of Hematology, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China. zhqsun69@163.com.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,China,Ann Palliat Med,Annals of palliative medicine,101585484,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)', 'aggressive NK-cell leukemia', 'hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT)']",2021/04/15 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2021/04/14 01:00'],"['2020/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/14 01:00 [entrez]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.21037/apm-21-68 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Palliat Med. 2021 Mar;10(3):3518-3523. doi: 10.21037/apm-21-68.,20210514,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (UNC13D protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow', 'Fever', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective registry-based analysis of clinical outcomes and immune reconstitution was conducted for 105 AYAs and 187 children with acute leukemia who underwent single-unit CBT using myeloablative conditioning (MAC) without antithymocyte globulin (ATG). RESULTS: Outcomes were similar between AYAs and children, except for nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and recovery rates of neutrophils and platelets. The 30-day cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment was similar between AYAs and children, but children had faster rates of neutrophil and platelet recovery than AYAs. The median time to neutrophil engraftment was earlier in children than in AYAs (AYAs, 19 days, 95% confidence interval [CI] 17.3-21.7; children, 16 days, 95% CI 13.1-19.5, p = 0.00003). The incidence of platelet recovery on day 120 was higher in children than in AYAs (AYAs, 80%, 95% CI 71-81%; children, 88%, 95% CI 82-92%, p = 0.037). CD34+ cell dose was the only independent factor influencing both neutrophil and platelet recovery. The cumulative incidence of NRM at 2 years was higher among AYAs than among children (AYAs, 27.5%, 95% CI 20-37%; children, 15%, 95% CI 10-21%, p = 0.008). Conditioning regimen was an independent factor influencing NRM. With respect to immune reconstitution, natural killer cell counts quickly recovered to normal levels 1-month post-CBT in both children and AYAs. CD8+ T-cell counts were higher in children than in AYAs at 1 and 3 months post-CBT. CD4+ T-cell counts were similar in both children and AYAs after CBT. CONCLUSION: AYAs with acute leukemia have outcomes of single-unit CBT using MAC without ATG that are as good as those of children. Thus, single-unit CBT using modified MAC without ATG is an acceptable choice for both AYAs and children who do not have a suitable donor.","['Zhang, Xuhan', 'Liu, Huilan', 'Zheng, Changcheng', 'Tang, Baolin', 'Zhu, Xiaoyu', 'Wan, Xiang', 'Tong, Juan', 'Yao, Wen', 'Song, Kaidi', 'Sun, Zimin']","['Zhang X', 'Liu H', 'Zheng C', 'Tang B', 'Zhu X', 'Wan X', 'Tong J', 'Yao W', 'Song K', 'Sun Z']",,"['Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20210413,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Adolescents and young adults', 'Cord blood transplantation', 'Myeloablative conditioning']",2021/04/14 06:00,2021/11/18 06:00,['2021/04/13 20:31'],"['2019/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/18 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/13 20:31 [entrez]']","['000507973 [pii]', '10.1159/000507973 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2021;144(5):569-579. doi: 10.1159/000507973.

The objective was to determine whether TE during treatment was associated with overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study using the Cancer in Young People-Canada registry. Children <15 years of age were diagnosed with de novo ALL (2000-2016). The primary exposure variable was radiologically-confirmed thrombo-embolism requiring medical intervention. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to determine the impact of thrombo-embolism on survival, where TE was time-dependent. We included 2006 children (median age: 4 years, 88.5% precursor B-cell ALL). Thrombo-embolism occurred in 113 patients (5.6%), at a median time of 107 days (interquartile range: 35-184 days) after ALL diagnosis. Among standard/low-risk patients, 41/1165 (3.5%) developed TE while among high/very high-risk patients, 72/841 (8.6%) developed TE. Patients with TE had a significantly worse OS (adjusted HR [aHR] of death: 2.61, 95% CI: 1.62-4.22, p < 0.001) and EFS (aHR of an event [death, relapse, second malignancy]: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.35-3.05, p = 0.001), compared with patients without TE.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been considered as one of the most promising prophylaxis for severe GVHD. However, there are no prospective or retrospective studies determining whether they can work synergistically on GVHD. To investigate the potential influence of KIR matching and MSCs, and their synergism on aGVHD and cGVHD after allo-HSCT in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Data from 104 patients with AML and 50 patients with ALL treated with allo-HSCT in the transplantation unit were retrospectively analyzed. KIR genotyping was performed by the PCR-SSO method. The amplicons were quantified on the Luminex 200 flow analyzer and analyzed using the Quick-Type for Lifecodes software to generate KIR data. Cox proportional hazards models were used in multivariate analyses. KIR receptor-ligand matching was associated with an increased risk of grade II-IV aGVHD compared to KIR receptor-ligand mismatching (p < 0.001) in AML patients, but KIR ligand-mismatching had no significant effect on aGVHD or cGVHD in ALL patients. In contrast, MSCs reduced the incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD in both AML and ALL patients (AML: p = 0.006; ALL: p = 0.008) regardless of KIR mismatching. The combination of KIR receptor-ligand mismatch and MSC transplantation significantly suppressed grade II-IV aGVHD occurrence in AML patients (p = 0.039). In the KIR mismatch group, the incidence of aGVHD was 2.8% in patients receiving MSC compared to 14.6% in those who did not (p = 0.047). KIR receptor-ligand mismatch, MSC transplantation and their combined use significantly reduced the risk of aGVHD after allo-HSCT. These data provide a clinically applicable strategy to reduce aGVHD, thus improving allo-HSCT outcome.","['Zhang, Yu', 'Zheng, Hao', 'Ren, Jinhua', 'Luo, Xiaofeng', 'Zheng, Zhihong', 'Zheng, Jing', 'Zheng, Xiaoyun', 'Chen, Yi', 'Chen, Zhizhe', 'Hu, Jianda', 'Yang, Ting']","['Zhang Y', 'Zheng H', 'Ren J', 'Luo X', 'Zheng Z', 'Zheng J', 'Zheng X', 'Chen Y', 'Chen Z', 'Hu J', 'Yang T']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4438-2544', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2451-5864']","['Department of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.']",['eng'],"['81570162/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81700131/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81870138/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2017Y9017/Fujian Provincial Department of Science and Technology', '2017Y9056/Fujian Provincial Department of Science and Technology', '2017Y9104/Fujian Provincial Department of Science and Technology', '2018J01312/Fujian Provincial Department of Science and Technology', '2018Y0031/Fujian Provincial Department of Science and Technology', '2020J011033/Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province', '2017Y9017/Joint Funding Projects for Scientific and Technological Innovation']",['Journal Article'],20210413,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor', 'mesenchymal stem cells']",2021/04/14 06:00,2021/08/18 06:00,['2021/04/13 12:23'],"['2021/03/20 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/13 12:23 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2867 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2021 Aug;39(3):380-389. doi: 10.1002/hon.2867.

METHODS: A French population-based sample with full job history (N = 10,010) was linked with four Matgene job-exposure matrices: flour, cement, silica and benzene. LOEP and the 95% confidence interval were estimated using four methods: the maximum exposure probability during the career (Proba_max), two methods subdividing careers into job-periods (job-period_M1, job-period_M2) and one into job-years (job-year). To quantify differences between methods, percentages of variation were calculated for proportion values and PAF, and compared with published results for France using cross-sectional proportion multiplied by a factor. RESULTS: For each agent, LOEP estimated from the maximum probability during the career (Proba_max) was consistently lower than proportion taking account of job-periods or job-years. LOEP on Proba_max for flour, cement, silica and benzene were, respectively, 4.4% 95% CI (4.0-4.7), 4.3% (3.9-4.6), 6.1% (5.7-6.5) and 3.9% (3.6-4.2). Percentage of variation ranged from 0 to 55.8% according to the agent. The number of cancer cases varied by a twofold factor for exposure to silica and lung cancer and by a fourfold factor for exposure to benzene and acute myeloid lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides a description of several LOEP estimation methods based on exposure assessment over the entire career and describes their impact on PAF. For health monitoring purposes, we recommend to report a range of LOEP with low and high estimates obtained using job-periods (job-period_M1 and job-period_M2).","['Houot, Marie-Tulin', 'Homere, Julie', 'Goulard, Helene', 'Garras, Loic', 'Delabre, Laurene', 'Pilorget, Corinne']","['Houot MT', 'Homere J', 'Goulard H', 'Garras L', 'Delabre L', 'Pilorget C']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7203-4598'],"[""Sante Publique France, The French National Public Health Agency, 12 rue du val d'osne, 94415, Saint-Maurice, France. marie.houot@santepubliquefrance.fr."", 'Sante Publique France, The French National Public Health Agency, 33076, Bordeaux, France.', 'Sante Publique France, The French National Public Health Agency, 33076, Bordeaux, France.', ""Sante Publique France, The French National Public Health Agency, 12 rue du val d'osne, 94415, Saint-Maurice, France."", ""Sante Publique France, The French National Public Health Agency, 12 rue du val d'osne, 94415, Saint-Maurice, France."", 'Sante Publique France, The French National Public Health Agency, 69373, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210413,Germany,Int Arch Occup Environ Health,International archives of occupational and environmental health,7512134,,['NOTNLM'],"['Job-exposure matrix (JEM)', 'Lifetime occupational exposure proportion', 'Population-attributable fraction (PAF)', 'Prevalence', 'Statistical method']",2021/04/14 06:00,2021/09/24 06:00,['2021/04/13 12:15'],"['2020/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/13 12:15 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00420-021-01691-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00420-021-01691-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Int Arch Occup Environ Health. 2021 Oct;94(7):1537-1547. doi: 10.1007/s00420-021-01691-1.

In our opinion, this now enables introduction of markers for more dynamic parameters, such as proliferative and (anti)apoptotic markers, which have proven their value in the field of histopathology in the diagnostic process of solid tumors and lymphoma. Although use of proliferative and (anti)apoptotic markers as objective parameters in the diagnostic process of myeloid malignancies was studied in the past decades, this did not result in the incorporation of these biomarkers into clinical diagnosis. This review addresses the potential of these markers for implementation in the current, state-of-the-art multiparameter analysis of myeloid malignancies. The reviewed studies clearly recognize the importance of proliferation and apoptotic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of bone marrow (BM) malignancies. The literature is, however, contradictory on the role of these processes in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasms, and acute myeloid leukemia. Furthermore, several studies underline the need for the analysis of the proliferative and apoptotic rates in subsets of hematopoietic BM cell lineages and argue that these results can have diagnostic and prognostic value in patients with myeloid malignancies. Recent developments in multiparameter flow cytometry now allow quantification of proliferative and (anti)apoptotic indicators in myeloid cells during their different maturation stages of separate hematopoietic cell lineages. This will lead to a better understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of these malignancies.","['Mestrum, Stefan G C', 'Hopman, Anton H N', 'Ramaekers, Frans C S', 'Leers, Math P G']","['Mestrum SGC', 'Hopman AHN', 'Ramaekers FCS', 'Leers MPG']",,"['Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, Zuyderland Medical Centre, Sittard-Geleen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, GROW School for Oncology and Developmental Biology, Maastricht University Medical Centre, Maastricht, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, GROW School for Oncology and Developmental Biology, Maastricht University Medical Centre, Maastricht, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, GROW School for Oncology and Developmental Biology, Maastricht University Medical Centre, Maastricht, The Netherlands; and.', 'Nordic-MUbio, Susteren, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, Zuyderland Medical Centre, Sittard-Geleen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC8045496,,,2021/04/14 06:00,2021/06/01 06:00,['2021/04/13 12:13'],"['2020/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/13 12:13 [entrez]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(21)00257-3 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020004094 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2021 Apr 13;5(7):2040-2052. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020004094.,20210531,,IM,"['Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis', '*Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases', '*Myeloproliferative Disorders']",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the impact of both of these aspects on prognosis in pediatric ALL. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the combined use of blood blast count and platelet count could predict event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) when minimal residual disease (MRD) detection was not available.A total of 419 patients aged 0 to 14 years diagnosed and treated for ALL between 2011 and 2015 were enrolled.Patients with a blast count >/=0.1 x 109/L on day 8 exhibited significantly lower survival rates than that in those with blast counts <0.1 x 109/L. The EFS and OS in patients with platelet count >/=100 x 109/L on day 33 were significantly higher than those with platelet counts <100 x 109/L. In univariate and multivariate analyses, patients with low blast count on day 8 and high platelet count on day 33 were significantly associated with better EFS and OS. The combination of blast cell count on day 8 and platelet count on day 33 demonstrated a strong association with MRD-based risk stratification.Complete blood count is an inexpensive, easy to perform, and reliable measurement in children with ALL. The combination of blast count and platelet count during and after induction chemotherapy was a significant and independent prognostic factor for treatment outcome in pediatric ALL.","['Dai, Qingkai', 'Shi, Rui', 'Zhang, Ge', 'Yang, Hui', 'Wang, Yuefang', 'Ye, Lei', 'Peng, Luyun', 'Guo, Siqi', 'He, Jiajing', 'Jiang, Yongmei']","['Dai Q', 'Shi R', 'Zhang G', 'Yang H', 'Wang Y', 'Ye L', 'Peng L', 'Guo S', 'He J', 'Jiang Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0487-1888'],"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University.', 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University.', 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University.', 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University.', 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University.', 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University.', 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University.', 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University.', 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University.', 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University.', 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,PMC8051997,,,2021/04/14 06:00,2021/04/20 06:00,['2021/04/13 12:12'],"['2020/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/13 12:12 [entrez]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000025548 [doi]', '00005792-202104160-00078 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2021 Apr 16;100(15):e25548. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000025548.,20210419,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Blood Cell Count/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Platelet Count/*statistics & numerical data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

Cardiac metastasis from a tongue cancer is a rare finding and only a few cases have been reported previously in the literature. In this case report and literature review, we discuss the main clinical features of patients with cardiac metastases secondary to a tongue cancer and imaging modalities performed, especially the 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT). PATIENT CONCERNS: This is a case of a 39-year-old woman who in April 2018 was diagnosed with an invasive well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the movable tongue. She underwent a left hemiglossectomy followed by a revision of hemiglossectomy and ipsilateral selective neck lymph nodes dissection levels II to III because of pathological margins. An early inoperable clinical recurrence was diagnosed and she received radiochemotherapy with good clinical and metabolic response. She remained asymptomatic thereafter. DIAGNOSIS: In January 2020, a pre-scheduled 18F-FDG PET/CT showed a diffuse cardiac involvement. In February 2020, a biopsy of the lesion revealed a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. INTERVENTIONS: She was deemed to not be a cardiac surgical candidate and treated by palliative chemotherapy: taxol-carboplatin associated with cetuximab then cetuximab alone because of adverse effects. A re-evaluation imaging performed in April 2020 evidenced a progression of the cardiac involvement, which led to switch chemotherapy by immunotherapy with nivolumab. OUTCOMES: This patient had a very poor prognosis and succumbed to major heart failure 4 months after the diagnosis of cardiac metastasis. CONCLUSION: In this case report, 18F-FDG PET/CT proved to be useful in detecting cardiac metastasis and changed the therapeutic management of the patient. It suggests that patients with tongue malignancies in a context of poor initial prognosis should be followed-up early by 18F-FDG PET/CT with HFLC diet to facilitate detection of recurrence.","['Delabie, Pierre', 'Evrard, Diane', 'Zouhry, Ilyass', 'Ou, Phalla', 'Rouzet, Francois', 'Benali, Khadija', 'Piekarski, Eve']","['Delabie P', 'Evrard D', 'Zouhry I', 'Ou P', 'Rouzet F', 'Benali K', 'Piekarski E']",,"['Department of Nuclear Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Bichat.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Department of Radiology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Bichat, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Inserm 1148, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Bichat.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Bichat.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Bichat.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,PMC8052045,,,2021/04/14 06:00,2021/04/20 06:00,['2021/04/13 12:12'],"['2021/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/13 12:12 [entrez]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000025529 [doi]', '00005792-202104160-00073 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2021 Apr 16;100(15):e25529. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000025529.,20210419,"['0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '0Z5B2CJX4D (Fluorodeoxyglucose F18)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*diagnostic imaging/secondary', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', '*Fluorodeoxyglucose F18', 'Heart Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/secondary', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Medical Illustration', 'Neck Dissection', 'Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography/*methods', '*Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Tongue/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Tongue Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/pathology']","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

PATIENTS CONCERNS: A 54-year-old female patient presented to our hospital in March 2018 with symptoms of easy fatigability. DIAGNOSIS: Bone marrow aspiration was hypercellular showing 67.2% blasts mainly including moderate myeloblasts and monoblasts. There was mild dysplasia with some cells having round, oval, or bizarre nuclei which containing 1 to 3 nucleolus. Erythroid lineage was hypoplasia and mature erythrocytes were generally normal. Conventional cytogenetics of bone marrow cells revealed complex karyotype (44, XX, del (5) (q14q34) del (5) (q14q34), del (14) t (11;14) (q10; q10), -16, del (17), -18[10]). INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with second line chemotherapy but did not respond. QUTCOMES: She died of cardiopulmonary failure 19days after starting of therapy. LESSONS: This unexpected and relatively uncommon occurrence was associated with a universally rapid and fatal clinical course with survival measured in <2 months despite intensive chemotherapy. We call attention to this rare phenomenon because it may pose a diagnostic challenge.","['Ji, Jiamei', 'Li, Yating', 'Fan, Lei', 'Lu, Hua', 'Qu, Xiaoyan']","['Ji J', 'Li Y', 'Fan L', 'Lu H', 'Qu X']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0863-5417'],"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['81302040/Innovative Research Group Project of the National Natural Science', 'Foundation of China']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,PMC8052012,,,2021/04/14 06:00,2021/04/20 06:00,['2021/04/13 12:12'],"['2021/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/13 12:12 [entrez]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000025528 [doi]', '00005792-202104160-00072 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2021 Apr 16;100(15):e25528. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000025528.,20210419,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/pathology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/complications/*diagnosis', 'Medical Illustration', 'Middle Aged']","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

Dysregulation of these chemical networks is linked to the emergence of diseases. Our research goal is to develop abiotic chemical catalysts that can intervene into life's chemical networks by complementing, surrogating, or exceeding enzymes in living cells or multicellular organisms such as animals or plants. Mending dysregulated networks in pathological states by the chemical catalysts will lead to a new medicinal strategy, catalysis medicine. This research direction will also advance catalysis science, because highly active and selective chemical catalysts must be developed to promote the intended reactions in a complex mixture of life in aqueous solution at body temperature.Epigenetics exists at the crossroads of chemistry, biology, and medicine and is a suitable field to pursue this idea. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histones epigenetically regulate chromatin functions and gene transcription and are intimately related to various diseases. Investigating the functions and cross-talk of histone PTMs is crucial for mechanistic elucidation of diseases and their treatments. We launched a program to develop chemical catalysts enabling endogenous histone modifications in living cells without relying on enzymes. We reported two types of chemical catalyst systems so far for synthetic histone acylation. The first system comprised a DNA-binding oligo-4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) catalyst and a phenyl ester acyl donor, PAc-gly. This system promoted histone hyperacetylation in Xenopus laevis sperm chromatin. Using the thus-synthesized hyperacetylated sperm chromatin, we found a novel relationship between histone acetylation and DNA replication. The second system involved a histone-binding catalyst, LANA-DSH, composed of a catalytic motif (DSH) and a histone-binding peptide ligand (LANA), and thioester acyl donors, including endogenous acyl-CoA. This system regioselectively (i.e., selectively to a lysine residue at a specific position) acylated lysine 120 of histone H2B (H2BK120), a lysine residue proximal to the DSH motif defined by binding of the LANA ligand to a nucleosome substrate. This catalyst system was optimized to achieve H2BK120-selective acetylation in living cells without genetic manipulation. The synthetically introduced H2BK120Ac inhibited enzyme-catalyzed ubiquitination at the same lysine residue, acting as a protecting group. H2BK120Ub is a mark recognized by methyltransferase that plays an essential role in mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged leukemia, suggesting the potential of the catalyst system as an epigenetic tool and a cancer therapy. We also discuss the prospects of chemical catalyst-promoted synthetic epigenetics for future PTM studies and therapeutic uses.","['Nozaki, Tamiko', 'Kanai, Motomu']","['Nozaki T', 'Kanai M']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1977-7648'],"['Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210413,United States,Acc Chem Res,Accounts of chemical research,0157313,,,,2021/04/14 06:00,2021/08/21 06:00,['2021/04/13 12:07'],"['2021/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/21 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/13 12:07 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00144 [doi]'],ppublish,Acc Chem Res. 2021 May 4;54(9):2313-2322. doi: 10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00144.

An increase in the activity of the small RhoGTPase cell division control protein 42 (Cdc42) within HSCs causes aging of HSCs. Old HSCs, treated ex vivo with a specific inhibitor of Cdc42 activity termed CASIN, stay rejuvenated upon transplantation into young recipients. We determined in this study the influence of an aged niche on the function of ex vivo rejuvenated old HSCs, as the relative contribution of HSCs intrinsic mechanisms vs extrinsic mechanisms (niche) for aging of HSCs still remain unknown. Our results show that an aged niche restrains the function of ex vivo rejuvenated HSCs, which is at least in part linked to a low level of the cytokine osteopontin found in aged niches. The data imply that sustainable rejuvenation of the function of aged HSCs in vivo will need to address the influence of an aged niche on rejuvenated HSCs.","['Guidi, Novella', 'Marka, Gina', 'Sakk, Vadim', 'Zheng, Yi', 'Florian, Maria Carolina', 'Geiger, Hartmut']","['Guidi N', 'Marka G', 'Sakk V', 'Zheng Y', 'Florian MC', 'Geiger H']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5794-5430'],"['Institute of Molecular Medicine, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, CCHMC, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],['SFB 1279/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft'],['Journal Article'],20210413,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cdc42', 'aging', 'hematopoietic stem cell', 'niche', 'osteopontin', 'rejuvenation']",2021/04/14 06:00,2021/04/14 06:00,['2021/04/13 08:57'],"['2021/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/13 08:57 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.3372 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2021 Aug;39(8):1101-1106. doi: 10.1002/stem.3372.

Hypercalcemia is a rare side effect of ATRA and it may be potentiated after interaction of ATRA with azole group antifungals. Herein, we have reported an APL case with hypercalcemia that is caused by the interaction of ATRA and posaconazole. CASE REPORT: A 49-year-old female patient was diagnosed as APL after the examinations performed upon the detection of pancytopenia when she had presented with the complaints of widespread bruising and fever. After the initiation of posaconazole and ATRA, her serum calcium levels begin to increase (10.3 to 11.1mg/dl). Her vitamin D level was 21.9 ng/ml and PTH 17.8 pg/ml, both were in the normal ranges. The Drug Interaction Probability Scale score of our case was calculated as 6, indicating that the probable adverse drug reaction. Therefore, the high level of serum calcium was attributed to the interaction between ATRA and posaconazole. MANAGEMENT & OUTCOME: Although hypercalcemia with ATRA and other antifungal agents have been previously reported in the literature, this is the first report of hypercalcemia with the concomitant use of ATRA and posaconazole. DISCUSSION: This case highlights the importance of monitoring ATRA's side effects when it is used in combination with drugs inhibiting the cytochrome P450 enzymes. In conclusion, the concomitant use of posaconazole and ATRA may lead to hypercalcemia and serum calcium levels return to normal ranges with the discontinuation of these drugs.","['Afacan Ozturk, Hacer Berna', 'Albayrak, Murat', 'Maral, Senem', 'Reis Aras, Merih', 'Yilmaz, Fatma', 'Akyol, Pinar', 'Tiglioglu, Mesut', 'Malkan, Umit Yavuz']","['Afacan Ozturk HB', 'Albayrak M', 'Maral S', 'Reis Aras M', 'Yilmaz F', 'Akyol P', 'Tiglioglu M', 'Malkan UY']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9386-7604', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4766-1861', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9161-5582', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6112-3950', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3829-289X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4111-2004', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5444-4895']","['Department of Hematology, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210413,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,,['NOTNLM'],"['ATRA', 'hypercalcemia', 'posaconazole']",2021/04/14 06:00,2021/04/14 06:00,['2021/04/13 08:46'],"['2021/04/13 08:46 [entrez]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/10781552211007889 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2021 Apr 13:10781552211007889. doi: 10.1177/10781552211007889.,,,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinicopathological study of 78 cases.,1117-1122,10.1111/ijlh.13540 [doi],"INTRODUCTION: Infantile leukemia encompasses a heterogeneous group which needs stratifying for treatment selection. METHODS: We collected 78 cases of infantile leukemia and retrospectively analyzed their clinicopathological data. RESULTS: Infantile leukemia featured a ratio of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) of 1:2, with a better survival for AML than B-ALL (median survival 36 vs 24 months). When stratified by age, ""early"" infantile B-ALL (2-6 months) showed a high rate of KMT2A rearrangement (100%), similar to the rate seen in congenital B-ALL (1 month) (100%) and higher than seen in ""late"" infantile B-ALL (>/=7 months) (68%). The three categories of infantile B-ALL exhibited an age-dependent increase in survival (median survival 8.5, 24, and >24 months, respectively). The age-dependent survival benefit remained after excluding the cases negative for KMT2A rearrangement. Conversely, infantile AML lacked an age-dependent pattern of survival. CONCLUSION: The clinical outcome of infantile leukemia depends on the type of leukemia. Given the age-dependent survival, infantile B-ALL can be divided into three subcategories.","['Liu, Xin', 'Zhao, Yue', 'Luedke, Catherine', 'Jug, Rachel', 'Yang, Lian-He', 'Lu, Mark', 'Pan, Zenggang', 'Wang, Dehua', 'Lorsbach, Robert', 'Shi, Yang', 'Knez, Virginia', 'Rehder, Catherine', 'Liang, Xiayuan', 'Wang, Endi']","['Liu X', 'Zhao Y', 'Luedke C', 'Jug R', 'Yang LH', 'Lu M', 'Pan Z', 'Wang D', 'Lorsbach R', 'Shi Y', 'Knez V', 'Rehder C', 'Liang X', 'Wang E']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6132-6336'],"['Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, College of Basic Medical Sciences and First Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, College of Basic Medical Sciences and First Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California and Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Yale University Medical Center, New Haven, CT, USA.', ""Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Department of Pathology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210413,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'congenital leukemia', 'infantile leukemia']",2021/04/14 06:00,2021/11/30 06:00,['2021/04/13 06:45'],"['2021/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/30 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/13 06:45 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13540 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2021 Oct;43(5):1117-1122. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13540.

However, the prognostic value and prediction of HSCT-associated severe bleeding in GVHD patients have not been reported in cohort studies. We did a retrospective analysis of 200 AL patients with GVHD after allo-HSCT from Feb 1, 2014, to Dec 1, 2015. Multivariate analysis showed that the severe bleeding class was associated with the risk of death (HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.31-3.92, p<0.001***). In order to predict severe bleeding and figure out the solution to bleeding events, we established a multiple logistic regression model. HLA-DQB1 unmatching, megakaryocyte reconsititution failure, and III or IV GVHD were the independent risk factors for severe bleeding. Among all the variations above, OR of HLA-DQB1 was the highest (OR: 16.02, 95% CI: 11.54-48.68). Adding HLA-DQB1 to other factors improved the reclassification for predicting severe bleeding (NRI=0.195, z=2.634, p=0.008**; IDI=0.289, z=3.249, p<0.001***). Lasso regression was used to select variants. A nomogram of the logistic model was generated and displayed. Calibration curve demonstrated excellent accuracy in estimating severe bleeding (C index of 0.935). HLA-DQB1 showed excellent efficacy of predicting severe bleeding in HSCT patients.","['Qi, Jiaqian', 'Zhang, Rui', 'Cai, Chengsen', 'Wang, Hong', 'Zhou, Meng', 'Shen, Wenhong', 'Tang, Yaqiong', 'Pan,

METHODS: Eight hundred and twenty-nine cycles of chemotherapy were evaluated in 112 patients with childhood cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Chemotherapy protocol, hematological, hepatic, and renal function parameters were collected and compared to presence and severity of OM, as graded by the World Health Organization (WHO) scale. Patients received counseling on oral hygiene and those who presented with OM (grade >/=1) received photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT). RESULTS: Age ranged from 0 to 17 years (mean/SD, 8.58 +/- 5.05) and fifty-one patients (45.54%) were females. The most common baseline diseases were leukemia (51%) followed by sarcomas (23%) and lymphomas (18%). Eight hundred and twenty-nine cycles of chemotherapy were evaluated, and OM was diagnosed in 527 cycles (63.57%). Higher incidence and severity of OM was observed in protocols using high-dose methotrexate (MTX-HD), MTX-HD cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin combination, and MTX-HD combined with cyclophosphamide (p <0.001). Patients with severe OM had lower levels of leukocytes (p = 0.003), hemoglobin (p = 0.005), platelets (p = 0.034), and higher levels of total bilirubin (p = 0.027), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.001), and creatinine (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: The study contributes to the elucidation of the risk factors for OM in pediatric cancer patients. Chemotherapy protocols using MTX-HD, MTX-HD associated with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, and MTX-HD and cyclophosphamide a have higher incidence of severe grades of OM. Other toxicities such as hematological, hepatic, and renal also developed in patients with OM.","['Curra, Marina', 'Gabriel, Amanda F', 'Ferreira, Maria Beatriz C', 'Martins, Marco Antonio T', 'Brunetto, Andre T', 'Gregianin, Lauro J', 'Martins, Manoela Domingues']","['Curra M', 'Gabriel AF', 'Ferreira MBC', 'Martins MAT', 'Brunetto AT', 'Gregianin LJ', 'Martins MD']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8473-9424', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8910-5815', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6814-6773', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7834-3319', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7958-1279', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0788-7858', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8662-5965']","['Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Rua Ramiro Barcelos, 2492, sala 503, CEP: 90035-003 Santana, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Rua Ramiro Barcelos, 2492, sala 503, CEP: 90035-003 Santana, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Department of Conservative Dentistry, School of Dentistry, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Rua Ramiro Barcelos, 2492, sala 503, CEP: 90035-003 Santana, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Department of Oral Medicine, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA/UFRGS), Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Childhood Cancer Institute, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Porto Alegre Clinicas Hospital (HCPA/UFRGS), Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Rua Ramiro Barcelos, 2492, sala 503, CEP: 90035-003 Santana, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. manomartins@gmail.com.', 'Department of Oral Medicine, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA/UFRGS), Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. manomartins@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['grant n.25000.056.976/2015-52/PRONON', '2016-0608/Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre']",['Journal Article'],20210412,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chemotherapy', 'Oral mucositis', 'Pediatric patients', 'Risk factors']",2021/04/14 06:00,2021/10/16 06:00,['2021/04/13 06:35'],"['2020/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/13 06:35 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-021-06199-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-021-06199-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2021 Nov;29(11):6243-6251. doi: 10.1007/s00520-021-06199-5.

Magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIG) is a natural compound extracted from licorice and a hepatoprotective drug used in liver injury. It exhibits antioxidant, antiinflammatory and antiapoptotic properties. The aim of the present study was to identify the protective action and underlying mechanism of MgIG against ATOinduced hepatotoxicity. A total of 50 mice were randomly divided into five groups (n=10/group): Control; ATO; MgIG and high and lowdose MgIG + ATO. Following continuous administration of ATO for 7 days, the relative weight of the liver, liver enzyme, histological data, antioxidant enzymes, proinflammatory cytokines, cell apoptosis and changes in Kelchlike ECHassociated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2related factor 2 (Keap1Nrf2) signaling pathway were observed. MgIG decreased liver injury, decreased the liver weight and liver index, inhibited oxidative stress and decreased the activity of glutathione, superoxide dismutase and catalase, production of reactive oxygen species and levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL1beta, IL6 and TNFalpha. Western blotting showed a decrease in Bax and caspase3. There was decreased cleaved caspase3 expression and increased Bcl2 expression. MgIG notably activated ATOmediated expression of Keap1 and Nrf2 in liver tissue. MgIG administration was an effective treatment to protect the liver from ATOinduced toxicity. MgIG maintained the level of Nrf2 in the liver and protected the antioxidative defense system to attenuate oxidative stress and prevent ATOinduced liver injury.","['Liu, Miaomiao', 'Zheng, Bin', 'Liu, Panpan', 'Zhang, Jianping', 'Chu, Xi', 'Dong, Chunhui', 'Shi, Jing', 'Liang, Yingran', 'Chu, Li', 'Liu, Yanshuang', 'Han, Xue']","['Liu M', 'Zheng B', 'Liu P', 'Zhang J', 'Chu X', 'Dong C', 'Shi J', 'Liang Y', 'Chu L', 'Liu Y', 'Han X']",,"['Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050200, P.R.

Based on our previous data revealing that the PU.1mediated expression of miR29b in cells from acute myeloid leukemia is sustained by Vav1, the potential role of this multidomain protein in modulating miR29b levels in breast tumor cells, in which Vav1 is ecstopically expressed and shows a nuclear accumulation, was investigated. Breast cancer cell lines with various phenotypes and patientderived xenograftderived TNBC cells were subjected to Vav1 modulation and reverse transcription quantitative PCR of miR29b levels. The recruitment of CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPalpha) to miR29b promoters was investigated by quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. It was found that Vav1 was essential for the recovery of mature miR29b in breast cancer cell lines, and that it promoted the expression of the miRNA in TNBC cells of the mesenchymal molecular subtype by sustaining the transcription of the miR29b1/a cluster mediated by CEBPalpha. The present results suggest that Vav1 is a crucial modulator of miR29b expression in breast tumor cells, and this finding may help identify strategies that may be useful in the management of TNBC by targeting the Vav1/miR29b axis, as there is a lack of molecularbased treatments for TNBC.","['Grassilli, Silvia', 'Vezzali, Federica', 'Cairo, Stefano', 'Brugnoli, Federica', 'Volinia, Stefano', 'De Mattei, Monica', 'Judde, Jean-Gabriel', 'Bertagnolo, Valeria']","['Grassilli S', 'Vezzali F', 'Cairo S', 'Brugnoli F', 'Volinia S', 'De Mattei M', 'Judde JG', 'Bertagnolo V']",,"['Department of Translational Medicine, University of Ferrara, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Medicine, University of Ferrara, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Xentech, 91000 Evry, France.', 'Department of Translational Medicine, University of Ferrara, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Medicine, University of Ferrara, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Ferrara, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Xentech, 91000 Evry, France.', 'Department of Translational Medicine, University of Ferrara, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210413,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,,['NOTNLM'],"['*breast cancer', '*Vav1', '*miR29b', '*triplenegative breast cancer', '*CEBPalpha']",2021/04/14 06:00,2021/11/09 06:00,['2021/04/13 06:34'],"['2020/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/13 06:34 [entrez]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3892/or.2021.8034 [doi]', '83 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2021 May;45(5). pii: 83. doi: 10.3892/or.2021.8034.

However, the function of LINC00460 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains elusive. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the role of LINC00460 in AML. The expression of LINC00460 in the serum of 80 diagnosed patients with AML and 67 healthy controls was measured via reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction, and the results were compared with clinical features and patient outcomes. The expression of LINC00460 in 45 patients with cytogenetically normalAML (CNAML) was also assayed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of serum LINC00460. In addition, the effects of LINC00460 on the viability, cell cycle distribution and apoptosis of AML cells were investigated. Bioinformatics tools were used to identify the possible mechanisms of how LINC00460 affects AML cells. It was found that the expression of LINC00460 was significantly upregulated in the serum of patients with AML and those with CNAML. Higher expression of serum LINC00460 was positively associated with FrenchAmericanBritish classification and cytogenetics. Furthermore, ROC curve analyses demonstrated that serum LINC00460 could differentiate patients with AML from healthy individuals with an area under the curve of 0.8488 (95% CI, 0.76970.9279). The serum LINC00460 expression was also significantly decreased when the patients achieved complete remission. KaplanMeier analysis indicated that patients with high serum LINC00460 expression had a shorter overall survival time compared with the low serum LINC00460 expression group. Knockdown of LINC00460 inhibited viability, while inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in AML cells. LINC00460 was also a decoy of microRNA (miR)320b, which can further inhibit the expression of PBX homeobox 3 (PBX3). Collectively, the results suggested that LINC00460 may be applied as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for patients with AML. It was identified that LINC00460 may exert its effects, at least partly, via the miR320b/PBX3 axis in AML.","['Zhuang, Qiang', 'Jin, Zhenlin', 'Zheng, Xiangkuo', 'Jin, Ting', 'Xiang, Lina']","['Zhuang Q', 'Jin Z', 'Zheng X', 'Jin T', 'Xiang L']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang 325035, P.R.

LIF is a cytokine in the interleukin6 family and signals via the common receptor subunit gp130 and ligandspecific LIF receptor. LIF causes heterodimerization of the LIF receptor and gp130, activating the Janus kinase/STAT and MAPK pathways, resulting in changes in protein phosphorylation. The present study profiled LIFmediated protein phosphorylation changes in mESCs via proteomic analysis. mESCs treated in the presence or absence of LIF were analyzed via twodimensional differential ingel electrophoresis and protein and phosphoprotein staining. Protein identification was performed by matrixassisted laser desorption/ionizationtime of flight mass spectrophotometry. Increased phosphorylation of 16 proteins and decreased phosphorylation of 34 proteins in response to LIF treatment was detected. Gene Ontology terms enriched in these proteins included 'organonitrogen compound metabolic process', 'regulation of mRNA splicing via spliceosome' and 'nucleotide metabolic process'. The present results revealed that LIF modulated phosphorylation levels of nucleotide metabolismassociated proteins, thus providing insight into the mechanism underlying LIF action in mESCs.","['Song, Hwa-Ryung', 'Kim, Han-Kyu', 'Kim, Seung-Gook', 'Lim, Hyung-Jin', 'Kim, Hyun-Yi', 'Han, Myung-Kwan']","['Song HR', 'Kim HK', 'Kim SG', 'Lim HJ', 'Kim HY', 'Han MK']",,"['Department of Microbiology, Jeonbuk National University Medical School, Jeonju, Jeollabuk 54896, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Microbiology, Jeonbuk National University Medical School, Jeonju, Jeollabuk 54896, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Microbiology, Jeonbuk National University Medical School, Jeonju, Jeollabuk 54896, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Microbiology, Jeonbuk National University Medical School, Jeonju, Jeollabuk 54896, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Department of Oral Biology, Yonsei University College of Dentistry, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Microbiology, Jeonbuk National University Medical School, Jeonju, Jeollabuk 54896, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210413,Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,PMC8060798,['NOTNLM'],"['*embryonic stem cells', '*leukemia inhibitory factor', '*phosphorylation', '*mouse']",2021/04/14 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2021/04/13 06:32'],"['2020/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/13 06:32 [entrez]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3892/mmr.2021.12070 [doi]', '431 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2021 Jun;23(6). pii: 431. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2021.12070.

Although hypothesized to serve important regulatory functions, physiologic roles of the minor spliceosome are not well understood. For example, the minor spliceosome component ZRSR2 is subject to recurrent, leukemia-associated mutations, yet functional connections among minor introns, hematopoiesis and cancers are unclear. Here, we identify that impaired minor intron excision via ZRSR2 loss enhances hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal. CRISPR screens mimicking nonsense-mediated decay of minor intron-containing mRNA species converged on LZTR1, a regulator of RAS-related GTPases. LZTR1 minor intron retention was also discovered in the RASopathy Noonan syndrome, due to intronic mutations disrupting splicing and diverse solid tumors. These data uncover minor intron recognition as a regulator of hematopoiesis, noncoding mutations within minor introns as potential cancer drivers and links among ZRSR2 mutations, LZTR1 regulation and leukemias.","['Inoue, Daichi', 'Polaski, Jacob T', 'Taylor, Justin', 'Castel, Pau', 'Chen, Sisi', 'Kobayashi, Susumu', 'Hogg, Simon J', 'Hayashi, Yasutaka', 'Pineda, Jose Mario Bello', 'El Marabti,

Interestingly, only rare cases of extrauterine DICER1-associated ERMS, mostly located in the genitourinary tract, have been reported to date. Our goal was to study clinicopathologic and molecular profiles of DICER1-mutant (DICER1-mut) and DICER1-wild type (DICER1-wt) ERMS in a cohort of genitourinary tumors. We collected a cohort of 17 ERMS including nine uterine (four uterine corpus and five cervix), one vaginal, and seven urinary tract tumors. DNA sequencing revealed mutations of DICER1 in 9/9 uterine ERMS. All other ERMS of our cohort were DICER1-wt. The median age at diagnosis of patients with DICER1-mut and DICER1-wt ERMS was 36 years and 5 years, respectively. Limited follow-up data (available for 15/17 patients) suggested that DICER1-mut ERMS might show a less aggressive clinical course than DICER1-wt ERMS. Histological features only observed in DICER1-mut ERMS were cartilaginous nodules (6/9 DICER1-mut ERMS), in one case accompanied by foci of ossification. Recurrent mutations identified in both DICER1-mut and DICER1-wt ERMS affected KRAS, NRAS, and TP53. Copy number analysis revealed similar structural variations with frequent gains on chromosomes 2, 3, and 8, independent of DICER1 mutation status. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of array-based whole-genome DNA methylation data of our study cohort together with an extended methylation data set including different RMS subtypes from genitourinary and extra-genitourinary locations (n = 102), revealed a distinct cluster for DICER1-mut ERMS. Such tumors clearly segregated from the clusters of DICER1-wt ERMS, alveolar RMS, and MYOD1-mutant spindle cell and sclerosing RMS. Only one tumor, previously diagnosed as ERMS arising in the maxilla of a 6-year-old boy clustered with DICER1-mut ERMS of the uterus. Subsequent sequencing analysis identified two DICER1 mutations in the latter case.

We engineered a high affinity soluble human LIF receptor (LIFR) decoy that sequesters human LIF and inhibits its signaling as a therapeutic strategy. This engineered 'ligand trap', fused to an antibody Fc-domain, has ~50-fold increased affinity (~20 pM) and improved LIF inhibition compared to wild-type LIFR-Fc, potently blocks LIF-mediated effects in pancreatic cancer cells, and slows the growth of pancreatic cancer xenograft tumors.

Conventional techniques for sperm recovery from testicular sperm extractions stagnate at the sample processing stage, where it can take several hours to identify viable sperm from a background of collateral cells such as white bloods cells (WBCs), red blood cells (RBCs), epithelial cells (ECs) and in some cases cancer cells. Manual identification of sperm from contaminating cells and debris is a tedious and time-consuming operation that can be suitably addressed through inertial microfluidics. Microfluidics has proven an effective technology for high-quality sperm selection based on motility. However, motility-based selection methods cannot cater for viable, non-motile sperm often present in testicular or epididymal sperm extractions and aspirations. This study demonstrates the use of a 3D printed inertial microfluidic device for the separation of sperm cells from a mixed suspension of WBCs, RBCs, ECs, and leukemic cancer cells. This technology presents a 36-fold time improvement for the recovery of sperm cells (> 96%) by separating sperm, RBCS, WBCs, ECs and cancer cells into tight bands in less than 5 min. Furthermore, microfluidic processing of sperm has no impact on sperm parameters; vitality, motility, morphology, or DNA fragmentation of sperm. Applying inertial microfluidics for non-motile sperm recovery can greatly improve the current processing procedure of testicular sperm extractions, simplifying the fertility outcomes for severe forms of male infertility that warrant the surgery.","['Vasilescu, Steven A', 'Khorsandi, Shayan', 'Ding, Lin', 'Bazaz, Sajad Razavi', 'Nosrati, Reza', 'Gook, Debra', 'Warkiani, Majid Ebrahimi']","['Vasilescu SA', 'Khorsandi S', 'Ding L', 'Bazaz SR', 'Nosrati R', 'Gook D', 'Warkiani ME']",,"['School of Biomedical Engineering, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW, 2007, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Engineering, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW, 2007, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Engineering, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW, 2007, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Engineering, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW, 2007, Australia.', 'Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, 3800, Australia.', ""Reproductive Services, Royal Women's Hospital/Melbourne IVF, Melbourne, Australia."", 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Melbourne Victoria, Melbourne, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Engineering, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW, 2007, Australia. majid.warkiani@uts.edu.au.', 'Institute for Biomedical Materials and Devices (IBMD), Faculty of Science, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW, 2007, Australia. majid.warkiani@uts.edu.au.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210412,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC8042033,,,2021/04/14 06:00,2021/11/05 06:00,['2021/04/13 06:16'],"['2021/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/13 06:16 [entrez]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-021-87046-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-021-87046-9 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2021 Apr 12;11(1):7917. doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-87046-9.,20211104,['0 (Suspensions)'],IM,"['Biopsy', 'Cell Separation', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Male', '*Microfluidics', 'Spermatozoa/*cytology', 'Suspensions', 'Testis/pathology']",,,['J Urol. 2021 Nov;206(5):1309-1311.

It is commonly assumed that training CNNs requires large amounts of annotated data. This is a bottleneck in many medical applications where annotation relies on expert knowledge. Here, we analyze the binary classification performance of a CNN on two independent cytomorphology datasets as a function of training set size. Specifically, we train a sequential model to discriminate non-malignant leukocytes from blast cells, whose appearance in the peripheral blood is a hallmark of leukemia. We systematically vary training set size, finding that tens of training images suffice for a binary classification with an ROC-AUC over 90%. Saliency maps and layer-wise relevance propagation visualizations suggest that the network learns to increasingly focus on nuclear structures of leukocytes as the number of training images is increased. A low dimensional tSNE representation reveals that while the two classes are separated already for a few training images, the distinction between the classes becomes clearer when more training images are used. To evaluate the performance in a multi-class problem, we annotated single-cell images from a acute lymphoblastic leukemia dataset into six different hematopoietic classes. Multi-class prediction suggests that also here few single-cell images suffice if differences between morphological classes are large enough. The incorporation of deep learning algorithms into clinical practice has the potential to reduce variability and cost, democratize usage of expertise, and allow for early detection of disease onset and relapse. Our approach evaluates the performance of a deep learning based cytology classifier with respect to size and complexity of the training data and the classification task.","['Schouten, Jens P E', 'Matek, Christian', 'Jacobs, Luuk F P', 'Buck, Michele C', 'Bosnacki, Dragan', 'Marr, Carsten']","['Schouten JPE', 'Matek C', 'Jacobs LFP', 'Buck MC', 'Bosnacki D', 'Marr C']",,"['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.', 'Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen-German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen-German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Munich, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen-Campus Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medicine III, Technische Universitat Munchen, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.

Safety and efficacy outcomes from the pivotal prospective clinical trials of axicabtagene ciloleucel, tisagenlecleucel and lisocabtagene maraleucel and the retrospective, postmarketing, real-world analyses have confirmed high response rates and durable remissions in patients who had failed multiple lines of therapy and had no meaningful treatment options. Although initially administered in the inpatient setting, there has been a growing interest in delivering CAR-T cell therapy in the outpatient setting; however, this has not been adopted as standard clinical practice for multiple reasons, including logistic and reimbursement issues. CAR-T cell therapy requires a multidisciplinary approach and coordination, particularly if given in an outpatient setting. The ability to monitor patients closely is necessary and proper protocols must be established to respond to clinical changes to ensure efficient, effective and rapid evaluation either in the clinic or emergency department for management decisions regarding fever, sepsis, cytokine release syndrome and neurological events, specifically immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome.

A retrospective investigation of blood donors' data covering the period from 22 May 2009 to 22 May 2019 was done. Data was accumulated and analyzed from Blood Transfusion Center records, pertaining to all donors who were screened for various TTIs using respective immunological techniques. Out of the 682,171 screened donors in the 2009-2019 study period, 2470 (0.36 %) were infected with at least one infectious agent. The overall prevalence of HBV, HCV, HTLV-1, HIV and syphilis were 1700 (0.25 %), 184 (0.027 %), 335 (0.05 %), 4 (0.0.05 %) and 247 (0.036 %), respectively. The study showed male dominated donor pool (96.79 %) with higher prevalence (0.34 %) of TTIs compared to female donors (0.02 %) with 3.21 % population. Despite the low prevalence of TTIs in our study, HBV, HCV, syphilis and HIV have remained a big threat to safe blood transfusion in Iran. Strict adherence to selection criteria, algorithm of donor screening, use of highly sensitive and specific methods for detection of TTIs, regular consultation and health education programs, prevention and sanitization strategies to reduce the risk of TTIs are recommended to reduce the risk of TTIs and ensure the safety of blood transfusion for recipient.","['Emadi, Behzad', 'Ghahraman Rezaieh, Mojtaba', 'Sedighi, Mansour']","['Emadi B', 'Ghahraman Rezaieh M', 'Sedighi M']",,"['Azarbaijan-Gharbi Regional Blood Transfusion Center, Urmia, Iran.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies formaldehyde as a Group 1 carcinogen, based on nasopharyngeal cancer and leukemia studies. However, the correlation between formaldehyde exposure and leukemia incidence is a controversial issue. To understand the association between formaldehyde exposure and leukemia, we explored biological networks based on formaldehyde-related genes retrieved from public and commercial databases. Through the literature-based network approach, we summarized qualitative associations between formaldehyde exposure and leukemia. Our results indicate that oxidative stress-mediated genetic changes induced by formaldehyde could disturb the hematopoietic system, possibly leading to leukemia. Furthermore, we suggested major genes that are thought to be affected by formaldehyde exposure and associated with leukemia development. Our suggestions can be used to complement experimental data for understanding and identifying the leukemogenic mechanism of formaldehyde.","['Kang, Doo Seok', 'Kim, Hyun Soo', 'Jung, Jong-Hyeon', 'Lee, Cheol Min', 'Ahn, Yeon-Soon', 'Seo, Young Rok']","['Kang DS', 'Kim HS', 'Jung JH', 'Lee CM', 'Ahn YS', 'Seo YR']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4093-4073'],"['Department of Life Science, Institute of Environmental Medicine for Green Chemistry, Dongguk University Biomedi Campus, 32 Dongguk-ro, Ilsandong-gu, Goyang-si, Gyeonggi-do, 10326, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Life Science, Institute of Environmental Medicine for Green Chemistry, Dongguk University Biomedi Campus, 32 Dongguk-ro, Ilsandong-gu, Goyang-si, Gyeonggi-do, 10326, Republic of Korea.', 'Faculty of Health Science, Daegu Haany University, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk, 38610, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, College of Natural Science and Engineering, Seokyeong University, Seoul, 02173, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine and Institute of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Wonju College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Wonju, Gangwon, 26426, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Life Science, Institute of Environmental Medicine for Green Chemistry, Dongguk University Biomedi Campus, 32 Dongguk-ro, Ilsandong-gu, Goyang-si, Gyeonggi-do, 10326, Republic of Korea. seoyr@dongguk.edu.']",['eng'],"['2017001970001/Korea Environmental Industry and Technology Institute', '2018001350006/Korea Environmental Industry and Technology Institute']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210412,England,Genes Environ,Genes and environment : the official journal of the Japanese Environmental Mutagen Society,101285347,PMC8042688,['NOTNLM'],"['Biological network analysis', 'Carcinogenicity', 'Formaldehyde', 'Leukemia', 'Toxicogenomics']",2021/04/14 06:00,2021/04/14 06:01,['2021/04/13 05:38'],"['2020/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/13 05:38 [entrez]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s41021-021-00183-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s41021-021-00183-5 [pii]']",epublish,Genes Environ. 2021 Apr 12;43(1):13. doi: 10.1186/s41021-021-00183-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to characterize genetic and epigenetic alterations of EZH2 in 58 patients (51 with acute myeloid leukemia and 7 with myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative neoplasms) by integrating data on EZH2 mutational status, co-occurring mutations, and EZH2 copy number status with EZH2 protein expression, histone H3K27 trimethylation, and EZH2 promoter methylation. RESULTS: EZH2 was mutated in 6/51 acute myeloid leukemia patients (12%) and 7/7 patients with other myeloid neoplasms. EZH2 mutations were not overrepresented in patients with chromosome 7q deletions or losses. In acute myeloid leukemia patients, EZH2 mutations frequently co-occurred with CEBPA (67%), ASXL1 (50%), TET2 and RAD21 mutations (33% each). In EZH2-mutated patients with myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative neoplasms, the most common co-mutations were in ASXL1 (100%), NRAS, RUNX1, and STAG2 (29% each). EZH2 mutations were associated with a significant decrease in EZH2 expression (p = 0.0002), which was similar in patients with chromosome 7 aberrations and patients with intact chromosome 7. An association between EZH2 protein expression and H3K27 trimethylation was observed in EZH2-unmutated patients (R(2) = 0.2, p = 0.01). The monoallelic state of EZH2 was not associated with EZH2 promoter hypermethylation. In multivariable analyses, EZH2 mutations were associated with a trend towards an increased risk of death (hazard ratio 2.51 [95% confidence interval 0.87-7.25], p = 0.09); similarly, low EZH2 expression was associated with elevated risk (hazard ratio 2.54 [95% confidence interval 1.07-6.04], p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Perturbations of EZH2 activity in AML/MDS occur on different, genetic and non-genetic levels. Both low EZH2 protein expression and, by trend, EZH2 gene mutations predicted inferior overall survival of AML patients receiving standard chemotherapy.","['Stomper, Julia', 'Meier, Ruth', 'Ma, Tobias', 'Pfeifer, Dietmar', 'Ihorst, Gabriele', 'Blagitko-Dorfs, Nadja', 'Greve, Gabriele', 'Zimmer, Dennis', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Hagemeijer, Anne', 'Schmitt-Graeff, Ingrid', 'Lubbert, Michael']","['Stomper J', 'Meier R', 'Ma T', 'Pfeifer D', 'Ihorst G', 'Blagitko-Dorfs N', 'Greve G', 'Zimmer D', 'Platzbecker U', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Schmitt-Graeff I', 'Lubbert M']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1186-1650'],"['Department of Medicine I (Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation), Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I (Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation), Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I (Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation), Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I (Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation), Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Clinical Trials Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Immunodeficiency, Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency (CCI), Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I (Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation), Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I (Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation), Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Partner Site Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medical Department-Hematology and Cell Therapy, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.', 'University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I (Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation), Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany. michael.luebbert@uniklinik-freiburg.de.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Partner Site Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany. michael.luebbert@uniklinik-freiburg.de.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany. michael.luebbert@uniklinik-freiburg.de.']",['eng'],"['SFB 992-C04/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', 'FOR 2674/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', 'Project ID L637/DKTK', 'L660/DKTK']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210412,Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,PMC8043064,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*EZH2', '*H3K27 trimethylation', '*Mutations', '*Promoter methylation', '*Protein expression', '*Survival']",2021/04/14 06:00,2021/04/14 06:00,['2021/04/13 05:36'],"['2020/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/13 05:36 [entrez]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13148-021-01052-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s13148-021-01052-2 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2021 Apr 12;13(1):77. doi: 10.1186/s13148-021-01052-2.,,,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Clin Epigenetics. 2021 Apr 28;13(1):94.

A particularly important use is in low-calorie beverages consumed by children and pregnant women. The Ramazzini Institute (RI) reported in 2006 and 2007 that aspartame causes dose-related increases in malignant tumors in multiple organs in rats and mice. Increased cancer risk was seen even at low exposure levels approaching the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI). Prenatal exposures caused increased malignancies in rodent offspring at lower doses than in adults. These findings generated intense controversy focused on the accuracy of RI's diagnoses of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue tumors (HLTs). Critics made the claim that pulmonary lesions observed in aspartame-exposed animals were inflammatory lesions caused by Mycoplasma infection rather than malignant neoplasms. METHODS: To address this question, RI subjected all HLTs from aspartame-exposed animals to immunohistochemical analysis using a battery of markers and to morphological reassessment using the most recent Internationally Harmonized Nomenclature and Diagnostic (INHAND) criteria. FINDINGS: This immunohistochemical and morphological re-evaluation confirmed the original diagnoses of malignancy in 92.3% of cases. Six lesions originally diagnosed as lymphoma (8% of all HLTs) were reclassified: 3 to lymphoid hyperplasia, and 3 to chronic inflammation with fibrosis. There was no evidence of Mycoplasma infection. INTERPRETATION: These new findings confirm that aspartame is a chemical carcinogen in rodents. They confirm the very worrisome finding that prenatal exposure to aspartame increases cancer risk in rodent offspring. They validate the conclusions of the original RI studies. These findings are of great importance for public health. In light of them, we encourage all national and international public health agencies to urgently reexamine their assessments of aspartame's health risks - especially the risks of prenatal and early postnatal exposures. We call upon food agencies to reassess Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) levels for aspartame.

METHODS: A literature search of PubMed and Embase databases was performed to identify eligible observational studies published from inception to July 17, 2020. The categorical and dose-response meta-analysis was conducted by pooling relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Potential sources of heterogeneity were detected by meta-regression and stratification analysis. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias test were also carried out. RESULTS: Forty-five articles involving 475,579 individuals were included in the meta-analysis. Among the thirty-three studies on the association between breastfeeding and risk of childhood leukemia, the pooled risk estimates were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.65-0.91) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.63-0.94) for ever versus non/occasional breastfeeding and longest versus shortest breastfeeding duration group, respectively. There was clear indication for non-linear dose-response relationship between breastfeeding duration and the risk of childhood leukemia (P non-linear < 0.001). The most protective effect (OR, 0.66, 95% CI 0.62-0.70) was observed at a breastfeeding duration of 9.6 months. Four studies examined, the association between breastfeeding and risk of childhood neuroblastoma, and significant inverse associations were consistently observed in both the comparisons of ever breastfeeding versus non/occasional breastfeeding (OR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.44-0.81) and longest versus shortest breastfeeding (OR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.44-0.83). However, no associations of breastfeeding with risk of other cancers were found. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports a protective role of breastfeeding on the risk of childhood leukemia, also suggesting a non-linear dose-response relationship. Further studies are warranted to confirm the association between breastfeeding and risk of childhood neuroblastoma.","['Su, Qing', 'Sun, Xiaohui', 'Zhu, Liwen', 'Yan, Qin', 'Zheng, Peiwen', 'Mao, Yingying', 'Ye, Ding']","['Su Q', 'Sun X', 'Zhu L', 'Yan Q', 'Zheng P', 'Mao Y', 'Ye D']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6654-7832'],"['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, 548 Binwen Road, Hangzhou, 310053, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, 548 Binwen Road, Hangzhou, 310053, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210008, China."", 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, 548 Binwen Road, Hangzhou, 310053, China.', ""Department of Medical Adiministration, Women's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310006, China."", 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, 548 Binwen Road, Hangzhou, 310053, China. myy@zcmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, 548 Binwen Road, Hangzhou, 310053, China. yeding@zcmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",20210413,England,BMC Med,BMC medicine,101190723,PMC8042913,['NOTNLM'],"['*Breastfeeding', '*Childhood cancer', '*Dose-response', '*Meta-analysis']",2021/04/14 06:00,2021/10/16 06:00,['2021/04/13 05:35'],"['2020/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/13 05:35 [entrez]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12916-021-01950-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12916-021-01950-5 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med. 2021 Apr 13;19(1):90. doi: 10.1186/s12916-021-01950-5.,20211015,,IM,"['*Breast Feeding', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report a case of relapsing EG in a patient who had returned from a trip to Colombia, thus establishing EG as an important differential diagnosis of tropical diseases, and demonstrating that even long-term antibiotic treatment can result in only partial remission of EG. CASE PRESENTATION: A 77-year-old man with underlying chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) on ibrutinib treatment was admitted because of a superinfected mosquito bite on the left ear and multiple partially necrotic skin lesions disseminated all over the entire body five days after returning from a trip to Colombia. The initial clinical suspicion of a tropical disease (leishmaniosis, systemic mycosis, or others) could not be confirmed. During the diagnostic workup, microbiological cultures of the skin biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavage revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa, leading to a diagnosis of EG. Initial antibiotic treatment resulted in partial remission. However, the patient had to be re-admitted due to a relapse 3-4 weeks after the first episode. Finally, the patient was successfully treated with a combined approach consisting of antibiotics, recurrent surgical incisions, and administration of immunoglobulins. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, EG should be considered as a differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients presenting with eschar-like skin ulcers. A combined treatment approach seems to be the best choice to achieve clinical cure and avoid relapse.","['Wiedemann, Gabriela M', 'Schneider, Jochen', 'Verbeek, Mareike', 'Konukiewitz, Bjorn', 'Spinner, Christoph D', 'Einwachter, Henrik', 'Schmid, Roland M', 'Rothe, Kathrin']","['Wiedemann GM', 'Schneider J', 'Verbeek M', 'Konukiewitz B', 'Spinner CD', 'Einwachter H', 'Schmid RM', 'Rothe K']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6138-9791'],"['Department of Internal Medicine II, University hospital rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Munich, Germany. gabriela.wiedemann@gmail.com.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University hospital rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Munich, Germany.', 'German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University hospital rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University hospital rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Munich, Germany.', 'German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University hospital rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University hospital rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Munich, Germany.', 'German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Microbiology, Immunology and Hygiene, Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20210412,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,PMC8042936,['NOTNLM'],"['Case report', 'Ecthyma gangrenosum', 'Ibrutinib', 'Leukemia', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Skin ulcer', 'Tropical disease']",2021/04/14 06:00,2021/05/01 06:00,['2021/04/13 05:32'],"['2020/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/13 05:32 [entrez]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12879-021-05998-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12879-021-05998-9 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2021 Apr 12;21(1):344. doi: 10.1186/s12879-021-05998-9.,20210430,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Administration, Intravenous', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/microbiology', 'Colombia', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Ecthyma/*diagnosis/drug therapy/microbiology/surgery', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunoglobulins/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Piperidines/therapeutic use', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/isolation & purification', 'Skin Ulcer/*diagnosis/microbiology/surgery']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatment with the histone modifier Trichostatin A could concurrently alter the expression profiles of microRNAs and protein-coding genes. METHODS: Changes in histone hyperacetylation and viability in response to drug treatment were analyzed, respectively, using western blotting and flow cytometry. Paired global expression profiling of microRNAs and coding genes was performed and highly regulated genes have been validated by qRT-PCR. The interrelationships between the drug-induced miR-494 upregulation, the expression of putative target genes, and T cell receptor-mediated apoptosis were evaluated using qRT-PCR, flow cytometry, and western blotting following lipid-mediated transfection with specific anti-microRNA inhibitors. RESULTS: Treatment of Jurkat cells with Trichostatin A resulted in histone hyperacetylation and apoptosis. Global expression profiling indicated prominent upregulation of miR-494 in contrast to differential regulation of many protein-coding and non-coding genes validated by qRT-PCR. Although transfection with synthetic anti-miR-494 inhibitors failed to block drug-induced apoptosis or miR-494 upregulation, it induced the transcriptional repression of the PVRIG gene. Surprisingly, miR-494 inhibition in conjunction with low doses of Trichostatin A enhanced the weak T cell receptor- mediated apoptosis, indicating a subtle pro-survival role of miR-494. Interestingly, this prosurvival effect was overwhelmed by mitogen-mediated T cell activation and higher drug doses, which mediated caspase-dependent apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Our results unravel a pro-survival function of miR-494 and its putative interaction with the PVRIG gene and the apoptotic machinery in Jurkat cells.","['Jayaraman, Arathi', 'Zhou, Tong', 'Jayaraman, Sundararajan']","['Jayaraman A', 'Zhou T', 'Jayaraman S']",,"['Department of Medicine, The University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60612, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60612, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60612, United States.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United Arab Emirates,Microrna,"MicroRNA (Shariqah, United Arab Emirates)",101631045,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*T cell', '*Trichostatin A.', '*epigenetics', '*histone deacetylases', '*leukemia', '*microRNA-494']",2021/04/14 06:00,2022/01/14 06:00,['2021/04/13 05:30'],"['2020/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/13 05:30 [entrez]']","['MIRNA-EPUB-115295 [pii]', '10.2174/2211536610666210412153322 [doi]']",ppublish,Microrna. 2021;10(1):39-50. doi: 10.2174/2211536610666210412153322.,20220113,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (MIRN494 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression', 'Histones/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', '*MicroRNAs/genetics']","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently reported that signal-transducing adaptor protein 1 (STAP-1) is upregulated in CML stem cells (LSCs) and functions to reduce the apoptosis of CML LSCs by upregulating the STAT5-downstream anti-apoptotic genes. In this study, we demonstrate the detailed molecular interactions among BCR-ABL, STAP-1, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5). Studies with deletion mutants have revealed that STAP-1 interacts with BCR-ABL and STAT5a through its SH2 and PH domains, respectively, suggesting the possible role of STAP-1 as a scaffold protein. Furthermore, the binding of STAP-1 to BCR-ABL stabilizes the BCR-ABL protein in CML cells. Since STAP-1 is highly expressed in CML cells, we also analyzed the STAP-1 promoter activity using a luciferase reporter construct and found that NFATc1 is involved in activating the STAP-1 promoter and inducing STAP-1 mRNA expression. Our results demonstrate that STAP-1 contributes to the BCR-ABL/STAT5 and BCR-ABL/Ca(2+)/NFAT signals to induce proliferation and STAP-1 mRNA expression in CML cells, respectively.","['Ishiura, Marie', 'Kitai, Yuichi', 'Kashiwakura, Jun-Ichi', 'Muromoto, Ryuta', 'Toda, Jun', 'Ichii, Michiko', 'Oritani, Kenji', 'Matsuda, Tadashi']","['Ishiura M', 'Kitai Y', 'Kashiwakura JI', 'Muromoto R', 'Toda J', 'Ichii M', 'Oritani K', 'Matsuda T']",,"['Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-0812, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-0812, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-0812, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-0812, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, 2-2 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, 2-2 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, International University of Health and Welfare, 4-3 Kouzunomori, Narita, Chiba, 286-8686, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-0812, Japan.

Salvage allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is widely used option for these patients, but only 10% to 15% of patients are cured by the procedure. Preclinical studies indicate that substitution of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide with bendamustine (PTB) in a prophylaxis regimen may be associated with an augmented graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reaction. The aim of this study was to establish the optimal dose of PTB and evaluate the antileukemic effect of HSCT with this type of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. In the prospective trial (NCT02799147), PTB was administered in doses of 140, 100, and 70 mg/m(2) on days +3 and +4. Myeloablative conditioning with fludarabine and oral busulfan was provided to all patients. The first 12 patients received single-agent PTB, and subsequent patients received combination therapy with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Inclusion criteria were acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) refractory to at least one induction course of chemotherapy or target therapy and >/=5% clonal blasts in the bone marrow. The study cohort comprised 22 patients with AML and 5 with ALL. Seven patients were enrolled in the 140 mg/m(2) group (due to a stopping rule), and 10 each were enrolled in the 100 mg/m(2) and 70 mg/m(2) groups. Primary refractory disease was documented in 41% of the patients, and secondary refractory was documented in 59%. The median blast count in the bone marrow at the start of the conditioning was 18% (range, 6% to 97%). Transplantation was performed with a matched sibling donor in 5 patients, a matched or mismatched unrelated donor in 15, and a haploidentical donor in 7. Engraftment was documented in 93% of the patients, including 89% with complete remission and 63% without measurable residual disease. After PTB prophylaxis, we observed an unusual complication, a cytokine release syndrome (CRS), in 70% of the patients, including grade 3 to 5 CRS in 44%. The most frequent clinical symptoms included high fever in 67% of patients, abnormal liver function tests in 67%, pancreatitis in 63%, skin vasculitis in 56%, enterocolitis in 48%, inflammation of oral mucosa in 37%, disseminated intravascular coagulation in 37%, and central nervous system toxicity in 26%. The development of CRS was associated with use of an HLA-mismatched donor (75% versus 20%; P = .0043). Classic acute GVHD was documented in 44% of the patients. Grade II-IV acute GVHD was associated with grade 3 to 5 CRS (67% versus 25%; P = .031). Moderate and severe chronic GVHD in the 100-day survivors were more often observed after single-agent PTB than after the combination immunosuppression (100% versus 18%; P = .002). A relatively low relapse rate was observed for this patient population. Three-year overall survival was 28% (95% confidence interval [CI], 13% to 46%), and event-free survival was 29% (95% CI, 13% to 46%). Nonrelapse mortality was 46% (95% CI, 25% to 64%), and the cumulative incidence of relapse was 26% (95% CI, 11% to 44%). No relapses were documented after day +100. There were no statistically significant differences among the dose groups (P = .3481); however, survival was higher in the 100 mg/kg group. Survival was higher in patients with AML compared with those with ALL (35% versus 0%; P = .0157). PTB represents a promising option to augment the GVL effect in refractory AML; however, the high CRS-associated mortality necessitates additional studies to reduce the risk of this complication. Thus, routine clinical application of PTB cannot be currently recommended.

The two cytokines mediated signaling was recently found to be closely associated with cancer and chronic inflammation, which represent promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of many solid tumors and inflammatory disease. As the most closely related members, cross-reactivity of them may result in undesired activation of off-target cells, leading to toxicity or lack of efficacy of the therapeutic effects. However, the mechanism of the cross-reactivity of OSM and LIF is not well understood. METHODS: In this work, protein-protein docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with explicit solvent and post endpoints binding free energy (BFE) analysis were carried out to further understand the structural and energetic principles of interactions between the two cytokines and the shared receptor LIFR. RESULTS: For the first time, the simulation given a computational model of OSM-LIFR interaction, and provided significant insights into the mechanism of OSM and LIF cross-react with LIFR. The identified common features shared by OSM and LIF bind to LIFR involving 10 ""conserved"" residues (90% similarity) distributed at the binding site III comprised of AB loop, BC loop and D helix. In addition, 11 shared residues were identified in LIFR contribute 77.85% and 84.63% energies for OSM and LIF binding, which play a critical role in the formation of the two cytokine-receptor complexes. Moreover, the ""nonconserved"" residues at the same position of cytokines such as Asp41 in OSM and Pro51 in LIF as well as the three residues (Glu338, Asn201 and Glu260) in LIFR were also discovered. CONCLUSIONS: These important information may facilitate the rational design of novel chemical or biological agents with less toxicity and improved efficacy.","['Du, Qingqing', 'Qian, Yan', 'Xue, Weiwei']","['Du Q', 'Qian Y', 'Xue W']",,"['Depart of Pharmacy, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400010, China.', 'Depart of Pharmacy, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400010, China.

This study investigated nutritional status during and after treatment in adolescents and young adults (AYA) with cancer. Methods: A retrospective chart review of AYA diagnosed with cancer was conducted. Data were collected monthly during treatment, then annually for 3 years of follow-up. Results: Of 93 AYA, 8% were underweight at diagnosis versus 20% during treatment (p = 0.012). Forty-four percent experienced >/=5% loss of weight (LOW) during treatment, and 23% of those were not referred to a dietitian. While 47% were referred to a dietitian at some point during treatment, 77% did not have dietetic involvement in the month after reaching greatest percentage LOW. Different tumor types were associated with different risks of LOW. Eighty-six percent with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)/lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) and 86% with acute myeloid leukemia had >/=5% LOW during treatment, compared with 17% with Hodgkin lymphoma (p < 0.0001). In year 3 of follow-up, 36% of all AYA were overweight or obese versus 25% at diagnosis (p = 0.2). Overweight/obesity was more common in ALL/LL survivors than other tumor types (67% vs. 14%, p = 0.037). No patients had dietitian involvement in year 3 of follow-up. Conclusions: AYA, particularly those with ALL/LL, are at risk of significant weight loss during treatment and overweight and obesity during survivorship. Dietetic involvement was inconsistent in this cohort. These data may guide which diagnoses warrant preemptive dietetic input during treatment and highlight the importance of dietetic involvement in survivorship.","['van der Haak, Natalie', 'Edwards, Suzanne', 'Perem, Merike', 'Landorf, Emma', 'Osborn, Michael']","['van der Haak N', 'Edwards S', 'Perem M', 'Landorf E', 'Osborn M']",,"[""Department of Nutrition, Women's and Children's Hospital, North Adelaide, South Australia."", 'Adelaide Health Technology Assessment, Data, Design and Statistics Service, School of Public Health, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia.', 'Youth Cancer Service, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia.', ""Department of Nutrition, Women's and Children's Hospital, North Adelaide, South Australia."", 'Youth Cancer Service, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia.', ""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Women's and Children's Hospital, North Adelaide, South Australia.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210412,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,,['NOTNLM'],"['*malnutrition', '*nutritional status', '*obesity', '*overweight']",2021/04/13 06:00,2021/12/25 06:00,['2021/04/12 20:09'],"['2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/12 20:09 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jayao.2020.0197 [doi]'],ppublish,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2021 Dec;10(6):668-674. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2020.0197.

The current multicenter study retrospectively examined Ven + HMA treatment outcome among 32 patients (median age 69 years; 59% males) with blast-phase myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN-BP). Pre-leukemic phenotype included essential thrombocythemia (ET)/post-ET myelofibrosis (34%), polycythemia vera (PV)/post-PV myelofibrosis (38%) and primary myelofibrosis (28%). Twenty-nine study patients were fully annotated cytogenetically and molecularly (NGS): 69% harbored complex karyotype and/or mutations, including TP53 (41%), IDH1/2 (21%), ASXL1 (21%), N/KRAS (14%), SRSF2 (10%), EZH2 (10%) and U2AF1 (7%). All patients received Ven combined with either azacitidine (n = 12) or decitabine (n = 20); either up front (n = 23) or after failing another induction therapy (n = 9). Complete remission with (CR) or without (CRi) count recovery was achieved in 14 (44%) patients and was more likely to occur in the absence of pre-leukemic PV/post-PV myelofibrosis phenotype (p < .01), complex karyotype (p < .01) or K/NRAS (p = .03) mutations; seven of eight patients (88%) without vs four of 21 (19%) with complex karyotype or K/NRAS mutation achieved CR/CRi (p < .01); all 11 informative patients with pre-leukemic PV/post-PV myelofibrosis phenotype displayed complex karyotype (p < .01). In contrast, neither TP53 (p = .45) nor IDH1/2 (p = .63) mutations affected response. Compared to historical controls treated with HMA alone (n = 26), the CR/CRi rate (44% vs 4%) and median survival (8 vs 5.5 months) were more favorable with Ven + HMA, but without significant difference in overall survival. Importantly, six patients with CR/CRi subsequently received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT). Note, Ven + HMA produces robust CR/CRi rates in MPN-BP, especially in the absence of RAS mutations and complex karyotype, thus enabling AHSCT, in some patients.","['Gangat, Naseema', 'Guglielmelli, Paola', 'Szuber, Natasha', 'Begna, Kebede H', 'Patnaik, Mrinal M', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Al-Kali, Aref', 'Foran, James M', 'Palmer, Jeanne M', 'Alkhateeb, Hassan', 'Elliott, Michelle A', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Pardanani, Animesh', 'Mannelli, Francesco', 'Vannucchi, Alessandro M', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Gangat N', 'Guglielmelli P', 'Szuber N', 'Begna KH', 'Patnaik MM', 'Litzow MR', 'Al-Kali A', 'Foran JM', 'Palmer JM', 'Alkhateeb H', 'Elliott MA', 'Hanson CA', 'Pardanani A', 'Mannelli F', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Tefferi A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9104-6172', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1809-284X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2730-8593', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6998-662X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9816-6302', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7366-9886', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9084-4148', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4810-6501', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5755-0730', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4605-3821']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, CRIMM, Center Research and Innovation of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Universite de Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, CRIMM, Center Research and Innovation of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, CRIMM, Center Research and Innovation of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20210506,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,PMC8251544,,,2021/04/13 06:00,2021/06/29 06:00,['2021/04/12 17:20'],"['2021/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/29 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/12 17:20 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.26186 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2021 Jul 1;96(7):781-789. doi: 10.1002/ajh.26186.

Increased LEF1 activity is associated with progression of several types of cancer including leukemia. Here, we investigated LEF1 isoform expression and genomic variations in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: LEF1 isoform expression was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR in 87 newly diagnosed childhood ALL patients and controls. Moreover, Western blot analysis was performed for detection of LEF1 expression and the hotspot region of LEF1 was screened by deep sequencing. RESULTS: The LEF1 mRNA expression of B cell ALL patients was higher than the controls (LEF1-total P = .011, LEF1-long P = .026). Moreover, B-ALL samples showing higher total LEF1 expression had significantly shorter relapse-free survival (P = .008) and overall survival (P = .011). Although full-length LEF1 expression was similar to the controls in T-ALL, 50% (n = 15) of the ALL patients had increased full-length LEF1 protein expression. Imbalance between short- and full-length LEF1 isoforms may lead to cell survival in ALL. Beside the LEF1 activation, LEF1 gene variations were rarely observed in our cohort. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the Wnt pathway may have a pathogenic function in a group of ALL patients and high LEF1-total expression might be a marker for shorter relapse-free survival time in B cell ALL.","['Erbilgin, Yucel', 'Hatirnaz Ng, Ozden', 'Can, Ismail', 'Firtina, Sinem', 'Kucukcankurt, Fulya', 'Karaman, Serap', 'Karakas, Zeynep', 'Celkan, Tulin Tiraje', 'Zengin, Emine', 'Aylan Gelen, Sema', 'Nihal Ozdemir, Gul', 'Yildirmak, Yildiz', 'Dogru, Omer', 'Tansel, Turkan', 'Khodzhaev, Khusan', 'Toluk, Ozlem', 'Ozbek, Ugur', 'Sayitoglu, Muge']","['Erbilgin Y', 'Hatirnaz Ng O', 'Can I', 'Firtina S', 'Kucukcankurt F', 'Karaman S', 'Karakas Z', 'Celkan TT', 'Zengin E', 'Aylan Gelen S', 'Nihal Ozdemir G', 'Yildirmak Y', 'Dogru O', 'Tansel T', 'Khodzhaev K', 'Toluk O', 'Ozbek U', 'Sayitoglu M']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6969-6649', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7728-6527', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3370-8545', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5345-9072', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7287-1276', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7362-6130', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2528-2409', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8008-7553', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6495-0839', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5319-0547', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8648-213X']","['Department of Genetics, Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Genetics, Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Biology, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Institute of Health Sciences, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Institute of Health Sciences, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Faculty of Art and Science, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Istinye University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Institute of Health Sciences, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Altinbas University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Pediatric Hematology Oncology Department, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Pediatric Hematology Oncology Department, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology Department, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Kocaeli University, Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Kocaeli University, Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Hematology Division, Istanbul Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Education and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Hematology Division, Ministry of Health Sisli Etfal Education and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Department, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Istanbul Medical Faculty, Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Genetics, Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Institute of Health Sciences, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, Bezmialem Vakif University Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Genetics, Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Genetics, Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Genetics, Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['22740/Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit of Istanbul University', 'Turkish Society of Hematology Research Fund']",['Journal Article'],20210412,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'LEF1', 'biomarker', 'gene expression', 'prognosis']",2021/04/13 06:00,2021/11/30 06:00,['2021/04/12 13:01'],"['2020/12/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/30 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/12 13:01 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13513 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2021 Oct;43(5):1093-1103. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13513.

Although outcomes for low-risk AML have improved significantly over recent decades, high-risk AML continues to be associated with an adverse prognosis. Recent advances in molecular diagnostics, risk stratification, and supportive care have contributed to improvements in outcomes in pediatric AML. Targeted approaches, for example, the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors to treat FLT3-ITD AML, offer promise and are currently undergoing clinical investigation in pediatric patients. New approaches to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, including the use of haploidentical donors, are significantly expanding donor options for patients with high-risk AML.

We prospectively evaluated a weighted donor ranking algorithm designed to prioritize HLA-compatible unrelated donors (URDs) with weak inhibitory KIR3DL1/HLA-Bw4 interaction, followed by donors with nontolerized activating KIR2DS1, and finally those with KIR centromeric B haplotype. During donor evaluation, we performed KIR genotyping and ranked 2079 URDs for 527 subjects with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Among all patients, 394 (75%) had at least 1 KIR-advantageous donor, and 263 (50%) underwent HCT. In patients with AML, KIR3DL1 weak inhibition provided protection from relapse. Compared with KIR3DL1-Weak Inhibiting donors, KIR3DL1-Noninteracting donors were associated with increased risk of relapse (HR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.33-6.64; P = .008) and inferior event-free survival (EFS; HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.16-3.95; P = .015). KIR3DL1-Strong Inhibiting donors were associated with HR, 1.65 (95% CI, 0.66-4.08; P = .25) for AML relapse and HR, 1.6 (95% CI, 0.81-3.17; P = .1) for EFS when compared with the use of KIR3DL1-weak inhibiting donors. Donor KIR2DS1/HLA-C1 status and centromeric KIR haplotype-B content were not associated with decreased risk of AML relapse. There was no benefit to KIR-based donor selection in patients with MDS. This study demonstrates that donor KIR typing is feasible, and prioritization of donors with certain KIR3DL1 genotypes may confer a protection from relapse after HCT in patients with AML.","['Shaffer, Brian C', 'Le Luduec, Jean-Benoit', 'Park, Soo', 'Devlin, Sean', 'Archer, Anne', 'Davis, Eric', 'Cooper, Candice', 'Nhaissi, Melissa', 'Suri, Beth', 'Wells, Deborah', 'Tamari, Roni', 'Papadopoulos, Esperanza', 'Jakubowski, Ann A', 'Giralt, Sergio', 'Hsu, Katharine C']","['Shaffer BC', 'Le Luduec JB', 'Park S', 'Devlin S', 'Archer A', 'Davis E', 'Cooper C', 'Nhaissi M', 'Suri B', 'Wells D', 'Tamari R', 'Papadopoulos E', 'Jakubowski AA', 'Giralt S', 'Hsu KC']",,"['Adult Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Weill Cornell School of Medicine, New York, NY; and.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, and.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Weill Cornell School of Medicine, New York, NY; and.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Weill Cornell School of Medicine, New York, NY; and.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Weill Cornell School of Medicine, New York, NY; and.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Weill Cornell School of Medicine, New York, NY; and.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Weill Cornell School of Medicine, New York, NY; and.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program.']",['eng'],"['K23 HL140134/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA023766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR002384/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC8045509,,,2021/04/13 06:00,2021/06/01 06:00,['2021/04/12 12:43'],"['2020/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/12 12:43 [entrez]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(21)00252-4 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002701 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2021 Apr 13;5(7):2003-2011. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002701.,20210531,,IM,"['Genotype', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies']",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Assessment of measurable residual disease (MRD) offers a high-sensitivity evaluation for remaining disease present in a patient. MRD is not a surrogate marker for the detection of cancer cells, but rather a direct measure of them. MRD has quickly become an important measurement of response in patients with multiple myeloma and acute lymphocytic leukemia. Retrospective and prospective studies indicate that MRD-negative patients have better outcomes, particularly progression-free and overall survival, compared with patients who are MRD-positive. Two methods have emerged as the primary strategies for assessing MRD: next-generation sequencing (NGS) and next-generation flow (NGF). Both methods measure detectable disease in the bone marrow. The clonoSEQ(R) Assay, which uses NGS technology, is cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration for the detection and monitoring of MRD in bone marrow samples from patients with multiple myeloma or B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Importantly, this clinical activity has been found to translate to prolonged survival. With some treatments, these responses are now allowing patients to stop therapy after 1 or 2 years, a concept referred to as ""fixed duration."" However, not all patients experience these outcomes. How to determine which patients can safely stop treatment remains unclear. Minimal residual disease (MRD) is emerging as a prognostic biomarker. In CLL, undetectable MRD has been shown to correlate with prolonged progression-free survival and, in some cases, overall survival. The incorporation of MRD status into clinical decision-making is not yet widely done, primarily based on the lack of prospective clinical trial data. As the endpoint of MRD status becomes more common in clinical trials of CLL, the role in the clinical setting will become more clear. Furthermore, prognostic models will help to determine the utility of MRD as a surrogate endpoint in clinical studies. This monograph examines clinical trial data regarding the role of MRD in CLL, and provides recommendations on how to incorporate MRD assessment into clinical management.","['Cheson, Bruce D', 'Mato, Anthony R']","['Cheson BD', 'Mato AR']",,"['Lymphoma Research Foundation, New York, New York.', 'CLL Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,,,,2021/04/13 06:00,2021/06/08 06:00,['2021/04/12 12:40'],"['2021/04/12 12:40 [entrez]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/08 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2020 Jun;18 Suppl 10(6):1-20.,20210607,,IM,"['Clinical Decision-Making', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBSERVATION: We report 2 children who presented with hyperleukocytosis, subsequently diagnosed with infant acute myeloid leukemia, and both developed isolated central nervous system relapse while on chemotherapy. Both infants underwent successful bone marrow transplantation with myeloablative conditioning (thiotepa, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide) without radiation, followed by 12 empiric post-transplant lumbar punctures with intrathecal cytarabine. Both patients tolerated these therapies well, and are without infections, chronic graft-versus-host disease, or any post-transplant sequelae. CONCLUSION: Nonradiation-based conditioning followed by empiric central nervous system-directed intrathecal chemotherapy may be considered for high-risk infants with leukemia.","['Andolina, Jeffrey R', 'Fries, Carol', 'Boulware, Renee', 'Vargas, Alyssa', 'Fraint, Ellen', 'Barth, Matthew', 'Ambrusko, Steven', 'Comito, Melanie', 'Monteleone, Philip']","['Andolina JR', 'Fries C', 'Boulware R', 'Vargas A', 'Fraint E', 'Barth M', 'Ambrusko S', 'Comito M', 'Monteleone P']",,"[""Department of Pediatrics, Golisano Children's Hospital, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Golisano Children's Hospital, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Golisano Children's Hospital, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Golisano Children's Hospital, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital at Montefiore, New York."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Oshei Children's Hospital, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Oshei Children's Hospital, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital, Syracuse, NY."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital, Syracuse, NY.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,,,2021/04/13 06:00,2021/04/13 06:00,['2021/04/12 12:39'],"['2020/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/12 12:39 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MPH.0000000000002151 [doi]', '00043426-900000000-96921 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2022 Jan 1;44(1):e264-e267. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000002151.,,,IM,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In this case report, we present a 14-month-old boy diagnosed as T cell -ALL. Based on his early presentation, family history of childhood lymphoma, and high AFP, inherited predisposition was suspected, and genetic testing confirms A-T. This report represents the crucial part of clinical suspicion of A-T in similar cases as well as highlighting the importance of an early A-T diagnosis that prevents toxic death due to the extensive regimen of radio- chemotherapeutic agents.

In addition, DAC and LBH589 were shown to promote apoptosis in SKM-1 cells, and SPAG6-knockdown to enhance the pro-apoptotic effect of DAC. DAC could reduce PTEN methylation and increase PTEN expression in SKM-1 cells. SPAG6-knockdown and LBH589 treatment could increase DAC-mediated demethylation of PTEN promoter. Finally, a mouse model was constructed, and an enhanced efficacy of DAC following SPAG6-knockdown was confirmed in vivo. In conclusion, DAC-mediated apoptosis and PTEN promoter demethylation may be synergistically enhanced by SPAG6-silencing. Therefore, in the present study it was indicated that SPAG6 may be a potential target for demethylation therapy in MDS.","['Luo, Jie', 'Mu, Jiao', 'Zhang, Meng', 'Zhao, Beibei', 'Liu, Lin']","['Luo J', 'Mu J', 'Zhang M', 'Zhao B', 'Liu L']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Laboratory Research Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Laboratory Research Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Laboratory Research Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210410,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Myelodysplastic syndromes', '*PTEN', '*apoptosis', '*methylation', '*sperm-associated antigen 6']",2021/04/13 06:00,2021/10/26 06:00,['2021/04/12 12:27'],"['2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/12 12:27 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2021.1913148 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2021 Sep;62(9):2242-2252. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2021.1913148.

Bushen Yijing decoction (BSYJ) is used for treating SSc. However, its underlying mechanism remains unknown. The present study aims to investigate potential roles of Friend leukemia integration factor 1 (FLI1) and microRNA in the beneficial effects of BSYJ on SSc. Primary skin fibroblasts were isolated from healthy individuals and SSc patients through tissue-explant technique and validated by immunocytochemistry. mRNA and microRNA levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Protein expression was measured by western blotting. MiR-26a mimics or inhibitor were transfected to induce miR-26a overexpression or knockdown in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Histological changes of skin tissues from SSc mouse were evaluated by H&E and Masson trichrome staining. Results showed that FLI1 expression significantly decreased in primary skin fibroblasts of SSc patients. MiR-26a was predicted to target FLI1 untranslated region. Transfection of miR-26 mimics in SSc skin fibroblasts (SFB) leads to decrease in FLI1 expression and increase in collagen I gene expression and fibronectin accumulation. On the other hand, miR-26a knockdown increased FLI1 expression and decreased collagen I and fibronectin expression in SFB. In addition, BSYJ-containing rat serum suppressed miR-26a expression, while it elevated FLI1 expression and inhibited fibronectin and collagen I accumulation in SFB. In the mouse SSc model, BSYJ-containing serum inhibited dermal fibrosis by suppressing miR-26a expression and restoring FLI1 protein levels. Overall, our study demonstrates that BSYJ decoction exerts anti-dermal fibrosis in SSc patients via suppressing miR-26a level and thus to increase FLI1 expression in fibroblasts.","['Cheng, Zixuan', 'Zhang, Jialin', 'Deng, Wanying', 'Lin, Shaojian', 'Li, Donghai', 'Zhu, Ke', 'Qi, Qing']","['Cheng Z', 'Zhang J', 'Deng W', 'Lin S', 'Li D', 'Zhu K', 'Qi Q']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4306-3680'],"['Department of Dermatology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Clinical Medicine of Guangdong, Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Bioengineered,Bioengineered,101581063,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bushen Yijing decoction', '*FLI1', '*dermal fibrosis', '*miRNA-26a', '*systemic sclerosis skin fibroblast']",2021/04/13 06:00,2021/11/11 06:00,['2021/04/12 12:27'],"['2021/04/12 12:27 [entrez]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/21655979.2021.1907128 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioengineered. 2021 Dec;12(1):1212-1225. doi: 10.1080/21655979.2021.1907128.,20211110,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/metabolism', 'Fibrosis', 'Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/*metabolism', 'Scleroderma, Systemic/*drug therapy/*genetics', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Skin/pathology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ruxolitinib and venetoclax show a dose-dependent effect on T-ALL individually, but combination treatment reduces survival and proliferation of T-ALL in vitro. Using a xenograft model, the combination treatment fails to improve survival, with death from hind limb paralysis. Despite on-target inhibition by the drugs, histopathology demonstrates increased leukemic infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS) as compared to liver or bone marrow. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy shows that ruxolitinib and venetoclax insufficiently cross into the CNS. The addition of the CXCR4 inhibitor plerixafor with ruxolitinib and venetoclax reduces clinical scores and enhances survival. While combination therapy with ruxolitinib and venetoclax shows promise for treating T-ALL, additional inhibition of the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis may be needed to maximize the possibility of complete remission.","['Walker, Kirsti L', 'Rinella, Sean P', 'Hess, Nicholas J', 'Turicek, David P', 'Kabakov, Sabrina A', 'Zhu, Fen', 'Bouchlaka, Myriam N', 'Olson, Sydney L', 'Cho, Monica M', 'Quamine, Aicha E', 'Feils, Arika S', 'Gavcovich, Tara B', 'Rui, Lixin', 'Capitini, Christian M']","['Walker KL', 'Rinella SP', 'Hess NJ', 'Turicek DP', 'Kabakov SA', 'Zhu F', 'Bouchlaka MN', 'Olson SL', 'Cho MM', 'Quamine AE', 'Feils AS', 'Gavcovich TB', 'Rui L', 'Capitini CM']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5720-9305', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2276-6731']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.']",['eng'],"['TL1 TR002375/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA174750/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008692/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA187299/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA215461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007899/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R33 DK070297/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 GM064598/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20210411,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,PMC8432301,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCL2', '*JAK/STAT', '*T cell', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*plerixafor', '*ruxolitniib', '*venetoclax']",2021/04/13 06:00,2021/05/20 06:00,['2021/04/12 12:26'],"['2022/05/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/20 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/12 12:26 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2021.1910684 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2021 May;62(5):1167-1177. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2021.1910684.

The inhibitory priority of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (such as Bcl-xL) to pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (such as Bad, tBid and Bax) determines the outcome of their interactions. Based on over-expression model system, we here evaluate the inhibitory priority of Bcl-xL to Bad, tBid and Bax by using live-cell imaging assay on cell viability. Fluorescence images of living cells co-expressing CFP-Bcl-xL and YFP-Bad or YFP-tBid or YFP-Bax showed that Bcl-xL markedly inhibited Bad/tBid/Bax-mediated apoptosis, revealing that Bcl-xL inhibits the proapoptotic function of Bad, tBid and Bax. In the case of equimolar co-expression of Bad and CFP-Bcl-xL, the inhibition of Bcl-xL on tBid/Bax mediate-apoptosis was completely relieved. Moreover, co-expression of tBid-P2A-CFP-Bcl-xL significantly relieved the inhibition of Bcl-xL on the pro-apoptotic ability Bax, suggesting that Bcl-xL preferentially inhibits the pro-apoptotic ability of Bad over tBid, subsequently to Bax.","['Wu, Ge', 'Tu, Zhuang', 'Yang, Fangfang', 'Mai, Zihao', 'Chen, Hongce', 'Tang, Qiling', 'Ye, Xianxin', 'Wang, Kunhao', 'Wang, Xiaoping', 'Chen, Tongsheng']","['Wu G', 'Tu Z', 'Yang F', 'Mai Z', 'Chen H', 'Tang Q', 'Ye X', 'Wang K', 'Wang X', 'Chen T']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2373-6531'],"['Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, Ministry of Education, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, Ministry of Education, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, Ministry of Education, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, Ministry of Education, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, Ministry of Education, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, Ministry of Education, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, Ministry of Education, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, Ministry of Education, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Pain Management, The First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, Ministry of Education, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'SCNU Qingyuan Institute of Science and Technology Innovation Co.

Whilst establishing CSC identity remains challenging in most cancers, studies of low-intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), other chronic myeloid malignancies and clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminant potential (CHIP) strongly support that the primary target cell usually resides in the rare haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment. This probably reflects the unique self-renewal potential of HSCs in normal human haematopoiesis, combined with the somatic initiating genomic driver lesion not conferring extensive self-renewal potential to downstream progenitor cells. Mutational 'fate mapping' further supports that HSCs are the only disease-propagating cells in low-intermediate risk MDS, but that MDS-propagating potential might be extended to progenitors upon disease progression. The clinical importance of MDS stem cells has been highlighted through the demonstration of selective persistence of MDS stem cells in patients at complete remission in response to therapy. This implies that MDS stem cells might possess unique resistance mechanisms responsible for relapses following otherwise efficient treatments. Specific surveillance of MDS stem cells should be considered to assess the efficiency of therapies and as an early indicator of emerging relapses in patients in clinical remission. Moreover, further molecular characterization of purified MDS stem cells should facilitate identification and validation of improved and more stem cell-specific therapies for MDS.","['Woll, P S', 'Jacobsen, S E W']","['Woll PS', 'Jacobsen SEW']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2340-2526'],"['From the, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'From the, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],['MC_UU_12009/5/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20210412,England,J Intern Med,Journal of internal medicine,8904841,,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer stem cells', '*haematopoietic stem cells', '*myelodysplastic syndromes']",2021/04/13 06:00,2021/10/12 06:00,['2021/04/12 06:36'],"['2021/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2021/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/12 06:36 [entrez]']",['10.1111/joim.13283 [doi]'],ppublish,J Intern Med. 2021 May;289(5):650-661. doi: 10.1111/joim.13283.

BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is the most frequent cause of vertebral compression fracture, with trauma and pathologic vertebral weakening being other common causes. Since secondary fractures at imaging investigation can present as simple compression fractures, it is important to identify an underlying pathology. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the frequency of unexpected positive histology in vertebral samples withdrawn from patients undergoing a vertebroplasty to evaluate if a vertebral biopsy can routinely be used in case of VCF and when a secondary cause is not suspected. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the results of 324 biopsies performed from February 2003 to March 2019 just before vertebroplasty in 1183 patients diagnosed with one or more vertebral compression fractures and with no history of neoplastic or hematological diseases and with no suspicious findings for secondary fractures at imaging. RESULTS: Biopsy was not diagnostic in 9/324 cases (2.8%); osteoporosis was the diagnosis in 295 cases (91%); in the remaining 20 cases (6.2%), histology was positive for an underlying pathology: 12/20 (60% of positive cases) multiple myeloma; 5/20 (25%) lymphoma/leukemia; 1/20 (5%) spondylitis; 1/20 (5%) metastasis; 1/20 (5%) hemangioma. A significantly higher incidence of positive biopsies was found in patients younger than 73 (p = 0.01) with 17 of 20 (85%) positive biopsies. No complications related to the bioptic maneuver were found, according to CIRSE guidelines on percutaneous needle biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Vertebral biopsy is a safe procedure with no related complications. In our series, an unexpected diagnosis was found in 6% of cases with impact on patient's clinical management. Positive unexpected histology was significantly higher in younger patients. In conclusion, we believe that a biopsy is useful and should be performed on all patients with vertebral compression fractures before a vertebroplasty.","['Sozzi, Carlo', 'Trentadue, Mirko', 'Nicoli, Lisa', 'Tavani, Federica', 'Piovan, Enrico']","['Sozzi C', 'Trentadue M', 'Nicoli L', 'Tavani F', 'Piovan E']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5942-7995'],"['SC Neuroradiologia, ASST Carlo Poma, Str.

ERG (ETS-related gene) is an important member of the E26 transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factor family that plays a crucial role in physiological and pathological processes. However, the role of ERG and its modification in leukemia remains underexplored. In the present study, we stably knocked down or overexpressed ERG in leukemia cells and observed that ERG significantly promotes the proliferation and inhibits the differentiation of AML (acute myeloid leukemia) cells. Further experiments showed that ERG was primarily modified by SUMO2, which was deconjugated by SENP2. PML promotes the SUMOylation of ERG, enhancing its stability. Arsenic trioxide decreased the expression level of ERG, further promoting cell differentiation. Furthermore, the mutation of SUMO sites in ERG inhibited its ability to promote the proliferation and inhibit the differentiation of leukemia cells. Our results demonstrated the crucial role of ERG SUMOylation in the development of AML, providing powerful targeted therapeutic strategies for the clinical treatment of AML.","['Chen, Xu', 'Qin,

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), leukemic stem/progenitor cells (LSC) anchored in the protective BM microenvironment, reprogram and transform this niche into a leukemia-supporting and chemoprotective environment. One most important player involved in this crosstalk are CXCL12, produced by the BM mesenchymal stromal cells, and its receptor CXCR4, present onto HSC. The downstream molecular mechanisms involved in CXCL12/CXCR4 axis have many targets, including the Src family members of non-receptor tyrosine kinase (SFK). We herein study the role of one SFK member, the Hematopoietic Cell Kinase (HCK), in CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway and its contribution to the AML pathogenesis. We verified that the inhibition of HCK severely impaired CXCL12-induced migration of leukemic cell lines and CD34 positive cells from AML patients bone marrow, through a disruption of the activation of CXCL12/CXCR4/PI3K/AKT and CXCL12/CXCR4/MAPK/ERK signaling, and by a decreased cytoskeleton dynamic through a lower rate of actin polymerization. We provide new insights into the key role of HCK in conferring a migratory advantage to leukemic cells thought CXCL12/CXCR4 axis. HCK represents an important protein of the main pathway involved in the crosstalk between HSC, and their surrounding milieu. Thus, HCK inhibition could represent a novel approach for the treatment of the acute myeloid leukemia.","['Roversi, Fernanda Marconi', 'Bueno, Maura Lima Pereira', 'Pericole, Fernando Viera', 'Saad, Sara Teresinha Olalla']","['Roversi FM', 'Bueno MLP', 'Pericole FV', 'Saad STO']",,"['Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Brazil.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210325,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,PMC8027121,['NOTNLM'],"['CXCL12/CXCR4 axis', 'PI3K/MAPK pathway', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'bone marrow-pathology', 'cancer therapeutic target', 'crosstalk', 'hematopoietic cell kinase']",2021/04/13 06:00,2021/04/13 06:01,['2021/04/12 06:24'],"['2020/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/12 06:24 [entrez]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.634044 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Mar 25;9:634044. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.634044. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Roversi, Bueno, Pericole and Saad.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the expression and role of FLVCR1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain largely unknown. Methods: FLVCR1 expression in tissues was measured by immunohistochemical staining (IHC). Celigo assay, MTT assay, colony formation, caspase 3/7 activity analysis, wound healing assay, Transwell migration, and invasion assay were applied to assess the effects of FLVCR1 on ESCC tumorigenesis. Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) were used to identify protein interactions with FLVCR1. An in vivo imaging system (IVIS) was used to investigate the functions of FLVCR1 on the growth and metastatic capability of ESCC cells in a xenograft model and a tail vein metastasis model. Results: Elevated expression of FLVCR1 was detected in ESCC tissues and predicted poor survival. Upregulated FLVCR1 was positively correlated with lymph node metastasis (N stage) and late tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. FLVCR1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation ability, induced cell apoptosis, and repressed cell migration and invasion of ESCC in vitro. Inhibition of FLVCR1 markedly repressed tumorigenicity and metastasis of ESCC cells in vivo. Mechanistically, chromosome segregation 1-like (CSE1L) was identified to interact with FLVCR1 using a Co-IP assay. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of FLVCR1 knockdown on proliferation and migration was counteracted by the exogenous expression of CSE1L. Conclusion: FLVCR1 plays a pivotal role in ESCC cell survival, growth, and migration. These functions may be partially dependent upon the protein interaction between FLVCR1 and CSE1L. In addition, FLVCR1 can be applied as a clinical prognostic marker for patients with ESCC.","['Zhou, Suna', 'Zhang, Mingxin', 'Zhou, Chao', 'Meng, Yinnan', 'Yang, Haihua', 'Ye, Wenguang']","['Zhou S', 'Zhang M', 'Zhou C', 'Meng Y', 'Yang H', 'Ye W']",,"['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Radiation Oncology, The Affiliated Taizhou Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Taizhou, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The Affiliated Taizhou Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Taizhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Minimally Invasive Techniques & Rapid Rehabilitation of Digestive System Tumor of Zhejiang Province, Taizhou, China.', ""Department of Gastroenterology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Medical University, Xi'an, China."", 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Radiation Oncology, The Affiliated Taizhou Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Taizhou, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The Affiliated Taizhou Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Taizhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Minimally Invasive Techniques & Rapid Rehabilitation of Digestive System Tumor of Zhejiang Province, Taizhou, China.', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Radiation Oncology, The Affiliated Taizhou Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Taizhou, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The Affiliated Taizhou Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Taizhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Minimally Invasive Techniques & Rapid Rehabilitation of Digestive System Tumor of Zhejiang Province, Taizhou, China.', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Radiation Oncology, The Affiliated Taizhou Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Taizhou, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The Affiliated Taizhou Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Taizhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Minimally Invasive Techniques & Rapid Rehabilitation of Digestive System Tumor of Zhejiang Province, Taizhou, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, The Affiliated Taizhou Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Taizhou, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210325,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC8027484,['NOTNLM'],"['CSE1L', 'ESCC', 'FLVCR1', 'growth', 'migration']",2021/04/13 06:00,2021/04/13 06:01,['2021/04/12 06:23'],"['2021/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/12 06:23 [entrez]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.660955 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Mar 25;11:660955. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.660955. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhou, Zhang, Zhou, Meng, Yang and Ye.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the differentiation therapy of ATRA-based treatment has not been effective in other subtypes of AML. In this study, we evaluated a small molecule of ent-kaurene diterpenoid, Jiyuan oridonin A (JOA), on the differentiation blockade in AML cells with the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene rearrangements (MLLr) in MV4-11, MOLM-13 and THP-1 cells. We found that JOA could significantly inhibit the proliferation of MOLM-13, MV4-11 and THP-1 cells. Moreover, JOA promoted cell differentiation coupled with cell-cycle exit at G0/G1 and inhibited the colony- forming capacity of these cells. We showed that the anti-proliferative effect of JOA attributed to cell differentiation is most likely through the martens tretinoin response up pathway in the MOLM-13 cell line, and the hematopoietic cell lineage pathway by the inhibition of c-KIT expression and cell adhesion pathway in the THP-1 cell line.

NSC765598 is a novel small molecule derivative of salicylanilide. This study aims to investigate the ligand-protein interactions of NSC765598 with its potential targets and to evaluate its anticancer activities in vitro. Methods: We used multi-computational tools and clinical databases, respectively, to identify the potential drug target for NSC765598 and analyze the genetic profile and prognostic relevance of the targets in multiple cancers. We evaluated the in vitro anticancer activities against the National Cancer Institute 60 (NCI60) human tumor cell lines and used molecular docking to study the ligand-protein interactions. Finally, we used the DTP-COMPARE algorithm to compare the NSC765598 anticancer fingerprints with NCI standard agents. Results: We identified mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)/mitogen-activated protein 2 kinase 1 (MAP2K1)/fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)/transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFB1) as potential targets for NSC765598. The targets were enriched in cancer-associated pathways, were overexpressed and were of prognostic relevance in multiple cancers. Among the identified targets, genetic alterations occurred most frequently in EGFR (7%), particularly in glioblastoma, esophageal squamous cell cancer, head and neck squamous cell cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer, and were associated with poor prognoses and survival of patients, while other targets were less frequently altered. NSC765598 displayed selective antiproliferative and cytotoxic preferences for NSCLC (50% growth inhibition (GI50) = 1.12-3.95 microM; total growth inhibition (TGI) = 3.72-16.60 muM), leukemia (GI50 = 1.20-3.10 microM; TGI = 3.90-12.70 muM), melanoma (GI50 = 1.45-3.59 microM), and renal cancer (GI50 = 1.38-3.40 microM; TGI = 4.84-13.70 muM) cell lines, while panels of colon, breast, ovarian, prostate, and central nervous system (CNS) cancer cell lines were less sensitive to NSC765598. Interestingly, NSC765598 docked well into the binding cavity of the targets by conventional H-bonds, van der Waal forces, and a variety of pi-interactions, with higher preferences for EGFR (DeltaG = -11.0 kcal/mol), NOS2 (DeltaG = -11.0 kcal/mol), and mTOR (DeltaG = -8.8 kcal/mol). NSC765598 shares similar anti-cancer fingerprints with NCI standard agents displayed acceptable physicochemical values and met the criteria of drug-likeness. Conclusion: NSC765598 displayed significant anticancer and potential multi-target properties, thus serve as a novel candidate worthy of further preclinical studies.","['Lawal, Bashir', 'Lee, Ching-Yu', 'Mokgautsi, Ntlotlang', 'Sumitra, Maryam Rachmawati', 'Khedkar, Harshita', 'Wu, Alexander T H', 'Huang, Hsu-Shan']","['Lawal B', 'Lee CY', 'Mokgautsi N', 'Sumitra MR', 'Khedkar H', 'Wu ATH', 'Huang HS']",,"['PhD Program for Cancer Molecular Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University and Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute for Cancer Biology & Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Orthopaedics, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'PhD Program for Cancer Molecular Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University and Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute for Cancer Biology & Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'PhD Program for Cancer Molecular Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University and Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute for Cancer Biology & Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'PhD Program for Cancer Molecular Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University and Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute for Cancer Biology & Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'TMU Research Center of Cancer Translational Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'The PhD Program of Translational Medicine, College of Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Clinical Research Center, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'PhD Program for Cancer Molecular Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University and Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute for Cancer Biology & Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'School of Pharmacy, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'PhD Program in Biotechnology Research and Development, College of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210326,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC8034425,['NOTNLM'],"['NSC765598', 'anticancer activity', 'molecular docking', 'multi-omics study', 'multi-target small molecule', 'protein-ligand interaction']",2021/04/13 06:00,2021/04/13 06:01,['2021/04/12 06:23'],"['2021/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/12 06:23 [entrez]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.656738 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Mar 26;11:656738. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.656738. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Lawal, Lee, Mokgautsi, Sumitra, Khedkar, Wu and Huang.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A second therapy approach, supported by preclinical research, also suggests that CSF1R-targeted therapy may increase the beneficial effect of conventional and novel therapeutics. Experimental evidence positioning inhibitors of CSF1R as treatment should, together with data from preclinical and early phase clinical trials, facilitate translation and clinical development of CSF1R-targeted therapy for AML.","['Sletta, Kristine Yttersian', 'Castells, Oriol', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore']","['Sletta KY', 'Castells O', 'Gjertsen BT']",,"['CCBIO, Centre for Cancer Biomarkers, Department of Clinical Science, Precision Oncology Research Group, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology Section, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'CCBIO, Centre for Cancer Biomarkers, Department of Clinical Science, Precision Oncology Research Group, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology Section, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210325,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC8027480,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'biomarkers', 'colony stimulating factor 1 receptor', 'signal transduction', 'targeted therapy', 'therapy development', 'tumor-stroma']",2021/04/13 06:00,2021/04/13 06:01,['2021/04/12 06:23'],"['2021/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/12 06:23 [entrez]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.654817 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Mar 25;11:654817. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.654817. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Sletta, Castells and Gjertsen.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once it progresses into the phase of blast crisis (CML-BP), the curative effect is poor, and the fatality rate is extremely high. Therefore, it is urgent to explore the molecular mechanisms of blast crisis and identify new therapeutic targets. Methods: The expression levels of miR-181d, RBP2 and NF-kappaB p65 were assessed in 42 newly diagnosed CML-CP patients and 15 CML-BP patients. Quantitative real-time PCR, Western blots, and cell proliferation assay were used to characterize the changes induced by overexpression or inhibition of miR-181d, RBP2 or p65. Luciferase reporter assay and ChIP assay was conducted to establish functional association between miR-181d, RBP2 and p65. Inhibition of miR-181d expression and its consequences in tumor growth was demonstrated in vivo models. Results: We found that miR-181d was overexpressed in CML-BP, which promoted leukemia cell proliferation. Histone demethylase RBP2 was identified as a direct target of miR-181d which downregulated RBP2 expression. Moreover, RBP2 inhibited transcriptional expression of NF-kappaB subunit, p65 by binding to its promoter and demethylating the tri/dimethylated H3K4 region in the p65 promoter locus. In turn, p65 directly bound to miR-181d promoter and upregulated its expression. Therefore, RBP2 inhibition resulting from miR-181d overexpression led to p65 upregulation which further forwarded miR-181d expression. This miR-181d/RBP2/p65 feedback regulation caused sustained NF-kappaB activation, which contributed to the development of CML-BP. Conclusions: Taken together, the miR-181d/RBP2/p65 feedback regulation promoted CML-BP and miR-181d may serve as a potential therapeutic target of CML-BP.","['Zhou, Minran', 'Yin, Xiaolin', 'Zheng, Lixin', 'Fu, Yue', 'Wang, Yue', 'Cui, Zelong', 'Gao, Zhenxing', 'Wang, Xiaoming', 'Huang, Tao', 'Jia, Jihui', 'Chen, Chunyan']","['Zhou M', 'Yin X', 'Zheng L', 'Fu Y', 'Wang Y', 'Cui Z', 'Gao Z', 'Wang X', 'Huang T', 'Jia J', 'Chen C']",,"['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Microbiology/Key Laboratory for Experimental Teratology of the Chinese Ministry of Education, School of Basic Medical Science, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Microbiology/Key Laboratory for Experimental Teratology of the Chinese Ministry of Education, School of Basic Medical Science, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Microbiology/Key Laboratory for Experimental Teratology of the Chinese Ministry of Education, School of Basic Medical Science, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210325,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC8027495,['NOTNLM'],"['CML blast crisis', 'RBP2', 'cell proliferation', 'miR-181d', 'p65']",2021/04/13 06:00,2021/04/13 06:01,['2021/04/12 06:23'],"['2021/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/12 06:23 [entrez]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.654411 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Mar 25;11:654411. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.654411. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhou, Yin, Zheng, Fu, Wang, Cui, Gao, Wang, Huang, Jia and', 'Chen.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Survival of children with ALL has dramatically improved over the last few decades, and is now over 90% (versus 40% of adult patients) in developed countries, except for in infants (i.e., children < 1 year), where no significant improvement was registered. Philadelphia positive ALL (Ph+ALL) accounts for around 3% of cases of childhood ALL, its incidence increasing with patient's age. Before the era of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs), pediatric Ph+ALL showed a worse prognosis in comparison to other forms of ALL, and was managed with intensive chemotherapy, followed, whenever possible, by allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in first morphological complete remission. TKIs have revolutionized the current clinical approach, which involves combinations of imatinib plus standard chemotherapy that can abrogate the negative prognostic impact conferred by the presence of BCR/ABL1 rearrangement, resulting in the probability of event-free survival (EFS) being significantly better than that recorded in the pre-TKI era. Long-term follow-up confirms these data, questioning the role of a real advantage offered by HSCT over intensive chemotherapy plus TKI in all Ph+ALL pediatric patients. Imatinib was the first generation TKI and the prototype of targeted therapy, but over the years second- (dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib) and third-generation (ponatinib) TKIs showed a capacity to overcome resistance to imatinib in Ph+ hematological neoplasms. Given the effectiveness of the first-in-class TKI, imatinib, also the second-generation TKI dasatinib was incorporated in the treatment regimens of Ph+ALL. In this manuscript, we will discuss the role of this drug in pediatric Ph+ALL, analyzing the available data published to date.","['Cerchione, Claudio', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Martinelli, Giovanni']","['Cerchione C', 'Locatelli F', 'Martinelli G']",,"['Hematology Unit, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Italy.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Cell and Gene Therapy, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Rome, Sapienza, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210325,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC8027101,['NOTNLM'],"['Philadelphia positive', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'children', 'dasatinib', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2021/04/13 06:00,2021/04/13 06:01,['2021/04/12 06:23'],"['2020/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/12 06:23 [entrez]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.632231 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Mar 25;11:632231. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.632231. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Cerchione, Locatelli and Martinelli.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research is revealing that the tumor microenvironment (TME) differs between different types of lymphoma, covering inflamed environments, as exemplified by Hodgkin lymphoma, to non-inflamed TMEs as seen in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or diffuse-large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In this review we consider how T cells and interferon-driven inflammatory signaling contribute to the regulation of anti-tumor immune responses, as well as sensitivity to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. We discuss tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms critical to anti-tumor immune responses, as well as sensitivity to immunotherapies, before adding an additional layer of complexity within the TME: the immunoregulatory role of non-hematopoietic stromal cells that co-evolve with tumors. Studying the intricate interactions between the immune-stroma lymphoma TME should help to design next-generation immunotherapies and combination treatment strategies to overcome complex TME-driven immune suppression.","['Apollonio, Benedetta', 'Ioannou, Nikolaos', 'Papazoglou, Despoina', 'Ramsay, Alan G']","['Apollonio B', 'Ioannou N', 'Papazoglou D', 'Ramsay AG']",,"[""Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", ""Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", ""Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", ""Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210325,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC8027510,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR T', 'T cells', 'anti-PD1', 'immunotherapy', 'interferon', 'lymphoma', 'stroma', 'tumor microenviroment']",2021/04/13 06:00,2021/04/13 06:01,['2021/04/12 06:23'],"['2020/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/12 06:23 [entrez]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.626818 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Mar 25;11:626818. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.626818. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Apollonio, Ioannou, Papazoglou and Ramsay.']",,,,,"['AGR has received research funding to Institution from Bristol-Myers Squibb Roche', 'Glycart AG and AstraZeneca.

The endothelial damage that leads to this histological lesion can be triggered by several conditions or diseases, hindering an early diagnosis and aetiological treatment. However, due to systemic involvement in TMA and its low incidence, an accurate early diagnosis is often troublesome. In the last few decades, major improvements have been made in the pathophysiological knowledge of TMAs such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [TTP, caused by ADAMTS-13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin Type 1 motif, member 13) deficiency] and atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS, associated with dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway), together with enhancements in patient management due to new diagnostic tools and treatments. However, diagnosis of aHUS requires the exclusion of all the other entities that can cause TMA, delaying the introduction of terminal complement blockers, which have shown high efficacy in haemolysis control and especially in avoiding organ damage if used early. Importantly, there is increasing evidence that other forms of TMA could present overactivation of the complement system, worsening their clinical progression. This review addresses the diagnostic and therapeutic approach when there is clinical suspicion of TMA, emphasizing complement evaluation as a potential tool for the inclusive diagnosis of aHUS, as well as for the improvement of current knowledge of its pathophysiological involvement in other TMAs. The development of both new complement activation biomarkers and inhibitory treatments will probably improve the management of TMA patients in the near future, reducing response times and improving patient outcomes.","['Blasco, Miquel', 'Guillen, Elena', 'Quintana, Luis F', 'Garcia-Herrera, Adriana', 'Pineiro, Gaston', 'Poch, Esteban', 'Carreras, Enric', 'Campistol, Josep M', 'Diaz-Ricart, Maribel', 'Palomo, Marta']","['Blasco M', 'Guillen E', 'Quintana LF', 'Garcia-Herrera A', 'Pineiro G', 'Poch E', 'Carreras E', 'Campistol JM', 'Diaz-Ricart M', 'Palomo M']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0789-7992', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7582-8476', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6492-024X']","['Department of Nephrology and Kidney Transplantation, Hospital Clinic, Centro de Referencia en Enfermedad Glomerular Compleja del Sistema Nacional de Salud (CSUR), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer (IDIPABS), Malalties Nefro-Urologiques i Trasplantament Renal, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Nephrology and Kidney Transplantation, Hospital Clinic, Centro de Referencia en Enfermedad Glomerular Compleja del Sistema Nacional de Salud (CSUR), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Nephrology and Kidney Transplantation, Hospital Clinic, Centro de Referencia en Enfermedad Glomerular Compleja del Sistema Nacional de Salud (CSUR), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer (IDIPABS), Malalties Nefro-Urologiques i Trasplantament Renal, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Nephrology and Kidney Transplantation, Hospital Clinic, Centro de Referencia en Enfermedad Glomerular Compleja del Sistema Nacional de Salud (CSUR), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer (IDIPABS), Malalties Nefro-Urologiques i Trasplantament Renal, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Nephrology and Kidney Transplantation, Hospital Clinic, Centro de Referencia en Enfermedad Glomerular Compleja del Sistema Nacional de Salud (CSUR), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer (IDIPABS), Malalties Nefro-Urologiques i Trasplantament Renal, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Hospital Clinic/University of Barcelona Campus, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Barcelona Endothelium Team, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Nephrology and Kidney Transplantation, Hospital Clinic, Centro de Referencia en Enfermedad Glomerular Compleja del Sistema Nacional de Salud (CSUR), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer (IDIPABS), Malalties Nefro-Urologiques i Trasplantament Renal, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Barcelona Endothelium Team, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Unit, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Biomedical Diagnosis Centre (CDB), Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Hospital Clinic/University of Barcelona Campus, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Barcelona Endothelium Team, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Unit, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Biomedical Diagnosis Centre (CDB), Institute of Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201106,England,Clin Kidney J,Clinical kidney journal,101579321,PMC8023218,['NOTNLM'],"['C5b-9 deposits', 'complement system', 'endothelial cells (ECs)', 'membrane attack complex (C5b-9)', 'soluble C5b-9', 'thrombotic microangiopathies']",2021/04/13 06:00,2021/04/13 06:01,['2021/04/12 06:20'],"['2020/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/12 06:20 [entrez]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1093/ckj/sfaa195 [doi]', 'sfaa195 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Kidney J. 2020 Nov 6;14(4):1055-1066. doi: 10.1093/ckj/sfaa195. eCollection 2021 Apr.,,,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

In order to explore the anticancer activity based on interaction between limonin and NQO1, Human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) were studied in vitro. We found that limonin could inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis of HL-60 cells, and the effect was positively correlated with its dosage. Western blot results showed that limonin could activate the endogenous apoptosis pathway mediated by mitochondria via up-regulating pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, cytochrome c, Caspase3, and Caspase9) and down-regulating anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2), thus inhibiting the proliferation of HL-60 cells and promoting apoptosis, which further proved the anticancer activity of limonin from the molecular mechanism. At the same time, limonin down-regulated the expression of NQO1, indicating that limonin may indirectly act on the apoptosis pathway by regulating the expression activity of antioxidant enzymes in vivo, thus exerting its inhibitory effect on tumor cells, which provides an idea for the molecular mechanism that natural products can indirectly exert their anticancer effect by regulating the activity of antioxidant enzymes.","['Chen, Yunyi', 'Liang, Jiaojiao', 'Liang, Xiao', 'Chen, Jiebiao', 'Wang, Yue', 'Cao, Jinping', 'Sun, Chongde', 'Ye, Jiaming', 'Chen, Qingjun']","['Chen Y', 'Liang J', 'Liang X', 'Chen J', 'Wang Y', 'Cao J', 'Sun C', 'Ye J', 'Chen Q']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4976-1551'],"['Laboratory of Fruit Quality Biology/The State Agriculture Ministry Laboratory of Horticultural Plant Growth, Development and Quality Improvement Zhejiang University Hangzhou China.', 'Laboratory of Fruit Quality Biology/The State Agriculture Ministry Laboratory of Horticultural Plant Growth, Development and Quality Improvement Zhejiang University Hangzhou China.', 'Laboratory of Fruit Quality Biology/The State Agriculture Ministry Laboratory of Horticultural Plant Growth, Development and Quality Improvement Zhejiang University Hangzhou China.', 'Laboratory of Fruit Quality Biology/The State Agriculture Ministry Laboratory of Horticultural Plant Growth, Development and Quality Improvement Zhejiang University Hangzhou China.', 'Laboratory of Fruit Quality Biology/The State Agriculture Ministry Laboratory of Horticultural Plant Growth, Development and Quality Improvement Zhejiang University Hangzhou China.', 'Laboratory of Fruit Quality Biology/The State Agriculture Ministry Laboratory of Horticultural Plant Growth, Development and Quality Improvement Zhejiang University Hangzhou China.', 'Laboratory of Fruit Quality Biology/The State Agriculture Ministry Laboratory of Horticultural Plant Growth, Development and Quality Improvement Zhejiang University Hangzhou China.', 'Zanyu Technology Qingshan Lake Science and Technology City Hangzhou China.', 'Zanyu Technology Qingshan Lake Science and Technology City Hangzhou China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210302,United States,Food Sci Nutr,Food science & nutrition,101605473,PMC8020947,['NOTNLM'],"['NQO1', 'antioxidant enzymes', 'cancer', 'cell apoptosis', 'limonin']",2021/04/13 06:00,2021/04/13 06:01,['2021/04/12 06:20'],"['2020/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/12 06:20 [entrez]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1002/fsn3.2109 [doi]', 'FSN32109 [pii]']",epublish,Food Sci Nutr. 2021 Mar 2;9(4):1860-1869. doi: 10.1002/fsn3.2109. eCollection 2021 Apr.,,,,,"['(c) 2021 The Authors.

The therapeutic drugs currently used to treat APL have adverse effects. 20(S)-ginsenoside Rh2 (GRh2) is an anticancer medicine with high effectiveness and low toxicity. However, the underlying anticancer mechanisms of GRh2-induced PML-RARA degradation and apoptosis in human APL cell line (NB4 cells) remain unclear. Methods: Apoptosis-related indicators and PML-RARA expression were determined to investigate the effect of GRh2 on NB4 cells. Z-VAD-FMK, LY294002, and C 87, as inhibitors of caspase, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha ) pathways were used to clarify the relationship between GRh2-induced apoptosis and PML-RARA degradation. Results: GRh2 dose- and time-dependently decreased NB4 cell viability. GRh2-induced apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and caspase3, caspase8, and caspase9 activation in NB4 cells after a 12-hour treatment. GRh2-induced apoptosis in NB4 cells was accompanied by massive production of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial damage and upregulated Bax/Bcl-2 expression. GRh2 also induced PML/PML-RARA degradation, PML nuclear bodies formation, and activation of the downstream p53 pathway in NB4 cells. Z-VAD-FMK inhibited caspase activation and significantly reversed GRh2-induced apoptosis and PML-RARA degradation. GRh2 also upregulated TNF-alpha expression and inhibited Akt phosphorylation. LY294002, an inhibitor of the PI3K pathway, enhanced the antitumor effects of GRh2, and C 87, an inhibitor of the TNF-alpha pathway, reversed NB4 cell viability, and GRh2-mediated apoptosis in a caspase-8-dependent manner. Conclusion: GRh2 induced caspase-dependent PML-RARA degradation and apoptosis in NB4 cells via the Akt/Bax/caspase9 and TNF-alpha/caspase8 pathways.","['Zhu, Sirui', 'Liu, Xiaoli', 'Xue, Mei', 'Li, Yu', 'Cai, Danhong', 'Wang, Shijun', 'Zhang, Liang']","['Zhu S', 'Liu X', 'Xue M', 'Li Y', 'Cai D', 'Wang S', 'Zhang L']",,"['Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Pharmacology and Safety Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210023, PR China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Pharmacology and Safety Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210023, PR China.', 'College of Basic Medical Sciences, Institute of TCM-related Comorbid Depression, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210023, PR China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Pharmacology and Safety Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210023, PR China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Pharmacology and Safety Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210023, PR China.', 'Shandong co-innovation center of TCM formula, College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong, 250035, PR China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Pharmacology and Safety Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210023, PR China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200515,Korea (South),J Ginseng Res,Journal of ginseng research,100890690,PMC8020289,['NOTNLM'],"['20(S)-ginsenoside Rh2', 'Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspase', 'PML-RARA']",2021/04/13 06:00,2021/04/13 06:01,['2021/04/12 06:14'],"['2019/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/12 06:14 [entrez]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.jgr.2020.05.001 [doi]', 'S1226-8453(20)30087-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Ginseng Res. 2021 Mar;45(2):295-304. doi: 10.1016/j.jgr.2020.05.001.

However, some cases of EBL onset in young beef cattle have been reported in Japan. The mechanism for early EBL onset is unclear. In Japan, beef cattle are given large amounts of concentrated feed with low vitamin A. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are regulators of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and thought to represent one of the key players in tumor malignancy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the differences in BMP-6 methylation status between EBL beef cattle under 3 years old and other cattle. We investigated the methylation status of the BMP-6 promoter region in 32 EBL beef cattle under 3 years old. We also compared the methylation status of EBL dairy cattle to that of healthy cattle. Median methylation rate of the BMP-6 promoter region in EBL beef cattle under 3 years old was 8.9%, which was significantly higher than that of other groups. Hypermethylation of the BMP-6 promoter region might contribute to early onset of EBL in beef cattle under 3 years old, and animal feeding management practices specific to beef cattle may affect the methylation status of the BMP-6 promoter region.","['Maezawa, Masaki', 'Watanabe, Ken-Ichi', 'Matsumoto, Kotaro', 'Kobayashi, Yoshiyasu', 'Ogawa, Haruko', 'Inokuma, Hisashi']","['Maezawa M', 'Watanabe KI', 'Matsumoto K', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Ogawa H', 'Inokuma H']",,"['Veterinary Medical Center, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine, Inada, Obihiro, Hokkaido 080-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine, Inada, Obihiro, Hokkaido 080-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine, Inada, Obihiro, Hokkaido 080-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine, Inada, Obihiro, Hokkaido 080-8555, Japan.', 'Veterinary Medical Center, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210409,Japan,J Vet Med Sci,The Journal of veterinary medical science,9105360,PMC8267195,['NOTNLM'],"['CpG islands', 'beef cattle', 'bone morphogenetic protein 6', 'early onset', 'enzootic bovine leucosis', 'methylation']",2021/04/13 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2021/04/12 06:09'],"['2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/12 06:09 [entrez]']",['10.1292/jvms.20-0663 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Med Sci. 2021 Jun 9;83(6):898-904. doi: 10.1292/jvms.20-0663.

Maintenance therapy after HCT for patients with targetable mutations such as mutated IDH1 or IDH2 may improve outcomes, and clinical trials evaluating this strategy are ongoing. However, clinical outcomes of IDH1- and IDH2-mutated AML patients after HCT have not been well described. The primary objective of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and post-HCT outcomes of IDH-mutated AML patients. Survival outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, and cumulative incidences of relapse and nonrelapse mortality. In this multicenter retrospective analysis, 112 adult patients with IDH1- or IDH2-mutated AML who underwent HCT and did not receive an IDH inhibitor as maintenance therapy after HCT were identified at Massachusetts General Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and Ohio State University. Mutation testing was performed using next-generation sequencing panels. Patient characteristics were collected retrospectively, and their survival outcomes were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. The median patient age was 64.1 years. The median follow-up was 27.5 months. Among patients, 78.5% had intermediate- or adverse-risk disease by European LeukemiaNET criteria. Fifty-eight percent of patients received intensive induction chemotherapy, 82% of patients underwent HCT during first complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), and 34% of patients received myeloablative conditioning. Frequently detected co-mutations were DNMT3A (35.7%), NPM1 (33.1%), and FLT3-ITD (13.4%); TP53 mutations were detected in 3.6% of patients. For IDH1-mutated patients transplanted during first CR/CRi, the 1- and 2-year PFS was 75% and 58%, respectively. For IDH2-mutated patients transplanted in first CR/CRi, the 1- and 2-year PFS was 64% and 58%, respectively. The 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 31% and 25% for IDH1- and IDH2-mutated cohorts, respectively. Multivariable analysis suggested first CR/CRi and age </=60 was associated with improved outcomes for IDH2-mutated patients.

The exact etiology and pathogenesis of this condition are not yet fully elucidated. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old White man presented with 2 weeks of low-grade fever and chills, night sweats, fatigue, dysphagia, and new-onset rapidly increasing cervical lymphadenopathy. He had a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia with transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma for which he was started on dose-adjusted rituximab, etoposide, prednisone vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (DA-R-EPOCH). Shortly after treatment initiation, the patient developed severe airway obstruction due to cervical lymphadenopathy that required emergency intubation. A few days later, the cervical lymphadenopathy and the status of the airway improved, and sedation was consequently weaned off to plan for extubation. However, the patient did not recover consciousness and developed generalized refractory seizures. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed edema in the cortical gray and subcortical white matter of the bilateral occipital and inferior temporal lobes, consistent with PRES. CONCLUSIONS: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome refers to a neurological disorder and imaging entity characterized by subcortical vasogenic edema in patients who develop acute neurological signs and symptoms of a usually reversible nature in different settings, including chemotherapy. Despite its name, PRES is not always fully reversible, and permanent sequelae can persist in some patients. Clinicians should be aware of the possible association between chemotherapy and PRES to ensure early recognition and timely treatment.","['Egoryan, Goar', 'Murguia-Fuentes, Ricardo', 'Agab, Mohamed', 'Abou-Ghanem, Nagwa', 'Yanez-Bello, Maria Adriana', 'Pyakuryal, Bimatshu', 'Trelles-Garcia, Daniela Patricia', 'Ibrahim, Rami', 'Filipiuk, Dorota', 'Gidron, Adi', 'Rodriguez-Nava, Guillermo']","['Egoryan G', 'Murguia-Fuentes R', 'Agab M', 'Abou-Ghanem N', 'Yanez-Bello MA', 'Pyakuryal B', 'Trelles-Garcia DP', 'Ibrahim R', 'Filipiuk D', 'Gidron A', 'Rodriguez-Nava G']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5203-8156'],"['Department of Internal Medicine, AMITA Health Saint Francis Hospital, 355 Ridge Ave, Evanston, IL, 60202, USA. vivagoar23@gmail.com.', 'Department of Neurology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, LA, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, AMITA Health Saint Francis Hospital, 355 Ridge Ave, Evanston, IL, 60202, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, AMITA Health Saint Francis Hospital, 355 Ridge Ave, Evanston, IL, 60202, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, AMITA Health Saint Francis Hospital, 355 Ridge Ave, Evanston, IL, 60202, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, AMITA Health Saint Francis Hospital, 355 Ridge Ave, Evanston, IL, 60202, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, AMITA Health Saint Francis Hospital, 355 Ridge Ave, Evanston, IL, 60202, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, AMITA Health Saint Francis Hospital, Evanston, IL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, AMITA Health Saint Francis Hospital, Evanston, IL, USA.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, AMITA Health Saint Francis Hospital, Evanston, IL, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, AMITA Health Saint Francis Hospital, 355 Ridge Ave, Evanston, IL, 60202, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20210412,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,PMC8040238,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'DA-R-EPOCH', 'Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', 'Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome', 'R-EPOCH', 'Richter syndrome']",2021/04/13 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2021/04/12 05:29'],"['2021/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/12 05:29 [entrez]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13256-021-02780-y [doi]', '10.1186/s13256-021-02780-y [pii]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2021 Apr 12;15(1):161. doi: 10.1186/s13256-021-02780-y.,20210514,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'EPOCH protocol']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Doxorubicin', 'Etoposide', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', '*Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/complications/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', '*Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging', 'Prednisone', 'Vincristine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML), differences were found in both OS (47.4% vs.65.2%, P<0.001) and DFS (21.0% vs. 52.1%, P<0.001) between ASXL1-mutated patients and ASXL1 wild-type patients.In the ASXL1-mutated AML cohort, the patients received allo-HSCT had longer 3-year OS (P=0.0005) and 3-year DFS (P<0.0001) than those who did not receive allo-HSCT. Multivariate analysis revealed that ASXL1 mutation was an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR 2.248, 95% CI 1.155-4.375, P=0.017), and allo-HSCT had a positive impact on OS (HR 7.568, 95% CI 3.597-15.92, P<0.001) and DFS (HR 2.611, 95% CI 1.688-4.039, P<0.001) in ASXL1-mutated patients.Conclusion: The results indicate that the presence of ASXL1 mutations is a factor predictive of poor prognosis in AML patients and allo-HSCT could improve the survival of AML patients with ASXL1 mutations.","['Zhou, Lili', 'An, Jingnan', 'Hou, Chang', 'Ding, Zixuan', 'Qiu, Huiying', 'Tang, Xiaowen', 'Sun, Aining', 'Chen, Suning', 'Xu, Yang', 'Liu, Tianhui', 'Wu, Depei']","['Zhou L', 'An J', 'Hou C', 'Ding Z', 'Qiu H', 'Tang X', 'Sun A', 'Chen S', 'Xu Y', 'Liu T', 'Wu D']",,"[""National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,['NOTNLM'],"['ASXL1 mutation', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant']",2021/04/13 06:00,2021/06/08 06:00,['2021/04/12 05:29'],"['2021/04/12 05:29 [entrez]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2021.1905356 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2021 Dec;26(1):340-347. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2021.1905356.,20210607,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: BSI episodes in febrile neutropenic patients following chemotherapy were prospectively collected (1997-2018). A case (HIV-infected)-control (non-HIV-infected) sub-analysis was performed (1:2 ratio), matching patients by age, gender, baseline disease, and etiological microorganism. RESULTS: From 1755 BSI episodes in neutropenic cancer patients, 60 (3.4%) occurred in those with HIV. HIV characteristics: 51.7% were men who have sex with men; 58.3% had < 200 CD4; 51.7% had a detectable HIV-1 RNA viral load before the BSI episode; 70.0% met AIDS-defining criteria; and 93.3% were on antiretroviral therapy, with a protease inhibitor-based regimen being the most common (53.0%). HIV-infected patients were younger, more frequently male and more commonly presenting chronic liver disease (p < 0.001 for all). BSI due to Enterococcus spp. was significantly more frequent among patients with HIV (p = 0.017) with no differences in other pathogens. HIV-infected patients with cancer presented with shock more frequently (p = 0.014) and had higher mortality (31.7% vs. 18.1%, p = 0.008). In the case-control analysis, cases (HIV-infected) had chronic liver disease (p = 0.003) more frequently, whereas acute leukemia (p = 0.013) and hematopoietic stem-cell transplant (p = 0.023) were more common among controls. There was a non-significant trend for cases to have higher mortality (p = 0.084). However, in multivariate analysis, HIV infection was not associated with mortality (p = 0.196). CONCLUSION: HIV-infected patients with cancer developing febrile neutropenia and BSI have different epidemiological and clinical profiles, and experience higher mortality. However, HIV infection by itself was not associated with mortality.","['Puerta-Alcalde, Pedro', 'Ambrosioni, Juan', 'Chumbita, Mariana', 'Hernandez-Meneses, Marta', 'Garcia-Pouton, Nicole', 'Cardozo, Celia', 'Moreno-Garcia, Estela', 'Marco, Francesc', 'Mensa, Josep', 'Rovira, Montserrat', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Martinez, Jose A', 'Garcia, Felipe', 'Mallolas, Josep', 'Soriano, Alex', 'Miro, Jose M', 'Garcia-Vidal, Carolina']","['Puerta-Alcalde P', 'Ambrosioni J', 'Chumbita M', 'Hernandez-Meneses M', 'Garcia-Pouton N', 'Cardozo C', 'Moreno-Garcia E', 'Marco F', 'Mensa J', 'Rovira M', 'Esteve J', 'Martinez JA', 'Garcia F', 'Mallolas J', 'Soriano A', 'Miro JM', 'Garcia-Vidal C']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2490-0217'],"['Infectious Diseases Department, Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS, Carrer de Villarroel 170, 08036, Barcelona, Spain. pedro.puerta84@gmail.com.', 'Infectious Diseases Department, Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS, Carrer de Villarroel 170, 08036, Barcelona, Spain. jambrosioni@intramed.net.', 'Infectious Diseases Department, Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS, Carrer de Villarroel 170, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Infectious Diseases Department, Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS, Carrer de Villarroel 170, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Infectious Diseases Department, Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS, Carrer de Villarroel 170, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Infectious Diseases Department, Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS, Carrer de Villarroel 170, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Infectious Diseases Department, Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS, Carrer de Villarroel 170, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Microbiology Department, Centre Diagnostic Biomedic, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'ISGlobal, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Infectious Diseases Department, Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS, Carrer de Villarroel 170, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Infectious Diseases Department, Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS, Carrer de Villarroel 170, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.', 'University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Infectious Diseases Department, Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS, Carrer de Villarroel 170, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.', 'University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Infectious Diseases Department, Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS, Carrer de Villarroel 170, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.', 'University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Infectious Diseases Department, Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS, Carrer de Villarroel 170, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.', 'University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Infectious Diseases Department, Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS, Carrer de Villarroel 170, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.', 'University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Infectious Diseases Department, Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS, Carrer de Villarroel 170, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.', 'University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['CM18/00132/Instituto de Salud Carlos III', 'FI19/00133/Instituto de Salud Carlos III', 'PI18/01061/Instituto de Salud Carlos III', 'FIS PI18/01061/Instituto de Salud Carlos III']",['Journal Article'],20210411,New Zealand,Infect Dis Ther,Infectious diseases and therapy,101634499,PMC8116456,['NOTNLM'],"['Bacteremia', 'HIV', 'Multidrug resistance', 'Neutropenia']",2021/04/12 06:00,2021/04/12 06:01,['2021/04/11 20:58'],"['2021/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/12 06:01 [medline]', '2021/04/11 20:58 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40121-021-00445-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s40121-021-00445-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Infect Dis Ther. 2021 Jun;10(2):955-970. doi: 10.1007/s40121-021-00445-3.

This study aimed to determine the incidence and clinical impact of molecular genetic aberrations in Thai patients with AML and MDS-EB, detected by the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique. This prospective, observational study was conducted between 2018 and 2020 on newly diagnosed Thai AML or MDS-EB patients aged above 15 years. NGS was performed using a custom amplicon-based targeted enrichment assay for 42 genes recurrently mutated in myeloid neoplasms. The molecular results were correlated with baseline patient and disease characteristics as well as outcomes. Forty-nine patients were enrolled in this study. The median age was 56 years (interquartile range [IQR], 44-64), with nearly equal proportions of males and females. The median number of mutations was 3 (IQR, 2-4). The most frequent alterations were FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITD) (28.6%), DNMT3A (24.5%), and WT1 (22.4%) mutations. FLT3-ITD was more frequent in the de novo AML group than in the MDS/secondary AML group, whereas in the MDS/secondary AML group, ASXL1, ETV6, and SRSF2 mutations were more frequent. Patients aged greater than 65 years and patients with mutated TP53 were more likely to have inferior overall survival from multivariate analysis. FLT3-ITD was the most common mutation among newly diagnosed Thai AML patients. TP53 mutation and advanced age were independent adverse factors for survival outcome.

The effects of IL-6 using SKBR3 cells were associated with the generation of apoptotic cells as analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. IL-6 activated p53 and upregulated TRAIL death receptors (DR-4 and DR-5) and stimulated the TNF-alpha and TRAIL dependent extrinsic apoptotic pathway without activation of the p53 mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathway. TNF-alpha and TRAIL induced cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-3 was more enhanced by IL-6, although these caspases were not cleaved by IL-6 alone. The dead cell generation elicited by the combination with IL-6 was blocked by anti-human TRAIL R2/TNFRSF10B Fc chimera antibody which can neutralize the DR-5 mediated death signal. These findings indicate that IL-6 could contribute to the enhancement of TNF-alpha or TRAIL induced apoptosis through p53 dependent upregulation of DR-4 and DR-5. The data suggest that a favorable therapeutic interaction could occur between TNF-alpha or TRAIL and IL-6, and provide an experimental basis for rational clinical treatments in various cancers.","['Sano, Emiko', 'Kazaana, Akira', 'Tadakuma, Hisashi', 'Takei, Toshiaki', 'Yoshimura, Sodai', 'Hanashima, Yuya', 'Ozawa, Yoshinari', 'Yoshino, Atsuo', 'Suzuki, Yutaka', 'Ueda, Takuya']","['Sano E', 'Kazaana A', 'Tadakuma H', 'Takei T', 'Yoshimura S', 'Hanashima Y', 'Ozawa Y', 'Yoshino A', 'Suzuki Y', 'Ueda T']",,"['Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Kashiwa, Chiba 277-8562, Japan.

The aim of the current study is to elucidate the association between dying at home and various personal factors in the Israeli population of cancer patients. METHODS: Data on cancer incidence (2008-2015) and death (2008-2017) was provided by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics and the Israel National Cancer Registry. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to assess odds ratios for death at home following cancer diagnosis while controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, years of education, residential socioeconomic score, and time from diagnosis. We also assessed the relation between place of death and specific cancer sites, as well as the time trend from 2008 to 2017. RESULTS: About one quarter (26.7%) of the study population died at home. Death at home was most frequent among patients diagnosed with brain tumors (37.0%), while it was the lowest among patients with hematologic malignancies (lymphoma and leukemia, 20.3 and 20.0%, respectively). Rates of dying at home among patients with residential socioeconomic scores of 1, 2-9, and 10 were about 15, 30, and 42.9%, respectively. In patients from the 4th to the 7th decades of life, rates of death at home increased at a linear rate that increased exponentially from the 8th decade onwards. After controlling for potential confounders, predictive variables for death at home included age (OR = 1.020 per year, 95% CI 1.017-1.024), male sex (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.077-1.294), years of education (OR = 1.029 per year, 95% CI 1.018-1.040), and time from diagnosis (OR = 1.003 per month, 95% CI 1.001-1.005 all p < 0.001). No trend was seen from 2008 to 2013, while from 2014 to 2017 a slight increase in the rate of death at home was seen each year. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate wide variability in death at home exists among patients of different ages, sex, education, socioeconomic status and time from diagnosis. These findings stress the importance of delivering quality palliative care at home, mainly for patients with hematologic malignancies, younger patients, and patients of very low socioeconomic status. Understanding the complex mechanisms whereby patient preferences and the above variables may determine the preferred place of death remains an important research priority.","['Rottenberg, Yakir', 'Goldzweig, Gil', 'Shaulov, Adir']","['Rottenberg Y', 'Goldzweig G', 'Shaulov A']",,"['Department of Oncology, Hadassah Medical Organization and Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel. ryakir@hadassah.org.il.', 'School of Behavioral Sciences, The Academic College of Tel Aviv-Yafo, Rabenu Yeruham St, 86162, Yaffo, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Hadassah Medical Organization and Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210410,England,Int J Equity Health,International journal for equity in health,101147692,PMC8037835,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*Dying at home', '*Israel', '*Socioeconomic status']",2021/04/12 06:00,2021/09/14 06:00,['2021/04/11 20:17'],"['2020/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/11 20:17 [entrez]', '2021/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12939-021-01437-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12939-021-01437-y [pii]']",epublish,Int J Equity Health. 2021 Apr 10;20(1):99. doi: 10.1186/s12939-021-01437-y.,20210913,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Attitude to Death', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Israel/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Preference', 'Socioeconomic Factors', '*Terminal Care']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carcinogenesis is accompanied by multiple changes in the DNA methylation pattern and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) genes; these changes are often associated with poor disease prognosis. Human DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A is responsible for de novo DNA methylation. Missense mutations in the DNMT3A gene occur frequently at the early stages of tumor development and are often observed in hematologic malignances, especially in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with a prevalence of the R882H mutation. This mutation is the only one that has been extensively studied using both model DNA substrates and cancer cell lines. Biochemical characterization of other DNMT3A mutants is necessary to assess their potential effects on the DNMT3A functioning. In this review, we describe DNMT3A mutations identified in AML with special emphasis on the missense mutations in the DNMT3A catalytic domain. The impact of R882H and less common missense mutations on the DNMT3A activity toward model DNA substrates and in cancer cell lines is discussed together with the underlying molecular mechanisms. Understanding general features of these mechanisms will be useful for further development of novel approaches for early diagnostics of hematologic diseases and personalized cancer therapy.","['Khrabrova, Dariya A', 'Yakubovskaya, Marianna G', 'Gromova, Elizaveta S']","['Khrabrova DA', 'Yakubovskaya MG', 'Gromova ES']",,"['Faculty of Chemistry, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, 119991, Russia. khrabrova_da@mail.ru.', 'Blokhin National Medical Research Center of Oncology, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, 115478, Russia.', 'Faculty of Chemistry, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, 119991, Russia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Biochemistry (Mosc),Biochemistry.

This retrospective study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of feline haemoplasmas in domestic cats in the Moscow region, Russia. A risk of haemoplasma coinfection with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) was also determined. qPCR analysis for feline haemoplasmas was performed on EDTA blood samples from 753 cats from the Moscow region, Russia. Subsets of these samples were tested also for FIV and FeLV by qPCR. Of the 753 blood samples, 104 (13.8 %) were positive for one of the Mycoplasma species. The prevalence of 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum' (CMhm), Mycoplasma haemofelis (Mhf), and 'Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis' (CMt) was 7.6 %, 5.5 %, and 0.7 %, respectively. One sample (0.1 %) was simultaneously infected with two haemoplasmas, namely, Mhf and CMt. Haemoplasma positive cats were more likely to be infected with FIV than haemoplasma negative (17.6 % vs 6.7 %), but these differences were not statistically significant. The prevalence of FeLV was comparable among haemoplasma positive and negative cats (23.5 % vs 25.7 %) All three known species of feline haemoplasma were detected, confirming their presence in Russia. The overall and species-specific rates of haemoplasma infections in Russian cats are generally similar to the rates in the countries of central Europe.

Autologous (from patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplasia (MDS)) or allogeneic (donor)-T-cells stimulated by DCleu, gain an efficient lysis of naive blasts, although not in every case. CXCL8, -9, -10, CCL2, -5 and Interleukin (IL-12) were quantified by Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) in supernatants from 5 DC-generating methods and correlated with AML-/MDS-patients' serum-values, DC-/T-cell-interactions/antileukemic T-cell-reactions after mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) and patients' clinical course. The blast-lytic activity of T-cells stimulated with DC or mononuclear cells (MNC) was quantified in a cytotoxicity assay. Despite great variations of chemokine-levels, correlations with post-stimulation (after stimulating T-cells with DC in MLC) improved antileukemic T-cell activity were seen: higher released chemokine-values correlated with improved T-cells' antileukemic activity (compared to stimulation with blast-containing MNC) - whereas with respect to the corresponding serum values higher CXCL8-, -9-, and -10- but lower CCL5- and -2-release correlated with improved antileukemic activity of DC-stimulated (vs. blast-stimulated) T-cells. In DC-culture supernatants higher chemokine-values correlated with post-stimulation improved antileukemic T-cell reactivity, whereas higher serum-values of CXCL8, -9, and -10 but lower serum-values of CCL5 and -2 correlated with post-stimulation improved antileukemic T-cell-reactivity. In a context of 'DC'-stimulation (vs serum) this might point to a change of (CCL5 and -2-associated) functionality from a more 'inflammatory' or 'tumor-promoting' to a more 'antitumor'-reactive functionality.

To explore the role of hepatoblasts, one of the major constituents of the FL hematopoietic microenvironment, in the pathogenesis of TAM, we investigated the influence of a human hepatoblastoma cell line, HUH-6, on the in vitro growth and differentiation of TAM blasts. In a coculture system with membrane filters, which hinders cell-to-cell contact between TAM blasts and HUH-6 cells, the growth and megakaryocytic differentiation of TAM blast progenitors were increased in the presence of HUH-6 cells. The culture supernatant of HUH-6 cells contained hematopoietic growth factors, including stem cell factor (SCF) and thrombopoietin (TPO). The neutralizing antibody against SCF abrogated the growth-stimulating activity of the culture supernatant of HUH-6 cells, demonstrating that, among the growth factors produced by HUH-6 cells, SCF may be the major growth stimulator and that TPO may be involved in megakaryocytic differentiation, rather than growth, of TAM blasts. This suggests that hepatoblasts function in the regulation of the growth and differentiation of TAM blasts in the FL through the production of hematopoietic growth factors, including SCF and TPO, and are involved in the leukemogenesis of TAM.","['Miyauchi, Jun', 'Kawaguchi, Hiroyuki']","['Miyauchi J', 'Kawaguchi H']",,"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Dental College Ichikawa General Hospital, Ichikawa, Chiba-ken, Japan.

However, few studies have investigated the incidence of these complications during the phase of chemotherapy. We evaluated the incidence of acute metabolic complications occurring during therapy in our cohort of patients diagnosed with ALL. METHODS: A prospective study involving 50 ALL pediatric patients diagnosed and treated between 2012 and 2016 in our oncology unit. We collected weight, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1C (HBA1c) levels during the two years of therapy. RESULTS: Obesity and overweight occurred in 43 and 25%, respectively among patients and have been reached at 12 months of chemotherapy. About 26% of the patients developed high blood pressure and 14% experienced hyperglycemias without meeting diabetes criteria. There was a significant decrease of HBA1c levels between the beginning and the end of therapy (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Increase of body mass index in our ALL pediatric patients occurred during the first months of therapy and plateaued after a year of treatment. We should target this population for early obesity prevention. HbA1c levels measured during therapy did not reveal diabetes criteria. Hence, fasting blood glucose levels are sufficient to monitor ALL pediatric patients' glycemia.","['Larouche, Valerie', 'Bellavance, Caroline', 'Tibout, Pauline', 'Bergeron, Sebastien', 'Simonyan, David', 'Gagne, Julie']","['Larouche V', 'Bellavance C', 'Tibout P', 'Bergeron S', 'Simonyan D', 'Gagne J']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9773-0995'],"['Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatric, CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatric, CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada.', 'Clinical and Evaluative Research Platform, Research Center, CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatric, CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210412,Germany,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab,Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,9508900,,['NOTNLM'],"['chemotherapy', 'children', 'hyperglycemia', 'leukemia', 'metabolic complications']",2021/04/11 06:00,2021/11/24 06:00,['2021/04/10 17:06'],"['2020/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/10 17:06 [entrez]']","['jpem-2020-0457 [pii]', '10.1515/jpem-2020-0457 [doi]']",epublish,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab. 2021 Apr 12;34(5):627-632. doi: 10.1515/jpem-2020-0457.

We compared overall survival (OS) using registry data from the Acute Leukemia Working Party (ALWP) of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) involving 455 adults who received a second allo-HCT from a human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-matched unrelated (MUD) (n = 320) or a haploidentical (n = 135) donor. Eligibility criteria required adults aged >/=18 years who received a second allo-HCT for treating AML relapse between 2005 and 2019. The primary end-point was OS. There was no statistically significant difference in the median (interquartile range) age between the groups, MUD 46 (35-58) versus haploidentical 44 (33-53) years (P = 0.07). The median OS was not different between the MUD and the haploidentical groups (10 vs. 11 months, P = 0.57). Similarly, the 2-year OS was 31% for the MUD and 29% for the haploidentical donor groups. The OS was worse if the procedure was performed with active AML [hazard ratio (HR) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.89; P = 0.02]. Conversely, a longer time from first allo-HCT to relapse (>13.2 months) was associated with better OS (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37-0.69; P < 0.0001). The results of the present analysis limit the ability to recommend one donor type over another when considering a second allo-HCT for relapsed AML.

CAR cells are characterized by several salient features, including much higher expression of CXCL12, stem cell factor (SCF), forkhead box C1 (FOXC1) and early B-cell factor 3 (EBF3), which are essential for HSC maintenance, than other cells. However, the human counterpart of CAR cells has not been fully described. Here, we show the presence of cells expressing much higher CXCL12 than other cells in human adult bone marrow using a flow cytometry-based in situ technique that enables high-throughput detection of mRNA at single-cell resolution. Most CXCL12(hi) cells expressed high levels of SCF, FOXC1 and EBF3 and had the potential to differentiate into adipocytes and osteoblasts. Histologically, the nuclei of CXCL12(hi) cells were identified and quantified by EBF3 expression in fixed marrow sections. CXCL12(hi) cells sorted from residual bone marrow aspirates of chronic myeloid leukaemia patients expressed reduced levels of CXCL12, SCF, FOXC1 and EBF3 in correlation with increased leukaemic burden. Together, we identified the human counterpart of CAR cells, enabling the evaluation of their alterations in various haematological disorders by flow cytometric and histological analyses.","['Aoki, Kazunari', 'Kurashige, Masako', 'Ichii, Michiko', 'Higaki, Kei', 'Sugiyama, Tatsuki', 'Kaito, Takashi', 'Ando, Wataru', 'Sugano, Nobuhiko', 'Sakai, Takashi', 'Shibayama, Hirohiko', 'Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi', 'Morii, Eiichi', 'Kanakura, Yuzuru', 'Nagasawa, Takashi']","['Aoki K', 'Kurashige M', 'Ichii M', 'Higaki K', 'Sugiyama T', 'Kaito T', 'Ando W', 'Sugano N', 'Sakai T', 'Shibayama H', 'Takaori-Kondo A', 'Morii E', 'Kanakura Y', 'Nagasawa T']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2172-2195', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9212-6644', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0018-6656']","['Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology and Developmental Immunology, Immunology Frontier Research Center, World Premier International Research Center (WPI), Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell Genetics, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Suita, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology and Developmental Immunology, Immunology Frontier Research Center, World Premier International Research Center (WPI), Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Suita, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology and Developmental Immunology, Immunology Frontier Research Center, World Premier International Research Center (WPI), Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopedic Medical Engineering, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopedic Medical Engineering, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Ube, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Suita, Japan.', 'Sumitomo Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology and Developmental Immunology, Immunology Frontier Research Center, World Premier International Research Center (WPI), Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Suita, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210410,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,PMC8252541,['NOTNLM'],"['*CXCL12-abundant reticular cell', '*bone marrow', '*haematopoietic stem cells', '*human', '*niche']",2021/04/11 06:00,2021/09/28 06:00,['2021/04/10 12:14'],"['2020/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/10 12:14 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.17396 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2021 May;193(3):659-668. doi: 10.1111/bjh.17396.

Serological assays detecting IgG against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein are useful to monitor the immune response after infection or vaccination. The objective of our study was to evaluate the clinical performance of the Siemens SARS-CoV-2 IgG (sCOVG) assay. METHODS: Sensitivity and specificity of the Siemens sCOVG test were evaluated on 178 patients with SARS-CoV-2-infection and 160 pre-pandemic samples in comparison with its predecessor test COV2G. Furthermore, correlation with virus neutralization titers was investigated on 134 samples of convalescent COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Specificity of the sCOVG test was 99.4% and sensitivity was 90.5% (COV2G assay 78.7%; p<0.0001). S1-RBD antibody levels showed a good correlation with virus neutralization titers (r=0.843; p<0.0001) and an overall qualitative agreement of 98.5%. Finally, median S1-RBD IgG levels increase with age and were significantly higher in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (median levels general ward: 25.7 U/mL; intensive care: 59.5 U/mL) than in outpatients (3.8 U/mL; p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Performance characteristics of the sCOVG assay have been improved compared to the predecessor test COV2G. Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD IgG levels could be used as a surrogate for virus neutralization capacity. Further harmonization of antibody quantification might assist to monitor the humoral immune response after COVID-19 disease or vaccination.","['Irsara, Christian', 'Egger, Alexander E', 'Prokop, Wolfgang', 'Nairz, Manfred', 'Loacker, Lorin', 'Sahanic, Sabina', 'Pizzini, Alex', 'Sonnweber, Thomas', 'Holzer, Barbara', 'Mayer, Wolfgang', 'Schennach, Harald', 'Loeffler-Ragg, Judith', 'Bellmann-Weiler, Rosa', 'Hartmann, Boris', 'Tancevski, Ivan', 'Weiss, Gunter', 'Binder, Christoph J', 'Anliker, Markus', 'Griesmacher, Andrea', 'Hoermann, Gregor']","['Irsara C', 'Egger AE', 'Prokop W', 'Nairz M', 'Loacker L', 'Sahanic S', 'Pizzini A', 'Sonnweber T', 'Holzer B', 'Mayer W', 'Schennach H', 'Loeffler-Ragg J', 'Bellmann-Weiler R', 'Hartmann B', 'Tancevski I', 'Weiss G', 'Binder CJ', 'Anliker M', 'Griesmacher A', 'Hoermann G']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4901-8861'],"['Central Institute of Clinical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, University Hospital of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Central Institute of Clinical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, University Hospital of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Central Institute of Clinical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, University Hospital of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Infectious Diseases, Pneumology, Rheumatology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Central Institute of Clinical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, University Hospital of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Infectious Diseases, Pneumology, Rheumatology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Infectious Diseases, Pneumology, Rheumatology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Infectious Diseases, Pneumology, Rheumatology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department for Animal Health, Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES), Moedling, Austria.', 'Central Institute for Blood Transfusion and Immunology (ZIB), University Hospital of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Central Institute for Blood Transfusion and Immunology (ZIB), University Hospital of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Infectious Diseases, Pneumology, Rheumatology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Infectious Diseases, Pneumology, Rheumatology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department for Animal Health, Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES), Moedling, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Infectious Diseases, Pneumology, Rheumatology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Infectious Diseases, Pneumology, Rheumatology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Central Institute of Clinical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, University Hospital of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Central Institute of Clinical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, University Hospital of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Central Institute of Clinical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, University Hospital of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210409,Germany,Clin Chem Lab Med,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,9806306,,['NOTNLM'],"['*COVID-19', '*SARS-CoV-2', '*neutralization assay', '*sensitivity', '*serology', '*specificity']",2021/04/11 06:00,2021/07/08 06:00,['2021/04/10 06:11'],"['2021/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/10 06:11 [entrez]']","['cclm-2021-0214 [pii]', '10.1515/cclm-2021-0214 [doi]']",epublish,Clin Chem Lab Med. 2021 Apr 9;59(8):1453-1462. doi: 10.1515/cclm-2021-0214.

However, the hydrodynamic environment in the bioreactor can modulate PSC behavior, pluripotency and differentiation potential in ways that need to be well understood. In this study, we investigated how murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) sense fluid shear stress and modulate a noncanonical Wnt signaling response to promote pluripotency. mESCs showed higher expression of pluripotency marker genes, Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in stirred suspension bioreactors compared to adherent culture, a phenomenon we have termed mechanopluripotency. In bioreactor culture, fluid shear promoted the nuclear translocation of the less well-known pluripotency regulator beta-catenin and concomitant increase of c-Myc expression, an upstream regulator of Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog. We also observed similar beta-catenin nuclear translocation in LIF-free mESCs cultured on E-cadherin substrate under defined fluid shear stress conditions in flow chamber plates. mESCs showed lower shear-induced expression of pluripotency marker genes when beta-catenin was inhibited, suggesting that beta-catenin signaling is crucial to mESC mechanopluripotency. Key to this process is vinculin, which is known to rearrange and associate more strongly with adherens junctions in response to fluid shear. When the vinculin gene is disrupted, we observe that nuclear beta-catenin translocation and mechanopluripotency are abrogated. Our results indicate that mechanotransduction through the adherens junction complex is important for mESC pluripotency maintenance.","['Nath, Suman C', 'Day, Bradley', 'Harper, Lane', 'Yee, Jeffrey', 'Hsu, Charlie Yu-Ming', 'Larijani, Leila', 'Rohani, Leili', 'Duan, Nicholas', 'Kallos, Michael S', 'Rancourt, Derrick E']","['Nath SC', 'Day B', 'Harper L', 'Yee J', 'Hsu CY', 'Larijani L', 'Rohani L', 'Duan N', 'Kallos MS', 'Rancourt DE']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4995-6252', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7283-0113', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0200-6310', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1480-8022', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4179-345X']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'McCaig Institute for Bone and Joint Health, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'McCaig Institute for Bone and Joint Health, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'McCaig Institute for Bone and Joint Health, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Pharmaceutical Production Research Facility, Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering, Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'McCaig Institute for Bone and Joint Health, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada', 'RGPIN-2017-04124/NSERC Discovery Grant', 'RGPIN/06506-2016/NSERC PGS-D award', 'University of Calgary Cumming School of Medicine Postdoctoral Fellowship']",['Journal Article'],20210423,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,,['NOTNLM'],"['adherens junction dynamics', 'bioreactor', 'fluid shear stress', 'mechanopluripotency', 'mouse embryonic stem cells', 'vinculin', 'beta-catenin nuclear translocation']",2021/04/11 06:00,2021/04/11 06:00,['2021/04/10 06:06'],"['2021/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/11 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/10 06:06 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.3382 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2021 Sep;39(9):1166-1177. doi: 10.1002/stem.3382.

Presently, no unified effective reinduction chemotherapy regimen has been developed. Therefore, the use of reinduction chemotherapy regimens before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is controversial. Our study aims to analyze the prognostic factors of R/R-AML and to evaluate the efficacy of the regimen involved decitabine, cladribine, idarubicin or homoharringtonine, and cytarabine (DCIA/DCHA). Clinical and survival data of 112 R/R-AML patients were obtained. Among the 102 R/R-AML patients that were treated with conventional regimens, we found that poor prognosis was related to a greater proportion of bone marrow blasts (>70%) and not achieving complete remission (non-CR) after the first reinduction chemotherapy. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (of which 89.47% was allo-HSCT) following CR after the first reinduction chemotherapy often improves the prognosis. Of the 10 R/R-AML patients that were treated with the DCIA/DCHA regimen, nine patients achieved CR or complete response with incomplete hematopoietic recovery (CRi) after one course of chemotherapy. The median overall survival of the 10 patients was 10.14 (1.23-29.13) months. In conclusion, non-CR was associated with poor prognosis in R/R-AML. Therefore, intensive reinduction chemotherapy should be selected to achieve CR. This creates conditions for allo-HSCT and improves prognosis of R/R-AML patients. The DCIA/DCHA regimen showed good efficacy and tolerable adverse reactions in R/R-AML treatment. This combination may be used as a bridging regimen for allo-HSCT in R/R-AML.","['Hui, Yan', 'Li, Yi', 'Tong, Xiwen', 'Huang, Lifang', 'Mao, Xia', 'Huang, Liang', 'Zhang, Donghua']","['Hui Y', 'Li Y', 'Tong X', 'Huang L', 'Mao X', 'Huang L', 'Zhang D']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2959-9638'],"['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],['81500082/National Natural Science Foundation of China'],['Journal Article'],20210409,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'prognosis', 'refractory', 'relapse', 'treatment']",2021/04/11 06:00,2021/04/11 06:00,['2021/04/10 06:05'],"['2021/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/11 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/10 06:05 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.33595 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Int J Cancer. 2021 Apr 9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.33595.,,,IM,,['(c) 2021 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patient characteristics, treatment patterns and outcomes in a racially diverse patient cohort controlling for cytogenetic risk group. Patients were classified into four groups: non-Hispanic White (NHW), non-Hispanic Black (NHB), Hispanic and Other. RESULTS: We evaluated 106 patients from 84 zipcodes incorporating demographics, clinicopathologic features, treatment patterns and outcomes. We identified significant differences in BMI and geographic poverty based on ethnoracial group, while prognostic mutations in NPM1 and FLT3 did not differ significantly. Utilization of intensive chemotherapy and transplant rate did not differ by ethnoracial group. However, there was a significantly higher use of alternate donor transplants in minority populations. There was a notably increased rate of clinical trial enrollment in NHW patients compared to other groups. In log-rank analysis, NHW patients had increased overall survival (OS) compared to NHB, Hispanic and Other patients (31.6 months vs. 16.7 months vs. 14.3 months, vs 18.1 months, p = 0.021). In bivariate analysis, overall survival was negatively influenced by advanced age and race. Obesity and zip code poverty levels approached statistical significance in predicting OS. In multivariate analysis, the only factors independently influencing OS were race and allogeneic stem cell transplant. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that race impacts survival in intermediate-risk AML, highlighting the need to dissect biologic and nonbiologic factors that contribute to this disparity.","['Abraham, Ivy Elizabeth', 'Patel, Anand Ashwin', 'Wang, Heidy', 'Galvin, John Patrick', 'Frankfurt, Olga', 'Liu, Li', 'Khan, Irum']","['Abraham IE', 'Patel AA', 'Wang H', 'Galvin JP', 'Frankfurt O', 'Liu L', 'Khan I']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1855-7731'],"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, 840 South Wood Street, Ste 820 E-CSB, Chicago, IL, 60612, USA.', 'University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, 840 South Wood Street, Ste 820 E-CSB, Chicago, IL, 60612, USA.', 'Hematology and Oncology Division, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, 840 South Wood Street, Ste 820 E-CSB, Chicago, IL, 60612, USA. irumkhan@uic.edu.']",['eng'],"['University of Illinois Cancer Center Pilot Grant/University of Illinois at', 'Chicago']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20210409,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,['NOTNLM'],"['Disparities', 'Leukemia', 'Outcomes']",2021/04/11 06:00,2021/07/13 06:00,['2021/04/10 06:02'],"['2020/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/10 06:02 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10552-021-01422-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s10552-021-01422-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2021 Jul;32(7):705-712. doi: 10.1007/s10552-021-01422-4.

This study aims to identify more effective and safer therapeutics for these patients. METHODS: A high-throughput phenotypic screen of a library of 3707 approved drugs and pharmacologically active compounds was performed to identify compounds with selective cytotoxicity against leukaemia cells followed by further preclinical evaluation in patient-derived xenograft models. RESULTS: Auranofin, an FDA-approved agent for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, was identified as exerting selective anti-cancer activity against leukaemia cells, including patient-derived xenograft cells from children with high-risk ALL, versus solid tumour and non-cancerous cells. It induced apoptosis in leukaemia cells by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and potentiated the activity of the chemotherapeutic cytarabine against highly aggressive models of infant MLL-rearranged ALL by enhancing DNA damage accumulation. The enhanced sensitivity of leukaemia cells towards auranofin was associated with lower basal levels of the antioxidant glutathione and higher baseline ROS levels compared to solid tumour cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights auranofin as a well-tolerated drug candidate for high-risk paediatric leukaemias that warrants further preclinical investigation for application in high-risk paediatric and adult acute leukaemias.","['Karsa, Mawar', 'Kosciolek, Angelika', 'Bongers, Angelika', 'Mariana, Anna', 'Failes, Tim', 'Gifford, Andrew J', 'Kees, Ursula R', 'Cheung, Laurence C',

Intensive chemotherapy often induces gastrointestinal adverse events. These adverse events leave patients in a state of malnutrition, leading to a reduction in body weight. In this study, we analyzed the impact of body weight loss before allo-HCT on survival outcomes of acute leukemia patients (acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoid leukemia and mixed phenotype acute leukemia). A loss of body weight (LBW), which was a reduction of body weight from diagnosis or relapse to transplantation, was calculated in 182 acute leukemia patients who received first allo-HCT at our center between June 2006 and September 2019. A receiver operating characteristics curve for nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was plotted for defining the cut-off value of LBW. The cutoff value of LBW was defined as 13.2%. A higher LBW was significantly associated with inferior NRM and overall survival (OS) (2-year [2y] NRM 36.1% versus 11.5%, P = .0025; 2y-OS 39.9% versus 65.8%, P = .020). The adverse impact of LBW was also confirmed in multivariate analyses for NRM and OS (HR of NRM 2.74 [1.25-6.03], P = .0012; HR of OS 2.06 [1.00-3.07], P = .0049). The main cause of death included disease progression (n = 34) and infection (n = 35). Death cause by infection was more frequently observed in the high-LBW group (15 cases [35.7%] versus 20 cases [14.3%]; P = .0035). In addition, subgroup analyses based on a combination of the body mass index at diagnosis and LBW were performed. When the non-overweight-low LBW group (body mass index [BMI] </=25 and LBW </=13.2%) was used as a reference in multivariate analysis, the overweight-high LBW group (BMI >25 and LBW >13.2%) showed an increased risk of poor survival outcomes (HR of NRM 4.27 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.82-10.0], P < .001; HR of OS 1.93 [95%, CI 1.00-3.71], P = .050).

The availability of alternative human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched donors, such as cord blood and haploidentical related donors, could allow patients to receive allogeneic HCT who are without an HLA-matched sibling or unrelated donor. The use of these alternative donors is preferable for patients with advanced disease due to the rapid availability. However, comparative data for cord blood transplantation (CBT) and haploidentical related donor transplantation (haplo-HCT) are limited for adult patients with AML in CR. We sought to compare overall survival (OS); leukemia-free survival (LFS); graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS); and chronic GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (CRFS) between single-unit CBT (SCBT) and haplo-HCT recipients for adult patients with intermediate- or poor-risk AML in CR. We retrospectively analyzed and compared the results of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in 1313 adult patients with intermediate- or poor-risk AML in CR who received either SCBT (n = 1102) or unmanipulated haplo-HCT (n = 211) between 2007 and 2018 in Japan. Among the whole cohort, the cumulative incidences of neutrophil and platelet recovery were significantly lower in SCBT recipients compared with those in haplo-HCT recipients (P < .001 for neutrophil, P < .001 for platelet). SCBT was significantly associated with a higher incidence of grade II to IV acute GVHD and lower incidence of extensive chronic GVHD compared to haplo-HCT (P = .013 for grades II to IV acute GVHD; P = .006 for extensive chronic GVHD). Haplo-HCT recipients developed a higher incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigenemia compared to SCBT recipients (P = .004). In the multivariate analysis, there were no significant differences for grades III or IV acute GVHD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], .88 to 1.57; P = .26), relapse incidence (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, .76 to 1.58; P = .61), non-relapse mortality (HR, .83; 95% CI, .58 to 1.18; P = .32), OS (HR, .92; 95% CI, .70 to 1.20; P = .56), LFS (HR, .94; 95% CI, .73 to 1.21; P = .67), GRFS (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, .90 to 1.40; P = .27), or CRFS (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, .92 to 1.44; P = .19) between the two donor types. In the propensity score matching analysis, which identified 180 patients in each cohort, there were no significant differences in transplant outcomes between the two donor types, except for delayed neutrophil (P < .001) and platelet recovery (P < .001) and a higher incidence of grades II to IV acute GVHD (P = .052) in SCBT. SCBT and unmanipulated haplo-HCT had similar survival outcomes for adult patients with AML in CR despite the lower hematopoietic recovery and higher grade II to IV acute GVHD in SCBT recipients and the higher CMV antigenemia in haplo-HCT recipients.","['Konuma, Takaaki', 'Kanda, Junya', 'Yamasaki, Satoshi', 'Harada, Kaito', 'Shimomura, Yoshimitsu', 'Terakura, Seitaro', 'Mizuno, Shohei', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Tanaka, Masatsugu', 'Doki, Noriko', 'Ozawa, Yukiyasu', 'Nakamae, Hirohisa', 'Sawa, Masashi', 'Matsuoka, Ken-Ichi', 'Morishige, Satoshi', 'Maruyama, Yumiko', 'Ikegame, Kazuhiro', 'Kimura, Takafumi', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Yanada, Masamitsu']","['Konuma T', 'Kanda J', 'Yamasaki S', 'Harada K', 'Shimomura Y', 'Terakura S', 'Mizuno S', 'Uchida N', 'Tanaka M', 'Doki N', 'Ozawa Y', 'Nakamae H', 'Sawa M', 'Matsuoka KI', 'Morishige S', 'Maruyama Y', 'Ikegame K', 'Kimura T', 'Kanda Y', 'Ichinohe T', 'Atsuta Y', 'Yanada M']",,"['Department of Hematology/Oncology, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.

Delayed recovery of adaptive immunity remains a problem, which can be approached by adoptive T-cell transfer. In a randomized trial, we have assessed the safety and efficacy of low-dose memory (CD45RA-depleted) donor lymphocytes (mDLI) after HSCT with alphabeta T-cell depletion. Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is viewed as an essential component of preparative regimen, critical for both prevention of graft failure and GVHD. Variable pharmacokinetics of ATG may significantly affect lymphocyte subpopulations after HSCT. To uncover the potential of mDLI, we replaced rabbit ATG with tocilizumab and abatacept. Here we compare post hoc the immune recovery and the key clinical outcomes, including nonrelapse mortality (NRM), overall- and event-free survival (OS and EFS), between the cohort enrolled in the prospective randomized trial and a historical cohort, comprised of patients grafted with a conventional ATG-based HSCT with alphabeta T cell depletion. A cohort of 149 children was enrolled in the prospective trial and 108 patients were selected as historical controls from a prospectively populated database. Patient population was comprised of children with high-risk hematologic malignancies, with more than 90% represented by acute leukemia. Median age at enrollment was 8.8 years. In the prospective cohort 91% of the donors were haploidentical parents, whereas in the historical cohort 72% of the donors were haploidentical. Conditioning was based on either 12Gy total body irradiation or treosulfan. Thiotepa, fludarabine, bortezomib, and rituximab were used as additional agents. Patients in the historical cohort received rabbit ATG at 5 mg/kg total dose, while prospective cohort patients received tocilizumab at 8 mg /kg on day -1 and abatacept at 10 mg/kg on days 0, 7, 14, and 28. Patients in the prospective trial cohort were randomized 1:1 to receive mDLI starting on day 0, whereas 69% of historical cohort patients received mDLI after engraftment, as part of previous trials. Primary engraftment rate was 99% in the prospective cohort and 98% in the historical cohort. The incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD was 13% in the prospective cohort and 16 % in the control group. Chronic GVHD developed among 13% (historical) and 7% (prospective) cohorts (P = .07). The incidence of cytomegalovirus viremia was 51% in the prospective cohort arm and 54% in the historical control arm (p = ns). Overall, in the prospective cohort 2-year NRM was 2%, incidence of relapse was 25%, EFS was 71%, and OS was 80%, whereas in the historical cohort 2-year NRM was 13%, incidence of relapse was 19%, EFS was 67%, and OS was 76%, difference non-significant for relapse and survival. NRM was significantly improved in the ATG-free cohort (P = .002). Recovery of both alphabeta- and gammadelta- T cells was significantly improved at days +30 and +60 after HSCT in recipients of ATG-free preparative regimens, as well as recovery of naive T cells. Among the recipients of alphabeta T-cell-depleted grafts, replacement of ATG with nonlymphodepleting abatacept and tocilizumab immunomodulation did not compromise engraftment and GVHD control and was associated with significantly lower NRM and better immune recovery early after HSCT.","['Shelikhova, Larisa', 'Glushkova, Svetlana', 'Nikolaev, Ruslan', 'Dunaikina, Maria', 'Zhekhovtsova, Zhanna', 'Blagov, Sergey', 'Khismatullina, Rimma', 'Balashov, Dmitriy', 'Kurnikova, Elena', 'Pershin, Dmitriy', 'Muzalevskii, Yakov', 'Kazachenok, Alexei', 'Osipova, Elena', 'Trakhtman, Pavel', 'Maschan, Alexei', 'Maschan, Michael']","['Shelikhova L', 'Glushkova S', 'Nikolaev R', 'Dunaikina M', 'Zhekhovtsova Z', 'Blagov S', 'Khismatullina R', 'Balashov D', 'Kurnikova E', 'Pershin D', 'Muzalevskii Y', 'Kazachenok A', 'Osipova E', 'Trakhtman P', 'Maschan A', 'Maschan M']",,"['Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Center Of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology And Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Transplantation Immunology And Immunotherapy Laboratory, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Center Of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology And Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Stem Cell Physiology Laboratory, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Center Of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology And Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Center Of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology And Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Center Of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology And Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Center Of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology And Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Center Of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology And Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Center Of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology And Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Transfusion Medicine Service, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Center Of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology And Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Transplantation Immunology And Immunotherapy Laboratory, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Center Of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology And Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Transfusion Medicine Service, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Center Of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology And Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Transfusion Medicine Service, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Center Of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology And Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Stem Cell Physiology Laboratory, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Center Of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology And Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Transfusion Medicine Service, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Center Of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology And Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Center Of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology And Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Center Of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology And Immunology, Moscow, Russia.

Here we analyzed the features and outcomes of AYA patients with AML who had achieved complete remission (CR) and those who had not (non-CR) at allo-HCT. We retrospectively analyzed 2350 AYA patients with AML who underwent allo-HCT with a myeloablative conditioning regimen and who were consecutively enrolled in the Japanese nationwide HCT registry. The difference in overall survival (OS) between younger (age 16 to 29 years) and older AYA (age 30 to 39 years) patients in CR at transplantation was not significant (70.2% versus 71.7% at 3 years; P = .62). Meanwhile, this difference trended toward a statistical significance between younger and older AYA patients in non-CR at transplantation (39.5% versus 34.3% at 3 years; P = .052). In AYA patients in CR and non-CR, the age at transplantation did not affect relapse or nonrelapse mortality (NRM). In AYA patients in CR, no difference in OS was observed between those who received total body irradiation (TBI) and those who did not (71.1% versus 70.5% at 3 years; P = .43). AYA patients who received TBI-based conditioning had a significantly lower relapse rate and higher NRM than those who underwent non-TBI-based conditioning (relapse: 19.8% versus 24.1% at 3 years [P = .047]; NRM: 14.7% versus 11.1% at 3 years [P = .021]). In contrast, among the non-CR patients, there were no differences between the TBI and non-TBI groups with respect to OS (P = .094), relapse (P = .83), and NRM (P = .27). Our data indicate that outcomes may be more favorable in younger AYA patients than in older AYA patients in non-CR at transplantation, and that outcomes of TBI-based conditioning could be comparable to those of non-TBI-based conditioning for AYA patients.","['Mizuno, Shohei', 'Takami, Akiyoshi', 'Kawamura, Koji', 'Arai, Yasuyuki', 'Kondo, Tadakazu', 'Kawata, Takahito', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Marumo, Atsushi', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Tanaka, Masatsugu', 'Ozawa, Yukiyasu', 'Yoshida, Shuro', 'Ota, Shuichi', 'Takada, Satoru', 'Sawa, Masashi', 'Onizuka, Makoto', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Yanada, Masamitsu']","['Mizuno S', 'Takami A', 'Kawamura K', 'Arai Y', 'Kondo T', 'Kawata T', 'Uchida N', 'Marumo A', 'Fukuda T', 'Tanaka M', 'Ozawa Y', 'Yoshida S', 'Ota S', 'Takada S', 'Sawa M', 'Onizuka M', 'Kanda Y', 'Ichinohe T', 'Atsuta Y', 'Yanada M']",,"['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Aichi Medical University, Nagakute, Japan.

Optimal postremission therapy choice in this heterogeneous patient population is currently unsettled. In the current study, we compared outcomes in IRcyto AML recipients of autologous (autoSCT) (n = 312) or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) (n = 279) in first complete remission (CR1). Molecular risk was defined based on CEBPA, NPM1, and FLT3-ITD mutational status, per European LeukemiaNet 2017 criteria. Five-year overall survival (OS) in patients with favorable molecular risk (FRmol) was 62% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50-72) after autoSCT and 66% (95% CI, 41-83) after matched sibling donor (MSD) alloSCT (P = .68). For patients of intermediate molecular risk (IRmol), MSD alloSCT was associated with lower cumulative incidence of relapse (P < .001), as well as with increased nonrelapse mortality (P = .01), as compared to autoSCT. The 5-year OS was 47% (95% CI, 34-58) after autoSCT and 70% (95% CI, 59-79) after MSD alloSCT (P = .02) in this patient subgroup.

These results indicate that, within IRcyto AML in CR1, autoSCT may be a valid option for FRmol patients, whereas MSD alloSCT should be the preferred postremission strategy in IRmol patients.","['Rodriguez-Arboli, Eduardo', 'Martinez-Cuadron, David', 'Rodriguez-Veiga, Rebeca', 'Carrillo-Cruz, Estrella', 'Gil-Cortes, Cristina', 'Serrano-Lopez, Josefina', 'Bernal Del Castillo, Teresa', 'Martinez-Sanchez, Maria Del Pilar', 'Rodriguez-Medina, Carlos', 'Vidriales, Belen', 'Bergua, Juan Miguel', 'Benavente, Celina', 'Garcia-Boyero, Raimundo', 'Herrera-Puente, Pilar', 'Algarra, Lorenzo', 'Sayas-Lloris, Maria Jose', 'Fernandez, Rosa', 'Labrador, Jorge', 'Lavilla-Rubira, Esperanza', 'Barrios-Garcia, Manuel', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Serrano-Maestro, Alfons', 'Sossa-Melo, Claudia Lucia', 'Garcia-Belmonte, Daniel', 'Vives, Susana', 'Rodriguez-Gutierrez, Juan Ignacio', 'Albo-Lopez, Carmen', 'Garrastazul-Sanchez, Maria Paz', 'Colorado-Araujo, Mercedes', 'Mariz, Jose', 'Sanz, Miguel Angel', 'Perez-Simon, Jose Antonio', 'Montesinos, Pau']","['Rodriguez-Arboli E', 'Martinez-Cuadron D', 'Rodriguez-Veiga R', 'Carrillo-Cruz E', 'Gil-Cortes C', 'Serrano-Lopez J', 'Bernal Del Castillo T', 'Martinez-Sanchez MDP', 'Rodriguez-Medina C', 'Vidriales B', 'Bergua JM', 'Benavente C', 'Garcia-Boyero R', 'Herrera-Puente P', 'Algarra L', 'Sayas-Lloris MJ', 'Fernandez R', 'Labrador J', 'Lavilla-Rubira E', 'Barrios-Garcia M', 'Tormo M', 'Serrano-Maestro A', 'Sossa-Melo CL', 'Garcia-Belmonte D', 'Vives S', 'Rodriguez-Gutierrez JI', 'Albo-Lopez C', 'Garrastazul-Sanchez MP', 'Colorado-Araujo M', 'Mariz J', 'Sanz MA', 'Perez-Simon JA', 'Montesinos P']",,"['Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla (IBIS/CSIC/CIBERONC), University of Seville, Seville, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla (IBIS/CSIC/CIBERONC), University of Seville, Seville, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital General Universitario de Alicante, Alicante, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Reina Sofia University Hospital/Maimonides Biomedical Research Institute of Cordoba (IMIBIC)/University of Cordoba, Cordoba, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Central de Asturias, ISPA, IUOPA, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, UCM, CNIO, CIBERONC, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Gran Canaria Doctor Negrin, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca (HUS/IBSAL), CIBERONC- CB16/12/00233 and Center for Cancer Research-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara, Caceres, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital General Universitario de Castellon, Castellon de la Plana, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital General de Albacete, Albacete, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Doctor Peset, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Insular de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology and Research Unit, Hospital Universitario de Burgos, Burgos, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Lucus Augusti, Lugo, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Regional Universitario de Malaga, Malaga, Spain.', 'Deparment of Hematology, Hospital Clinico Universitario de Valencia, Instituto de Investigacion INCLIVA, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario HM Sanchinarro, Madrid, Spain.', 'Fundacion Oftalmologica de Santander-Clinica Carlos Ardila Lulle, Floridablanca, Colombia.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario La Zarzuela, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology - ICO Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol , Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Badalona , Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Basurtoko Unibertsitate Ospitalea, Bilbao, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de Vigo, Vigo, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar, Cadiz, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia do Porto FG, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla (IBIS/CSIC/CIBERONC), University of Seville, Seville, Spain.

We previously reported that expansion of adaptive NK cells after CMV reactivation in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) was associated with a lower rate of relapse of acute myelogenous leukemia. In the present study, we examined the impact of adaptive NK cell expansion in a cohort of 110 individuals who underwent autologous HCT (AHCT) for a lymphoid malignancy (lymphoma or multiple myeloma [MM]). In this cohort, higher absolute numbers of adaptive NK cells (>1.58/muL) at day 28 post-AHCT were associated with significantly decreased risk of relapse in patients with MM. No significant association was seen in patients with lymphoma. Further stratification of MM patients by CMV serostatus found a strong protective effect of adaptive NK cells only in CMV-seropositive individuals. These findings suggest that strategies to increase adaptive NK cells after AHCT may be a therapeutic option in patients with MM.","['Merino, Aimee M', 'Mehta, Rohtesh S', 'Luo, Xianghua', 'Kim, Hansol', 'De For, Todd', 'Janakiram, Murali', 'Cooley, Sarah', 'Wangen, Rose', 'Cichocki, Frank', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Miller, Jeffrey S', 'Bachanova, Veronika']","['Merino AM', 'Mehta RS', 'Luo X', 'Kim H', 'De For T', 'Janakiram M', 'Cooley S', 'Wangen R', 'Cichocki F', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Miller JS', 'Bachanova V']",,"['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Furthermore, the accompanying mutations and fusion genes with FLT3 mutations are unclear in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: We investigated FLT3 mutations and their correlation with other gene mutations and gene fusions through two RNA-seq based next-generation sequencing (NGS) method and prognostic impact in 207 de novo AML patients. RESULTS: FLT3-ITD mutations were positive in 58 patients (28%), and FLT3-TKD mutations were positive in 20 patients (9.7%). FLT3-ITD was associated with a higher white blood cell count (WBC, mean 72.9 x 10(9)/L vs. 24.2 x 10(9)/L, P = 0.000), higher bone marrow blasts (mean 65.9% vs. 56.0%, P = 0.024), and NK-AML (normal karyotype) (64.8% vs. 48.4%, P = 0.043). NPM1 and DNMT3A mutations were enriched in FLT3-ITD (53.5% vs. 15.3%, P = 0.000; 34.6% vs. 13%, P = 0.003). However, the mutations of CEBPA were excluded in FLT3-AML (3.8% vs. 0% vs. 19.8%, P = 0.005). Mutations of Ras and TP53 were unlikely associated with FLT3-ITD (1.9% vs. 20.6%, P = 0.006; 0% vs. 6.1%, P = 0.04). The common fusion genes (> 10%) in FLT3-ITD had MLL-rearrangement and NUP98-rearrangement, while the common fusion genes in FLT3-TKD had AML1-ETO and MLL-rearrangement. Two novel fusion genes PRDM16-SKI and EFAN2-ZNF238 were identified in FLT3-ITD patients. Gene fusions and NPM1 mutation were mutually excluded in FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD patients. Their patterns of mutual exclusivity and cooperation among mutated genes suggest that additional driver genetic alterations are required and reveal two evolutionary patterns of FLT3 pathogenesis. Patients with FLT3-ITD had a lower CR (complete remission) rate, lower 3-year OS (overall survival), DFS (disease-free survival), and EFS (event-free survival) compared to FLT3wtAML. NK-AML with FLT3-ITD had a lower 3-year OS, DFS, and EFS than those without, while FLT3-TKD did not influence the survival in whole cohort and NK-AML. Besides, we found that FLT3-ITD/TET2 bimutation defined a poor prognostic subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Our study offers deep insights into the molecular pathogenesis and biology of AML with FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD by providing the profiles of concurrent molecular alterations and the clinical impact of FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD on AML patients.","['Guan, Wei', 'Zhou, Lei', 'Li, Yan', 'Yang, Erna', 'Liu, Yangyang', 'Lv, Na', 'Fu, Lin', 'Ding, Yi', 'Wang, Nan', 'Fang, Nan', 'Liu, Qian', 'Wang, Binan', 'Li, Fuwei', 'Zhang, Juan', 'Wang, Maoquan', 'Wang, Lili', 'Jing, Yu', 'Li, Yonghui', 'Yu, Li']","['Guan W', 'Zhou L', 'Li Y', 'Yang E', 'Liu Y', 'Lv N', 'Fu L', 'Ding Y', 'Wang N', 'Fang N', 'Liu Q', 'Wang B', 'Li F', 'Zhang J', 'Wang M', 'Wang L', 'Jing Y', 'Li Y', 'Yu L']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5830-7089', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6872-2665']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University Third Hospital, 49 North Garden Road, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Precision Medicine for Hematological Malignancies, Carlson International Cancer Center, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, 1098 Xueyuan AVE, Shenzhen, 518060, China.', 'Beijing USCI Medical Laboratory Co., Ltd, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Precision Medicine for Hematological Malignancies, Carlson International Cancer Center, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, 1098 Xueyuan AVE, Shenzhen, 518060, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Beijing USCI Medical Laboratory Co., Ltd, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing USCI Medical Laboratory Co., Ltd, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing USCI Medical Laboratory Co., Ltd, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing USCI Medical Laboratory Co., Ltd, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing USCI Medical Laboratory Co., Ltd, Beijing, China.', 'School of Medicine, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Tianjin, 300071, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Precision Medicine for Hematological Malignancies, Carlson International Cancer Center, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, 1098 Xueyuan AVE, Shenzhen, 518060, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China. liyu301@vip.163.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Precision Medicine for Hematological Malignancies, Carlson International Cancer Center, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, 1098 Xueyuan AVE, Shenzhen, 518060, China. liyu301@vip.163.com.']",['eng'],"['81670162/the National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81800135/the National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81570137/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81870134/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '7202186/Beijing Natural Science Foundation', '2019ZX09201-002/Major science and technology projects for major new drug creation']",['Journal Article'],20210409,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,PMC8033687,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'FLT3-ITD', 'FLT3-TKD', 'Next-generation sequencing', 'TET2']",2021/04/11 06:00,2021/04/11 06:01,['2021/04/10 05:30'],"['2020/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/10 05:30 [entrez]', '2021/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40164-021-00207-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s40164-021-00207-4 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2021 Apr 9;10(1):27. doi: 10.1186/s40164-021-00207-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation as a complication of bursitis were not reported previously. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old Japanese woman was scheduled to undergo resection of a rapidly growing subcutaneous tumor-like lesion on her left back. Preoperative blood tests suggested disseminated intravascular coagulation. The resected lesion was cystic tumor containing a hematoma. After the operation, the patient completely recovered from disseminated intravascular coagulation, indicating that disseminated intravascular coagulation in this case was caused by the tumor. Pathological examination of the resected tumor revealed considerable fibrin deposition and angiogenesis on the cyst wall, which was presumably a response to inflammation and indicated presence of repetitive intratumoral bleeding, subsequently leading to a diagnosis of chronic hemorrhagic bursitis. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should note that, despite being benign, soft-tissue tumors accompanied by inflammation with angiogenesis and repetitive intratumoral bleeding can cause disseminated intravascular coagulation, albeit rarely.","['Hamada, Taisuke', 'Nishihara, Tasuku', 'Mizuno, Yosuke', 'Kidani, Teruki', 'Tokiwa, Hiroki', 'Abe, Naoki', 'Sekiya, Keisuke', 'Kitamura, Sakiko', 'Takasaki, Yasushi', 'Miura, Hiromasa', 'Yorozuya, Toshihiro']","['Hamada T', 'Nishihara T', 'Mizuno Y', 'Kidani T', 'Tokiwa H', 'Abe N', 'Sekiya K', 'Kitamura S', 'Takasaki Y', 'Miura H', 'Yorozuya T']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5734-0458'],"['Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Medicine, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Toon, Ehime, 791-0295, Japan.', 'Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Medicine, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Toon, Ehime, 791-0295, Japan. ntasukuk@yahoo.co.jp.', 'Division of Diagnostic Pathology, Ehime University Hospital, Toon, Ehime, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Toon, Ehime, Japan.', 'Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Medicine, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Toon, Ehime, 791-0295, Japan.', 'Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Medicine, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Toon, Ehime, 791-0295, Japan.', 'Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Medicine, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Toon, Ehime, 791-0295, Japan.', 'Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Medicine, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Toon, Ehime, 791-0295, Japan.', 'Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Medicine, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Toon, Ehime, 791-0295, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Toon, Ehime, Japan.', 'Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Medicine, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Toon, Ehime, 791-0295, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20210410,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,PMC8035724,['NOTNLM'],"['Angiogenesis', 'Bursitis', 'Chronic inflammation', 'DIC', 'Disseminated intravascular coagulation', 'Fibrinolytic phenotype', 'Intratumoral bleeding']",2021/04/11 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2021/04/10 05:28'],"['2019/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/10 05:28 [entrez]', '2021/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13256-021-02773-x [doi]', '10.1186/s13256-021-02773-x [pii]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2021 Apr 10;15(1):155. doi: 10.1186/s13256-021-02773-x.,20210514,,IM,"['Aged', '*Bursitis/complications', '*Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/etiology', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Humans', '*Neoplasms']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considering the key role of miR-15/16 loci in the pathogenesis of myeloid and lymphocytic leukemia, here we aimed to correlate the expression of miR-15a/16 and miR-15b/16 to progression of CML from chronic phase to BC. We analyzed the expression of the two miR-15/16 clusters in 17 CML patients in chronic phase and 22 patients in BC and in 11 paired chronic phase and BC CML patients. BC CMLs show a significant reduction of the expression of miR-15a/-15b/16 compared to CMLs in chronic phase. Moreover, BC CMLs showed an overexpression of miR-15/16 direct targets such as Bmi-1, ROR1, and Bcl-2 compared to CMLs in chronic phase. This study highlights the loss of both miR-15/16 clusters as a potential oncogenic driver in the transition from chronic phase to BC in CML patients.","['Lovat, Francesca', 'Gasparini, Pierluigi', 'Nigita, Giovanni', 'Larkin, Karilyn', 'Byrd, John C', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Carter, Bing Z', 'Croce, Carlo M']","['Lovat F', 'Gasparini P', 'Nigita G', 'Larkin K', 'Byrd JC', 'Minden MD', 'Andreeff M', 'Carter BZ', 'Croce CM']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1898-9836', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9089-8816', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1144-1958', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0076-0889', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3788-1457']","['Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, 2308 NSW, Australia.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210; carlo.croce@osumc.edu.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197706/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC7980455,['NOTNLM'],"['*blast crisis', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*miR-15/16 cluster']",2021/04/11 06:00,2021/09/10 06:00,['2021/04/10 01:01'],"['2021/04/10 01:01 [entrez]', '2021/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['2101566118 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.2101566118 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2021 Mar 16;118(11). pii: 2101566118. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2101566118.,20210909,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN15 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN16 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ROR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/*pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Loci', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors/genetics/metabolism']",,,,,,['The authors declare no competing interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is also evidence suggesting that inhibition of the BER enzyme 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1 (OGG1), which initiates repair of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) and 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (Fapy-dG), could be useful in treating certain cancers. Specifically, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), both the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion and the CBFB-MYH11 subtypes have lower levels of OGG1 expression, which correlate with increased therapeutic-induced cell cytotoxicity and good prognosis for improved, relapse-free survival compared with other AML patients. Here we present data demonstrating that AML cell lines deficient in OGG1 have enhanced sensitivity to cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside [Ara-C]) relative to OGG1-proficient cells. This enhanced cytotoxicity correlated with endogenous oxidatively-induced DNA damage and Ara-C-induced DNA strand breaks, with a large proportion of these breaks occurring at common fragile sites. This lethality was highly specific for Ara-C treatment of AML cells deficient in OGG1, with no other replication stress-inducing agents showing a correlation between cell killing and low OGG1 levels. The mechanism for this preferential toxicity was addressed using in vitro replication assays in which DNA polymerase delta was shown to insert Ara-C opposite 8-oxo-dG, resulting in termination of DNA synthesis. Overall, these data suggest that incorporation of Ara-C opposite unrepaired 8-oxo-dG may be the fundamental mechanism conferring selective toxicity and therapeutic effectiveness in OGG1-deficient AML cells.","['Owen, Nichole', 'Minko, Irina G', 'Moellmer, Samantha A', 'Cammann, Sydney K', 'Lloyd, R Stephen', 'McCullough, Amanda K']","['Owen N', 'Minko IG', 'Moellmer SA', 'Cammann SK', 'Lloyd RS', 'McCullough AK']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2691-3636', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4501-6917', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2362-2502', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7273-372X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9500-4973']","['Oregon Institute of Occupational Health Sciences, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Oregon Institute of Occupational Health Sciences, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Oregon Institute of Occupational Health Sciences, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Oregon Institute of Occupational Health Sciences, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Oregon Institute of Occupational Health Sciences, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.', 'Oregon Institute of Occupational Health Sciences, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239; mcculloa@ohsu.edu.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239.']",['eng'],['R21 CA216551/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC7980395,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML therapy', '*DNA polymerase delta', '*DNA repair', '*DNA replication', '*fragile site']",2021/04/11 06:00,2021/09/24 06:00,['2021/04/10 01:00'],"['2021/04/10 01:00 [entrez]', '2021/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['2016833118 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.2016833118 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2021 Mar 16;118(11). pii: 2016833118. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2016833118.,20210923,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', ""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", 'EC 3.2.2.- (DNA Glycosylases)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (oxoguanine glycosylase 1, human)']",IM,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine/genetics"", 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Glycosylases/*genetics', 'DNA Repair', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",,,,,,['The authors declare no competing interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report on the efficacy and safety of venetoclax combinations in AML patients treated outside of clinical trials. Complete remission (CR) + CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) were achieved in 61% of patients, with similar CR+CRi rates in with secondary AML, and in patients who were previously treated with HMA (61% and 43%, respectively). Relapse occurred in 25% of patients, with a median event-free survival (EFS) of 11.7 months (95% CI, 10.09-13.35) in responding patients. At a median follow up of 8.7 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 9.8 months (95% CI 6.42-13.3) in the entire cohort. In multivariate analysis adverse karyotype was the only negative predictor of CR/CRi (p = .03), while both ECOG performance status (PS) and adverse karyotype were significantly associated with shorter OS (p = .023 and .038, respectively). Median OS was higher in patients achieving CR/CRi and in patients proceeding to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Treatment was well tolerated, with side effects similar to those described in the randomized clinical trials. Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) occurred in 12% of patients. Our data support the efficacy and safety of venetoclax combinations in newly diagnosed AML patients not eligible for intensive therapy. According to our data, secondary AML patients could benefit from venetoclax combinations similarly to de-novo AML patients, and allo-SCT could be offered to selected patients achieving CR/CRi.","['Apel, Arie', 'Moshe, Yakir', 'Ofran, Yishai', 'Gural, Alexander', 'Wolach, Ofir', 'Ganzel, Chezi', 'Canaani, Jonathan', 'Zektser, Miri', 'Duek, Adrian', 'Stemer, Galia', 'Hellman, Ilana', 'Basood, May', 'Frisch, Avraham', 'Leibovitch, Chiya', 'Koren-Michowitz, Maya']","['Apel A', 'Moshe Y', 'Ofran Y', 'Gural A', 'Wolach O', 'Ganzel C', 'Canaani J', 'Zektser M', 'Duek A', 'Stemer G', 'Hellman I', 'Basood M', 'Frisch A', 'Leibovitch C', 'Koren-Michowitz M']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6269-9994', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5521-1337', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8662-0707', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1722-4807', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5294-3524']","['Department of Hematology, Shamir Medical Center (formerly Assaf Harofe Medical Center), Zerifin, Israel, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Hematology, Hasassah-Hebrew-University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Belinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Faculty of Health Science, Soroka University Medical Center, Beersheba, Israel.', 'Hematology Department, Assuta Medical Center, Ashdod, Israel.', 'Hematology Unit, Haemek Medical Center, Afula, Israel.', 'Hematology Unit, Meir Medical Center, Kfar Saba, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Belinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Shamir Medical Center (formerly Assaf Harofe Medical Center), Zerifin, Israel, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210429,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,,,2021/04/10 06:00,2021/06/29 06:00,['2021/04/09 20:24'],"['2021/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/29 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/09 20:24 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.26190 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2021 Jul 1;96(7):790-795. doi: 10.1002/ajh.26190.

The nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) test kit is commonly used to diagnose patients with acute febrile illness in dengue-endemic countries, although this test kit can yield false-positive results. The Dengue NS1 test kit mostly relies on cross-reaction among febrile illness patients with other viral infections rather than malignancies. CASE REPORT A 52-year-old male patient presented with 3 days of fever, intermittent gum bleeding, weight loss, and mucocutaneous bleeding. He was transferred to a second hospital with acute febrile illness. Both dengue NS1 antigen test kits were positive from the 2 hospitals where he was previously treated. Fever and cytopenia persisted, and then the dengue RT-PCR test was performed to establish the cause of illness. A peripheral blood smear was reviewed and showed blast cells. A bone marrow examination was done to test for the compatibility of lymphoblastic leukemia. The flow cytometry test showed B cells ALL with Philadelphia-positive chromosome. Finally, the result of the dengue RT-PCR test was negative. CONCLUSIONS Our patient presented with fever and viral-like illness, but he was finally diagnosed with Ph+ ALL. We demonstrated the first case of false-positive dengue NS1 antigen in a Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patient. Moreover, we reviewed the literature to gather information on false-positive results using the dengue NS1 test kit. The dengue NS1 test kit is useful and produces reliable clinical findings, especially in patients with hematological malignancies.","['Chamnanchanunt, Supat', 'Thungthong, Pravinwan', 'Abdulkanan, Asrinda', 'Nakhakes, Chajchawan']","['Chamnanchanunt S', 'Thungthong P', 'Abdulkanan A', 'Nakhakes C']",,"['Department of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Rajavithi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Rajavithi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Rajavithi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20210409,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,PMC8045561,,,2021/04/10 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2021/04/09 17:15'],"['2021/04/09 17:15 [entrez]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['928865 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.928865 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2021 Apr 9;22:e928865. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.928865.,20210514,['0 (Viral Nonstructural Proteins)'],IM,"['*Dengue/diagnosis', '*Dengue Virus/genetics', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Viral Nonstructural Proteins/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 641 1-year survivors of HCT, transplanted between 2010 and 2013 as adults, and in remission from their primary disease. Standardized definitions were used to characterize viral, fungal, and bacterial infections. Cumulative incidence of infections was calculated, with relapse/progression considered as a competing risk event. Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard ratio estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained, adjusted for relevant covariates. RESULTS: Median age at HCT was 55.2 years (range 18.1-78.1 years); 54.0% were survivors of allogeneic HCT. The 5-year cumulative incidence of a late-occurring infection for the entire cohort was 31.6%; the incidence of polymicrobial (>/=2) infections was 10.1%. In survivors who developed at least one infection, the 5-year incidence of a subsequent infection was 45.3%. Among allogeneic HCT survivors, patients with acute lymphoblastic (HR = 1.82 95% CI [1.12-2.96]) or myeloid (HR = 1.50 95% CI [1.02-2.20]) leukemia, and those with an elevated HCT-Comorbidity index score (HR = 1.09 95% CI [1.01-1.17]) were more likely to develop late-occurring infections; there was an incremental risk associated with severity of graft versus host disease (GVHD) at 1-year post-HCT (mild: HR = 2.17, 95% CI [1.09-4.33]; moderate/severe: HR = 3.78, 95% CI [1.90-7.53]; reference: no GVHD). CONCLUSIONS: The burden of late-occurring infections in HCT survivors is substantial, and there are important patient- and HCT-related modifiers of risk over time. These findings may help guide personalized screening and prevention strategies to improve outcomes after HCT.","['Sy, Andrew', 'Chanson, Dayana', 'Berano Teh, Jennifer', 'Wong, Florence L', 'Nakamura, Ryotaro', 'Dadwal, Sanjeet', 'Armenian, Saro H']","['Sy A', 'Chanson D', 'Berano Teh J', 'Wong FL', 'Nakamura R', 'Dadwal S', 'Armenian SH']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9946-8812', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2604-8603']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA."", 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology & Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 HL150069/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210409,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,PMC8086032,['NOTNLM'],"['*graft versus host disease', '*hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*late-occurring infections', '*long-term', '*survivors']",2021/04/10 06:00,2021/07/21 06:00,['2021/04/09 13:06'],"['2021/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/09 13:06 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.3896 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2021 May;10(9):2956-2966. doi: 10.1002/cam4.3896.

Interestingly, HTLV-1 infection does not necessarily imply the development of pathological processes and it is unknown why some patients remain asymptomatic carriers (AC). Despite some mutations in the HTLV-1 genome appear to influence the outcome of HTLV-1, there are few studies that characterize molecularly the hbz region. This study aimed to perform the molecular characterization of hbz gene isolated from patients with different clinical outcomes. A total of 15 sequences were generated and analyzed with 571 sequences previously published. The analises showed that the R119Q mutation seems to be related to HTLV-1 clinical conditions since the frequency of this HBZ mutation is significantly different in comparison between AC with HAM/TSP and ATLL. The R119Q mutation is possibly a protective factor as the frequency is higher in AC sequences.","['Cucco, Marina Silveira', 'de Moraes, Laise Eduarda Paixao', 'de Oliveira Andrade, Felipe', 'Khouri, Ricardo', 'Galvao-Castro, Bernardo', 'Araujo, Thessika Hialla Almeida', 'de Almeida Rego, Filipe Ferreira', 'Gois, Luana Leandro', 'Barreto, Fernanda Khouri', 'Santos, Luciane Amorim']","['Cucco MS', 'de Moraes LEP', 'de Oliveira Andrade F', 'Khouri R', 'Galvao-Castro B', 'Araujo THA', 'de Almeida Rego FF', 'Gois LL', 'Barreto FK', 'Santos LA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3062-0273', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9095-5860', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0970-7005', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5664-4436', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0644-6471', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0420-8082', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6102-6672', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7538-3558', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0088-9036', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0261-3495']","['Escola Bahiana de Medicina e Saude Publica, Salvador, Bahia, Brasil.', 'Instituto Goncalo Moniz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Salvador, Bahia, Brasil.', 'Programa de Pos-graduacao em Ciencias da Saude, Faculdade de Medicina da Bahia, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Salvador, Bahia, Brasil.', 'Universidade Federal da Bahia, Vitoria da Conquista, Bahia, Brasil.', 'Instituto Goncalo Moniz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Salvador, Bahia, Brasil.', 'Programa de Pos-graduacao em Ciencias da Saude, Faculdade de Medicina da Bahia, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Salvador, Bahia, Brasil.', 'Escola Bahiana de Medicina e Saude Publica, Salvador, Bahia, Brasil.', 'Escola Bahiana de Medicina e Saude Publica, Salvador, Bahia, Brasil.', 'Universidade Catolica do Salvador, Salvador, Bahia, Brasil.', 'Escola Bahiana de Medicina e Saude Publica, Salvador, Bahia, Brasil.', 'Instituto Goncalo Moniz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Salvador, Bahia, Brasil.', 'Universidade Catolica do Salvador, Salvador, Bahia, Brasil.', 'Universidade Federal da Bahia, Vitoria da Conquista, Bahia, Brasil.', 'Escola Bahiana de Medicina e Saude Publica, Salvador, Bahia, Brasil.', 'Instituto Goncalo Moniz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Salvador, Bahia, Brasil.', 'Programa de Pos-graduacao em Ciencias da Saude, Faculdade de Medicina da Bahia, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Salvador, Bahia, Brasil.', 'Universidade Catolica do Salvador, Salvador, Bahia, Brasil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210621,United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,,['NOTNLM'],"['*HBZ', '*HTLV-1', '*molecular characterization', '*sequence']",2021/04/10 06:00,2021/12/30 06:00,['2021/04/09 12:57'],"['2021/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/30 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/09 12:57 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jmv.27005 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Virol. 2021 Nov;93(11):6418-6423. doi: 10.1002/jmv.27005.

We had earlier reported jacalin to be mitogenic to K562, the Bcr-Abl expressing erythroleukemia cell line. The dearth of studies highlighting the proliferative effects of jacalin and other lectins motivated us to unveil the mechanism underlying the mitogenic effects of jacalin. Caveolin-1 (cav-1) is an integral membrane protein, known to play a crucial role in cell signaling, lipid transport, and membrane trafficking. The role of cav-1 in tumorigenesis is considered to be controversial as it can suppress as well as promote tumor growth, depending on the cellular context. In the present study, we propose that cav-1 plays the central role in the mitogenic effects of jacalin on the K562 cells. In accordance, the mRNA, as well as protein expression of cav-1 was found to be upregulated in the jacalin-treated K562 cells as compared to the untreated control. Further, jacalin stimulation also increased the phosphorylation of ERK and Akt. The rationale that leads to the initial conjecture about cav-1 was that the sequence of jacalin possesses a cav-1-binding site.","['V, Lavanya', 'Jamal, Shazia', 'Ahmed, Neesar']","['V L', 'Jamal S', 'Ahmed N']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7367-2188'],"['School of Life Sciences, B S A Crescent Institute of Science and Technology, Vandalur, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, 600048, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Guru Nanak College, Velachery, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, 600042, India.', 'School of Life Sciences, B S A Crescent Institute of Science and Technology, Vandalur, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, 600048, India.', 'School of Life Sciences, B S A Crescent Institute of Science and Technology, Vandalur, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, 600048, India. neesar.sls@crescent.education.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210409,United States,Glycoconj J,Glycoconjugate journal,8603310,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Caveolin-1', '*Jacalin', '*K562 cells', '*PP2A']",2021/04/10 06:00,2021/04/10 06:00,['2021/04/09 12:52'],"['2020/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/09 12:52 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10719-021-09998-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s10719-021-09998-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Glycoconj J. 2021 Jun;38(3):361-368. doi: 10.1007/s10719-021-09998-4.

However, hospitalization and death by disease category are not well defined < 5 years from diagnosis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using linked cancer registry-hospital discharge-vital records to identify cancer cases < 20 years at diagnosis during 1987-2012 (n = 4,567) and comparison children without cancer, matched on birth year and sex (n = 45,582). Data linkage identified serious morbidities resulting in cancer- and non-cancer-related hospitalizations or deaths < 5 years from diagnosis. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated to compare relative hospitalization and mortality by disease category and after excluding cancer-related outcomes. Among cancer cases, relative risks of these outcomes for children with solid tumors compared with children with leukemia/lymphoma were also estimated. RESULTS: Greater rates of all-cause hospitalization (281.5/1,000 vs. 6.2/1,000 person years) and death (40.7/1,000 vs. 0.15/1,000 person years) were observed in childhood cancer cases than comparators and across all diagnosis categories. Increased hospitalization (31.0/1,000 vs. 6.2/1,000 person years; HR 5.0, 95% CI 4.5-5.5) and death (1.0/1,000 vs. 0.15/1,000 person years; HR 10.4, 95% CI 5.6-19.1) rates remained when cancer-related outcomes were excluded. Although HRs for hospitalization and death did not differ greatly by treatment era, absolute rates of hospitalization were greater (1987-1999: 233.3/1,000; 2000-2012: 320.0/1,000 person years) and death were lesser (1987-1999: 46.3/1,000; 2000-2012: 36.8/1,000 person years) in the later treatment era among cases. Children with solid tumors were less likely to have a cancer-related hospitalization than were those with leukemia/lymphoma (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84-0.98). CONCLUSION: Even after excluding cancer-related diagnoses, children with cancer experience greater rates of hospitalization and death in all disease categories. Results may guide future toxicity mitigation initiatives and inform anticipatory guidance for families of children with cancer.","['Steineck, Angela', 'Chow, Eric J', 'Doody, David R', 'Mueller, Beth A']","['Steineck A', 'Chow EJ', 'Doody DR', 'Mueller BA']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8000-0179'],"[""Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA, USA. angela.steineck@seattlechildrens.org."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA. angela.steineck@seattlechildrens.org.', ""Center for Clinical and Translational Research, Seattle Children's Research Institute, 1900 9t h Ave, MS JMB 10-C, Seattle, WA, 98101, USA. angela.steineck@seattlechildrens.org."", 'Cambia Palliative Care Center of Excellence, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. angela.steineck@seattlechildrens.org.', ""Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['T32 CA009351/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32CA009351-40/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CN067009/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DP12-1205 DP003899-02/CC/CDC HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201300012I/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01PC35142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201000029C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CN005230/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U58 DP003899/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20210409,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,PMC8215887,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Cohort study', 'Hospitalization', 'Mortality', 'Pediatric', 'Population-based study']",2021/04/10 06:00,2021/07/13 06:00,['2021/04/09 12:50'],"['2020/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/07/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/09 12:50 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10552-021-01425-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s10552-021-01425-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2021 Jul;32(7):739-752. doi: 10.1007/s10552-021-01425-1.

METHODS: Data of 961 consecutive subjects with newly-diagnosed CML were integrated for these outcomes in multi-variable Cox regression analyses after adjusting for confounders and interactions. RESULTS: Elder age was associated with less use of a 2nd generation TKI as initial therapy. Household registration, comorbidity(ies) and education level were associated with use of a generic rather than branded TKI as initial therapy. Subjects with lower education level were more likely to be diagnosed with CML because of leukaemia-related symptoms. Rural registration and lower education level were also associated with a greater likelihood of switching TKI-therapy. Lower education level was associated with lower likelihood of achieving MMR [HR = 0.8 (0.7, 0.9), p = 0.002], MR(4.5) [HR = 0.8 (0.7, 1.0), p = 0.055], and poor FFS [HR = 1.7 (1.3, 2.5); p < 0.001], PFS [HR = 2.0 (1.1, 5.0); p = 0.014], CML-related survival [HR = 2.5 (1.0, 10.0); p = 0.060] and survival [HR = 2.5 (1.0, 10.0); p = 0.043].

In contrast to typical molluscum contagiosum, dermoscopic features of giant lesions have been poorly described, and none of the reports included multiple giant lesions in an immunocompromised patient. We present a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome diagnosed with multiple giant molluscum contagiosum along with the dermoscopic features of this entity. We examined a 40-year-old patient who had been diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) two months earlier. The disease defining AIDS was cerebral toxoplasmosis (initially presenting as a brain tumor several months earlier). Laboratory investigation showed a decreased CD4 cell count of 11 cells/mm3 and HIV viral load of 252 472 copies/mL. The patient was referred to the Department of Dermatology due to multiple flesh-colored, asymptomatic nodules with superficial telangiectasia that had been observed on the face for several weeks (Figure 1, a). Dermoscopy of larger (>5 mm) skin lesions showed yellowish globules of different size and random distribution, separated by smaller, oval-shape white globules and polymorphic vessels (Figure 1, b-d). Dermoscopy of smaller skin lesions showed the presence of a central yellow globule and white structureless area with irregular linear vessels of radial arrangement at the periphery (Figure 1, e). Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum (MC); special staining showed the details of the lesion (Figure 2, a-c). Antiretroviral therapy with Triumeq(R) (dolutegravir + abacavir + lamivudine) was initiated. After discussing MC treatment options with the patient, we decided to delay the treatment and wait for the effect of antiretroviral therapy. Partial regression of MC lesions was observed after 5 months; laboratory investigations showed a CD4 cell count of 99 cells/mm3 and a HIV viral load of 56 copies/mL. Along with continuation of antiretroviral therapy, the patient received treatment with topical imiquimod (Aldara(R)) for 12 weeks. Subsequently, a few lesions resistant to previous treatment were treated with cryosurgery and the patient was instructed to apply imiquimod only to new-onset/regrowing lesions. Clinical evaluation after 2 months revealed a good clinical and aesthetic effect (Figure 3). MC is a viral disease caused by a DNA virus of the Poxviridae family (MCV-1 or MCV-2). The infection most commonly affects children and sexually active adults, and may be diagnosed based on physical examination in the majority of cases. Typical clinical presentation includes single to multiple, 2-5 mm, flesh-colored, asymptomatic nodules with central umbilication. Dermoscopy is a non-invasive diagnostic method that allows skin examination with magnification, therefore improving the accuracy of dermatological diagnosis. It was primarily developed to detect melanoma, but in recent years the role of this method in general dermatology has been constantly increasing. There have been several published reports that demonstrated the utility of dermoscopy in the diagnosis of MC. Most commonly observed structures include a central orifice and blood vessels arranged in punctiform, radial or mixed flower pattern (1). Giant molluscum contagiosum is an atypical variant of the disease, with the presence of multiple or single lesions larger than 5 mm (2). The diagnosis of giant MC usually indicates immunodeficiency and has been mainly described in HIV-positive patients, but also in coexistence with leukemia, sarcoidosis, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, selective immunoglobulin M deficiency, atopic dermatitis, and after splenectomy, bone marrow transplantation, and during immunosuppressive therapy (3). Giant MC may mimic other benign or malignant dermatoses, and the final diagnosis is usually based on histopathological examination. The list of differential diagnoses is long and includes basal cell carcinoma, keratoacanthoma, viral wart, varicella, intradermal nevi, pyogenic granuloma, lichen planus, atypical mycobacterial infection, pneumocystosis, cutaneous cryptococcosis, and histoplasmosis (3). In contrast to typical MC, dermoscopic features of giant MC have been poorly described, and none of the reports included multiple lesions in immunocompromised patient. Mun et al. described a pattern of multiple shiny white clods in giant MC observed in a 2-year-old girl in the perianal area (4). A different dermoscopic image - with prominent arborizing vessels and polylobular white structureless areas - was reported by Uzuncakmak et al., who described giant MC on the eyelid in a 25-year-old woman (2). Similar dermoscopic features of atypical MC (5 mm in size) were described by Zaballos et. al. (5). The course and treatment of MC differ in immunocompetent and in immunocompromised individuals. While the infection is usually mild and self-limiting in the former group, in the latter it may be extensive, symptomatic, and resistant to therapy. Treatment methods commonly applied in immunocompetent patients such as cryotherapy, curettage, and electrocautery are not generally recommended in patients with severe immunodeficiency as they pose a risk of secondary infection or autoinoculation (6). Additionally, such treatment of multiple lesions is connected with pain and higher risk of postinflammatory changes/scarring (7). According to the literature, treatment with local immunomodulators - including imiquimod cream, interferon-a (IFN-a) injections and cidofovir - appears to be effective (6). Topical 5% imiquimod was most commonly used, and although not licensed for this indication it was shown to be effective in HIV-positive individuals, including treatment of giant MC lesions (7). Regardless of the topical treatment, previous reports documented a correlation between immunity status and the extension of MC lesions. Therefore, effective antiretroviral therapy may itself lead to resolution of MC [8]. To sum up, the presented report introduced additional observations into the dermoscopic spectrum of giant MC. The observed dermoscopically large yellowish globules seem to correspond with the crypts and the surrounding white structures with the areas of lobulated, endophytic epidermal hyperplasia. The presence of vascular structures in dermoscopy corresponds with the blood vessels tightly surrounding inverted hyperplastic epidermal lobules (Figure 2, b). Dermoscopic features od giant MC are different than those observed in small lesions. Interestingly, the dermoscopic appearance of smaller lesions observed in our patient seemed to be similar to MC eruptions described in immunocompetent patients (1). In case of clinical suspicion giant MC coexisting with smaller lesions, dermoscopic assessment of the latter may serve as a clue to diagnosis.","['Slawinska, Martyna', 'Hlebowicz, Maria', 'Izycka-Swieszewska, Ewa', 'Sikorska, Monika', 'Sokolowska-Wojdylo, Malgorzata', 'Smiatacz, Tomasz', 'Gesing, Marta', 'Nowicki, Roman J', 'Sobjanek, Michal']","['Slawinska M', 'Hlebowicz M', 'Izycka-Swieszewska E', 'Sikorska M', 'Sokolowska-Wojdylo M', 'Smiatacz T', 'Gesing M', 'Nowicki RJ', 'Sobjanek M']",,"['Martyna Slawinska MD, PhD, Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology Medical University of Gdansk, Smoluchowskiego 17 Street, 80-214 Gdansk; mslawinska@gumed.edu.pl.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Croatia,Acta Dermatovenerol Croat,Acta dermatovenerologica Croatica : ADC,9433781,,,,2021/04/10 06:00,2021/10/26 06:00,['2021/04/09 12:25'],"['2021/04/09 12:25 [entrez]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Acta Dermatovenerol Croat. 2020 Dec;28(7):233-235.,20211025,['P1QW714R7M (Imiquimod)'],IM,"['*Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications', 'Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imiquimod', '*Melanoma', '*Molluscum Contagiosum/complications', '*Skin Neoplasms']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed the presence of the CML LSCs in the peripheral blood (PB) and concurrently in the BM in the patients with chronic-phase CML (CP CML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with CP CML were included into the study. CD45(+) /CD34(+) /CD38(-) cells with positive CD26 expression were considered as CML LSCs (CD26(+) LSC) by using multiparameter flow cytometry (FCM). RESULTS: Mean BCR-ABL, PB LSC, and BM LSC were 58.528 IS (37.405-83.414 IS), 237.5 LSC/muL (16-737.5 LSC/muL), and 805 LSC/10(6) WBCs (134.6-2470 LSC/10(6) WBCs), respectively, in newly diagnosed CML patients. In the patients with BCR-ABL positive hematopoiesis, mean BCR-ABL, PB LSCs, and BM LSCs were 30.09 IS (0.024-147.690 IS), 13.5 LSC/muL (0-248.7 LSC/muL) and 143.5 LSC/10(6) WBCs (9-455.2 LSC/10(6) WBCs), respectively. No CML LSCs were detected in PB of patients who achieved deep molecular response (DMR). BM LSCs of the patients who were in DMR were 281.1 LSC/10(6) WBCs (3.1-613.7 LSC/10(6) WBCs). The amount of PB LSCs was highest in patients with newly diagnosed CML (P < .001). CONCLUSION: LSCs persisted in the BM of the patients with DMR, whereas there was no LSCs in the peripheral blood. The investigation of the CML LSCs in bone marrow before deciding TKI discontinuation could be justified to achieve and maintain stable TFR.","['Ilhan, Osman', 'Narli Ozdemir, Zehra', 'Dalva, Klara', 'Arslan, Aysenur', 'Okay Ozgeyik, Mufide', 'Ipek, Senay', 'Saydam, Guray', 'Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim C']","['Ilhan O', 'Narli Ozdemir Z', 'Dalva K', 'Arslan A', 'Okay Ozgeyik M', 'Ipek S', 'Saydam G', 'Haznedaroglu IC']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3237-320X'],"['Department of Hematology, Ankara University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Ministry of Health Ankara City Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Ankara University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Ege University School of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Ministry of Health Eskisehir City Hospital, Eskisehir, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Ankara University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Ege University School of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],['54173265/Pfizer'],['Journal Article'],20210409,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'flow cytometry', 'stem cell']",2021/04/10 06:00,2021/11/30 06:00,['2021/04/09 06:50'],"['2021/03/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/30 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/09 06:50 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13528 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2021 Oct;43(5):1110-1116. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13528.

METHODS: Transcriptome sequencing was used to detect potential fusion transcripts. Other laboratory results and clinical data of the patient were also analyzed. RESULTS: The patient was found to harbor TCF3 exon 17-ZNF384 exon 7 in-frame fusion transcript. The minimal residual disease (MRD) has remained positive after multiple chemotherapy protocols including CD19-, CD22- targeted chimeric antigen receptor T cells immunotherapy. The patient eventually achieved complete remission and sustained MRD negativity after allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). CONCLUSION: Transcriptome sequencing can effectively detect potential fusion genes with clinical significance in leukemia. TCF3-ZNF384 positive B-ALL has unique laboratory and clinical characteristics, may not well respond to chemotherapy and immunotherapy, and is more likely to relapse. Timely allo-HSCT treatment may help such patients to achieve long-term disease-free survival.

Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 result in distinct mutational landscapes and differentially modulate the tumor-immune microenvironment, with gene expression programs related to both adaptive and innate immunity enriched in BRCA2-deficient tumors. Single-cell RNA sequencing further revealed distinct T cell, natural killer, macrophage, and dendritic cell populations enriched in BRCA2-deficient tumors. Taken together, our findings reveal the divergent effects of BRCA1 and BRCA2-deficiency on ICB outcome, and have significant implications for elucidating the genetic and microenvironmental determinants of response to immunotherapy.","['Samstein, Robert M', 'Krishna, Chirag', 'Ma, Xiaoxiao', 'Pei, Xin', 'Lee, Ken-Wing', 'Makarov, Vladimir', 'Kuo, Fengshen', 'Chung, Jonathan', 'Srivastava, Raghvendra M', 'Purohit, Tanaya A', 'Hoen, Douglas R', 'Mandal, Rajarsi', 'Setton, Jeremy', 'Wu, Wei', 'Shah, Rachna', 'Qeriqi, Besnik', 'Chang, Qing', 'Kendall, Sviatoslav', 'Braunstein, Lior', 'Weigelt, Britta', 'Carrillo Albornoz, Pedro Blecua', 'Morris, Luc G T', 'Mandelker, Diana L', 'Reis-Filho, Jorge S', 'de Stanchina, Elisa', 'Powell, Simon N', 'Chan, Timothy A', 'Riaz, Nadeem']","['Samstein RM', 'Krishna C', 'Ma X', 'Pei X', 'Lee KW', 'Makarov V', 'Kuo F', 'Chung J', 'Srivastava RM', 'Purohit TA', 'Hoen DR', 'Mandal R', 'Setton J', 'Wu W', 'Shah R', 'Qeriqi B', 'Chang Q', 'Kendall S', 'Braunstein L', 'Weigelt B', 'Carrillo Albornoz PB', 'Morris LGT', 'Mandelker DL', 'Reis-Filho JS', 'de Stanchina E', 'Powell SN', 'Chan TA', 'Riaz N']",,"['Dept. of Radiation Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065.', 'Dept. of Radiation Oncology, Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, NY 10029.', 'Precision Immunology Institute at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029.', 'These authors contributed equally: Robert M.

Although therapeutic concentrations of voriconazole (VCZ) have been documented for infected skin, there is no evidence specifying whether specific dermatologic side effects could predict high VCZ serum concentration, especially in high-risk leukemic children. Case report: Herein, we report a unique skin side effect of VCZ in a 5-year-old boy with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) referred to Amir Medical Oncology Center in Shiraz, Iran. The patient experienced erythroderma and macular rashes shortly after VCZ consumption, leading to generalized exfoliative skin rashes. Concurrent to these skin manifestations, VCZ serum concentration reached the supratherapeutic levels despite the recommended VCZ doses. As a result, VCZ was withheld, and the patient was treated with caspofungin. The lesions were resolved gradually within 2 weeks, and the patient successfully completed his treatment course with caspofungin. Conclusion: The unique case presented in this study emphasizes the need for a high index of suspicion for VCZ toxicity in any patient with atypical dermatologic manifestations, especially generalized exfoliative skin rashes. Based on this report, VCZ supratherapeutic concentration could be predicted early in the course of treatment. Additional therapeutic dose monitoring should be considered to establish a confirmatory diagnosis. It is required to further investigate the toxic effect of high VCZ concentration on the skin epithelium.","['Amanati, Ali', 'Badiee, Parisa', 'Lotfi, Mehrzad', 'Monabati, Ahmad', 'Faghihi, Mohammad Ali', 'Yavarian, Majid', 'Hatami Mazinani, Nazafarin']","['Amanati A', 'Badiee P', 'Lotfi M', 'Monabati A', 'Faghihi MA', 'Yavarian M', 'Hatami Mazinani N']",,"['Professor Alborzi Clinical Microbiology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Professor Alborzi Clinical Microbiology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Medical Imaging Research Center, Department of Radiology, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Hematopathology, Molecular Pathology and Cytogenetics, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Center for Therapeutic Innovation, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Miami, Miami, USA.', 'Persian Bayan Gene Research and Training Center, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Persian Bayan Gene Research and Training Center, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Iran,Curr Med Mycol,Current medical mycology,101647935,PMC8018824,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Skin rash', 'Therapeutic drug monitoring', 'Voriconazole']",2021/04/10 06:00,2021/04/10 06:01,['2021/04/09 06:32'],"['2021/04/09 06:32 [entrez]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18502/cmm.6.3.4500 [doi]', 'CMM-6-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Med Mycol. 2020 Sep;6(3):73-78. doi: 10.18502/cmm.6.3.4500.,,,,,"['Copyright: (c) 2020, Published by Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences on', 'behalf of Iranian Society of Medical Mycology and Invasive Fungi Research Center.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The complete blood count (CBC) is an easy and inexpensive test that provides information on blood content. Platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and delta neutrophil index (DNI) are relatively novel biomarkers that have been used in the prognosis of various diseases. We aimed to determine the usefulness of PLR, NLR, and DNI in predicting the outcomes of SCA. Materials and Methods: This retrospective observational study was performed on patients with SCA. Patients who visited the tertiary university hospital from January 2015 to December 2019 were targeted. The inclusion criteria were all nontraumatic adult out-hospital cardiac arrest patients. We analyzed DNI, PLR, and NLR based on the CBC results of all enrolled patients. The exclusion criteria were as follows: no data on laboratory study, traumatic arrest, age < 18 years, and a history of leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and myelofibrosis. The primary outcome was assessed as return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), the secondary outcome as survival to discharge, and the tertiary outcome as neurological outcome. Results: From January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2019, 739 patients were enrolled. ROSC was seen in 324 patients, of whom 60 had survival to discharge and 24 had good neurological outcome at the time of discharge (cerebral performance categories (CPCs) 1-2). The PLR of the ROSC group was 42.41 (range: 4.21-508.7), which was higher than that of the No-ROSC group (p=0.006). The DNI value of the survival group was 0.00 (range: 0.00-40.9), which was lower than that of the nonsurvival group. Conclusions: Patients with SCA and subsequent ROSC had higher PLR and NLR, while those with survival to discharge had lower DNI values than those with nonsurvival to discharge (p=0.005).","['Han, Sang Il', 'Cha, Kyoung-Chul', 'Roh, Young Il', 'Hwang, Sung Oh', 'Jung, Woo Jin', 'Kim, Tae Youn']","['Han SI', 'Cha KC', 'Roh YI', 'Hwang SO', 'Jung WJ', 'Kim TY']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1818-2466', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8317-4943', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4585-3181', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9368-0196', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0353-5345']","['Department of Emergency Medicine, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210324,Egypt,Emerg Med Int,Emergency medicine international,101567070,PMC8012140,,,2021/04/10 06:00,2021/04/10 06:01,['2021/04/09 06:28'],"['2020/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/09 06:28 [entrez]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2021/6650958 [doi]'],epublish,Emerg Med Int. 2021 Mar 24;2021:6650958. doi: 10.1155/2021/6650958. eCollection 2021.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2021 Sang Il Han et al.'],,,,,['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Emerging evidence demonstrates that circRNAs play crucial roles in many biological processes by regulating linear RNA transcription, downstream gene expression and protein or peptide translation. Meanwhile, recent studies have suggested that circRNAs have the potential to be oncogenic or anti-oncogenic and play vital regulatory roles in the initiation and progression of tumors. Circular RNA Forkhead box O3 (circ-Foxo3, hsa_circ_0006404) is encoded by the human FOXO3 gene and is one of the most studied circular RNAs acting as a sponge for potential microRNAs (miRNAs) (Du et al., 2016). Previous studies have reported that circ-Foxo3 is involved in the development and tumorigenesis of a variety of cancers (bladder, gastric, acute lymphocytic leukemia, glioma, etc.). In this review, we summarize the current studies concerning circ-Foxo3 deregulation and the correlative mechanism in various human cancers. We also point out the potential clinical applications of this circRNA as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.","['Yang, Tianli', 'Li, Yang', 'Zhao, Feng', 'Zhou, Liuhua', 'Jia, Ruipeng']","['Yang T', 'Li Y', 'Zhao F', 'Zhou L', 'Jia R']",,"['Department of Urology, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Urology, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Urology, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Urology, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Urology, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210323,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,PMC8021895,['NOTNLM'],"['FOXO3', 'biomarker', 'cancers', 'circular RNAs', 'microrna sponge']",2021/04/10 06:00,2021/04/10 06:01,['2021/04/09 06:26'],"['2021/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/09 06:26 [entrez]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2021.652995 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2021 Mar 23;12:652995. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2021.652995. eCollection 2021.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Yang, Li, Zhao, Zhou and Jia.']",,,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty to forty percent of DLBCL patients still experience relapse or develop refractory disease even with standard immunochemotherapy, leading to a poor prognosis. Currently, although several gene-based classification methods can be used to predict the prognosis of DLBCL, some patients are still unable to be classified. This study was performed to identify a novel prognostic biomarker for DLBCL. Patients and Methods: A total of 1850 B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) patients in 8 independent datasets with microarray gene expression profiles were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project (LLMPP). The candidate genes were selected through three filters in a strict pipeline. Survival analysis was performed in two independent datasets of patients with both gene expression data and clinical information. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and the CIBERSORT algorithm were used to explore the biological functions of the genes. Results: We identified 6 candidate genes associated with the clinical outcome of DLBCL patients: CHN1, CD3D, CLU, ICOS, KLRB1 and LAT. Unlike the other five genes, CHN1 has not been previously reported to be implicated in lymphoma. We also observed that CHN1 had prognostic significance in important clinical subgroups; in particular, high CHN1 expression was significantly related to good outcomes in DLBCL patients with the germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) subtype, stage III-IV, or an International Prognostic Index (IPI) score > 2. Multivariate Cox regression analysis of the two datasets showed that CHN1 was an independent prognostic factor for DLBCL. Additionally, GSEA and CIBERSORT indicated that CHN1 was correlated with cell adhesion and T cell immune infiltration. Conclusion: Our data indicate for the first time that high CHN1 expression is associated with favorable outcomes in DLBCL patients, suggesting its potential utility as a prognostic marker in DLBCL.","['Sun, Jie', 'Zhu, Xiaoquan', 'Zhao, Yanyang', 'Zhou, Qi', 'Qi, Ruomei', 'Liu, Hui']","['Sun J', 'Zhu X', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhou Q', 'Qi R', 'Liu H']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8568-6472', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8961-8015']","[""Department of Hematology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Graduate School of Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Laboratory of Geriatrics, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Laboratory of Geriatrics, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Laboratory of Geriatrics, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Laboratory of Geriatrics, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Graduate School of Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210401,New Zealand,Pharmgenomics Pers Med,Pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine,101514107,PMC8021264,['NOTNLM'],"['CHN1', 'biomarker', 'diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', 'prognosis']",2021/04/10 06:00,2021/04/10 06:01,['2021/04/09 06:24'],"['2021/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/09 06:24 [entrez]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/PGPM.S301718 [doi]', '301718 [pii]']",epublish,Pharmgenomics Pers Med. 2021 Apr 1;14:397-408. doi: 10.2147/PGPM.S301718. eCollection 2021.,,,,,['(c) 2021 Sun et al.'],,,,,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

HLA-DR and CD117 (c-Kit) are important diagnostic markers of AML. Our objective is to determine the prognostic significance of HLA-DR and CD117 expressions in newly diagnosed AML patients and determine the correlation between HLA-DR and CD117 expressions and other prognostic markers such as cytogenetic abnormalities, FLT3-ITD, response to treatment, and patient's survival. Methods: This study included 100 newly diagnosed AML patients. All patients were subjected to clinical, morphological, cytochemical, cytogenetic analysis, molecular genetic analysis to detect FLT3-ITD, and Flowcytometric detection of HLA-DR, CD117, and CD 34. Results: The results showed that HLA-DR expression was found in 75 patients (77.3%), while CD117 expression was found in 63 patients (64.9%). Patients with HLA-DR expression showed significantly higher mean Hb concentration, significantly higher platelet count, associated with AML-FAB subtypes (M0, M1, and M2), CD34 expression, and favorable cytogenetic group. M3 subtype was significantly associated with HLA-DR-ve. While patients with CD117 expression showed significantly lower platelets count. Double positive patients (HLA-DR+ve/CD117+ve) showed significant association with the intermediate cytogenetic group, while double-negative patients (HLA-DR-ve/CD117-ve) were associated with the favorable and intermediate cytogenetic group and either positive (HLA-DR+ve /CD117-ve or HLA-DR-ve/CD117+ve) associated with poor cytogenetic groups. FLT3-ITD expression had significantly worse overall survival. Conclusion: The current study suggested that the expression of CD117 and HLA-DR may be a prognostic marker in AML, as they are associated with M0, M1, and M2 FAB subtypes; moreover, patients with combined HLA-DR and CD117 positive expression are associated with CD34 expression and intermediate cytogenetic group.","['El-Meligui, Yomna M', 'Abd Elrhman, Heba E', 'Salahuddin, Ahmad', 'Hamouda, Manal Ali', 'Kassem, Amira B']","['El-Meligui YM', 'Abd Elrhman HE', 'Salahuddin A', 'Hamouda MA', 'Kassem AB']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6848-5743', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7382-4284', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4195-6036']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Damanhour University, Damanhour, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pharmacy Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ahram Canadian University, Giza, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacy Practice Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Damanhour University, Damanhour, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210330,New Zealand,Pharmgenomics Pers Med,Pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine,101514107,PMC8019664,['NOTNLM'],"['CD117', 'CD34', 'FLT3-ITD', 'HLA-DR', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cytogenetic', 'response']",2021/04/10 06:00,2021/04/10 06:01,['2021/04/09 06:24'],"['2020/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/09 06:24 [entrez]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/PGPM.S268986 [doi]', '268986 [pii]']",epublish,Pharmgenomics Pers Med. 2021 Mar 30;14:381-393. doi: 10.2147/PGPM.S268986. eCollection 2021.,,,,,['(c) 2021 El-Meligui et al.'],,,,,['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant activation of long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposons is common in human cancers, yet their tumor-type-specific functions are poorly characterized. We identified MPHOSPH8/MPP8, a component of the human silencing hub (HUSH) complex, as an acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-selective dependency by epigenetic regulator-focused CRISPR screening. Although MPP8 is dispensable for steady-state hematopoiesis, MPP8 loss inhibits AML development by reactivating L1s to induce the DNA damage response and cell cycle exit. Activation of endogenous or ectopic L1s mimics the phenotype of MPP8 loss, whereas blocking retrotransposition abrogates MPP8-deficiency-induced phenotypes. Expression of AML oncogenic mutations promotes L1 suppression, and enhanced L1 silencing is associated with poor prognosis in human AML. Hence, while retrotransposons are commonly recognized for their cancer-promoting functions, we describe a tumor-suppressive role for L1 retrotransposons in myeloid leukemia.","['Gu, Zhimin', 'Liu, Yuxuan', 'Zhang, Yuannyu', 'Cao, Hui', 'Lyu, Junhua', 'Wang, Xun', 'Wylie, Annika', 'Newkirk, Simon J', 'Jones, Amanda E', 'Lee, Michael Jr', 'Botten, Giovanni A', 'Deng, Mi', 'Dickerson, Kathryn E', 'Zhang, Cheng Cheng', 'An, Wenfeng', 'Abrams, John M', 'Xu, Jian']","['Gu Z', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Cao H', 'Lyu J', 'Wang X', 'Wylie A', 'Newkirk SJ', 'Jones AE', 'Lee M Jr', 'Botten GA', 'Deng M', 'Dickerson KE', 'Zhang CC', 'An W', 'Abrams JM', 'Xu J']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5172-0305', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8054-8030', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5659-7120', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1988-7337']","[""Children's Medical Center Research Institute, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Harold C.

In acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), aberrant KIT tyrosine kinase often coexists with t(8;21) to drive leukaemogenesis. Here we evaluated the potential therapeutic effect of cabozantinib on a selected AML subtype characterised by t(8;21) coupled with KIT mutation. Cabozantinib exerted substantial cytotoxicity in Kasumi-1 cells with an IC50 of 88.06 +/- 4.32 nM, which was well within clinically achievable plasma levels. The suppression of KIT phosphorylation and its downstream signals, including AKT/mTOR, STAT3, and ERK1/2, was elicited by cabozantinib treatment and associated with subsequent alterations of cell cycle- and apoptosis-related molecules. Cabozantinib also disrupted the synthesis of an AML1-ETO fusion protein in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In a mouse xenograft model, cabozantinib suppressed tumourigenesis at 10 mg/kg and significantly prolonged survival of the mice. Further RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that mTOR-mediated signalling pathways were substantially inactivated by cabozantinib treatment, causing the downregulation of ribosome biogenesis and glycolysis, along with myeloid leukocyte activation. We suggest that cabozantinib may be effective in the treatment of AML with t(8;21) and KIT mutation. Relevant clinical trials are warranted.","['Su, Kuan-Wei', 'Ou, Da-Liang', 'Fu, Yu-Hsuan', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Lin, Liang-In']","['Su KW', 'Ou DL', 'Fu YH', 'Tien HF', 'Hou HA', 'Lin LI']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8368-1141', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5917-2961', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1384-5593', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3561-1093']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Oncology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. hsinanhou@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. lilin@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. lilin@ntu.edu.tw.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210408,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,,,,2021/04/10 06:00,2021/04/10 06:00,['2021/04/09 06:18'],"['2020/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/09 06:18 [entrez]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41417-021-00329-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41417-021-00329-1 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Cancer Gene Ther. 2021 Apr 8. pii: 10.1038/s41417-021-00329-1. doi: 10.1038/s41417-021-00329-1.,,,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunologic surveillance of residual leukemic cells is hypothesized to be one of the critical factors in successful TFR, with self-renewing leukemic stem cells implicated in relapse. Immunological characterization in CML may help to develop novel immunotherapies that specifically target residual leukemic cells upon TKI discontinuation to improve TFR rates. This review focuses on immune dysfunction in newly diagnosed CML patients, and the role that TKIs and other therapies have in restoring immune surveillance. Immune dysfunction and immunosurveillance in CML points towards several emerging areas in the key goals of DMR and TFR, including: (1) Aspects of innate immune system, in particular natural killer cells and the newly emerging target plasmacytoid dendritic cells. (2) The adaptive immune system, with promise shown in regard to leukemia-associated antigen vaccine-induced CD8 cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) responses, increased CTL expansion, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. (3) Immune suppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells and T regulatory cells that are reduced in DMR and TFR. (4) Immunomodulator mesenchymal stromal cells that critically contribute to leukomogenesis through immunosuppressive properties and TKI- resistance. Therapeutic strategies that leverage existing immunological approaches include donor lymphocyte infusions, that continue to be used, often in combination with TKIs, in patients relapsing following allogeneic stem cell transplant. Furthermore, previous standards-of-care, including interferon-alpha, hold promise in attaining TFR in the post-TKI era. A deeper understanding of the immunological landscape in CML is therefore vital for both the development of novel and the repurposing of older therapies to improve TFR outcomes.","['Hsieh, Ya-Ching', 'Kirschner, Kristina', 'Copland, Mhairi']","['Hsieh YC', 'Kirschner K', 'Copland M']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2715-669X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7607-8670', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7655-016X']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G12 0YN, UK. ya-ching.hsieh@glasgow.ac.uk."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G12 0YN, UK. kristina.kirschner@glasgow.ac.uk."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G12 0YN, UK. mhairi.copland@glasgow.ac.uk.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20210408,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC8102187,,,2021/04/10 06:00,2021/06/16 06:00,['2021/04/09 06:16'],"['2020/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/09 06:16 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-021-01238-w [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-021-01238-w [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 May;35(5):1229-1242. doi: 10.1038/s41375-021-01238-w.

Therefore, deciphering the cellular program activated downstream this pathway has become of paramount importance for the development of innovative therapies. Using an original ex vivo model of BCR-induced proliferation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, we generated 108 temporal transcriptional and proteomic profiles from 1 h up to 4 days after BCR activation. This dataset revealed a structured temporal response composed of 13,065 transcripts and 4027 proteins, comprising a leukemic proliferative signature consisting of 430 genes and 374 proteins. Mathematical modeling of this complex cellular response further highlighted a transcriptional network driven by 14 early genes linked to proteins involved in cell proliferation. This group includes expected genes (EGR1/2, NF-kB) and genes involved in NF-kB signaling modulation (TANK, ROHF) and immune evasion (KMO, IL4I1) that have not yet been associated with leukemic cells proliferation. Our study unveils the BCR-activated proliferative genetic program in primary leukemic cells. This approach combining temporal measurements with modeling allows identifying new putative targets for innovative therapy of lymphoid malignancies and also cancers dependent on ligand-receptor interactions.","['Schleiss, Cedric', 'Carapito, Raphael', 'Fornecker, Luc-Matthieu', 'Muller, Leslie', 'Paul, Nicodeme', 'Tahar, Ouria', 'Pichot, Angelique', 'Tavian, Manuela', 'Nicolae, Alina',

Treatment with chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR T) has emerged as a novel therapy to improve malignancies treatment. C-type lectin-like molecule 1 (CLL1) is highly expressed on AML stem cells, blast cells, and monocytes, but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells, indicating the therapeutic potential of anti-CLL1 CAR T in AML treatment. This study aimed to test the safety and efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy in R/R-AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four pediatric patients with R/R-AML were enrolled in the ongoing phase I/II anti-CLL1 CAR T-cell therapy trial. The CAR design was based on an apoptosis-inducing gene, FKBP-caspase 9, to establish a safer CAR (4SCAR) application. Anti-CLL1 CAR was transduced into peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the patients via lentivector 4SCAR, followed by infusion into the recipients after lymphodepletion chemotherapy. Cytokine release syndrome, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, and other adverse events were documented. Treatment response was evaluated by morphology and flow cytometry-based minimal residual disease assays. RESULTS: Three patients with R/R-AML achieved complete remission and minimal residual disease negativity, while the other patient remained alive for 5 months. All these patients experienced low-grade and manageable adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of our single-institution experience, autologous anti-CLL1 CAR T-cell therapy has the potential to be a safe and efficient alternative treatment for children with R/R-AML, and therefore requires further investigation.","['Zhang, Hui', 'Wang, Pengfei', 'Li, Zhuoyan', 'He, Yingyi', 'Gan, Wenting', 'Jiang, Hua']","['Zhang H', 'Wang P', 'Li Z', 'He Y', 'Gan W', 'Jiang H']",,"[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, P.R.

The allosteric IDH1 inhibitor, ivosidenib, suppresses 2-HG production and induces clinical responses in relapsed/refractory IDH1-mutant AML. Herein, we describe a clinical case of AML in which we detected the neomorphic IDH1 p.R132C mutation in consecutive patient samples with a mutational hotspot targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay. The patient had a clinical response to ivosidenib, followed by relapse and disease progression. Subsequent sequencing of the relapsed sample using a newly developed all-exon, hybrid-capture-based NGS panel identified an additional IDH1 p.S280F mutation known to cause renewed 2-HG production and drug resistance. Structural modeling confirmed that serine-to-phenylalanine substitution at this codon sterically hinders ivosidenib from binding to the mutant IDH1 dimer interface and predicted a similar effect on the pan-IDH inhibitor AG-881. Joint full-exon NGS and structural modeling enables monitoring IDH1 inhibitor-treated AML patients for acquired drug resistance and choosing follow-up therapy.","['Oltvai, Zoltan N', 'Harley, Susan E', 'Koes, David', 'Michel, Stephen', 'Warlick, Erica D', 'Nelson, Andrew C', 'Yohe, Sophia', 'Mroz, Pawel']","['Oltvai ZN', 'Harley SE', 'Koes D', 'Michel S', 'Warlick ED', 'Nelson AC', 'Yohe S', 'Mroz P']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4741-0010', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3838-4743']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.', 'Department of Computational and Systems Biology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15260, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15261, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York 14642, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.', 'Department of Computational and Systems Biology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15260, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210408,United States,Cold Spring Harb Mol Case Stud,Cold Spring Harbor molecular case studies,101660017,PMC8040736,['NOTNLM'],['*leukemia'],2021/04/10 06:00,2021/12/01 06:00,['2021/04/09 05:47'],"['2020/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/09 05:47 [entrez]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/01 06:00 [medline]']","['mcs.a006007 [pii]', '10.1101/mcs.a006007 [doi]']",epublish,Cold Spring Harb Mol Case Stud. 2021 Apr 8;7(2). pii: mcs.a006007. doi: 10.1101/mcs.a006007.

This study investigates the clinical significance of genomic heterogeneity of AMKL in children with and without DS and in children with TAM. Genomic evaluation of nine patients with DS-related TAM or AMKL, and six patients with non-DS AMKL, included conventional cytogenetics and a comprehensive next-generation sequencing panel for single-nucleotide variants/indels and copy-number variants in 118 genes and fusions involving 110 genes. Recurrent gene fusions were found in all patients with non-DS, including two individuals with complex genomes and either a NUP98-KDM5A or a KMT2A-MLLT6 fusion, and the remaining harbored a CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion, which arose from both typical and atypical cytogenetic mechanisms. These fusions guided treatment protocols and resulted in a change in diagnosis in two patients. The nine patients with DS had constitutional trisomy 21 and somatic GATA1 mutations, and those with DS-AMKL had two to four additional clinically significant somatic mutations. Comprehensive genomic characterization provides critical information for diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment decisions for patients with AMKL.

Tuberculosis has been reported a serious complication in leukemia patients who undergo chemotherapy. The study was focused to find mutations in hupB gene of M. tuberculosis in 50 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients through semi multi complex PCR. A column based DNA isolation method was adopted for DNA isolation. The gene for histone-like protein (hupB [Rv2986c]) of M tuberculosis was amplified to detect two closely related mycobacterial species. Primers M and S (histone like protein HupB) were utilized to generate amplicons of 318 bp and 291 bp for M. tuberculosis and M. bovis, respectively. Out of fifty ALL patients, 21 (42%) were females and 29 (58%) were males. The prevalence of ALL was found higher in males as compared to females. The prevalence of ALL was higher in patients of age group 5-10 years.

However, CD73 expression and its impact on tumor microenvironment and clinical outcomes in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain unclear. METHODS: This study included two cohorts: 138 patients from our institution (MDA) and 176 patients from TCGA dataset. CD73 expression, CD4(+), CD8(+), CD21(+) and CD45RO + tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays. The results of CD73 expression were correlated with clinicopathologic parameters, survival and TILs. RESULTS: CD73 overexpression correlated with poor differentiation (P = 0.002) and tumor size (P = 0.049). For CD73-low group, median overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were 26.9 +/- 3.8 months and 12.6 +/- 2.6 months, respectively, compared to 16.9 +/- 4.4 months (P = 0.01) and 7.9 +/- 1.2 months (P = 0.01), respectively, in CD73-high group. CD73 was an independent predictor for both RFS (P = 0.02) and OS (P = 0.01) by multivariate variate analysis. Similarly, CD73-high tumors had significantly shorter OS than CD73-low tumors in TCGA dataset (P < 0.0001). CD73-high correlated with decreased CD4(+) TILs in MDA cohort and decreased CD8A and CR2 (CD21) expression in TCGA cohort. CONCLUSIONS: CD73 overexpression is associated with poor differentiation, tumor size, and shorter survival, and is an independent prognostic factor in PDAC patients. CD73 overexpression is associated with decreased CD4(+), CD8(+) and CD21(+) TILs. Our data support that CD73 plays an important role in immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and promote tumor progression in PDAC.","['Zhao, Jun', 'Soto, Luisa M Solis', 'Wang, Hua', 'Katz, Matthew H', 'Prakash, Laura R', 'Kim, Michael', 'Tzeng, Ching-Wei D', 'Lee, Jeffrey E', 'Wolff, Robert A', 'Huang, Yanqing', 'Wistuba, Ignacio I', 'Maitra, Anirban', 'Wang, Huamin']","['Zhao J', 'Soto LMS', 'Wang H', 'Katz MH', 'Prakash LR', 'Kim M', 'Tzeng CD', 'Lee JE', 'Wolff RA', 'Huang Y', 'Wistuba II', 'Maitra A', 'Wang H']",,"['Department of Anatomical Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Evolution of Cancer, Leukemia and Immunity Post Stem Cell Transplant (ECLIPSE), The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Anatomical Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Anatomical Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

In approximately 30% of the cases, driver mutations in the FLT3 gene are identified. FLT3 inhibitors are used in treatment of such patients together with cytotoxic drugs or (in refractory AML) as single agents. Unfortunately, resistance to FLT3 inhibitors limits their efficacy. Resistance is often due to secondary mutations in the gene encoding the molecular target. The gatekeeper mutation F691L confers resistance to specific FLT3 inhibitors such as quizartinib, but pexidartinib is much less resistance to this mutation. Pexidartinib alone is however sensitive to many other resistance mutations. In chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), it has been suggested that rotation between drugs with a different landscape of resistance mutations might postpone the emergence of resistance. METHODS: We studied the effect of quizartinib and pexidartinib in AML cell lines that express FLT3 (MOLM-14 and MV4-11). Using a rotation protocol, we further examined whether the emergence of resistance could be postponed. Computational modelling was used to analyse the onset of resistance and suggest which mutations are most likely to occur in a quantitative fashion. RESULTS: The cells were sensitive to both inhibitors but quickly developed resistance that could be inherited, suggesting a genetic origin. Rotation protocols were not useful to postpone the emergence of resistance, which implies that such protocols, or changing from pexidartinib to quizartinib (or vice-versa) should not be used in patients. The computational modelling led to similar conclusions and suggested that F691L is the most common mutation to occur with quizartinib, and also when both drugs are used in rotation. CONCLUSIONS: AML patients are not likely to benefit from a quizartinib/pexidartinib rotation protocol. A combination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (with different molecular targets) might be more useful in the future. Development of specific FLT3 inhibitors that are less sensitive to resistance mutations might also lead to a better outcome.","['Yang, Jingmei', 'Lindstrom, H Jonathan G', 'Friedman, Ran']","['Yang J', 'Lindstrom HJG', 'Friedman R']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8696-3104'],"['Department of Chemistry and Biomedical Science, Linnaeus University, Kalmar Campus, Kalmar, 391 82, Sweden.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biomedical Science, Linnaeus University, Kalmar Campus, Kalmar, 391 82, Sweden.', 'Faeth Therapeutics Inc., 237 Kearny Street, #9245, San Francisco, CA, 94108, US.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biomedical Science, Linnaeus University, Kalmar Campus, Kalmar, 391 82, Sweden. ran.friedman@lnu.se.']",['eng'],['CAN 2018/362/Cancerfonden'],['Journal Article'],20210408,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,PMC8033742,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukaemia', 'FLT3', 'kinase inhibitors']",2021/04/10 06:00,2021/04/10 06:01,['2021/04/09 05:33'],"['2020/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/09 05:33 [entrez]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-021-01856-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12935-021-01856-5 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2021 Apr 8;21(1):198. doi: 10.1186/s12935-021-01856-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Late effects of these cancers are a concern in reproductive-age patients, including pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth. Our study aimed to evaluate whether diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma prior to pregnancy was associated with preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation). METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using a population-based dataset from California with linked birth certificates to hospital discharge records and an Iowa-based sample that linked birth certificates to Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry data. Preterm birth was defined using birth certificates. We ascertained history of leukemia and lymphoma using discharge diagnosis data in California and SEER registry in Iowa. RESULTS: Prevalence of preterm birth in California and Iowa was 14.6% and 12.0%, respectively, in women with a history of leukemia/lymphoma compared to 7.8% and 8.2%, respectively, in women without a cancer history. After adjusting for maternal age, race, education, smoking, and plurality, Women with history of leukemia/lymphoma were at an increased risk of having a preterm birth in California (odds ratio (OR) 1.89; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.56-2.28) and Iowa (OR 1.61; 95% CI 1.10-2.37) compared to those with no cancer history. CONCLUSION: In both California and Iowa, women with a history of leukemia or lymphoma were at increased risk for preterm birth. This suggests the importance of counseling with a history of leukemia/lymphoma prior to pregnancy and increased monitoring of women during pregnancy.","['Anand, Sonia T', 'Chrischilles, Elizabeth A', 'Baer, Rebecca J', 'Charlton, Mary E', 'Breheny, Patrick J', 'Terry, William W', 'McLemore, Monica R', 'Karasek, Deborah A', 'Jelliffe-Pawlowski, Laura L', 'Ryckman, Kelli K']","['Anand ST', 'Chrischilles EA', 'Baer RJ', 'Charlton ME', 'Breheny PJ', 'Terry WW', 'McLemore MR', 'Karasek DA', 'Jelliffe-Pawlowski LL', 'Ryckman KK']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5494-1821', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6539-4256']","['Department of Epidemiology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'California Preterm Birth Initiative, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA.', 'Department of Family Health Care Nursing, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'California Preterm Birth Initiative, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA086862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20210408,England,J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",101136916,PMC8497644,['NOTNLM'],"['Preterm birth', 'gestational age', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'premature']",2021/04/10 06:00,2021/04/10 06:00,['2021/04/09 05:27'],"['2022/10/08 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/04/09 05:27 [entrez]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/14767058.2021.1907332 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med. 2021 Apr 8:1-9. doi: 10.1080/14767058.2021.1907332.,,,IM,,,,,['NIHMS1715866'],['2022/10/08 00:00'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DIAGNOSES: The immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of GS, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed its origin from APL. INTERVENTIONS: She received surgery, and had an excellent response to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), DA (daunorubicin combined with cytarabine) regimens, and arsenic trioxide (ATO). OUTCOMES: The patient achieved CR in March 2020 after radiotherapy followed by ATO and ATRA. So far, she is still in follow-up. LESSONS: It is rare that recurrent GS at multiple sites is involved in APL patient with bone marrow morphology in CR. It is interesting to observe a long-term excellent response to ATRA, chemotherapy and ATO.

Paraneoplastic hypercalcemia is commonly associated with dismal prognoses, with survival rates of about 3 months. In this paper, we report on a patient with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-small cell lung carcinoma who developed severe hypercalcemia and discuss the diagnosis and treatment of this metabolic complication. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 56-year old male with a 2-year history of Rai stage IV chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with life-threatening hypercalcemia. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed a suspicious lung lesion. A transbronchial biopsy was performed from the upper left lobe. Due to the small size of the specimen, immunohistochemical markers were performed and revealed positive staining for cytokeratin 7 and negative for TTF-1, napsin A and p 40, which were consistent with non-small cell lung carcinoma. DIAGNOSIS: Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy was diagnosed. INTERVENTION: The patient was treated with saline infusion, calcitonin, intravenous pamidronate, followed with denosumab. OUTCOMES: The hypercalcemia was successfully treated and the patient's calcium levels returned to normal. Further evaluation revealed a non-small cell lung carcinoma as a second primary malignancy. The patient was treated with venetoclax for his refractory CLL and received chemotherapy and immunotherapy for lung adenocarcinoma. Several days after starting venetoclax, he developed Legionella pneumonia and short time after the second course of chemotherapy, a severe sepsis occurred and he passed away. LESSONS: Coexistence of 2 unrelated malignancies, whichever could be a reason for hypercalcemia of malignancy is a rare event. Severe hypercalcemia, which is possible but rare feature of CLL should be a reason for further prompt evaluation.","['Shacham, Elena Chertok', 'Marshak, Dafna Chap', 'Brikman, Shay', 'Dori, Guy', 'Ishay, Avraham']","['Shacham EC', 'Marshak DC', 'Brikman S', 'Dori G', 'Ishay A']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9013-1271'],"['Department of Internal Medicine E, HaEmek Medical Center.', 'Endocrinology Unit, HaEmek Medical Center.', 'Hematology Unit, HaEmek Medical Center, Afula.', 'Department of Internal Medicine E, HaEmek Medical Center.', 'Faculty of medicine, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Internal Medicine E, HaEmek Medical Center.', 'Faculty of medicine, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Endocrinology Unit, HaEmek Medical Center.', 'Faculty of medicine, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,PMC8036102,,,2021/04/10 06:00,2021/04/16 06:00,['2021/04/09 01:00'],"['2020/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/09 01:00 [entrez]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000024982 [doi]', '00005792-202104090-00016 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2021 Apr 9;100(14):e24982. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000024982.,20210415,,IM,"['Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*chemically induced/complications/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography']","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

DESIGN: Tumor and the paracancerous tissues were collected from 83 patients with OSCC. OSCC stem cells were extracted from a human OSCC cell line Tca8113. Silencing of HOXA10-AS was introduced in stem cells and then the malignant behaviors of cells were determined. The target transcripts of HOXA10-AS were predicted using integrated bioinformatics analyses. The interactions among HOXA10-AS, microRNA (miR)-29a and MCL-1 were validated, and their functions in stem cell behaviors in vivo and in vitro were explored. RESULTS: HOXA10-AS and MCL-1 were highly expressed while miR-29a was poorly expressed in the collected tumor tissues and the extracted OSCC stem cells. High expression of HOXA10-AS and MCL-1, while poor expression of miR-29a was relevant to poor prognosis in patients. Silencing of HOXA10-AS suppressed proliferation and tumor sphere formation ability of stem cells, and it reduced growth and metastasis of tumors in animals. HOXA10-AS served as a sponge for miR-29a and upregulated MCL-1 mRNA expression. Inhibition of miR-29a promoted, while silencing of MCL-1 suppressed the malignant behaviors of OSCC stem cells. In addition, HOXA-10-AS and MCL-1 were found to activate the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: This study evidenced that HOXA10-AS enhances the stem cell property of OSCC stem cells through the miR-29a/MCL-1/PI3K/AKT axis.","['Wang, Dongying']",['Wang D'],,"['Department of Stomatology, Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia University for Nationalities, No.1742, Huolinhe Street, Tongliao, 028000, Inner Mongolia, PR China.

FLT3 inhibitors have been developed to treat patients with FLT3-ITD AML; however, when used alone, their efficacy is insufficient. FLT3 inhibitors combined with chemotherapy may be a promising treatment for FLT3-ITD AML. Homoharringtonine (HHT) is a classical anti-leukaemia drug with high sensitivity to FLT3-ITD AML cells. Here, we showed that HHT synergizes with a selective next-generation FLT3 inhibitor, quizartinib, to inhibit cell growth/viability and induce cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in FLT3-ITD AML cells in vitro, significantly inhibit acute myeloid leukemia progression in vivo, and substantially prolong survival of mice-bearing human FLT3-ITD AML. Mechanistically, HHT and quizartinib cooperatively inhibit FLT3-AKT and its downstream targets GSK3beta, c-Myc, and cyclin D1, cooperatively up-regulate the pro-apoptosis proteins Bim and Bax, and down-regulate the anti-apoptosis protein Mcl1. Most strikingly, HHT and quizartinib cooperatively reduce the numbers of side-population (SP) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive cells, which reportedly are rich in LSCs. In conclusion, HHT combined with quizartinib may be a promising treatment strategy for patients with FLT3-ITD AML.","['Wang, Fangfang', 'Huang, Jingcao', 'Guo, Tingting', 'Zheng, Yuhuan', 'Zhang, Li', 'Zhang, Dan', 'Wang, Fujue', 'Naren, Duolan', 'Cui, Yushan', 'Liu, Xiaoyan', 'Qu, Ying', 'Luo, Hongmei', 'Yang, Yan', 'Wei, Haichen', 'Guo, Yong']","['Wang F', 'Huang J', 'Guo T', 'Zheng Y', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang D', 'Wang F', 'Naren D', 'Cui Y', 'Liu X', 'Qu Y', 'Luo H', 'Yang Y', 'Wei H', 'Guo Y']",,"['Hematology Research Laboratory, Department of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Hematology Research Laboratory, Department of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Precision Medicine Research Laboratory, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Hematology Research Laboratory, Department of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Hematology Research Laboratory, Department of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Hematology Research Laboratory, Department of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Hematology Research Laboratory, Department of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Hematology Research Laboratory, Department of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Hematology Research Laboratory, Department of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Hematology Research Laboratory, Department of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Hematology Research Laboratory, Department of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Hematology Research Laboratory, Department of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Hematology Research Laboratory, Department of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Hematology Research Laboratory, Department of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.

In this study, we analyzed the mechanistic pathways that modulate the sensitivity of human AML U937 and HL-60 cells to YM155. YM155 induced apoptosis in AML cells, which was characterized by p38 MAPK phosphorylation and downregulation of survivin and MCL1 expression. Phosphorylated p38 MAPK causes autophagy-mediated Sp1 degradation, thereby inhibiting the transcription of survivin and MCL1. The reduction of survivin and MCL1 levels further facilitated Sp1 protein degradation through autophagy. The restoration of Sp1, survivin, or MCL1 expression protected U937 and HL-60 cells from YM155-mediated cytotoxicity. U937 and HL-60 cells were continuously exposed to hydroquinone (HQ) to generate U937/HQ and HL-60/HQ cells, which showed increased SLC35F2 expression. The increase in SLC35F2 expression led to an increase in the sensitivity of U937/HQ cells to YM155-mediated cytotoxicity, whereas no such effect was observed in HL-60/HQ cells. Of note, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in HL-60 and HL-60/HQ cells enhanced YM155 cytotoxicity in these cells, and the enforced expression of MPO also increased the sensitivity of U937 cells to YM155. Taken together, we conclude that p38 MAPK-modulated autophagy inhibits Sp1-mediated survivin and MCL1 expression, which, in turn, leads to the death of U937 and HL-60 cells following YM155 treatment. In addition, our data indicate that SLC35F2 increases the sensitivity of U937 cells to YM155-mediated cytotoxicity, whereas MPO enhances YM155 cytotoxicity in U937 and HL-60 cells.","['Chiou, Jing-Ting', 'Lee, Yuan-Chin', 'Huang, Chia-Hui', 'Wang, Liang-Jun', 'Shi, Yi-Jun', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Chiou JT', 'Lee YC', 'Huang CH', 'Wang LJ', 'Shi YJ', 'Chang LS']",,"['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan; Department of Biotechnology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan.

To identify potential disturbances in gene regulation, we conducted an unbiased screen of allele-specific expression (ASE) in 209 AML cases. The gene encoding GATA binding protein 2 (GATA2) displayed ASE more often than any other myeloid- or cancer-related gene. GATA2 ASE was strongly associated with CEBPA double mutations (DMs), with 95% of cases presenting GATA2 ASE. In CEBPA DM AML with GATA2 mutations, the mutated allele was preferentially expressed. We found that GATA2 ASE was a somatic event lost in complete remission, supporting the notion that it plays a role in CEBPA DM AML. Acquisition of GATA2 ASE involved silencing of 1 allele via promoter methylation and concurrent overactivation of the other allele, thereby preserving expression levels. Notably, promoter methylation was also lost in remission along with GATA2 ASE. In summary, we propose that GATA2 ASE is acquired by epigenetic mechanisms and is a prerequisite for the development of AML with CEBPA DMs. This finding constitutes a novel example of an epigenetic hit cooperating with a genetic hit in the pathogenesis of AML.","['Mulet-Lazaro, Roger', 'van Herk, Stanley', 'Erpelinck, Claudia', 'Bindels, Eric', 'Sanders, Mathijs A', 'Vermeulen, Carlo', 'Renkens, Ivo', 'Valk, Peter', 'Melnick, Ari M', 'de Ridder, Jeroen', 'Rehli, Michael', 'Gebhard, Claudia', 'Delwel, Ruud', 'Wouters, Bas J']","['Mulet-Lazaro R', 'van Herk S', 'Erpelinck C', 'Bindels E', 'Sanders MA', 'Vermeulen C', 'Renkens I', 'Valk P', 'Melnick AM', 'de Ridder J', 'Rehli M', 'Gebhard C', 'Delwel R', 'Wouters BJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0298-7948', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3965-4488', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8575-9213', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8074-2287', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0828-3477', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3992-932X']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center (MC) Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Oncode Institute, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center (MC) Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Oncode Institute, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center (MC) Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Oncode Institute, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center (MC) Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center (MC) Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Oncode Institute, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine, University Medical Center, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Oncode Institute, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine, University Medical Center, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center (MC) Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, Cornell University, New York, NY.', 'Oncode Institute, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine, University Medical Center, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III and.', 'Regensburg Centre for Interventional Immunology (RCI), University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III and.', 'Regensburg Centre for Interventional Immunology (RCI), University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center (MC) Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Oncode Institute, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center (MC) Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Oncode Institute, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA198089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233332/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC8489178,,,2021/04/09 06:00,2021/07/31 06:00,['2021/04/08 17:31'],"['2020/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/07/15 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [medline]', '2021/04/08 17:31 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(21)00842-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020009244 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2021 Jul 15;138(2):160-177. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020009244.,20210730,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Alleles', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,['2022/07/15 00:00'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of study limitations prompted a comparison of safety/efficacy of CPX-351 against regimens containing a purine analogue and high-dose cytarabine (HIDAC). This retrospective study compared complete response rates with/without count recovery (CR/CRi) between HIDAC-based regimens and CPX-351 in 169 patients with newly diagnosed sAML. The CR/CRi rate was 62.7% in the HIDAC-based therapy arm vs. 47.9% in the CPX-351 arm (p = 0.002 [one-sided for non-inferiority]). Median time to absolute neutrophil and platelet count recovery was shorter after HIDAC-based therapy (18 and 23 days, respectively) compared to CPX-351 (36 and 38 days; p < 0.001). Median overall survival was 9.8 months in the HIDAC-based group and 9.14 months in the CPX-351 group. 30-day mortality was greater with CPX-351 (8.5%) compared to HIDAC-based (1.3%; p = 0.039).

The present study addressed the open issues concerning these tumors, by assessing the clinical-pathological features of 28 consecutive ILs, diagnosed over a 10-year period at a tertiary center for surgical pathology. ILs were more frequently documented in elderly males (mean age at surgery 70.8 years; M/F ratio 3.3), with sharp prevalence of gastrointestinal and urinary tract involvement (22/28 [78.6%] cases). Low-grade B-cell lymphomas outnumbered all other entities, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) was the most common subtype (18/28 [64.3%] cases). Compared to other ILs, CLL/SLL occurred at older age and was the sole lymphoid neoplasm affecting the urinary tract. In conclusion, ILs are rare lesions, mostly affecting the gastrointestinal and urinary tract of elderly males. The diagnosis of IL is based on a high degree of suspicion and on careful morphological/phenotypic characterization.","['Pizzi, Marco', 'Sbaraglia, Marta', 'Bellan, Alberto', 'Santoro, Luisa', 'Dal Santo, Luca', 'De Bartolo, Debora', 'Carraro, Elisa', 'Zoletto, Simone', 'Visentin, Andrea', 'Marino, Dario', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Dei Tos, Angelo Paolo']","['Pizzi M', 'Sbaraglia M', 'Bellan A', 'Santoro L', 'Dal Santo L', 'De Bartolo D', 'Carraro E', 'Zoletto S', 'Visentin A', 'Marino D', 'Trentin L', 'Dei Tos AP']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4006-7317'],"['Surgical Pathology and Cytopathology Unit, Department of Medicine-DIMED, University of Padua, Padua, Italy. marco.pizzi.1@unipd.it.', 'Surgical Pathology and Cytopathology Unit, Department of Medicine-DIMED, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Pathology, ULSS6, Camposampiero Hospital, Camposampiero - Padua, Italy.', 'Surgical Pathology and Cytopathology Unit, Department of Medicine-DIMED, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Surgical Pathology and Cytopathology Unit, Department of Medicine-DIMED, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Surgical Pathology and Cytopathology Unit, Department of Medicine-DIMED, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', ""Oncohematology Unit, Department of Children and Women's Health, University of Padua, Padua, Italy."", 'Surgical Pathology and Cytopathology Unit, Department of Medicine-DIMED, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology & Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine-DIMED, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Medical Oncology 1, Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV IRCCS, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology & Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine-DIMED, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Surgical Pathology and Cytopathology Unit, Department of Medicine-DIMED, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210408,Germany,Virchows Arch,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,9423843,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma', 'Collision tumors', 'Incidental lymphoma', 'Lymphoma']",2021/04/09 06:00,2021/04/09 06:00,['2021/04/08 12:44'],"['2021/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/08 12:44 [entrez]', '2021/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00428-021-03096-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00428-021-03096-4 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Virchows Arch. 2021 Apr 8. pii: 10.1007/s00428-021-03096-4. doi: 10.1007/s00428-021-03096-4.,,,IM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major clinical challenge with targeted therapeutics, such as the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199, is the development of acquired resistance. We assessed the in vivo response of luciferase-positive LOUCY cells to ABT-199 monotherapy and observed specific residual disease in the splenic microenvironment. Of note, these results were confirmed by using a primary ETP-ALL patient-derived xenograft. Splenomegaly has previously been associated with poor prognosis in diverse types of leukemia. However, the exact mechanism by which the splenic microenvironment alters responses to specific targeted therapies remains largely unexplored. We show that residual LOUCY cells isolated from the spleen microenvironment displayed reduced BCL-2 dependence, which was accompanied by decreased BCL-2 expression levels. Notably, this phenotype of reduced BCL-2 dependence could be recapitulated by using human splenic fibroblast coculture experiments and was confirmed in an in vitro chronic ABT-199 resistance model of LOUCY. Finally, single-cell RNA-sequencing was used to show that ABT-199 triggers transcriptional changes in T-cell differentiation genes in leukemic cells obtained from the spleen microenvironment. Of note, increased expression of CD1a and sCD3 was also observed in ABT199-resistant LOUCY clones, further reinforcing the idea that a more differentiated leukemic population might display decreased sensitivity toward BCL-2 inhibition. Overall, our data reveal the spleen as a site of residual disease for ABT-199 treatment in ETP-ALL and provide evidence for plasticity in T-cell differentiation as a mechanism of therapy resistance.","['Di Grande, Alessandra', 'Peirs, Sofie', 'Donovan, Paul D', 'Van Trimpont, Maaike', 'Morscio, Julie', 'Lintermans, Beatrice', 'Reunes, Lindy', 'Vandamme, Niels', 'Goossens, Steven', 'Nguyen, Hien Anh', 'Lavie, Arnon', 'Lock, Richard B', 'Prehn, Jochen H M', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter', 'Ni Chonghaile, Triona']","['Di Grande A', 'Peirs S', 'Donovan PD', 'Van Trimpont M', 'Morscio J', 'Lintermans B', 'Reunes L', 'Vandamme N', 'Goossens S', 'Nguyen HA', 'Lavie A', 'Lock RB', 'Prehn JHM', 'Van Vlierberghe P', 'Ni Chonghaile T']",,"['Physiology and Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine and.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Physiology and Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Centre for Systems Medicine, Department of Physiology and Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine and.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine and.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine and.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine and.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Data Mining and Modelling for Biomedicine, VIB Center for Inflammation Research, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine and.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'The Jesse Brown VA Medical Center, Chicago, IL; and.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Centre for Childhood Cancer Research, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'Physiology and Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Centre for Systems Medicine, Department of Physiology and Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine and.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Physiology and Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Centre for Systems Medicine, Department of Physiology and Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,PMC8045507,,,2021/04/09 06:00,2021/06/01 06:00,['2021/04/08 12:39'],"['2021/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/08 12:39 [entrez]', '2021/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(21)00247-0 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2021004177 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2021 Apr 13;5(7):1963-1976. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2021004177.,20210531,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic', 'Humans', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', '*Spleen', 'Sulfonamides', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
