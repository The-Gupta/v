METHODS: A retrospective analysis including clinical information, cell morphology, chromosome, immunophenotype and molecular biology was performed on 41 cases of childhood t(8;21)AML. The control group included 19 cases of AML without t(8;21) translocation detected during the same period. RESULTS: The 41 cases of t(8;21)AML accounted for 68.3% of 60 continuous childhood AML patients. Among them, classical t(8;21) translocation was seen in 29 cases; variant t(8;21) translocation, simple 8q-, near-tetraploidy characterized by the duplication of t(8;21) translocation each came into view in 2 cases; and cryptic t(8;21) translocation was seen in 6 cases. Thirty seven cases (80.4%) belonged to M2 subtype of AML. Most of them had the morphological changes such as the leukemia cells' indent nucleus with a light stain region of perinucleus, basophilic cytoplasm, differentiation with maturation, megaloblastoid changes and nuclear-cytoplasm imbalance; the high expression of CD13 antigen; and the AML1/ETO fusion transcript in 23 cases examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, including 6 cases with normal karyotype. The difference in complete remission rate between t(8;21) positive patients group and t(8;21) negative patients group was not significant in statistics (82.4% vs 75%, P>0.05). However the difference in recurring rate of the leukemia was statistically significant (10.7% vs 41.7%, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: t(8;21)AML is the most frequent type of childhood AML. It is predominantly associated with M2 subtype of AML and has unique morphological, immunological prognostic features .","['He, Jun', 'Xue, Yongquan', 'He, Hailong', 'Li, Jianqin', 'Song, Xiaoxiang', 'Huang, Yiping', 'He, Yaxiang', 'Zhang, Xuelan', 'Chai, Yihuan', 'Zhu, Lingli']","['He J', 'Xue Y', 'He H', 'Li J', 'Song X', 'Huang Y', 'He Y', 'Zhang X', 'Chai Y', 'Zhu L']","['Affiliated Childhood Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, 215003 P.R.

Enzymes implicated in regulating ligand occupancy and trans-activation of the nuclear receptors belong to the AKR1C family (AKR1C1-AKR1C3). Nuclear receptors regulated by AKR1C members include the steroid hormone receptors (androgen, estrogen, and progesterone receptors) and the orphan peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARgamma). In human myeloid leukemia (HL-60) cells, ligand access to PPARgamma is regulated by AKR1C3, which diverts PGD(2) metabolism away from J-series prostanoids (Desmond et al., 2003). Inhibition of AKR1C3 by indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), caused PPARgamma-mediated terminal differentiation of the HL-60 cells. To discriminate between antineoplastic effects of NSAIDs that are mediated by either AKR1C or cyclooxygenase (COX) isozymes, selective inhibitors are required. We report a structural series of N-phenylanthranilic acid derivatives and steroid carboxylates that selectively inhibit recombinant AKR1C isoforms but do not inhibit recombinant COX-1 or COX-2. The inhibition constants, IC(50), K(I) values, and inhibition patterns were determined for the NSAID analogs and steroid carboxylates against AKR1C and COX isozymes. Lead compounds, 4-chloro-N-phenylanthranilic acid and 4-benzoyl-benzoic acid for the N-phenylanthranilic acid analogs and most steroid carboxylates, exhibited IC(50) values that had greater than 500-fold selectivity for AKR1C isozymes compared with COX-1 and COX-2. Crystallographic and molecular modeling studies showed that the carboxylic acid of the inhibitor ligand was tethered by the catalytic Tyr55-OH(2)(+) and explained why A-ring substituted N-phenylanthranilates inhibited only AKR1C enzymes. These compounds can be used to dissect the role of the AKR1C isozymes in neoplastic diseases and may have cancer chemopreventive roles independent of COX inhibition.","['Bauman, David R', 'Rudnick, Stephen I', 'Szewczuk, Lawrence M', 'Jin, Yi', 'Gopishetty, Sridhar', 'Penning, Trevor M']","['Bauman DR', 'Rudnick SI', 'Szewczuk LM', 'Jin Y', 'Gopishetty S', 'Penning TM']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, 130C John Morgan Building, 3620 Hamilton Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6084, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['Alcohol Oxidoreductases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Aldehyde Reductase', 'Aldo-Keto Reductases', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Carboxylic Acids/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flufenamic Acid/chemistry/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Ligands', 'Models, Molecular', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/metabolism', 'Steroids/chemical synthesis/pharmacology']",2004/10/12 09:00,2005/03/29 09:00,['2004/10/12 09:00'],"['2004/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['mol.104.006569 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.104.006569 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2005 Jan;67(1):60-8. doi: 10.1124/mol.104.006569.

Derivatives from this compound class are effective against most of the imatinib mesylate-resistant BCR-ABL mutants isolated from advanced chronic myeloid leukemia patients. Here, we established an efficient proteomics method employing an immobilized pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine ligand as an affinity probe and identified more than 30 human protein kinases affected by this class of compounds. Remarkably, in vitro kinase assays revealed that the serine/threonine kinases Rip-like interacting caspase-like apoptosis-regulatory protein kinase (RICK) and p38alpha were among the most potently inhibited kinase targets. Thus, pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines did not discriminate between tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases. Instead, we found that these inhibitors are quite selective for protein kinases possessing a conserved small amino acid residue such as threonine at a critical site of the ATP binding pocket. We further demonstrated inhibition of both p38 and RICK kinase activities in intact cells upon pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine inhibitor treatment. Moreover, the established functions of these two kinases as signal transducers of inflammatory responses could be correlated with a potent in vivo inhibition of cytokine production by a pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine compound. Thus, our data demonstrate the utility of proteomic methods employing immobilized kinase inhibitors for identifying new targets linked to previously unrecognized therapeutic applications.","['Wissing, Josef', 'Godl, Klaus', 'Brehmer, Dirk', 'Blencke, Stephanie', 'Weber, Martina', 'Habenberger, Peter', 'Stein-Gerlach, Matthias', 'Missio, Andrea', 'Cotten, Matt', 'Muller, Stefan', 'Daub, Henrik']","['Wissing J', 'Godl K', 'Brehmer D', 'Blencke S', 'Weber M', 'Habenberger P', 'Stein-Gerlach M', 'Missio A', 'Cotten M', 'Muller S', 'Daub H']","['Axxima Pharmaceuticals AG, 81377 Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/chemistry', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Ligands', 'Lipopolysaccharides/chemistry', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Models, Chemical', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Polyethylene Glycols/chemistry', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Pyridines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors']",2004/10/12 09:00,2005/06/21 09:00,['2004/10/12 09:00'],"['2004/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1535-9476(20)32941-8 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M400124-MCP200 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2004 Dec;3(12):1181-93. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M400124-MCP200.

The goal of this study was to evaluate glucose metabolism in BCR-ABL-positive cells that are sensitive to imatinib exposure. Two human BCR-ABL-positive cell lines (CML-T1 and K562) and one BCR-ABL-negative cell line (HC-1) were incubated with different imatinib concentrations for 96 hours. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy on cell acid extracts was performed to evaluate [1-13C]glucose metabolism, energy state, and changes in endogenous metabolites after incubation with imatinib. Imatinib induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in CML-T1 (IC50, 0.69 +/- 0.06 micromol/L) and K562 cells (IC50, 0.47 +/- 0.04 micromol/L), but not in HC-1 cells. There were no metabolic changes in imatinib-treated HC-1 cells. In BCR-ABL-positive cells, the relevant therapeutic concentrations of imatinib (0.1-1.0 micromol/L) decreased glucose uptake from the media by suppressing glycolytic cell activity (C3-lactate at 0.25 mmol/L, 65% for K562 and 77% for CML-T1 versus control). Additionally, the activity of the mitochondrial Krebs cycle was increased (C4-glutamate at 0.25 micromol/L, 147% for K562 and 170% for CML-T1). The improvement in mitochondrial glucose metabolism resulted in an increased energy state (nucleoside triphosphate/nucleoside diphosphate at 0.25 micromol/L, 130% for K562 and 125% for CML-T1). Apoptosis was observed at higher concentrations. Unlike standard chemotherapeutics, imatinib, without cytocidal activity, reverses the Warburg effect in BCR-ABL-positive cells by switching from glycolysis to mitochondrial glucose metabolism, resulting in decreased glucose uptake and higher energy state.","['Gottschalk, Sven', 'Anderson, Nora', 'Hainz, Carsten', 'Eckhardt, S Gail', 'Serkova, Natalie J']","['Gottschalk S', 'Anderson N', 'Hainz C', 'Eckhardt SG', 'Serkova NJ']","['Department of Biology/Chemistry, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carbon Isotopes', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Glucose/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Glutamates/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Lactates/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2004/10/12 09:00,2005/03/30 09:00,['2004/10/12 09:00'],"['2004/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['10/19/6661 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0039 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Oct 1;10(19):6661-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0039.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Carbon Isotopes)', '0 (Glutamates)', '0 (Lactates)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because these proteins have a very restricted normal tissue expression, they may be suitable targets for immunotherapy. SLLP1 is an intra-acrosomal, nonbacteriolytic, c lysozyme-like protein recently isolated from human spermatozoa. In this study, we determined whether SLLP1 is a novel cancer-testis antigen in hematologic malignancies EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: SLLP1 expression in hematologic tumor cells and normal tissues was determined using a combination of reverse transcription-PCR, real-time PCR, and Western blot analysis. The presence of antibodies against SLLP1 was determined by ELISA analysis. RESULTS: SLLP1 was aberrantly expressed in the tumor cells from 2 of 9 acute myeloid leukemia, 3 of 11 chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 4 of 14 chronic myeloid leukemia, and 6 of 17 multiple myeloma. In contrast, they were not detected in corresponding specimens from any healthy donors. SLLP1 exhibited a very restricted normal tissue expression, being found only in testis/spermatozoa. SLLP1 was expressed in some tumor cells at a level of >25%. High titer IgG antibodies against SLLP1 were also detected in the sera of some of these patients. CONCLUSIONS: SLLP1 is a novel cancer-testis antigen in hematologic malignancies and is capable of eliciting B-cell immune responses in vivo in cancer-bearing individuals. Our results, therefore, support SLLP1 as a protein target appropriate for additional in vitro study to define its suitability for immunotherapy.","['Wang, Zhiqing', 'Zhang, Yana', 'Mandal, Arabinda', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Herr, John C', 'Lim, Seah H']","['Wang Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Mandal A', 'Zhang J', 'Giles FJ', 'Herr JC', 'Lim SH']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Amarillo, Texas 79106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Isoantigens/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Seminal Plasma Proteins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Spermatozoa/*metabolism']",2004/10/12 09:00,2005/03/30 09:00,['2004/10/12 09:00'],"['2004/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['10/19/6544 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0911 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Oct 1;10(19):6544-50. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0911.,"['D43 HD00654/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA106283/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA88434/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD35523/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U54-HD29099/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (SPACA3 protein, human)', '0 (Seminal Plasma Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus far, mouse models for human cancer have been rarely utilized to study the role of DNA methylation in tumor onset and progression. It would be advantageous to use mouse tumor models to a greater extent to study the role and mechanism of DNA methylation in cancer because mouse models allow manipulation of the genome, study of samples/populations with a homogeneous genetic background, the possibility of modulating gene expression in vivo, the statistical power of using large numbers of tumor samples, access to various tumor stages, and the possibility of preclinical trials. Therefore, it is likely that the mouse will emerge as an increasingly utilized model to study DNA methylation in cancer. To foster the use of mouse models, we developed an arrayed mouse NotI-EcoRV genomic library, with clones from three commonly used mouse strains (129SvIMJ, FVB/NJ, and C57BL/6J). A total of 23,040 clones representing an estimated three- to fourfold coverage of the mouse genome were arrayed in 60 x 384-well plates. We developed restriction landmark genomic scanning (RLGS) mixing gels with 32 plates to enable the cloning of methylated sequences from RLGS profiles run with NotI-EcoRV-HinfI. RLGS was used to study aberrant methylation in two mouse models that overexpressed IL-15 or c-Myc and developed either T/NK-cell leukemia or T-cell lymphomas, respectively. Careful analysis of 198 sequences showed that 188 (94.9%) identified CpG-island sequences, 132 sequences (66.7%) had homology to the 5' regions of known genes or mRNAs, and all 132 NotI-EcoRV clones were located at the same CpG islands with the predicted promoter sequences. We have also developed a modified pGL3-based luciferase vector that now contains the NotI, AscI, and EcoRV restriction sites and allows the rapid cloning of NotI-EcoRV library fragments in both orientations. Luciferase assays using NotI-EcoRV clones confirmed that the library is enriched for promoter sequences. Thus, this library will support future genetic and epigenetic studies in mouse models.","['Yu, Li', 'Liu, Chunhui', 'Bennett, Kristi', 'Wu, Yue-Zhong', 'Dai, Zunyan', 'Vandeusen, Jeff', 'Opavsky, Rene', 'Raval, Aparna', 'Trikha, Prashant', 'Rodriguez, Ben', 'Becknell, Brian', 'Mao, Charlene', 'Lee, Stephen', 'Davuluri, Ramana V', 'Leone, Gustavo', 'Van den Veyver, Ignatia B', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Plass, Christoph']","['Yu L', 'Liu C', 'Bennett K', 'Wu YZ', 'Dai Z', 'Vandeusen J', 'Opavsky R', 'Raval A', 'Trikha P', 'Rodriguez B', 'Becknell B', 'Mao C', 'Lee S', 'Davuluri RV', 'Leone G', 'Van den Veyver IB', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Plass C']","['Division of Human Cancer Genetics, Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,IM,"['Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'CpG Islands/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', '*Gene Library', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/metabolism', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Animal', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping']",2004/10/12 09:00,2005/03/16 09:00,['2004/10/12 09:00'],"['2004/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0888-7543(04)00171-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ygeno.2004.06.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Genomics. 2004 Oct;84(4):647-60. doi: 10.1016/j.ygeno.2004.06.010.,"['CA68418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93548/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0 (Interleukin-15)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.1.21.4 (Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific)', 'EC 3.1.21.4 (GATATC-specific type II deoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.21.4 (GCGGCCGC-specific type II deoxyribonucleases)']",['Copyright 2004 Elsevier Inc.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis demonstrated classical t(9;22)(q34;q11) chromosomic translocation associated with a duplication of the BCR-ABL fusion gene. Other cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in all analyzed mitosis, the most frequent being a trisomy of chromosome 8.

In addition, ERY-1 cell line expressed beta-globin mRNA and a non-phosphorylable form of the erythropoietin receptor, even in presence of erythropoietin. Of note, the proliferation of ERY-1 cells was inhibited by TGFbeta1 or STI-571 (Gleevec), without significant induction of further differentiation.

In this work we have studied the ability of hyperthermia to induce differentiation in the K562 cell line. K562 cells were treated with hyperthermia in the range of 41-45 degrees C. Cell proliferation and the plating efficiency of heat treated cells along with their hemoglobin synthesis was measured and compared with controls. Hyperthermia severely inhibited the growth of K562 cells in the suspension culture in a time- and temperature-dependent manner. Sixty minutes of heating and 44 and 40 min of heating at 45 degrees C totally inhibited the growth of the cells. The number of clonogenic cells also decreased as a result of heat treatment. Extended periods of heating for more than 2 h at 41 degrees C resulted in thermal adaptation. Hyperthermia-induced hemoglobin synthesis by these cells, only at 42 and 43 degrees C. Maximum induction was observed after heat treatment for 80 min at 43 degrees C and 180 min at 42 degrees C. At lower temperature, although the fraction of surviving cells was high, but no signs of hemoglobin synthesis could be observed. At temperatures higher than 43 degrees C, the fraction of surviving cells decreased rapidly and also no signs of hemoglobin synthesis could be detected. At the two selective temperatures, hemoglobin synthesis started 4 days after heat treatment. The results showed that hyperthermia caused cytotoxicity and growth arrest and induced differentiation as judged by hemoglobin synthesis and reduced clonogenicity in this cell line. This is the first time that a physical agent has been shown to induce differentiation in erythroleukemic cell lines.","['Goliaei, Bahram', 'Rafiei, Mina', 'Soheili, Zahra']","['Goliaei B', 'Rafiei M', 'Soheili Z']","['Laboratory of Biophysics and Molecular Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, P.O.

Loss of p15INK4B expression due to promoter methylation occurs frequently in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) but the expression and methylation status of p27KIP1 remains to be characterized in T-ALL or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL). As well, while some have reported a high frequency of p21CIP1 methylation in ALL patient samples others have found the gene to be unmethylated in this disease and the relationship between p21CIP1 expression and promoter methylation has not been examined in T-LBL. Using RNase protection assays (RPA) and methylation specific PCR (MSP), we found p27KIP1 to be expressed and its promoter unmethylated in 20 of 20 (100%) and 28 of 28 (100%) T-LBL/ALL samples, respectively. In contrast, p21CIP1 mRNA was absent in 7 of 14 (50%) T-LBL biopsies and 5 of 6 (83%) T-ALL cell lines. However, like p27KIP1 there was no evidence of p21CIP1 promoter methylation by MSP or temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis (TTGE) analysis of 35 CpG sites in any of the 28 T-LBL/ALLs analyzed. Similar to T-ALL, we found p15INK4B mRNA was absent in 13 of 14 (93%) T-LBL biopsies and its promoter methylated in 6 of 10 (64%) cases. Our results indicate that p21CIP1 mRNA is absent in human T-LBL biopsies and T-ALL cell lines at a high frequency. However, unlike p15INK4B, reduced p21CIP1 expression in T-LBL/ALL is independent of dense promoter-associated CpG methylation.

Since this only occurs in a minority of patients, however, it is possible some individuals are predisposed due to genetic polymorphisms in genes for enzymes that mediate drug metabolism. To address this possibility we measured the genotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents in patients receiving treatment for ALL by the frequency of the Vgamma/Jbeta trans-rearrangement in their peripheral blood leukocytes and compared this with CYP3A4 genotype. CYP3A4 is the most abundant of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme in the liver and intestine which contains a common -392A>G substitution in the promoter region (CYP3A4*1B allele). We found a significant increase in the frequency of rearrangements during chemotherapy only in patients homozygous for the wild type CYP3A4*1A allele.

It has been approved for the treatment of patients with resistant chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Measuring plasma/serum levels of alemtuzumab is important for optimizing the dosing and scheduling of therapy; however, current assays in serum or plasma, based on the capture of alemtuzumab using CD52, are complicated and difficult to adapt for high throughput testing. We developed a simple sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure alemtuzumab that takes advantage of the remaining rat sequence in alemtuzumab. Using specific anti-rat immunoglobulin (Ig) antibodies (absorbed against human Ig), alemtuzumab levels were measured in the serum and plasma of patients treated with alemtuzumab. Levels were similar between plasma and serum samples, in fresh samples and samples stored at 4 degrees C for 24 h, but were significantly lower in samples stored at room temperature for 24h. The assay was successfully used to determine serum alemtuzumab pre- and post-treatment. This assay is simple and adaptable for high throughput testing, with a limit of detection of 0.05 microg/ml and a coefficient of variation of +/-12.5%. No false positivity was observed in >200 samples tested. This validated assay should help optimize the dosing and scheduling of alemtuzumab therapy. The underlying principles are also applicable to the measurement of other humanized antibodies using an appropriate anti-Ig.","['Jilani, Iman', 'Keating, Michael', 'Giles, Francis J', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Albitar, Maher']","['Jilani I', 'Keating M', 'Giles FJ', ""O'Brien S"", 'Kantarjian HM', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Hematopathology, Nichols Institute, Quest Diagnostics, 33608 Ortega Highway, Rm# 108B, San Juan Capistrano, CA 92690-6130, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*blood', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*blood', 'Blood Preservation', 'Cryopreservation', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods/standards', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/*standards', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Reference Standards']",2004/10/12 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/12 09:00'],"['2003/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212604001274 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2004.04.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2004 Dec;28(12):1255-62. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2004.04.003.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The oldest cell line is K-562 which is one of the most prolific in use. Most cell lines have been established from acute myeloid leukemia M6 or chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis and generally express immunoprofiles typically seen in immature erythroid cells. Several cell lines are constitutively growth factor-dependent, responding proliferatively to a variety of cytokines. The predominant cytogenetic abnormalities are the t(9;22)(q34;q11) found exclusively in CML-derived cell lines, and rearrangements of chromosomes 5 and 7 which occur in all disease subtypes. Ph+ve cell lines consistently displayed structural and numerical changes associated with disease evolution, including +8, -17/17p-/i(17q), and +19. It is striking that many cell lines though committed to either the erythroid or megakaryocytic lineage tend to co-express features of the other lineage, consistent with the concept of a common erythroid-megakaryocytic progenitor. Several cell lines may be induced to differentiate along the erythroid, megakaryocytic or monocytic pathway by treatment with pharmacological or physiological reagents. Notable functional features include expression of various globin chains or the complete hemoglobins as erythroid attributes. Taken together, this class of cell lines is relatively well characterized and affords useful model systems for immature erythroid cells.","['Drexler, Hans G', 'Matsuo, Yoshinobu', 'MacLeod, Roderick A F']","['Drexler HG', 'Matsuo Y', 'MacLeod RA']",,['eng'],"['Editorial', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Cytokines', 'Erythroid Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/pathology']",2004/10/12 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/12 09:00'],"['2004/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212604001869 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2004.03.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2004 Dec;28(12):1243-51. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2004.03.022.,,,['0 (Cytokines)'],,67,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells expressing membrane differentiation markers CD11b and CD14 were increased from 4% in non-treated control to 8-16% after being treated with 10-30 microM MG or HK. When added to 1 nM VD3, MG or HK increased markers expressing cells from approximately 30% to 50-80%. When either MG or HK was added to 20 nM ATRA, only CD11b, but not CD14, expressing cells were increased from 9% to 24-70%. Under the same conditions, adding MG or HK to VD3 or ATRA treatment further enlarged the G0/G1 cell population and increased the expression of p27(Kip1), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. Pharmacological studies using PD098059 (a MEK inhibitor), SB203580 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor) and SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) suggested that the MEK pathway was important for VD3 and ATRA-induced differentiation and also its enhancement by MG or HK, the p38 MAPK pathway had a inhibitory effect and the JNK pathway had little influence.

Deletions of 9q34 were observed in 14% of all the cases and were present in 46% of cases with single BCR/ABL fusion pattern. All the 9q34 deletions occurred in cases with single BCR/ABL fusion signal. However, a single-fusion pattern is not specific for 9q34 deletions, and cases should be routinely screened for the presence of this prognostically significant abnormality by using a third probe directed specifically at 9q34.","['Aoun, Patricia', 'Wiggins, Michele', 'Pickering, Diane', 'Foran, James', 'Rasheed, Husain', 'Pavletic, Steve Z', 'Sanger, Warren']","['Aoun P', 'Wiggins M', 'Pickering D', 'Foran J', 'Rasheed H', 'Pavletic SZ', 'Sanger W']","['Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha 68198, USA. paoun@unmc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA Probes', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Interphase', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Philadelphia Chromosome']",2004/10/12 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/12 09:00'],"['2004/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2004/02/06 00:00 [revised]', '2004/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(04)00090-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2004.02.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2004 Oct 15;154(2):138-43. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2004.02.012.,,,"['0 (DNA Probes)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENT(S): Six fertile volunteers studied over two menstrual cycles. INTERVENTION(S): Cervicovaginal lavages (CVLs) and peripheral blood specimens were obtained during the menstrual, proliferative, periovulatory, and midsecretory phases of the cycle. Endometrial biopsies were obtained during the midsecretory phase. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Concentrations of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), TGF-beta2, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in CVL and peripheral blood of fertile women; endometrial cytokine messenger (m)RNA levels in midsecretory phase; and serum E(2) and P levels throughout the menstrual cycle. RESULT(S): Macrophage-colony stimulating factor and EGF were detectable in all CVL samples. Macrophage-colony stimulating factor concentrations were positively correlated with serum E2 levels and the E2/P ratio. Whereas EGF concentrations in serum and CVL samples remained constant throughout the menstrual cycle, individual concentrations during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle were positively correlated with endometrial EGF mRNA levels. Interleukin-1beta, TGF-beta1, and TGF-beta2 were detected in most CVL samples. Interleukin-1beta concentrations in CVL were significantly higher at menses than at the periovulatory stage of the menstrual cycle; TGF-beta2 levels were higher at menses than at the periovulatory and secretory stages. Leukemia inhibitory factor was undetectable in CVL except at menses. In serum, TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, M-CSF, and EGF were detectable, but there was no menstrual cycle effect. There were no correlations between cytokine levels in CVL and serum. CONCLUSION(S): This study demonstrates that several endometrial cytokines that have been implicated in uterine receptivity are detectable in cervicovaginal secretions and peripheral blood of reproductive-aged women, and it provides normal concentration ranges of these cytokines in CVL and serum of fertile women at four stages of the menstrual cycle. Macrophage-colony stimulating factor and EGF warrant further study in CVLs of fertile and infertile women to determine their predictive value as minimally invasive markers of uterine receptivity.","['Gargiulo, Antonio R', 'Fichorova, Raina N', 'Politch, Joseph A', 'Hill, Joseph A', 'Anderson, Deborah J']","['Gargiulo AR', 'Fichorova RN', 'Politch JA', 'Hill JA', 'Anderson DJ']","[""Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Biology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. agargiulo@partners.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Fertil Steril,Fertility and sterility,0372772,IM,"['Adult', 'Cervix Uteri/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Endometrium/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fertility', 'Hormones/blood', 'Humans', 'Menstrual Cycle/*physiology', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Ovulation/*metabolism', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reference Values', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Therapeutic Irrigation', 'Uterus/*metabolism']",2004/10/12 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/12 09:00'],"['2003/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/02 00:00 [revised]', '2004/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0015-0282(04)01250-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fertnstert.2004.03.039 [doi]']",ppublish,Fertil Steril. 2004 Oct;82 Suppl 3:1226-34. doi: 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2004.03.039.,['R01-HD33205/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hormones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Flow cytometry was used to distinguish K562 cells of early apoptosis stage from those of late apoptosis stage through Annexin V and PI staining. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) was used to separate and compare the HT-induced apoptotic K562 cells and control K562 cells. RESULTS: When K562 cells were treated with 10 microg/ml HT for 5,a nd 24 hours,percentages of early apoptotic cells (Annexin V+/PI-) were 28.3%, and 18.1%(P< 0.01), while percentages of late apoptotic cells (Annexin V+/PI+) were 9.1%,and 20.2% (P< 0.01), respectively. Statistical analysis showed (1300+/-50) protein spots were resolved with a match rate of (88.3+/-2.0)% in control K562 cells. Ten protein spots in late apoptotic cells displayed changes in expression after induction of HT for 24 hours (P< 0.01), of which 8 showed higher expression, 1 decreased,and 1 only expressed in control k562 cells.

This study was designed to investigate the molecular mechanism of apoptosis and G(2)/M arrest in leukemia cell line HL-60 induced by proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO). METHODS: Apoptosis in HL-60 cells was observed under fluorescent microscope, flow cytometry and immunoblot were used to analyze cell apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and the mechanisms. RESULTS: MG132 (2 micromol/L)induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells after 24-h treatment. Meanwhile, HL-60 cells were arrested at G(2)/M phase before apoptosis after induced by MG132. The percentage of G(2)/M phase in MG132-treated HL-60 cells at 12 h was 63.42+/-2.02,while that in untreated cells was 7.29+/-3.01 (P< 0.01). The percentage of apoptosis in MG132-treated HL-60 cells at 24 h was 16.67+/-1.48, while untreated cells had no death (P< 0.01). Compared to the treatment with MG132 only, caffeine (2 mmol/L) exposure can reduce G(2)/M arrest and apoptosis in MG132-treated HL-60 cells. Expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21waf/cip1 up-regulated after treated with MG132 for 3 h, but no p53 or p27 detected. CONCLUSIONS: Proteasome inhibitor MG132 can induce G2/M arrest before the apoptosis appeared in HL-60 cells. The obvious up-regulation of p21 indicated that it is p21(waf/cip1), but not p53 or p53-related proteins,that involved in the regulation of G(2)/M arrest and subsequent apoptosis induced by MG132 in HL-60 cells.","['Sun, Guo-Jing', 'Qian, Jun-Jie', 'Meng, Xiang-Bing', 'Song, Yi', 'Zhang, Feng', 'Mei, Zhu-Zhong', 'Dong, Yan', 'Sun, Zhi-Xian']","['Sun GJ', 'Qian JJ', 'Meng XB', 'Song Y', 'Zhang F', 'Mei ZZ', 'Dong Y', 'Sun ZX']","['Institute of Radiation Medicine, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100850, P.R.China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Leupeptins/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2004/10/12 09:00,2005/08/16 09:00,['2004/10/12 09:00'],"['2004/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['1000467X2004101144 [pii]'],ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2004 Oct;23(10):1144-8.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Leupeptins)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are few data on adults with CH. The timing of adiposity rebound (AR) in childhood has been shown to have strong correlations with adult obesity. Our aims were to study the timing of AR and factors affecting AR in children with CH. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The timing of AR was examined in a retrospective study of children with CH with growth data at least up to 5 years of age. The proportion of children with CH who reached AR by 37 months and by 49 months of age were compared with healthy children and children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) described in the literature. Correlation of timing of AR with body mass index (BMI) standard deviation score (SDS) at 10 years, initial severity of hypothyroidism and age at normalization of TSH were examined. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify independent factors associated with BMI > or = 20 (overweight) at 10 years of age. RESULTS: The study included 53 children (34 females and 19 males). AR had occurred by 37 months in 37.7% children with CH, in 42.7% children treated for ALL (CH vs. ALL, P = 0.58) and in 4.5% healthy British children (CH vs. normal, P < 0.0001). We found that 54.7% children with CH had reached AR compared with 21.4% of normal children (CH vs. normal, P < 0.0001) by the age of 49 months. Timing of AR showed significant negative correlation with BMI SDS at 10 years (r = -0.487, P = 0.01). There were no significant relationships between timing of AR and initial thyroid function or age at normalization of TSH. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified age at AR as an independent factor associated with BMI > or = 20 at 10 years of age (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Children with CH showed significantly earlier AR compared to normal British children. This showed significant negative correlation with BMI SDS at 10 years. AR in CH does not appear to be directly related to the initial severity of hypothyroidism or to treatment factors.","['Wong, S C', 'Ng, S M', 'Didi, M']","['Wong SC', 'Ng SM', 'Didi M']","[""Department of Endocrinology, Royal Liverpool Alder Hey Children's Hospital, UK. jarodwong@hotmail.com""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,IM,"['Age of Onset', 'Body Mass Index', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Congenital Hypothyroidism/*complications/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Obesity/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Thyroxine/therapeutic use']",2004/10/12 09:00,2005/03/02 09:00,['2004/10/12 09:00'],"['2004/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['CEN2116 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2265.2004.02116.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2004 Oct;61(4):441-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2265.2004.02116.x.,,,['Q51BO43MG4 (Thyroxine)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, it was observed that 2-substituted compound 36, which has methyl group at R1 position, exhibited a better antitumor activity than 6-substituted compounds against L1210 and SNU-1 in vitro. The ED50 value of 2-substituted compound 36 against L1210 was found to be comparable to the ED50 value of adriamycin and was even better against the solid cancer cell line SNU-1.

The protein level decreases between the double negative and double positive stages, and then increases when thymocytes become single positive. We addressed the role played by PBR in T-cell maturation. To this aim, we used Jurkat cells, which are immature T lymphocytes derived from an acute lymphoblastic leukemia. These cells are PBR negative and were stably transfected to achieve PBR levels similar to that in mature T cells. Using the DNA chip technology, we analyzed the PBR expression-dependent gene changes and evidenced that PBR-expressing cells exhibited more mature features than mock-transfected ones. A majority of the modulated genes encode proteins playing direct or indirect roles during the lymphocyte maturation process. In particular, PBR expression induced several differentiation markers (such as CD1, CD6), or key regulating elements (e.g., RAG1, RAG2, CD99, TCR). By contrast, some regulators of TCR signaling were reduced. PBR expression also affected the expression of critical apoptosis regulators: the proapoptotic lipocortin I, galectin-1, and galectin-9 were reduced while the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 was induced. Altogether our results supported the hypothesis that PBR controls T-cell maturation and suggested mechanisms through which PBR may regulate thymocyte-positive selection.","['Rochard, Pierrick', 'Galiegue, Sylvaine', 'Tinel, Norbert', 'Peleraux, Annick', 'Bord, Annie', 'Jbilo, Omar', 'Casellas, Pierre']","['Rochard P', 'Galiegue S', 'Tinel N', 'Peleraux A', 'Bord A', 'Jbilo O', 'Casellas P']","['Immunology-Oncology Department, Sanofi-Synthelabo Recherche, 371 rue du Professeur Joseph Blayac, 34184 Montpellier cedex 04, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Gene Expr,Gene expression,9200651,IM,"['Apoptosis', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Models, Biological', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Receptors, GABA-A/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/*cytology']",2004/10/12 09:00,2005/02/11 09:00,['2004/10/12 09:00'],"['2004/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/000000004783992170 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Expr. 2004;12(1):13-27. doi: 10.3727/000000004783992170.,,,"['0 (Receptors, GABA-A)']",,,PMC6009102,,,,,,,,,,,

We train and analyze Bayesian networks with the goal of inferring biological aspects of gene function. Our two-component approach focuses on supporting the drug discovery process by identifying genes with central roles for the network operation, which could act as drug targets. The first component, referred to as scale-free analysis, uses topological measures of the network-related to a high-traffic load of genes-as estimators for their functional importance. The second component, referred to as generative inverse modeling, is a method of estimating the effect of a simulated drug treatment or mutation on the global state of the network, as measured in the expression profile. We show for a dataset from acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients that both approaches are suitable for finding genes with central cellular functions. In addition, generative inverse modeling correctly identifies a known oncogene in a purely data-driven way.","['Dejori, Mathaeus', 'Schuermann, Bernd', 'Stetter, Martin']","['Dejori M', 'Schuermann B', 'Stetter M']","['Corporate Technology, Information and Communications, Siemens AG, Munich D-81730, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,IEEE Trans Nanobioscience,IEEE transactions on nanobioscience,101152869,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Computer Simulation', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Drug Design', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological', 'Models, Statistical', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Proteome/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",2004/10/12 09:00,2005/02/16 09:00,['2004/10/12 09:00'],"['2004/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1109/tnb.2004.833690 [doi]'],ppublish,IEEE Trans Nanobioscience. 2004 Sep;3(3):180-91. doi: 10.1109/tnb.2004.833690.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proteome)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied HIN-1 methylation status in many types of adult and pediatric malignancies and cell lines. We examined the expression of HIN-1 mRNA in 52 cell lines and the promoter methylation status in the cell lines and in over 800 primary tumors representing 17 tumor types using methylation specific PCR. Promoter methylation was observed in 73% of breast cancer, 67% of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 30% of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and 57% of malignant mesothelioma (MM) cell lines, and methylation was completely correlated with loss of expression. Expression negative cell lines restored HIN-1 expression after treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Promoter methylation of HIN-1 was found in 90% of retinoblastomas, 73% of Wilms' tumors, 61% of rhabdomyosarcomas, 57% of breast cancers, 52% of prostate cancers, 40% of MMs, 28% of NSCLCs and 27% of lymphomas. Methylation frequencies in colorectal cancers, cervical cancers, bronchial carcinoids, SCLCs, neuroblastomas, osteosarcomas, leukemia, medulloblastomas and bladder cancers were lower (4-21%), while hepatoblastomas lacked methylation. HIN-1 methylation was rarely detected in nonmalignant tissues (8 of 165, 5%).

There is scanty data from Middle East. AIM: To determine the efficacy of ATRA and multi-agent combination chemotherapy in treatment of APL in a single Centre in Kuwait. SET-UPS AND DESIGN: Tertiary cancer centre, retrospective study. METHODS AND MATERIAL: All newly diagnosed APL patients were treated with oral ATRA 45 mg/m2 daily until complete remission (CR), intravenous daunorubicin 50 mg/m2 on days 1,3 and 5, cytosine arabinoside 100 mg/m2 12 hrly on days 1 through 10 and etoposide 100 mg/m2 on days 1 through 5. Post remission three courses of intensive consolidation chemotherapy were administered. Since October 1999, maintenance chemotherapy consisting of oral 6 mercaptopurine 9 mg/m2 daily, methotrexate 15 mg/m2 weekly and ATRA 45 mg/m2 for 2 weeks every three months was added. Complete remission rates and duration, relapse rate and toxicity were studied. RESULTS: 22 of 24 evaluable patients (91.6%) achieved CR. The median duration of remission was 13 months (range 2-55 months). Three patients (12.5%) relapsed. Two patients (8.3%) developed retinoic acid syndrome and responded to dexamethasone. Five patients (20.8%) died one each of refractory disease, during remission induction and of relapse. Two patients died while in remission. CONCLUSION: ATRA and combination chemotherapy results in high complete remission rates and low relapse rate in newly diagnosed APL. Maintenance therapy may be useful in preventing relapses.","['Al Bahar, S', 'Pandita, R', 'Bavishi, K', 'Kreze, O']","['Al Bahar S', 'Pandita R', 'Bavishi K', 'Kreze O']","['Department of Hematology, Kuwait Cancer Control Centre, Shuwaikh, Kuwait. soleman97@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",2004/10/09 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/09 09:00'],"['2004/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2004 Jul-Sep;41(3):125-8.,,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Primers and probes specific for the conserved regions of the eubacterial 23S rRNA gene or the groEL gene (encoding the 60-kDa heat shock protein Hsp60) were designed. During the development of the 23S rRNA RT-PCR, problems caused by the contamination of reagents with bacterial DNA were noted. Treatment with 8-methoxypsoralen and UV irradiation reduced the level of contaminating DNA. The sensitivity of the assays was greatly influenced by the enzyme system which was used.

With a two-enzyme system consisting of Moloney murine leukemia virus RT and Taq DNA polymerase, we detected 16 CFU/ml. With groEL mRNA as the target of RT-PCR under optimized conditions, we detected 125 CFU of E. coli/ml, and no problems with false-positive results caused by reagent contamination or a cross-reaction with human nucleic acids were found.

Hypothalamic-pituitary hormone insufficiency is a well-recognized consequence of CRT for childhood cancer. Another problem is increased cardiovascular risk, which has been shown in long-term survivors of other childhood cancers. In the only previously reported study on cardiovascular risk after childhood ALL, obesity and dyslipidemia were recorded in a small subgroup treated with CRT, compared with patients treated with chemotherapy. The mechanisms behind the increase in cardiovascular risk in survivors of childhood cancer are not clarified. The aim of the present study was to elucidate mechanisms of increased cardiovascular risk in former childhood ALL patients. A group of 44 ALL survivors (23 males, median age 25 yr, range 19-32 yr at the time of study) treated with CRT (median 24 Gy, 18-30 Gy) at a median age of 5 yr (1-18 yr) and chemotherapy were investigated for prevalence of GH deficiency and cardiovascular risk factors. Comparison was made with controls randomly selected from the general population and individually matched for sex, age, smoking habits, and residence. All patients and controls underwent a GHRH-arginine test, and patients with a peak GH 3.9 microg/liter or greater were further investigated with an additional insulin tolerance test. Significantly higher plasma levels of insulin (P = 0.002), blood glucose (P = 0.01), and serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein (Apo) B, triglycerides, fibrinogen, and leptin (all P <or= 0.05) were recorded among the ALL patients, compared with controls. Furthermore, the serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.03) and Apo A1 (P = 0.005) were significantly lower among the patients. Compared with controls, the patients had higher body mass index and waist to hip ratio, and body composition measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry showed significantly higher fat mass and lower lean mass (P < 0.001). Forty of 44 ALL patients (91%) were considered GH deficient according to the insulin tolerance test and/or the GHRH-arginine test, and the rest were considered GH insufficient. In patients, peak GH during GHRH-arginine was significantly negatively correlated to total body fat mass measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (r = -0.48, P = 0.001), waist to hip ratio (r = -0.32, P = 0.03), plasma insulin (r = -0.49, P = 0.001), and leptin (r = -0.46, P = 0.002). Moreover, a significantly positive correlation was recorded with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.38, P = 0.012). Using Doppler echocardiography, a marked reduction in cardiac dimensions and performance (ejection fraction P < 0.001 and fractional shortening P = 0.01), compared with controls, was recorded. In conclusion, at a median 17 yr after treatment with CRT and chemotherapy in former childhood ALL patients, a significant increase in cardiovascular risk factors was recorded. We suggest that GH deficiency, induced by CRT, is a primary cause for this because strong correlations between the stimulated GH peak and several of the cardiovascular risk factors were observed.","['Link, Katarina', 'Moell, Christian', 'Garwicz, Stanislaw', 'Cavallin-Stahl, Eva', 'Bjork, Jonas', 'Thilen, Ulf', 'Ahren, Bo', 'Erfurth, Eva Marie']","['Link K', 'Moell C', 'Garwicz S', 'Cavallin-Stahl E', 'Bjork J', 'Thilen U', 'Ahren B', 'Erfurth EM']","['Department of Endocrinology, Lund University Hospital, SE-221 85 Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Apolipoproteins B/blood', 'Arginine', 'Blood Glucose', 'Body Height', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/blood/diagnostic imaging/*epidemiology', 'Carotid Arteries/diagnostic imaging', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cholesterol, LDL/blood', 'Echocardiography, Doppler', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen/metabolism', 'Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone', 'Human Growth Hormone/blood/*deficiency', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Insulin/blood', 'Leptin/blood', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*radiotherapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Risk Factors', 'Triglycerides/blood']",2004/10/09 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/09 09:00'],"['2004/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['89/10/5003 [pii]', '10.1210/jc.2004-0126 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2004 Oct;89(10):5003-12. doi: 10.1210/jc.2004-0126.,,,"['0 (Apolipoproteins B)', '0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Cholesterol, LDL)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', '9034-39-3 (Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To characterize and identify novel markers of ATL, we examined the expression profiles of more than 12 000 genes in 8 cases of acute-type ATL using microarray. One hundred ninety-two genes containing interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor alpha were up-regulated more than 2-fold compared with CD4(+) and CD4(+)CD45RO(+) T cells, and tumor suppressor in lung cancer 1 (TSLC1), caveolin 1, and prostaglandin D2 synthase showed increased expression of more than 30-fold. TSLC1 is a cell adhesion molecule originally identified as a tumor suppressor in the lung but lacks its expression in normal or activated T cells. We confirmed ectopic expression of the TSLC1 in all acute-type ATL cells and in 7 of 10 ATL- or HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. Introduction of TSLC1 into a human ATL cell line ED enhanced both self-aggregation and adhesion ability to vascular endothelial cells.

The number of T cells during 4 weeks of in vitro culture increased 2- to 3.5-fold and the number of T cells recognizing FMOD peptides bound to HLA-A2 dimers increased 10-fold.

We examined whether the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/p70 S6 kinase pathway is activated by RA. RA treatment of sensitive cell lines resulted in phosphorylation/activation of mTOR and downstream induction of p70 S6 kinase activity. Such phosphorylation/activation of p70 S6 kinase was inducible in primary acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) blasts and RA-sensitive NB-4 cells, but was defective in an NB-4 variant cell line (NB-4.007/6) that is resistant to the biologic effects of RA. The RA-dependent activation of p70 S6 kinase was also phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase (PI3'K)-dependent, and resulted in downstream phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal protein on Ser235/236 and Ser240/244, events important for initiation of translation for mRNAs with oligopyrimidine tracts in their 5' untranslated region. RA treatment of leukemia cells also resulted in an mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of the 4E-BP1 repressor of mRNA translation, to induce its deactivation and dissociation from the eukaryotic initiation factor-4E (eIF-4E) complex. Altogether, these findings provide evidence for the existence of a novel RA-activated cellular pathway that regulates cap-dependent translation, and strongly suggest that this cascade plays a role in the induction of retinoid responses in APL cells.","['Lal, Lakhvir', 'Li, Yongzhong', 'Smith, Jessica', 'Sassano, Antonella', 'Uddin, Shahab', 'Parmar, Simrit', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Minucci, Saverio', 'Hay, Nissim', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Lal L', 'Li Y', 'Smith J', 'Sassano A', 'Uddin S', 'Parmar S', 'Tallman MS', 'Minucci S', 'Hay N', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

It has unique cytologic features independent of the site of the tumor and can be identified on fine needle aspiration. CASE: A 13-year old girl without a relevant medical history presented with an abdominal mass. Investigation revealed a tumor infiltrate in the small intestine and mesentery. The fine needle aspirate contained myeloid blasts with cytoplasmic granules. Immunohistochemistry on subsequent biopsy confirmed myeloid differentiation. There was no evidence of blood or bone marrow involvement suggestive of acute leukemia. The patient was well after 27 months of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Granulocytic sarcoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of any small intestine infiltrate. Cytomorphology is accurate and efficient for the diagnosis in conjunction with complete immunocytochemistry study.,"['Mrad, Karima', 'Abid, Leila', 'Driss, Maha', 'Ben Abid, Hela', 'Ben Romdhane, Khaled']","['Mrad K', 'Abid L', 'Driss M', 'Ben Abid H', 'Ben Romdhane K']","['Histopathology Department, Salah Azaiez Institute, and Hematology Department, Aziza Othmana Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia. karima.mrad@rns.tn']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Biopsy, Fine-Needle', 'Cell Lineage/physiology', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Diagnostic Errors/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intestinal Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Intestine, Small/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/pathology', 'Mesentery/pathology', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*pathology']",2004/10/09 09:00,2004/11/13 09:00,['2004/10/09 09:00'],"['2004/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000326435 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Cytol. 2004 Sep-Oct;48(5):641-4. doi: 10.1159/000326435.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While multiple myeloma (MM) and plasma cell leukemia (PCL) are incurable malignant diseases, most patients with MG of undetermined significance (MGUS) show an indolent/benign clinical course. Evidence has accumulated which supports the role of the bone marrow microenvironment in MG. Accordingly, the survival, drug-resistance and proliferation of MM cells have been shown to be largely dependent on a supportive microenvironment. Among the different environment-associated parameters, those related to the status/activity of the immune system are particularly relevant. This review focuses on the different ways clonal plasma cells (PC) interact with the immune system in different models of MG, to characterize crucial events in the development and progression of MG.

Improvements in diagnostic technology have led to the detection of disease-associated markers in increasing numbers of otherwise healthy individuals. However, many of these approaches do not necessarily constitute evidence of a neoplastic process: the identification of a disease-precursor state requires evidence at several levels. The advent of high-sensitivity flow cytometry techniques, developed to monitor disease in CLL patients undergoing treatment, has allowed accurate enumeration of sub-clinical levels of monoclonal B-cells with a CLL phenotype in healthy individuals from the general population and CLL families. The age and gender distribution parallels that of clinical disease. Emerging evidence confirms the association between the aberrant cells in healthy individuals and those in CLL patients at the phenotypic, genotypic and clinical level, particularly in families with inherited susceptibility. These cells provide a tool for studying the events responsible for disease initiation.","['Rawstron, A C']",['Rawstron AC'],"['Hematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, United Kingdom. andy.rawstron@hmds.org.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,8809253,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymphocytosis/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sex Factors']",2004/10/09 09:00,2005/05/03 09:00,['2004/10/09 09:00'],"['2004/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents. 2004 Apr-Jun;18(2):155-60.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,43,,,,,,,,,,,,

Particularly the evaluation of early treatment response has high prognostic value, because this allows identification of true low-risk and high-risk patients, who may profit from treatment reduction or treatment intensification, respectively. Consequently, monitoring of MRD is now being incorporated in many clinical protocols. Analysis of MRD in acute leukemia is currently mainly performed using flowcytometric immunophenotyping, real-time quantitative (RQ-)PCR analysis of fusion gene transcripts, and RQ-PCR analysis of rearranged immunoglobulin and/or T-cell receptor genes. These three techniques differ in their applicability and sensitivity and it should be noted that MRD results obtained by one method cannot yet easily be compared with MRD results obtained by another method. Also between laboratories applying the same method, significant variations in MRD results can be present. Consequently, multicenter clinical studies with MRD-based treatment intervention need standardization of MRD techniques and quality control of MRD results.","['van der Velden, V H J', 'Boeckx, N', 'van Wering, E R', 'van Dongen, J J M']","['van der Velden VH', 'Boeckx N', 'van Wering ER', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. v.h.j.vandervelden@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,8809253,IM,"['Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/10/09 09:00,2005/05/03 09:00,['2004/10/09 09:00'],"['2004/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents. 2004 Apr-Jun;18(2):146-54.,,,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",,100,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in many cases T cell immunity is unable to successfully control tumor progression. Since tumors are derived from normal tissues, most antigens are shared with normal tissues, although expression levels are usually elevated in malignant cells. Nevertheless, low-level expression in normal cells can be sufficient to render autologous T cells tolerant and thus unable to mount effective immune responses against tumors. Here, we review how allogeneic T cells can be used to isolate T cells that effectively recognise and kill tumor cells, but not normal cells with low level of antigen expression. The TCR of allogeneic T cells can be introduced into patient T cells to equip them with anti-tumor specificity that may not be present in the autologous T cell repertoire.","['Xue, S', 'Gillmore, R', 'Gao, L', 'Bendle, G', 'Holler, A', 'Downs, A M', 'Tsallios, A', 'Ramirez, F', 'Ghani, Y', 'Hart, D', 'Alcock, S', 'Tranter, A', 'Morris, E', 'Stauss, H J']","['Xue S', 'Gillmore R', 'Gao L', 'Bendle G', 'Holler A', 'Downs AM', 'Tsallios A', 'Ramirez F', 'Ghani Y', 'Hart D', 'Alcock S', 'Tranter A', 'Morris E', 'Stauss HJ']","['Department of Immunology, Tumour Immunology Section, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,8809253,IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/therapy', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology', 'WT1 Proteins/immunology']",2004/10/09 09:00,2005/05/03 09:00,['2004/10/09 09:00'],"['2004/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents. 2004 Apr-Jun;18(2):131-3.,,,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",,29,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, no clear evidence for such effects has been found in epidemiological studies of people exposed to radiation. The predicted risks of hereditary effects of any kinds resulting from parental exposure to relatively low doses of ionizing radiation remain very low, compared to the spontaneous risks in the absence of irradiation. Irradiation of the mouse embryo can lead to various effects (lethality, growth retardation, congenital abnormalities), depending on the period of gestation at which irradiation occurs. In humans, prenatal irradiation has only been exceptionally associated with congenital abnormalities, but irradiation between weeks 8-25 has been shown to be able to induce severe mental retardation. Although being not proven, the risk of developing a childhood cancer following prenatal irradiation may also not be excluded. Like for genetic effects, the risk of adverse effects following exposure of the embryo to relatively low doses remains quite low compared to the natural risks.","['Jacquet, P']",['Jacquet P'],"['SCKCEN, Mol, Belgium. pjacquet@sckcen.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,8809253,IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/radiation effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations/radiation effects', 'Congenital Abnormalities/etiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*radiation effects', 'Female', 'Fetus/radiation effects', 'Germ Cells/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', '*Radiation, Ionizing', 'Reproduction/radiation effects', 'Risk Factors']",2004/10/09 09:00,2005/05/03 09:00,['2004/10/09 09:00'],"['2004/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents. 2004 Apr-Jun;18(2):106-14.,,,,,51,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a patient of Down's syndrome with TMD in neonatal period which had spontaneous remission at 3 weeks but later died of acute myeloid leukemia at 6 months. The blasts in our case during the TMD episode were Myeloperoxidase(MPO) positive unlike other cases of TMD reported in literature.

Smad1 is commonly involved in bone morphogenetic protein but not in tumor-transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signaling pathways. This study focuses on Smad1 signaling pathway in non-Hodgkin lymphoma cells including follicular or large-cell lymphoma cells. Our results support the notion that phosphorylation of Smad1 is mediated by TGFbeta present in the microenvironment and occurs in FL in vivo. Using an in vitro coculture system mimicking interactions between stroma cells and FL cells, we found that both the cell partners release TGFbeta at a sufficient concentration to activate Smad pathways in the malignant cells. This Smad1 activation involves TGFbetaRII but not ALK-1 receptors, and does not compete with the Smad2 pathway. Moreover, proliferation assays performed on lymphoma cells expressing wild-type or mutated Smad1, or in which endogenous Smad1 level was decreased by gene silencing, strongly supported that overexpression and activation of Smad1 modifies the biological response of lymphoma B cells to TGFbeta family members. This work opens new insights into aberrant Smad pathways and their pathophysiological role in FL and in other non-Hodgkin lymphomas.","['Munoz, O', 'Fend, F', 'de Beaumont, R', 'Husson, H', 'Astier, A', 'Freedman, A S']","['Munoz O', 'Fend F', 'de Beaumont R', 'Husson H', 'Astier A', 'Freedman AS']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA. omunoz@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Activin Receptors, Type I/metabolism', 'Activin Receptors, Type II', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', '*Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Palatine Tonsil/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Smad Proteins', 'Smad1 Protein', 'Smad2 Protein', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/10/08 09:00,2004/12/22 09:00,['2004/10/08 09:00'],"['2004/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403485 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403485 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Dec;18(12):2015-25. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403485.,,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (SMAD1 protein, human)', '0 (SMAD2 protein, human)', '0 (Smad Proteins)', '0 (Smad1 Protein)', '0 (Smad2 Protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (ACVRL1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Activin Receptors, Type I)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Activin Receptors, Type II)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of TCRB rearrangements showed a significant relation with age (highest frequency of 46% between 5 and 10 years of age) and the presence of TEL-AML1 transcripts, and was associated with relatively high frequencies of IGK-Kde, TCRG, and Vdelta2-Jalpha rearrangements. In 62 out of 65 patients with Southern blot-detected Vbeta-(Dbeta)-Jbeta and/or Dbeta-Jbeta rearrangements, at least one TCRB gene rearrangement was detected by PCR. Based on combined Southern blot and PCR analysis, oligoclonal TCRB gene rearrangements were observed in only 12% of patients. Analysis of paired diagnosis and relapse samples (n=26) showed that 20 out of 24 (83%) Vbeta-(Dbeta)-Jbeta rearrangements and eight out of 14 (57%) Dbeta-Jbeta rearrangements remained stable. Using real-time quantitative PCR, a quantitative range < or =10(-4) was obtained in 64% of TCRB gene rearrangements and in 86% of cases a sensitivity < or =10(-4) was obtained. In conclusion, TCRB gene rearrangements occur in 35% of precursor-B-ALL patients and are relatively stable and sensitive PCR targets for detection of minimal residual disease, particularly if this concerns complete Vbeta-(Dbeta)-Jbeta rearrangements.","['van der Velden, V H J', 'Bruggemann, M', 'Hoogeveen, P G', 'de Bie, M', 'Hart, P G', 'Raff, T', 'Pfeifer, H', 'Luschen, S', 'Szczepanski, T', 'van Wering, E R', 'Kneba, M', 'van Dongen, J J M']","['van der Velden VH', 'Bruggemann M', 'Hoogeveen PG', 'de Bie M', 'Hart PG', 'Raff T', 'Pfeifer H', 'Luschen S', 'Szczepanski T', 'van Wering ER', 'Kneba M', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/*genetics', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor beta/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2004/10/08 09:00,2004/12/22 09:00,['2004/10/08 09:00'],"['2004/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403505 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403505 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Dec;18(12):1971-80. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403505.,,,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The apoptosis characteristics of MRD cells may differ from those at diagnosis and thereby determine the adequacy of further treatment. Such characteristics are largely unknown, since studies hereto are hampered by minimal cell availability. This study explores the applicability of the recently described RT-Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (RT-MLPA) for gene expression analysis of small amounts of RNA obtained from MRD cells. Reproducibility and dilution experiments showed that the relative expression of 37 apoptosis-related genes starting with only 1000 cells could be measured with 12% variation; for 100 cells, 31/37 genes could still be quantified, though expression variation increased. In practice 100-1000 leukemic cells can be obtained from bone marrow samples with clinically relevant MRD percentages of 0.01-0.1. Procedures often necessary to obtain AML blasts, that is, FACS-sorting, freeze-thawing or combinations are possible, provided that selected viable nonapoptotic cells are used. Concluding, RT-MLPA allows accurate gene expression profiling of MRD cells. This method will help to gain insight into the processes of MRD emergence and persistence in AML, which may ultimately guide new therapeutic strategies in AML.","['Hess, C J', 'Denkers, F', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Waisfisz, Q', 'McElgunn, C J', 'Eldering, E', 'Schouten, J P', 'Schuurhuis, G J']","['Hess CJ', 'Denkers F', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Waisfisz Q', 'McElgunn CJ', 'Eldering E', 'Schouten JP', 'Schuurhuis GJ']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2004/10/08 09:00,2004/12/22 09:00,['2004/10/08 09:00'],"['2004/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403520 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403520 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Dec;18(12):1981-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403520.,,,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This syndrome is characterized by immunodeficiency, facial dysmorphy, mental retardation of variable severity and chromosomal abnormalities that essentially involve juxtacentromeric heterochromatin of chromosomes 1 and 16. These abnormalities demonstrate that hypomethylation of satellite DNA can induce alterations in the structure of heterochromatin. In order to investigate the effect of DNA hypomethylation on heterochromatin organization, we analyzed the in vivo distribution of HP1 proteins, essential components of heterochromatin, in three ICF patients. We observed that, in a large proportion of ICF G2 nuclei, all HP1 isoforms show an aberrant signal concentrated into a prominent bright focus that co-localizes with the undercondensed 1qh or 16qh heterochromatin. We found that SP100, SUMO-1 and other proteins from the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (NBs) form a large body that co-localizes with the HP1 signal. This is the first description of altered nuclear distribution of HP1 proteins in the constitutional ICF syndrome. Our results show that satellite DNA hypomethylation does not prevent HP1 proteins from associating with heterochromatin. They suggest that, at G2 phase, HP1 proteins are involved in the heterochromatin condensation and may therefore remain concentrated at these sites until the condensation is complete. They also indicate that proteins from the NB could play a role in this process. Finally, satellite DNA length polymorphism could affect the efficiency of heterochromatin condensation and thus contribute to the variability of the ICF phenotype.","['Luciani, Judith J', 'Depetris, Danielle', 'Missirian, Chantal', 'Mignon-Ravix, Cecile', 'Metzler-Guillemain, Catherine', 'Megarbane, Andre', 'Moncla, Anne', 'Mattei, Marie-Genevieve']","['Luciani JJ', 'Depetris D', 'Missirian C', 'Mignon-Ravix C', 'Metzler-Guillemain C', 'Megarbane A', 'Moncla A', 'Mattei MG']","['Inserm U 491, Faculte de Medecine, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Hum Genet,European journal of human genetics : EJHG,9302235,IM,"['Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Centromere/*genetics', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromobox Protein Homolog 5', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Satellite/*metabolism', 'Face/*abnormalities', 'Female', 'G2 Phase', 'Heterochromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Syndrome']",2004/10/08 09:00,2005/04/27 09:00,['2004/10/08 09:00'],"['2004/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['5201293 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201293 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Hum Genet. 2005 Jan;13(1):41-51. doi: 10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201293.,,,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA, Satellite)', '0 (Heterochromatin)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '107283-02-3 (Chromobox Protein Homolog 5)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because imatinib is predominantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, its pharmacokinetics may be altered when it is coadministered with drugs or herbs (eg, St John's wort) that modulate CYP3A4 activity. Thus we examined the effects of St John's wort on imatinib pharmacokinetics. METHODS: This 2-period, open-label, fixed-sequence study was completed by 12 healthy subjects (6 men and 6 women) aged between 20 and 51 years. Each subject received 400 mg imatinib orally on study day 1, St John's wort (300 mg 3 times daily) on days 4 to 17, and 400 mg imatinib again on day 15. Serial blood samples were obtained over a 72-hour period after each imatinib dose. Imatinib and N -desmethyl-imatinib (CGP 74588) were quantified in plasma by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: St John's wort administration increased imatinib clearance by 43% ( P < .001), from 12.5 +/- 3.6 L/h to 17.9 +/- 5.6 L/h; imatinib area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) extrapolated to infinity was decreased by 30%, from 34.5 +/- 9.5 microg . h/mL to 24.2 +/- 7.0 microg . h/mL ( P < .001). Imatinib half-life (12.8 hours versus 9.0 hours) and maximum concentration (C max ) (2.2 microg/mL versus 1.8 microg/mL) were also significantly decreased ( P < .005). N -desmethyl-imatinib C max was increased from 285 +/- 95 ng/mL to 318 +/- 95 ng/mL during St John's wort dosing, but the AUC from 0 to 72 hours was not altered. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that St John's wort increases imatinib clearance. Thus patients taking imatinib should avoid taking St John's wort. Concomitant use of enzyme inducers, including St John's wort, may necessitate an increase in the imatinib dose to maintain clinical effectiveness.","['Frye, Reginald F', 'Fitzgerald, Sara M', 'Lagattuta, Theodore F', 'Hruska, Matthew W', 'Egorin, Merrill J']","['Frye RF', 'Fitzgerald SM', 'Lagattuta TF', 'Hruska MW', 'Egorin MJ']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Pittsburgh, USA. frye@cop.ufl.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Pharmacol Ther,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,0372741,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Benzamides', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Hypericum', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Phytotherapy', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/blood/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Plant Extracts/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/blood/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics']",2004/10/08 09:00,2004/10/30 09:00,['2004/10/08 09:00'],"['2004/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/30 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009923604002334 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clpt.2004.06.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2004 Oct;76(4):323-9. doi: 10.1016/j.clpt.2004.06.007.,"['M01 RR00056/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA47904/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH63458/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0 (Antidepressive Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These mutations result in defective receptor internalization and sustained cellular activation, suggesting a loss of negative signaling by the G-CSFR. In this paper we investigated the roles of SHIP and cytokine-inducible Src homology 2 protein (CIS) in down-modulating G-CSFR signals and demonstrate that loss of their recruitment as a consequence of receptor mutations leads to aberrant signaling. We show that SHIP binds to phosphopeptides corresponding to Tyr744 and Tyr764 in the G-CSFR and that Tyr764 is required for in vivo phosphorylation of SHIP and the formation of SHIP/Shc complexes. Cells expressing a G-CSFR form lacking Tyr764 exhibited hypersensitivity to G-CSF and enhanced proliferation, but to a lesser degree than observed with the most common mutant G-CSFR form in patients with SCN/AML, prompting us to investigate whether suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins also down-modulate G-CSFR signals. G-CSF was found to induce the expression of CIS and of CIS bound to phosphopeptides corresponding to Tyr729 and Tyr744 of the G-CSFR. The expression of CIS was prolonged in cells with the SCN/AML mutant G-CSFR lacking Tyr729 and Tyr744, which also correlated with increased G-CSFR expression. These findings suggest that SHIP and CIS interact with distal phosphotyrosine residues in the G-CSFR to negatively regulate G-CSFR signaling by limiting proliferation and modulating surface expression of the G-CSFR, respectively. Novel therapeutic approaches targeting inhibitory pathways that limit G-CSFR signaling may have promise in the treatment of patients with SCN/AML.","['Hunter, Melissa G', 'Jacob, Anand', ""O'donnell, Lynn C"", 'Agler, Amanda', 'Druhan, Lawrence J', 'Coggeshall, K Mark', 'Avalos, Belinda R']","['Hunter MG', 'Jacob A', ""O'donnell LC"", 'Agler A', 'Druhan LJ', 'Coggeshall KM', 'Avalos BR']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, The Arthur G.

The identification and isolation of stem-like cells would have significant implications for successful myogenic cell transfer therapy in human muscle disorders. Using a clonal culture system for mouse muscle satellite cells, we have identified two cell types, designated 'round cells' and 'thick cells', in clones derived from single muscle satellite cells that have been taken from either slow or fast muscle. Clonal analysis of satellite cells revealed that the round cells are immediate descendants of quiescent satellite cells in adult muscle. In single-myofiber culture, round cells first formed colonies and then generated progeny, thick cells, that underwent both myogenic and osteogenic terminal differentiation under the appropriate culture conditions. Thick cells, but not round cells, responded to terminal differentiation-inducing signals. Round cells express Pax7, a specific marker of satellite cells, at high levels. Myogenic cell transfer experiments showed that round cells reconstitute myofibers more efficiently than thick cells. Furthermore, round cells restored dystrophin in myofibers of mdx nude mice, even when as few as 5000 cells were transferred into the gastrocnemius muscle. These results suggest that round cells are satellite-cell descendants with stem cell-like characteristics and represent a useful source of donor cells to improve muscle regeneration.","['Hashimoto, Naohiro', 'Murase, Takeshi', 'Kondo, Syunzo', 'Okuda, Asuko', 'Inagawa-Ogashiwa, Masayo']","['Hashimoto N', 'Murase T', 'Kondo S', 'Okuda A', 'Inagawa-Ogashiwa M']","['Tissue Stem Cell Research Team, Mitsubishi Kagaku Institute of Life Sciences, 11 Minamiooya, Machida, Tokyo 194-8511, Japan. nao@libra.ls.m-kagaku.co.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dystrophin/metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Muscle Development/drug effects', 'Muscles/*cytology/*metabolism', 'PAX7 Transcription Factor', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism']",2004/10/08 09:00,2004/12/24 09:00,['2004/10/08 09:00'],"['2004/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['dev.01395 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.01395 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2004 Nov;131(21):5481-90. doi: 10.1242/dev.01395.

However, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of the IKKalpha gene itself. The present study revealed that the transcriptional induction of the IKKalpha gene is positively regulated by binding ETS-1, the protein product of the ETS-1 proto-oncogene. Furthermore, ETS-1 mediated activation of IKKalpha is negatively regulated by p53 binding to ETS-1. By analyzing the genomic DNA sequence, we identified the putative IKKalpha promoter sequence in the 5'-flanking untranslated region of the IKKalpha gene. Transfection of EU-4, an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line, with plasmids containing the IKKalpha 5'-untranslated region sequence upstream of the luciferase reporter showed that this region possessed major promoter activity. Induction or enforced overexpression of p53 represses IKKalpha mRNA and protein expression as well as IKKalpha promoter activity. Deletion and mutation analyses as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicated that ETS-1 binds to the core IKKalpha promoter and strongly induces its activity. Although p53 does not directly bind to the IKKalpha promoter, it physically interacts with ETS-1 and specifically inhibits ETS-1-induced IKKalpha promoter activity.

Spectrophotometric measurements of mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activities, NMR spectroscopy of culture media, determination of antioxidant enzyme activities, and cell proliferation and differentiation assays were performed. The data showed that moderate hyperoxia in this myeloid cell line causes: i) intriguing alterations in the mitochondrial activities at the levels of succinate dehydrogenase and succinate-cytochrome c reductase; ii) induction of metabolic compensatory adaptations, with significant shift to glycolysis; iii) induction of different antioxidant enzyme activities; iv) significant cell growth inhibition and v) no significant apoptosis.

Herein, the effect of SCH66336 on the isoprenylation and function of the human and mouse IPs overexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and by the IP endogenously expressed in human erythroleukaemia cells, was investigated. SCH66336 yielded concentration-dependent decreases in IP-mediated cAMP generation (IC50 0.27-0.62 nM), [Ca2+]i mobilization (IC50 26.6-48.3 nM) and IP internalization, but had no effect on signalling by the non-isoprenylated beta2 adrenergic receptor or b isoform of the TP (prostanoid thromboxane A2 receptor). Additionally, SCH66336 impaired IP-mediated crossdesensitization of TPa signalling (IC50 56.1 nM) and reduced farnesylation of the molecular chaperone protein HDJ-2 (IC50 3.1 nM). To establish whether farnesylation of the IP is inhibited and/or whether its 'CaaX motif' might undergo alternative geranylgeranylation in the presence of SCH66336, a series of chimaeric Ha (Harvey)-Ras fusions were generated by replacing its CaaX motif (-CVLS) with that of the IP (-CSLC) or, as controls, of Ki (Kirsten)-Ras 4B (-CVIM) or Rac 1 (-CVLL). Whereas SCH66336 had no effect on Ha-RasCVLL isoprenylation in vitro or in whole cells, it supported alternative geranylgeranylation of Ha-RasCVIM, but completely impaired isoprenylation of both Ha-RasCVLS and Ha-RasCSLC. These data confirm that the -CSLC motif of the IP is a direct target for inhibition by the FTI SCH66336, and in the presence of strong FTase inhibition, the IP does not undergo compensatory geranylgeranylation","[""O'Meara, Sarah J"", 'Kinsella, B Therese']","[""O'Meara SJ"", 'Kinsella BT']","['Department of Biochemistry, Conway Institute of Biomolecular and Biomedical Research, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Adrenergic beta-Agonists/pharmacology', 'Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Epoprostenol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Farnesyltranstransferase', 'HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iloprost/metabolism', 'Isoproterenol/pharmacology', 'Kidney', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/metabolism', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Proline/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Propanolamines/metabolism', 'Protein Prenylation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-2/drug effects/genetics', 'Receptors, Epoprostenol/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Thromboxane A2, Prostaglandin H2/drug effects', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transfection']",2004/10/08 09:00,2005/08/03 09:00,['2004/10/08 09:00'],"['2004/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJ20041290 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20041290 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2005 Feb 15;386(Pt 1):177-89. doi: 10.1042/BJ20041290.,,,"['0 (Adrenergic beta-Agonists)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNAJA1 protein, human)', '0 (HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Propanolamines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-2)', '0 (Receptors, Epoprostenol)', '0 (Receptors, Thromboxane A2, Prostaglandin H2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)', 'DCR9Z582X0 (Epoprostenol)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'IOW153004F (lonafarnib)', 'JED5K35YGL (Iloprost)', 'L628TT009W (Isoproterenol)', 'NE94J8CAMD (cicaprost)', 'R89UMZ82MJ (CGP 12177)', 'X3MM60SOVP (ceronapril)']",,,PMC1134780,,,,,,,,,,,

MTX achieves its cytotoxicity through the inhibition of folate-dependent enzymes, suggesting that the genes controlling their activity or the levels of folate cofactors can modulate drug efficacy and, thus, the sensitivity of a patient to MTX. Indeed, several studies, conducted mostly in leukemia and rheumatoid arthritis patients, have addressed the potential for tailoring MTX therapy based on a patient's genetics. Several genetic variants have been shown to have a predictive role, among which the most frequently studied are those of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase genes.

However, little is known about the mechanism of action of the ATO effect on solid tumor. We investigated the anti-vascular effect of ATO and the potential of combining ATO with radiation therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied the anti-vascular effect of ATO and radiosensitization of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) VII murine tumors of C3H mice. The anti-vascular effect was examined using magnetic resonance imaging(MRI), and radiosensitivity was studied by clonogenic assay and tumor growth delay. Histopathological changes of the tumors after various treatments were also observed with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. RESULTS: Necrosis and blood flow changes in the central region of tumors in the hind limbs of the animals were observed on T2-weighted imaging after an i.p. injection of 8 mg/kg of ATO alone. ATO exposure followed by radiation decreased the clonogenic survival of SCC VII cells compared with either treatment alone. Tumor growth delay after 10-20 Gy of radiation alone was increased slightly compared with control tumors, but the combination of ATO injection 2 hours before exposure to 20 Gy of radiation significantly prolonged tumor growth delay by almost 20 days. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that ATO and radiation can enhance the radiosensitivity of solid tumor.","['Monzen, Hajime', 'Griffin, Robert J', 'Williams, Brent W', 'Amano, Morikazu', 'Ando, Satoshi', 'Hasegawa, Takeo']","['Monzen H', 'Griffin RJ', 'Williams BW', 'Amano M', 'Ando S', 'Hasegawa T']","['Department of Radiology, Otsu Red Cross Hospital, 1-35 Nagara, Otsu-shi, Shiga 520-8511, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Japan,Radiat Med,Radiation medicine,8412264,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Vessels/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Coloring Agents', 'Growth Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Hindlimb', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Necrosis', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Regional Blood Flow/drug effects', 'Skin Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2004/10/08 09:00,2004/11/04 09:00,['2004/10/08 09:00'],"['2004/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Med. 2004 Jul-Aug;22(4):205-11.,"['CA 13353/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 44114/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, therefore, we present a clinical study using a combination of ATO with low-dose ATRA (LD-ATRA) to treat 108 APL patients (80 newly diagnosed patients, 28 relapsed patients). Therapeutic outcomes using the ATO/LD-ATRA approach were compared with those of APL patients treated either with ATO alone (65 patients) or ATRA alone (51 patients). The results showed that the ATO/LD-ATRA approach provided significantly better therapeutic outcomes as compared to either ATO or ATRA alone, as evidenced by lower mortality, a higher CR rate and a reduced period to CR. In addition, the toxic side-effects have been no worse with the combined ATO/LD-ATRA treatment than with either ATO or ATRO alone and in some cases have been reduced. These data suggest that the ATO/LD-ATRA regimen is superior to either regimen given alone to patients with APL.","['Wang, Guanjun', 'Li, Wei', 'Cui, Jiuwei', 'Gao, Sujun', 'Yao, Cheng', 'Jiang, Zhenyu', 'Song, Yanqiu', 'Yuan, Chang-Ji', 'Yang, Yan', 'Liu, Ziling', 'Cai, Lu']","['Wang G', 'Li W', 'Cui J', 'Gao S', 'Yao C', 'Jiang Z', 'Song Y', 'Yuan CJ', 'Yang Y', 'Liu Z', 'Cai L']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, The First Hospital, Jilin University School of Medicine, Changchun, 130021, PR China. guanjunw1995@sina.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage']",2004/10/07 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/07 09:00'],"['2004/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.728 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2004 Jun;22(2):63-71. doi: 10.1002/hon.728.,,,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']","['Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",19,,,,,,,,,,,,

Changes in LAIPs during the course of the disease may be a limitation for this approach. METHODS: We analyzed 49 patients at diagnosis and relapse by flow cytometry, cytomorphology, cytogenetics, and molecular genetics. RESULTS: In 37 patients (76%), at least one LAIP detectable at diagnosis was present at relapse; in 12 patients (24%), none of the original LAIPs were present in at least 1% of bone marrow cells. Three groups were identified: no change in LAIPs, partial changes in LAIPs, and complete change in LAIPs. There were significant differences across these groups with regard to changes in cytomorphology (11%, 40%, and 58% of all cases, respectively; P = 0.007), cytogenetics (15%, 20%, and 25%; not significant), and molecular genetics (18%, 0, and 86%; P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that, in a subset of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, the disease is biologically different at relapse; therefore, monitoring of minimal residual disease is difficult to accomplish. In most patients with acute myeloid leukemia, multiparameter flow cytometry may be used to monitor minimal residual disease.","['Voskova, Daniela', 'Schoch, Claudia', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Kern, Wolfgang']","['Voskova D', 'Schoch C', 'Schnittger S', 'Hiddemann W', 'Haferlach T', 'Kern W']","['Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

In this study, we developed a method to detect the phosphotyrosine proteins by flow cytometry and we asked whether phosphorylation was affected by imatinib mesylate treatment. METHODS: Cells were treated or not with imatinib mesylate, fixed and permeabilized by PFA followed by saponin, then stained with anti-phosphotyrosine (p-tyr) monoclonal antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Optimal staining parameters were performed with p-tyr antibody using K562 and LAMA84 lines that displayed high levels of tyrosine phosphorylation as compared to the control line, HL60. Tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited by imatinib in a dose-dependent manner, but not modified by other inhibitors demonstrating that the staining detected is specific to Bcr-Abl phosphorylation. The staining of imatinib-resistant cell lines such as the mutated BaF/Bcr-AblT315I cell line or resistant CML patient cells, showed that hyperphosphorylation was not affected by imatinib treatment. In one CML patient, our technique permitted us to detect a small hyperphosphorylated population resistant to imatinib that appeared hyperphosphorylated and amplified at the time of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a flow cytometric technique presenting several advantages such as rapidity and sensitivity, which requires fewer cells than the Western blot.","['Desplat, Vanessa', 'Lagarde, Valerie', 'Belloc, Francis', 'Chollet, Claudine', 'Leguay, Thibaut', 'Pasquet, Jean-Max', 'Praloran, Vincent', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier']","['Desplat V', 'Lagarde V', 'Belloc F', 'Chollet C', 'Leguay T', 'Pasquet JM', 'Praloran V', 'Mahon FX']","['Laboratoire Hematopoiese Normale et Pathologique, FRE CNRS 2617, Universite Victor Segalen, rue Leo-Saignat, 33076 Bordeaux Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

In some acute leukaemias, a chromosomal translocation fusing the PLZF gene to that encoding the retinoic acid receptor RARalpha gives rise to a fusion protein, PLZF-RARalpha, thought to be responsible for constitutive repression of differentiation-associated genes in these cells. Repression by both PLZF and PLZF-RARalpha is sensitive to the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA, and PLZF was previously shown to interact physically with HDAC1, a class I histone deacetylase. We here asked whether class II histone deacetylases, known to be generally involved in differentiation processes, participate in the repression mediated by PLZF and PLZF-RARalpha, and found that PLZF interacts with HDAC4 in both GST-pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Furthermore, HDAC4 is indeed involved in PLZF and PLZF-RARalpha-mediated repression, since an enzymatically dead mutant of HDAC4 released the repression, as did an siRNA that blocks HDAC4 expression. Taken together, our data indicate that recruitment of HDAC4 is necessary for PLZF-mediated repression in both normal and leukaemic cells.","['Chauchereau, Anne', 'Mathieu, Marion', 'de Saintignon, Julie', 'Ferreira, Roger', 'Pritchard, Linda L', 'Mishal, Zohair', 'Dejean, Anne', 'Harel-Bellan, Annick']","['Chauchereau A', 'Mathieu M', 'de Saintignon J', 'Ferreira R', 'Pritchard LL', 'Mishal Z', 'Dejean A', 'Harel-Bellan A']","['UPR 9079 CNRS-Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, Institut Andre Lwoff, 7 rue Guy Moquet, 94800 Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Deacetylases/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Repressor Proteins/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology']",2004/10/07 09:00,2005/03/03 09:00,['2004/10/07 09:00'],"['2004/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208128 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208128 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Nov 18;23(54):8777-84. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208128.,,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein, human)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate that CHFR, a mitotic checkpoint protein frequently inactivated in human cancers, is a dynamic component of PML bodies. Intermolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis identified a distinct fraction of CHFR that interacts with PML in living cells. This interaction modulates the nuclear distribution and mobility of CHFR. A trans-dominant mutant of CHFR that inhibits checkpoint function also prevents colocalization and interaction with PML. Conversely, the distribution and mobility of CHFR are perturbed in PML(-/-) cells, accompanied by aberrations in mitotic entry and the response to spindle depolymerization.

Moreover, Mcl-1 undergoes a complex transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational regulation process. This regulation modifies not only Mcl-1 expression, but also its function. Various extra-cellular stimuli, including cytokines, growth factors, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and IFN, activate pathways which regulate Mcl-1 expression. Furthermore, Mcl-1 can be alternatively spliced into a long (Mcl-1) or a short (Mcl-1S) form. Mcl-1 opposes pro-apoptotic proteins and can be either cleaved or phosphorylated at a post-translational level. Mcl-1-spliced products, Mcl-1-cleaved products, or phosphorylated Mcl-1 have either a pro or an anti-apoptotic function, highlighting the complexity and pivotal role of Mcl-1 regulation.

In these cells, paclitaxel exposure failed to induce p21(Cip1/Waf1) expression. Nevertheless, stable expression of U937 cells with a p21(Cip1/WAF1) antisense construct blocked paclitaxel-induced G(2)M arrest and increased mitochondrial injury, caspase activation, apoptosis, and loss of clonogenic potential. Consistent with these results, enforced expression of p21(Cip1/WAF1) in Jurkat cells increased the percentage of cells arrested in G2M and attenuated paclitaxel-mediated mitochondrial injury and apoptosis. Unexpectedly, enforced expression of p21(Cip1/WAF1) diminished paclitaxel-mediated inactivation of ERK, and reduced paclitaxel-induced activation of JNK as well as Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Together, these findings suggest that p21(Cip1/WAF1) partially protects p53-null human leukemia cells from paclitaxel-mediated lethality, and raise the possibility that p21(Cip1/WAF1)-associated perturbations in signal transduction pathways as well as Bcl-2 phosphorylation status may play a role in this phenomenon.","['Ahmed, Wesam', 'Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Ahmed W', 'Rahmani M', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Antisense Elements (Genetics)', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*metabolism', 'Doxycycline/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*pathology', 'Mitotic Index', 'Paclitaxel/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*deficiency/genetics', 'U937 Cells']",2004/10/07 09:00,2006/04/25 09:00,['2004/10/07 09:00'],"['2004/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['1156 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.3.10.1161 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2004 Oct;3(10):1305-11. doi: 10.4161/cc.3.10.1161.

Inhibition of Bcr-Abl by STI571 is widely used to treat CML patients. Unlike in most cancer types, the frequency of p53 mutations in CML is low. Here, we investigated the effect of STI571 treatment of CML cells on p53 regulation. Exposure of CML cells, including established cell lines and freshly isolated cells from patients, to STI571 reduced p53 protein levels, and severely impaired its accumulation in response to DNA damage. This may be explained by the status of p53 serine 20 phosphorylation. In non-stressed CML cells, serine 20 of p53 is constitutively phosphorylated by Chk1, and is inhibited by STI571. In response to DNA damage, however, this phosphorylation is mediated by Chk1 and Chk2, and is only partially inhibited by STI571. CML cells expressing wild-type p53 are more resistant to treatment with STI571, but moderately more sensitive to DNA damage, than CML cells lacking p53. An enhanced induction of apoptosis by STI571 and DNA damage is observed in CML cells bearing wild-type p53, but not in cells lacking functional p53. This implies that the status of p53 may affect the response of CML cells to this combined treatment.","['Goldberg, Zehavit', 'Levav, Yaara', 'Krichevsky, Svetlana', 'Fibach, Eitan', 'Haupt, Ygal']","['Goldberg Z', 'Levav Y', 'Krichevsky S', 'Fibach E', 'Haupt Y']","['Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, The Hebrew Universitym, Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects/physiology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation/drug effects/physiology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism']",2004/10/07 09:00,2006/04/15 09:00,['2004/10/07 09:00'],"['2004/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['1126 [pii]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2004 Sep;3(9):1188-95.

Many of their effects are mediated by nuclear retinoid receptors including retinoic acid receptors (RARs alpha, beta and gamma) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs alpha, beta and gamma). Human retinoic acid receptor beta (RARbeta) has three different isoforms: beta1, beta2 and beta4. The tumor suppressive characteristics of RARbeta2, its silencing by promoter hypermethylation, and its reexpression following demethylation have been reported. In contrast, RARbeta1, an embryonic isoform with restricted expression in adult tissues has been linked to carcinogenesis. However, factors regulating RARbeta1 expression have not yet been clarified. During studies on the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells, we found that the expression of RARbeta increased in cells grown to high density. Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction revealed that the isoform increased in these cells was RARbeta1. Epigenetic modifications of this isoform were tested using combined bisulfite restriction analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. The UMSCC38 cell line showed significant RARbeta1 expression (p < 0.001), which was dependent on cell density and culture duration. The increased expression of RARbeta1 was not due to demethylation of its promoter. However, higher cell densities were associated with increased acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 9 in RARbeta1 but not in RARbeta2. These findings reveal that the expression of RARbeta1 is regulated by cell density through changes in histone acetylation.","['Youssef, Emile M', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J', 'Lotan, Reuben']","['Youssef EM', 'Issa JP', 'Lotan R']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

There is little doubt that changes in genomic hypermethylation contribute to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes. Furthermore, recent studies have also identified the significance of genomic hypomethylation associated with chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis. One of the most perplexing questions regarding epigenetic modifications and leukemogenesis is the relationship with DNA methyltransferases (DNMT's). The primary function of the DNMT enzymes is to methylate genomic DNA, whereas the methyl-CpG binding domain proteins (MBD) interpret this methylation signal and regulate gene expression and chromatin behavior. In this study we analyse these gene families by quantitative real-time PCR to investigate whether expression levels and the B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) phenotype are associated. Furthermore, given the epigenetic crosstalk between genome stability and the histone chromatin code we have analysed eukaryotic histone methyltransferase (Eu-HMTaseI). Surprisingly, we did not observe significant changes in DNMT1 expression in B-CLL cases when compared to normal lymphocytes, regardless of whether we normalise against GAPDH or PCNA as reference standards. Indeed, expression of the maintenance and de novo methylases were independently regulated. Of particular note was the significant down regulation of DNMT3b. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between HMTaseI expression levels and stage of leukemia suggesting that changes in the methylation patterns in B-CLL may represent deregulation of the epigenetic repertoire that also include the methylation dependent binding proteins, MBD2 and MeCP2. We envisage changes in the epigenetic program are multifactorial in nature and postulate that the prevalent genomic methylases just one component of a larger epigenetic repertoire.","['Kn, Harikrishnan', 'Bassal, Sahar', 'Tikellis, Chris', 'El-Osta, Assam']","['Kn H', 'Bassal S', 'Tikellis C', 'El-Osta A']","['The Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct, Baker Medical Research Institute, Epigenetics in Human Health and Disease Laboratory, Prahran, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*genetics/metabolism', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Methyltransferases', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",2004/10/07 09:00,2005/07/06 09:00,['2004/10/07 09:00'],"['2004/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['1137 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.3.10.1137 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2004 Oct;3(10):989-94. doi: 10.4161/cbt.3.10.1137.

Tumor cell differentiation is the process of turning abnormal tumor cells into 'normal' cells accompanied by down-regulation of telomerase activity. However, the precise mechanism of the regulation of telomerase activity in differentiated cells is not fully understood. In this study, we observed the role of alternative splicing of hTERT in the regulation of telomerase activity in all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced, differentiated HL-60 cells. ATRA-induced down-regulation of telomerase activity in differentiated HL-60 cells was associated with a decrease in hTERT and an increase in human telomerase-associated protein-1 (hTP1) transcription. Expression of full length variant hTERT alpha+ beta+ mRNA decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The drop of hTERT beta- mRNA was time-dependent. hTERT alpha- and hTERT alpha- beta- mRNA were reduced dramatically after ATRA treatment. In the dose-effect study, hTERT alpha+ beta+ and hTERT beta- maintained a relatively stable ratio when telomerase activity decreased largely from treatment with 1 to 5 microM ATRA. Although the splicing pattern of hTERT mRNA was altered in time-effect research, the change was not related to the ATRA-treated decline of telomerase activity. The expression of alternative splicing variants of hTERT also decreased at the protein level.

We evaluated the effect of depsipeptide, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, on EBV-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and Burkitt lymphoma cell lines in a mouse model and explored its mechanism of action in vitro. METHODS: We studied EBV-transformed LCLs, which express a latent III (Lat-III) viral gene profile, as do some EBV-positive lymphoproliferative malignancies, and Burkitt lymphoma cell lines, which express a Lat-I viral gene profile. Cell lines were used to characterize depsipeptide-induced apoptosis, which was evaluated by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry, western blot analyses, and histone deacetylase inhibitors were used to investigate components of prodeath and survival pathways in vitro. We studied depsipeptide's effects on survival with a mouse xenograft model of EBV-positive human B-cell tumors (groups of 10 mice). All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Depsipeptide (5 mg/m2 of body surface area) treatment was associated with statistically significantly improved survival of mice carrying Lat-III EBV-positive LCL tumors, compared with that of control-treated mice (day 30: for depsipeptide-treated mice, 90% survival, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 73.2% to 100%; for control-treated mice, 20% survival, 95% CI = 5.79% to 69.1%; P<.001), but it was not associated with survival of mice carrying Lat-I EBV-positive Burkitt lymphoma tumors. Depsipeptide induced apoptosis in 64% of LCLs and in 14% of EBV-positive Burkitt lymphoma cells in vitro. Depsipeptide-treated LCL cultures had two distinct cell populations--one sensitive and one resistant to depsipeptide. Depsipeptide-mediated apoptosis was associated with a 12-fold increased level of active caspase 3, but some apoptosis persisted despite z-VAD-fmk treatment to inhibit caspase activity. Depsipeptide-resistant LCLs expressed higher levels of latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1; P = .017), BCL2 (P = .032), and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) (P<.001) than depsipeptide-sensitive LCLs; this resistance was circumvented by treatment with PS-1145, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Apoptosis is induced by depsipeptide via caspase-dependent and -independent pathways in Lat-III EBV-positive LCLs and is enhanced by inhibiting NF-kappaB activity. Depsipeptide as a treatment for Lat-III EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders should be explored further in clinical trials.","['Roychowdhury, Sameek', 'Baiocchi, Robert A', 'Vourganti, Srinivas', 'Bhatt, Darshna', 'Blaser, Bradley W', 'Freud, Aharon G', 'Chou, Jason', 'Chen, Chang-Shi', 'Xiao, Jim J', 'Parthun, Mark', 'Chan, Kenneth K', 'Eisenbeis, Charles F', 'Ferketich, Amy K', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Chen, Ching-Shih', 'Caligiuri, Michael A']","['Roychowdhury S', 'Baiocchi RA', 'Vourganti S', 'Bhatt D', 'Blaser BW', 'Freud AG', 'Chou J', 'Chen CS', 'Xiao JJ', 'Parthun M', 'Chan KK', 'Eisenbeis CF', 'Ferketich AK', 'Grever MR', 'Chen CS', 'Caligiuri MA']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/virology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Depsipeptides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*complications/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology/*isolation & purification', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/virology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/drug effects/metabolism']",2004/10/07 09:00,2004/11/02 09:00,['2004/10/07 09:00'],"['2004/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['96/19/1447 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djh271 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2004 Oct 6;96(19):1447-57. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djh271.,"['P01 CA95426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', 'CX3T89XQBK (romidepsin)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, only a limited number of ""stretch-responsive"" genes in this cell type have been reported. We employed oligonucleotide arrays to identify stretch-sensitive genes in primary culture human bladder SMC subjected to repetitive mechanical stimulation for 4 h. Differential gene expression between stretched and nonstretched cells was assessed using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM). Expression of 20 out of 11,731 expressed genes ( approximately 0.17%) was altered >2-fold following stretch, with 19 genes induced and one gene (FGF-9) repressed. Using real-time RT-PCR, we tested independently the responsiveness of 15 genes to stretch and to platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), another hypertrophic stimulus for bladder SMC. In response to both stimuli, expression of 13 genes increased, 1 gene (FGF-9) decreased, and 1 gene was unchanged. Six transcripts (HB-EGF, BMP-2, COX-2, LIF, PAR-2, and FGF-9) were evaluated using an ex vivo rat model of bladder distension. HB-EGF, BMP-2, COX-2, LIF, and PAR-2 increased with bladder stretch ex vivo, whereas FGF-9 decreased, consistent with expression changes observed in vitro. In silico analysis of microarray data using the FIRED algorithm identified c-jun, AP-1, ATF-2, and neurofibromin-1 (NF-1) as potential transcriptional mediators of stretch signals. Furthermore, the promoters of 9 of 13 stretch-responsive genes contained AP-1 binding sites. These observations identify stretch as a highly selective regulator of gene expression in bladder SMC. Moreover, they suggest that mechanical and growth factor signals converge on common transcriptional regulators that include members of the AP-1 family.","['Adam, Rosalyn M', 'Eaton, Samuel H', 'Estrada, Carlos', 'Nimgaonkar, Ashish', 'Shih, Shu-Ching', 'Smith, Lois E H', 'Kohane, Isaac S', 'Bagli, Darius', 'Freeman, Michael R']","['Adam RM', 'Eaton SH', 'Estrada C', 'Nimgaonkar A', 'Shih SC', 'Smith LE', 'Kohane IS', 'Bagli D', 'Freeman MR']","[""Urological Diseases Research Center, Department of Urology, Children's Hospital Boston and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. rosalyn.adam@childrens.harvard.edu <rosalyn.adam@childrens.harvard.edu>""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Physiol Genomics,Physiological genomics,9815683,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Becaplermin', 'Binding Sites', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Computational Biology', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/metabolism', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 9/biosynthesis/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Muscle, Smooth/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/*metabolism', 'Neurofibromin 1/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptor, PAR-2/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stress, Mechanical', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Urinary Bladder/*metabolism']",2004/10/07 09:00,2006/05/24 09:00,['2004/10/07 09:00'],"['2004/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['00181.2004 [pii]', '10.1152/physiolgenomics.00181.2004 [doi]']",ppublish,Physiol Genomics. 2004 Dec 15;20(1):36-44. doi: 10.1152/physiolgenomics.00181.2004.

We looked for agents that would synergize with As(2)O(3) to induce apoptosis in malignant cells, but not in normal cells. We found that trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid), a widely known antioxidant, enhances As(2)O(3)-mediated apoptosis in APL, myeloma, and breast cancer cells. Treatment with As(2)O(3) and trolox increased intracellular oxidative stress, as evidenced by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein levels, c-Jun terminal kinase (JNK) activation, and protein and lipid oxidation. The synergistic effects of trolox may be specific to As(2)O(3), as trolox does not add to toxicity induced by other chemotherapeutic drugs. We explored the mechanism of this synergy using electron paramagnetic resonance and observed the formation of trolox radicals when trolox was combined with As(2)O(3), but not with doxorubicin. Importantly, trolox protected nonmalignant cells from As(2)O(3)-mediated cytotoxicity. Our data provide the first evidence that trolox may extend the therapeutic spectrum of As(2)O(3). Furthermore, the combination of As(2)O(3) and trolox shows potential specificity for tumor cells, suggesting it may not increase the toxicity associated with As(2)O(3) monotherapy in vivo.","['Diaz, Zuanel', 'Colombo, Myrian', 'Mann, Koren K', 'Su, Haixiang', 'Smith, Kamilah N', 'Bohle, D Scott', 'Schipper, Hyman M', 'Miller, Wilson H Jr']","['Diaz Z', 'Colombo M', 'Mann KK', 'Su H', 'Smith KN', 'Bohle DS', 'Schipper HM', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research,McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Annexin A5/analysis', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromans/*pharmacology', 'Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing)/metabolism', 'Heme Oxygenase-1', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects']",2004/10/07 09:00,2005/04/22 09:00,['2004/10/07 09:00'],"['2004/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)46817-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-05-1772 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Feb 1;105(3):1237-45. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-05-1772.

Recent studies indicate an ectopic up-regulation in tumor cells that may favor their escape from antitumor immune responses. The role of HLA-G in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) has not been defined. HLA-G expression was studied retrospectively in circulating B-CLL cells from 47 patients by flow cytometry using the anti-HLA-E specific monoclonal antibody MEM/G9. The proportion of leukemic cells expressing HLA-G varied from 1% to 54%. Patients with 23% or fewer HLA-G-positive cells (according to receiver operating characteristics [ROC] analysis; designated as HLA-G-negative group) had a significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) time than patients with more than 23% positive cells (median PFS: 120 versus 23 months; P = .0001). In multivariate analysis, HLA-G expression (hazard ratio: 4.8; P = .002) was an even better independent prognostic factor than the zeta-associated protein 70 (ZAP-70) or CD38 status. Humoral and cellular immunosuppression were significantly more prominent in the HLA-G-positive compared with the HLA-G-negative patient group. In B-CLL, the level of HLA-G expression is correlated with the degree of immunosuppression and prognosis. HLA-G may contribute to the impairment of immune responses against tumor cells and infections. Thus, these findings need to be confirmed in a prospective study.","['Nuckel, Holger', 'Rebmann, Vera', 'Durig, Jan', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Grosse-Wilde, Hans']","['Nuckel H', 'Rebmann V', 'Durig J', 'Duhrsen U', 'Grosse-Wilde H']","['Department of Hematology, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany. holger.nueckel@uniessen.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/*biosynthesis/blood', 'HLA-G Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*immunology/pathology', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/statistics & numerical data', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphopenia/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",2004/10/07 09:00,2005/03/04 09:00,['2004/10/07 09:00'],"['2004/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)45897-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-08-3335 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Feb 15;105(4):1694-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-08-3335.

The most commonly represented IGHV genes mirrored the usage of normal B cells, with the exception of IGHV1-18, IGHV3-30.3, and IGHV4-59 that were underrepresented. The IGHV3-21 gene, frequently expressed in Northern European CLL, was present only in 16 cases (2.9%). Based on HCDR3 cluster analysis, cases using IGHV3-21 could be grouped in 2 subsets of similar frequency. The first one (7 of 16 cases) carried a similar HCDR3 amino acid sequence (common-HCDR3 subset), virtually identical to the Scandinavian IGHV3-21 CLL. These cases used the IGHJ6 gene; 4 of 7 were unmutated; 6 of 7 carried the V(lambda)2-14 (IGLV3-21) light-chain gene with a similar LCDR3. All expressed CD38 and had a progressive disease. The second subset (9 of 16) was characterized by heterogeneous HCDR3 rearrangements (nonhomogeneous-HCDR3 subset), diverse IGHJ and IGV light-chain gene usage, variable IGHV mutational status (5 of 9 unmutated), variable CD38 expression, and variable clinical course (4 of 9 progressed). The first subset suggests a potential antigenic element rarely encountered in the Mediterranean area, possibly responsible for a negative outcome.

Tax activates transcription from the long terminal repeat (LTR) of HTLV-I through association with cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). Here, we present evidence that transducer of regulated cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein 3 (TORC3), a co-activator of CREB, is involved in Tax-induced transcriptional activation from the HTLV-I LTR. By using a luciferase assay system, we show that TORC3 alone can enhance transcription from the HTLV-I LTR, as well as from a cellular cyclic AMP-response element (CRE). Interestingly, we find that co-expression of TORC3 and Tax dramatically increased transcriptional activation at the HTLV-I LTR. We also show by glutathione S-transferase pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation experiments that TORC3 interacts with Tax. Using deletion mutant analysis, we identify the Tax interaction domain of TORC3 as a region spanning from amino acid 1 to 103, which contains a coiled-coil domain. These results provide important clues toward understanding the molecular mechanism of Tax-dependent transcriptional activation of the HTLV-I LTR.","['Koga, Hiroshi', 'Ohshima, Takayuki', 'Shimotohno, Kunitada']","['Koga H', 'Ohshima T', 'Shimotohno K']","['Department of Viral Oncology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA Interference', 'Rats', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Trans-Activators/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2004/10/07 09:00,2005/02/05 09:00,['2004/10/07 09:00'],"['2004/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(18)81930-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M409021200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Dec 17;279(51):52978-83. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M409021200.

Recent studies with mice showed that Foxp3, which encodes the transcription factor Scurfin, is a master regulatory gene for the development and function of CD25(+)CD4(+) regulatory T cells. Here we examined the role of FOXP3 in human CD25(+)CD4(+) regulatory T cells. The FOXP3 gene and its protein product were preferentially expressed in peripheral CD25(+)CD4(+) T cells, in particular CD25(+)CD45RO(+)CD4(+) T cells in normal individuals and, interestingly, in some human T cell leukemia virus type 1-infected T cell lines, which constitutively express CD25. TCR stimulation of CD25(-)CD45RO(-)CD4(+) naive T cells failed to elicit FOXP3 expression at the gene or protein level. Ex vivo retroviral gene transfer of FOXP3, on the other hand, converted peripheral CD25(-)CD45RO(-)CD4(+) naive T cells into a regulatory T cell phenotype similar to CD25(+)CD4(+) regulatory T cells. For example, FOXP3-transduced T cells exhibited impaired proliferation and production of cytokines including IL-2 and IL-10 upon TCR stimulation, up-regulated the expression of regulatory T cell-associated molecules such as CD25 and CTL-associated antigen-4 and suppressed in vitro proliferation of other T cells in a cell-cell contact-dependent manner. Thus, human FOXP3 is a crucial regulatory gene for the development and function of CD25(+)CD4(+) regulatory T cells, and can be used as their reliable marker. Furthermore, regulatory T cells de novo produced from normal naive T cells by FOXP3 transduction can be instrumental for treatment of autoimmune/inflammatory diseases and negative control of various immune responses.","['Yagi, Haruhiko', 'Nomura, Takashi', 'Nakamura, Kyoko', 'Yamazaki, Sayuri', 'Kitawaki, Toshio', 'Hori, Shohei', 'Maeda, Michiyuki', 'Onodera, Masafumi', 'Uchiyama, Takashi', 'Fujii, Shingo', 'Sakaguchi, Shimon']","['Yagi H', 'Nomura T', 'Nakamura K', 'Yamazaki S', 'Kitawaki T', 'Hori S', 'Maeda M', 'Onodera M', 'Uchiyama T', 'Fujii S', 'Sakaguchi S']","['Department of Experimental Pathology, Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, 53 Shogoin Kawahara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,IM,"['Autoimmune Diseases/genetics/immunology/therapy', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics/immunology', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2004/10/07 09:00,2005/03/25 09:00,['2004/10/07 09:00'],"['2004/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['dxh165 [pii]', '10.1093/intimm/dxh165 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 2004 Nov;16(11):1643-56. doi: 10.1093/intimm/dxh165.

In spite of similar binding at the cell surface, WGA was found to promote cell death to a different extent in Molt3, K562 and PBMC and to induce different death events leading to apoptosis in Molt3 and either apoptosis and necrosis in K562 cells and PBMC. In Molt3 but not in K562 cells, WGA cytotoxicity could be potentiated 66-200 fold by 50 nM monensin, a carboxylic ionophore that perturbs the intracellular trafficking of endocytosed molecules. Synergism between the cytotoxic activities of WGA and monensin was demonstrated in Molt3 cells by comparing non toxic, or slightly toxic, doses of WGA and monensin alone or in combination. These results show that the cytotoxic effect of WGA is dependent on internalisation events which may differ among the cell lines used. WGA and monensin can enter the human diet being a component of wheat germ and an antibiotic used for zootechnic reasons in the bioindustry, respectively. These data reveal the synergistic effect between two dietary molecules, otherwise per se toxic at much higher concentrations, with possible implications for human and animal health.","['Dalla Pellegrina, Chiara', 'Matucci, Andrea', 'Zoccatelli, Gianni', 'Rizzi, Corrado', 'Vincenzi, Simone', 'Veneri, Gianluca', 'Andrighetto, Giancarlo', 'Peruffo, Angelo D B', 'Chignola, Roberto']","['Dalla Pellegrina C', 'Matucci A', 'Zoccatelli G', 'Rizzi C', 'Vincenzi S', 'Veneri G', 'Andrighetto G', 'Peruffo AD', 'Chignola R']","[""Dipartimento Scientifico e Tecnologico, Universita' di Verona, Strada Le Grazie, 15, 37134 Verona, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,IM,"['Antifungal Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Monensin/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wheat Germ Agglutinins/*toxicity']",2004/10/07 09:00,2005/02/26 09:00,['2004/10/07 09:00'],"['2003/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0887233304000852 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2004.04.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2004 Dec;18(6):821-7. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2004.04.008.,,,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Wheat Germ Agglutinins)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fraction A was composed of xylose, xylooligosaccharides and water-soluble lignin, determined by high-performance anion exchange chromatography and spectrophotometry. Fraction B was composed of glucose and celooligosaccharides. It was found that Fraction B expressed a negligible cytotoxic effect against leukemia cells, while Fraction A reduced markedly (in a dose-dependent manner) the viability of leukemia cell lines, derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)--Jurkat and MOLT-4. Fraction A did not influence the viability of leukemia cells, derived from myelogenous leukemia (ML-2) or lymphoma (SupT-1), as well as the viability of normal lymphocytes. Furthermore, microscopic examination of ALL-derived cells treated with Fraction A showed typical apoptotic morphological changes such as a condensation of nucleus and membrane blebing, as well as phosphatidylserine (PSer) exposure on the cell surface. The effect of decomposed products of commercially available xylan against ALL-derived Jurkat cells was significantly lower than that of Fraction A. These results suggest that the cytotoxic effect of Fraction A may be attributed to apoptosis, induced by xylooligosaccharides and it is specific for ALL-derived cells. We speculate that the water-soluble lignin is an important factor, potentiating the cytotoxic effect of xylan in HCW-extracts from bamboo.","['Ando, Hiroki', 'Ohba, Hideki', 'Sakaki, Tsuyoshi', 'Takamine, Kazunori', 'Kamino, Yoshitaka', 'Moriwaki, Sawako', 'Bakalova, Rumiana', 'Uemura, Yoshimitsu', 'Hatate, Yasuo']","['Ando H', 'Ohba H', 'Sakaki T', 'Takamine K', 'Kamino Y', 'Moriwaki S', 'Bakalova R', 'Uemura Y', 'Hatate Y']","['Kagoshima Prefecture Institute of Industrial Technology, 1445-1 Oda Hayato-cho, Aira, Kagoshima 899-5105, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Lignin/pharmacology', 'Oligosaccharides/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Pressure', 'Sasa/*chemistry', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Water/chemistry']",2004/10/07 09:00,2005/02/26 09:00,['2004/10/07 09:00'],"['2003/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0887233304000463 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2004.03.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2004 Dec;18(6):765-71. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2004.03.011.,,,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '9005-53-2 (Lignin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach to gene selection and classification using the logistic regression model. The basic idea of our approach is in conjunction with a logistic regression model to relate the gene expression with the class labels. We use Gibbs sampling and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to discover important genes. To implement Gibbs Sampler and MCMC search, we derive a posterior distribution of selected genes given the observed data. After the important genes are identified, the same logistic regression model is then used for cancer classification and prediction. Issues for efficient implementation for the proposed method are discussed. The proposed method is evaluated against several large microarray data sets, including hereditary breast cancer, small round blue-cell tumors, and acute leukemia. The results show that the method can effectively identify important genes consistent with the known biological findings while the accuracy of the classification is also high. Finally, the robustness and sensitivity properties of the proposed method are also investigated.","['Zhou, Xiaobo', 'Liu, Kuang-Yu', 'Wong, Stephen T C']","['Zhou X', 'Liu KY', 'Wong ST']","['Harvard Center for Neurodegeneration and Repair, Center for Bioinformatics, Harvard Medical School, 220 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",United States,J Biomed Inform,Journal of biomedical informatics,100970413,IM,"['*Algorithms', '*Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Genetic Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms/classification/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated/*methods', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted']",2004/10/07 09:00,2005/03/09 09:00,['2004/10/07 09:00'],"['2004/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1532-0464(04)00077-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jbi.2004.07.009 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biomed Inform. 2004 Aug;37(4):249-59. doi: 10.1016/j.jbi.2004.07.009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: In a prospective inpatient study conducted from July 1994 to August 1997, 220 patients aged 16-65 years received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for hematologic cancer at a single institution. Patients were assessed at hospital admission and then on a weekly basis during hospitalization until discharge or death. RESULTS: Internal consistency reliability and test-retest reliability of the tested scales were adequate. Convergent, divergent, criterion, and predictive validities as well as responsiveness to change of our scales were demonstrated by significant associations with their tested constructs.

Recent studies indicate that one member of the Rab family, Rab27A, regulates the transport of lysosome-related organelles, such as melanosome distribution in melanocytes, lytic granule release in cytotoxic T cells, and dense granule release in platelets. Here, we have examined the involvement of Rab27A in the exocytic transport of another lysosome-related organelle, the basophilic secretory granule, in basophils. We have found that Rab27A locates on basophilic secretory granules containing histamine in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) 2H3 cells. In addition, exogenous expression of dominant active Rab27A reduces antigen-induced histamine release from the cells. We have moreover identified Munc13-4 as a Rab27A target using a CytoTrap system and found that exogenous expression of Munc13-4 affects antigen-induced histamine release from RBL-2H3 cells. These results demonstrate that Rab27A plays a crucial role in antigen-induced histamine release from RBL-2H3 cells.","['Goishi, Keiichi', 'Mizuno, Kouichi', 'Nakanishi, Hideki', 'Sasaki, Takuya']","['Goishi K', 'Mizuno K', 'Nakanishi H', 'Sasaki T']","['Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Health Biosciences, The University of Tokushima Graduate School, Tokushima 770-8503, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Exocytosis/*physiology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Histamine/metabolism', '*Histamine Release', '*Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Secretory Vesicles/chemistry/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'rab GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'rab27 GTP-Binding Proteins']",2004/10/07 09:00,2004/12/29 09:00,['2004/10/07 09:00'],"['2004/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(04)02089-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.09.050 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2004 Nov 5;324(1):294-301. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.09.050.,,,"['0 (Proteins)', '0 (Unc13d protein, rat)', '0 (rab27 GTP-Binding Proteins)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'EC 3.6.1.-.

The in vitro experiments showed that the intracellular accumulation of pazufloxacin in adriamycin-resistant human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells (K562/ADR) overexpressing P-glycoprotein was significantly lower than that in human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells (K562/S) not expressing P-glycoprotein. When rats received an intravenous injection of pazufloxacin in combination with or without cyclosporine, cyclosporine significantly delayed the disappearance of pazufloxacin from plasma and decreased the systemic clearance and volume of distribution at steady state of pazufloxacin to 50% and 70% of the corresponding control values, respectively. Renal handling experiments revealed that the renal clearance of pazufloxacin was 75% of that corresponding to the systemic clearance, suggesting that the main route of pazufloxacin elimination is the kidney. Cyclosporine significantly increased the steady-state concentration of pazufloxacin in plasma by decreasing the tubular secretion clearance and glomerular filtration rate. These results suggest the possibility that pazufloxacin is excreted into the urine via P-glycoprotein. No significant differences in the renal and tubular secretion clearances of pazufloxacin were observed between normal rats and Eisai hyperbilirubinemic rats (EHBR), which have a hereditary deficiency in Mrp2, indicating the lack of the involvement of Mrp2 in the renal excretion of pazufloxacin. Sparfloxacin, a P-glycoprotein substrate, also significantly decreased the renal and tubular secretion clearances of pazufloxacin, suggesting that pazufloxacin and sparfloxacin share the same transporters, including P-glycoprotein. The present study at least suggests that pazufloxacin is excreted into the urine via P-glycoprotein and some active drug transporters other than Mrp2.","['Shimizu, Akemi', 'Miyoshi, Mika', 'Sugie, Masami', 'Ueyama, Jun', 'Yamaguchi, Takuji', 'Sasaki, Toshinobu', 'Takagi, Kenzo', 'Jin, Mingji', 'Miyamoto, Ken-Ichi', 'Tsuji, Akira', 'Hasegawa, Takaaki']","['Shimizu A', 'Miyoshi M', 'Sugie M', 'Ueyama J', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Sasaki T', 'Takagi K', 'Jin M', 'Miyamoto K', 'Tsuji A', 'Hasegawa T']","['Department of Medical Technology, Nagoya University School of Health Sciences, 1-1-20 Daikominami, Higashi-ku, Nagoya 461-8673, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*physiology/urine', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fluoroquinolones/chemistry/*pharmacology/*urine', 'Kidney/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Oxazines/chemistry/*pharmacology/*urine', 'Rats', 'Rats, Mutant Strains', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",2004/10/07 09:00,2005/03/05 09:00,['2004/10/07 09:00'],"['2004/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2004/07/26 00:00 [revised]', '2004/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-2999(04)00924-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2004.08.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2004 Oct 6;501(1-3):151-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2004.08.013.,,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Fluoroquinolones)', '0 (Oxazines)', '4CZ1R38NDI (pazufloxacin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to better understand the mechanisms associated with this period, we aimed at analyzing simultaneously three parameters: B-lymphocytosis, cell proliferation and viral replication. RESULTS: Sheep were experimentally infected either with a wild type BLV provirus or with selected mutants among which: a virus harboring an optimalized LTR promoter with consensus cyclic AMP-responsive elements, two deletants of the R3 or the G4 accessory genes and a fusion-deficient transmembrane recombinant. Seroconversion, as revealed by the onset of an anti-viral antibody response, was detected at 3 to 11 weeks after inoculation. At seroconversion, all sheep exhibited a marked increase in the numbers of circulating B lymphocytes expressing the CD5 and CD11b cluster of differentiation markers and, interestingly, this phenomenon occurred independently of the type of virus. The net increase of the absolute number of B cells was at least partially due to accelerated proliferation as revealed, after intravenous injection of bromodeoxyuridine, by the higher proportion of circulating BrdU+ B lymphocytes. BLV proviral DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in the leucocytes of all sheep, as expected. However, at seroconversion, the proviral loads were lower in sheep infected by the attenuated proviruses despite similar levels of B cell lymphocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the proviral loads are not directly linked to the extent of B cell proliferation observed during primo-infection of BLV-infected sheep. We propose a model of opportunistic replication of the virus supported by a general activation process of B lymphocytes.","['Debacq, Christophe', 'Sanchez Alcaraz, Maria Teresa', 'Mortreux, Franck', 'Kerkhofs, Pierre', 'Kettmann, Richard', 'Willems, Luc']","['Debacq C', 'Sanchez Alcaraz MT', 'Mortreux F', 'Kerkhofs P', 'Kettmann R', 'Willems L']","['Molecular and cellular biology, FUSAGx, Gembloux, Belgium. debacq.c@fsagx.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/prevention & control', 'Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Plasmids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proviruses', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds', 'Sheep/immunology', 'Sheep Diseases/virology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Viral Load/*veterinary']",2004/10/07 09:00,2006/08/01 09:00,['2004/10/07 09:00'],"['2004/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2004/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-1-31 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-1-31 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2004 Oct 5;1:31. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-1-31.,,20041005,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds)', 'MR86K0XRQP (1,2-dioleoyloxy-3-(trimethylammonium)propane)']",,,PMC526217,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of genetic polymorphisms in modulating CS function, and hence in disease susceptibility, has been extensively analyzed. Their impact on therapeutic response still remains to be explored. The role of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 in corticosteroid metabolism, and that of the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) in regulation of responsive genes, renders CYP3A4 and NR3C1 polymorphisms as potential candidates for pharmacogenetic analysis. AIM: The aim of the study was to analyze the role of these polymorphisms in the outcome of a disease treated with CS drugs. METHODS: Towards this aim we analyzed the CYP3A4-290A/G substitution and three NR3C1 polymorphisms (200G/A, 1220A/G and BclI RFLP) in 222 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) whose treatment protocols, among other components, contained corticosteroid drugs. RESULTS: The analysis of survival probabilities in relation to the indicated genotypes showed only an association between homozygosity for allele G of the NR3C1 BclI RFLP polymorphism and overall survival (univariate and multivariate hazard ratio [HR] 2.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0, 7.6 and 5.2, 95% CI 1.4, 18.9, respectively). The association reflects a correlation with disease progression and prognosis, and may vary depending on risk of relapse. CONCLUSION: A reduction in survival probability in children with ALL was associated with homozygosity for G allele of the NR3C1BclI RFLP polymorphism, particularly in certain patient subgroups. Further analysis is required to replicate this finding and to understand the mechanism underlying the observed association.","['Fleury, Isabelle', 'Primeau, Melanie', 'Doreau, Agnes', 'Costea, Irina', 'Moghrabi, Albert', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Krajinovic, Maja']","['Fleury I', 'Primeau M', 'Doreau A', 'Costea I', 'Moghrabi A', 'Sinnett D', 'Krajinovic M']","['Research Center, Sainte-Justine Hospital, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Mere-Enfant, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",New Zealand,Am J Pharmacogenomics,American journal of pharmacogenomics : genomics-related research in drug development and clinical practice,100967746,IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Probability', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*genetics', 'Survival Rate']",2004/10/07 09:00,2004/12/30 09:00,['2004/10/07 09:00'],"['2004/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/30 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['456 [pii]', '10.2165/00129785-200404050-00006 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pharmacogenomics. 2004;4(5):331-41. doi: 10.2165/00129785-200404050-00006.,,,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 1.14.14.55 (CYP3A4 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was suggested that antineutrophil autoantibodies might be involved in the pathogenesis of neutrocytopenia; however, the role of autoantibodies against neutrophil precursors and their specific target autoantigen(s) remained further characterized. The objective was to investigate the target antigens and clinical associations of autoantibodies against neutrophils and neutrophil precursors in patients with SLE. Sera were collected from 92 patients with SLE and renal biopsy proven lupus nephritis. Cell lysates of peripheral neutrophils (as mature neutrophils) from a normal blood donor and white blood cells from a patient with blast crisis of chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL) (as neutrophil precursors) were used as antigens in Western blot analysis to detect autoantibodies in sera from patients with SLE. The clinical significance of antineutrophil autoantibodies that recognized different antigens were further analysed. Using normal peripheral neutrophils as antigens, two bands could be blotted: 64 kD (33/92, 35.9%) and 50 kD (13/92, 14.1%). The prevalence of anti-64 kD autoantibody in patients with positive rheumatic factor was significantly higher than that in patients without (54.5 versus 18.8%, P < 0.05). Using CGL white cells as antigen, five bands could be blotted: 60 kD (34/92, 37.0%), 50 kD (32/92, 34.8%), 29 kD (27/92, 29.3%), 42 kD (19/92, 20.7%) and 18 kD (16/92, 17.4%). The prevalence of anti-60 kD autoantibody was significantly higher in patients with neutrocytopenia than that in patients without neutrocytopenia (100 versus 48.3%, P < 0.01). The prevalence of anti-29 kD autoantibody was significantly higher in patients with alopecia than that in patients without alopecia (45.8 versus 20.8%, P < 0.05). Furthermore, the prevalences of anti-60 kD, anti-50 kD and anti-42 kD autoantibodies were significantly higher in patients with anti-Ro autoantibody than those in patients without; the prevalences of anti-29 kD and anti-18 kD autoantibodies were significantly higher in patients with anti-Sm autoantibody than those in patients without.

Improved survival requires new strategies to prevent relapse. Molecular targeting therapies are remarkably specific and have been demonstrated to cause no gross systemic toxicity. Molecular targeting drugs for leukemia such as all-trans retinoic acid and imatinib are presently being used in clinical settings, and many other molecular targeting drugs are being evaluated in phase I/II clinical trials.

In an attempt to prepare a carrier system to minimize the toxicity of this drug, the aim of this study is to prepare and characterize liposomes encapsulating arsenic trioxide (ATO). For this, we prepared different types of liposomes entrapping ATO: large multilamellar (MLV), sonicated (SUV) and dried reconstituted vesicles (DRV). The techniques used were: thin film hydration, sonication and the DRV method, respectively. Two lipid compositions were studied for each liposome type, EggPC/Chol (1:1) and DSPC/Chol (1:1). After liposome preparation, drug encapsulation was evaluated by measuring arsenic in liposomes. For this, energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy or atomic absorption was used. In addition, the retention of the drug in the liposomes was evaluated after incubating the liposomes in buffer at 37 degrees C. The experimental results reveal that encapsulation of ATO in liposomes ranges between 0.003 and 0.506 mol/ mol of lipid, and is highest in the DRV vesicles and lowest in the small unilamellar vesicles, as anticipated. Considering the in vitro stability of ATO-encapsulating liposomes: 1) For the PC/Chol liposomes (DRV and MLV), after 24 hours of incubation, more than 70% (or 90% in some cases) of the initially encapsulated amount of ATO was released. 2) The liposomes composed of DSPC/Chol could retain substantially higher amounts of ATO, especially the DRV liposomes (54% retained after 24 h). 3) In the case of PC/Chol, temperature of incubation has no effect on the ATO release after 24 hours, but affects the rate of ATO release in the MLV liposomes, while for the DSPC/Chol liposomes there is a slight increase (statistically insignificant) of ATO release at higher temperature.","['Kallinteri, Paraskevi', 'Fatouros, Dimitrios', 'Klepetsanis, Pavlos', 'Antimisiaris, Sophia G']","['Kallinteri P', 'Fatouros D', 'Klepetsanis P', 'Antimisiaris SG']","['Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Technology, Department of Pharmacy, University of Patras, Rio, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",England,J Liposome Res,Journal of liposome research,9001952,IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Capsules', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Drug Carriers', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Stability', 'Kinetics', 'Lipids/chemistry', '*Liposomes', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', 'Sonication']",2004/10/06 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/06 09:00'],"['2004/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['120039661 [pii]', '10.1081/lpr-120039661 [doi]']",ppublish,J Liposome Res. 2004;14(1-2):27-38. doi: 10.1081/lpr-120039661.,,,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Capsules)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These membrane domains are characterized by detergent insolubility at low temperatures and low buoyant density. Human CD38 is the prototype of a gene family encoding surface molecules endowed with multiple functional activities. The endocytosis of the human CD38 molecule has been investigated in normal lymphocytes and in a number of leukemia- and lymphoma-derived cell lines demonstrating that internalization after CD38 ligation is a reproducible event involving only a fraction of the whole amount of the surface molecule. This study reports the results obtained by conventional, confocal, and electron microscopy on the effects induced by the engagement of the molecule with agonistic mAb, reproducing the signals mediated by its natural ligand. The results demonstrate that the endocytosis induced as consequence of CD38 ligation is preceded by a thorough rearrangement of the cell surface with formation of glycosphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich plasma membrane microdomains. These data suggest that specialized raft microdomains might be the plasma membrane structure through which CD38 translocates at intracellular level.

The clinical scenario quickly became highly suggestive of leukemia cutis, given the infant's extremely high white blood cell count. Further examination revealed trisomy 21 in the leukemic cells and disomy 21 in the buccal keratinocytes, and a diagnosis of self-resolving TMD was made. Biopsy specimens of the lesions showed a sparse, perivascular, atypical, mononuclear infiltrate.

We report our observations in a series of 69 patients less than 20 years of age who presented either with primary cutaneous lymphoma (n = 62) or with secondary manifestations of extracutaneous disease (n = 7). Clinicopathologic features permitted classification of the cases into the following diagnostic categories: mycosis fungoides (n = 24, all primary cutaneous), anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma (n = 13, all primary cutaneous), LYP (n = 11, all primary cutaneous), subcutaneous ""panniculitis-like"" T-cell lymphoma (n = 1, primary cutaneous), small-medium pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma (n = 2, all primary cutaneous), natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma, nasal-type (n = 1, secondary cutaneous), follicle center cell lymphoma (n = 1, primary cutaneous), marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (n = 7, all primary cutaneous), B-lymphoblastic lymphomas (n = 6, 3 primary and 3 secondary cutaneous), specific cutaneous manifestations of Hodgkin disease (n = 1, secondary cutaneous), and acute myeloid leukemia (n = 2, both secondary cutaneous). Cutaneous lymphoma in children should be differentiated from benign skin disorders that may simulate them. In particular, mycosis fungoides and LYP in this age group may present with clinicopathologic features reminiscent of inflammatory disorders such as pityriasis alba, vitiligo, pityriasis rosea, and pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta. Even in secondary cutaneous lymphomas, skin manifestations may be the first sign of the systemic disease, and a diagnosis may be achieved on examination of histopathologic specimens of a cutaneous lesion. Our study illustrates the wide spectrum of cutaneous lymphomas and leukemias in patients less than 20 years of age and underlines the need for proper interpretation of these lesions by dermatologists and dermatopathologists.","['Fink-Puches, Regina', 'Chott, Andreas', 'Ardigo, Marco', 'Simonitsch, Ingrid', 'Ferrara, Gerardo', 'Kerl, Helmut', 'Cerroni, Lorenzo']","['Fink-Puches R', 'Chott A', 'Ardigo M', 'Simonitsch I', 'Ferrara G', 'Kerl H', 'Cerroni L']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Graz, Graz, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Dermatol,Pediatric dermatology,8406799,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Austria/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*classification/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Medical Records', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/*classification/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology']",2004/10/06 09:00,2005/01/26 09:00,['2004/10/06 09:00'],"['2004/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['PDE21500 [pii]', '10.1111/j.0736-8046.2004.21500.x [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Dermatol. 2004 Sep-Oct;21(5):525-33. doi: 10.1111/j.0736-8046.2004.21500.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In PTCL, bone marrow biopsy is performed to establish the diagnosis, rule out other pathology, assess the extent of disease and monitor treatment response. The frequency and histology of bone marrow involvement varies greatly between different clinicopathological entities recognized by the World Health Organisation (WHO) classification, reflecting the differences in the underlying biology. Some lymphomas, such as angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, show nodular and/or interstitial pattern of infiltration with accompanying reactive changes. Others, including hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma and large granular lymphocyte leukaemia, are characterized by intrasinusoidal infiltration. In many instances the pathological features are subtle and immunohistochemical and molecular studies are required for the diagnosis. Histological appearances may overlap with a variety of reactive T-cell proliferations and other malignancies. Furthermore PTCL frequently induce secondary changes in the marrow that may obscure the neoplastic infiltrate. The diagnosis often requires critical integration of the information obtained from clinical features, peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy findings. In this article we review the histopathology of bone marrow biopsy in PTCL within the context of the new WHO classification.","['Dogan, Ahmet', 'Morice, William G']","['Dogan A', 'Morice WG']","['Department of Histopathology, University College London, London, UK. a.dogan@ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/*pathology']",2004/10/06 09:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/06 09:00'],"['2004/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5144 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05144.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Oct;127(2):140-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05144.x.,,,,,92,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Semiquantitative RT-PCR was employed to study the MOST-1 mRNA expression in BM mononuclear cells separated by Ficoll density gradient method. The MOST-1 expression levels were represented by the ratio of MOST-1 band pixels against its corresponding housekeeping gene beta-actin mRNA band pixels determined by GDS8000 densitometry and GelWork-1 analysis software. The PCR product was eluted and sequenced, and its sequence was confirmed by Pairwise BLAST search. RESULTS: A total of 17 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were studied. MOST-1 mRNA was exclusively expressed in the mononuclear cells from 3 patients with ALL-L3 type. However, there was no MOST-1 mRNA expression in other 14 children with ALL-L1 or ALL-L2, irrespective of their initial peripheral WBC count and blast cell percentage in peripheral blood and bone marrow. The MOST-1 mRNA expression levels in two of the ALL-L3 patients with higher blast cell percentages in peripheral blood and bone marrow were 3- and 2-fold respectively as compared with that in the third ALL-L3 child with lower initial blast cell load. MOST-1 mRNA expression was no longer detected in the two ALL-L3 children after complete remission with combination chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: MOST-1 was expressed in the bone marrow mononuclear cells in patients with ALL-L3, and its expression level was somewhat related to tumor cell burden. It might be implicated in the leukemogenesis of ALL-L3 and might serve as an indicator of tumor burden and thus a useful guide for clinical management.","['Gao, Ju', 'Yuan, Li-xing', 'Sun, Lei', 'Li, Xin-xiao', 'Liao, Qing-kui']","['Gao J', 'Yuan LX', 'Sun L', 'Li XX', 'Liao QK']","['Department of Pediatrics, West China Second Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Sichuan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Sichuan da xue xue bao.

Transfection of glioma cell lines with FMG expression constructs results in fusion with massive syncytia formation followed by cytotoxic cell death. Nevertheless, ubiquitous expression of the GALV receptor, Pit-1, makes targeting desirable in order to increase the specificity of the observed cytopathic effect. Here we report on use of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-cleavable linkers to target the cytotoxicity of FMG-expressing adenoviral vectors against gliomas. METHODS: Replication-defective adenoviruses (Ad) were constructed expressing the hyperfusogenic version of the GALV glycoprotein linked to a blocking ligand (C-terminal extracellular domain of CD40 ligand) through either an MMP-cleavable linker (AdM40) or a non-cleavable linker (AdN40). Both viruses also co-expressed the green fluorescent protein (GFP) via an internal ribosomal entry site. RESULTS: The glioma cell lines U87, U118, and U251 characterized by zymography and MMP-2 activity assay as high, medium and low MMP expressors, respectively, the MMP-poor cell lines TE671 and normal human astrocytes were infected with AdM40 and AdN40 at different multiplicities of infection (MOIs) from 1-30. Fusion was quantitated by counting both number and size of syncytia. Infection of these cell lines with AdN40 did not result in fusion or cytotoxic cell death, despite the presence of infection, as demonstrated by GFP positivity, therefore indicating that the displayed CD40 ligand blocked GALV-induced fusion. Fusion was restored after infection of glioma cells with AdM40 at an MOI as low as 1 to an extent dependent on MMP expression and coxsackie adenovirus receptor (CAR) expression in the specific cell line. Western immunoblotting demonstrated the presence of the cleaved CD40 ligand in the supernatant of fused glioma cells. Use of the MMP inhibitors 1,10 phenanthroline and N-hydroxy-5,5-dimethylpiperazine-2-carboxamide completely abolished AdM40-induced fusion, while the non-specific serine protease inhibitor soybean trypsin inhibitor did not affect it, thus demonstrating specificity of the observed effect. Intratumoral treatment of BalbC/nude mice bearing subcutaneous U87 glioma xenografts with AdM40 at a total dose of 1.2 x 10(10) plaque-forming units (pfu) resulted in statistically significant tumor regression as compared with control animals either treated with AdN40 (p = 0.01) or untreated animals (p = 0.01). Treatment with AdM40 also resulted in survival improvement as compared with AdN40-treated animals (p = 0.006) or untreated animals (p = 0.001). Histopathologic examination of treated tumors demonstrated extensive syncytia formation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that AdM40, a replication-defective adenovirus expressing the GALV fusogenic glycoprotein, attached to a blocking ligand via an MMP-cleavable linker, can target the cytotoxicity of GALV in MMP-overexpressing glioma lines and xenografts, and maintain significant antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo. Given the high frequency of MMP overexpression in gliomas, AdM40 represents a potentially promising agent in the gene therapy of these tumors.","['Allen, Cory', 'McDonald, Cari', 'Giannini, Caterina', 'Peng, Kah Whye', 'Rosales, Gabriela', 'Russell, Stephen J', 'Galanis, Evanthia']","['Allen C', 'McDonald C', 'Giannini C', 'Peng KW', 'Rosales G', 'Russell SJ', 'Galanis E']","['Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Size', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Giant Cells/pathology', 'Glioma/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/*genetics', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Viral Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2004/10/02 05:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2004/10/02 05:00'],"['2004/10/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/02 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.616 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2004 Nov;6(11):1216-27. doi: 10.1002/jgm.616.,['CA 84388-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These pathologic findings may simulate malignant disease and/or have implications on the already complicated management of patients with head and neck cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 202 consecutive patients with a preoperative diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), who underwent 307 neck dissections performed by a single surgeon and examined by a single pathologist. RESULTS: Ten patients had an unexpected finding. These included metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma, leukemia, lymphoma, Warthin's tumor, and tuberculosis. Two of three patients with benign-appearing thyroid tissue within lymph nodes received no further treatment, and both remained well beyond 6 years. Four patients succumbed to SCC; none died from the incidentally discovered pathologic findings. CONCLUSIONS: Unexpected pathologic findings may be present in more than 3% of neck dissections. Although this is usually indolent, with the underlying SCC remaining the main prognostic determinate, it may significantly complicate postoperative management.","['Sheahan, Patrick', 'Hafidh, Maky', 'Toner, Mary', 'Timon, Conrad']","['Sheahan P', 'Hafidh M', 'Toner M', 'Timon C']","['Department of Otolaryngology, St. James Hospital, 17 Hampton Square, Navan Road, Dublin 7, Ireland. sheahanp@eircom.net']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Head Neck,Head & neck,8902541,IM,"['Adenolymphoma/pathology/therapy', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Papillary/pathology/secondary/surgery', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*surgery', 'Cricoid Cartilage/pathology', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neck Dissection', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/pathology/secondary/surgery', 'Thyroidectomy', 'Tuberculosis, Lymph Node/drug therapy/pathology']",2004/10/02 05:00,2005/04/29 09:00,['2004/10/02 05:00'],"['2004/10/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/02 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hed.20110 [doi]'],ppublish,Head Neck. 2005 Jan;27(1):28-35. doi: 10.1002/hed.20110.,,,,"['Copyright 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-6 is a major survival factor for myeloma cells. Bcl-2 protein family regulates pathways to apoptosis that are activated upon growth factor deprivation. Pro-apoptotic proteins that have only a single Bcl-2 homology domain, BH3-only, are potent inducers of apoptosis. In myeloma cells, Mcl-1 has been shown to be a major anti-apoptotic protein that appears to regulate cell survival through the JAK/STAT pathway. In this study, we examined the regulation of the BH3-only protein Bim and its interaction with Mcl-1. The three major Bim isoforms are expressed in myeloma cells and are negatively regulated by IL-6. Blockade of IL-6 signaling induces an up-regulation of Bim concomitant to Mcl-1 down-regulation. Of major interest, Bim is found strongly associated with Mcl-1 in viable myeloma cells while this interaction is disrupted under apoptosis induction. Of note, while Bim is also found strongly associated to Bcl-2, this interaction is not changed under apoptosis induction. Thus, in myeloma cells, Mcl-1 neutralizes Bim through complex formation and therefore prevents apoptosis. Under apoptosis induction, the disappearance of Mcl-1 allows Bim to exercise its pro-apoptotic function and to activate Bax.","['Gomez-Bougie, Patricia', 'Bataille, Regis', 'Amiot, Martine']","['Gomez-Bougie P', 'Bataille R', 'Amiot M']","['INSERM, U601, Departement de Cancerologie LNC Label, Institut de Biologie, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/immunology', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic/immunology', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology']",2004/10/02 05:00,2004/12/22 09:00,['2004/10/02 05:00'],"['2004/10/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/02 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.200424981 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2004 Nov;34(11):3156-64. doi: 10.1002/eji.200424981.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined T-cell clonality and the antigen recognized by T cells from the inflamed synovium of patients with HAAP by using histology, a single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing. The SSCP analysis showed oligoclonal expansion of T cells in the synovium, suggesting an antigen-mediated stimulation. In contrast, there was less clonal expansion in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). The expression of HTLV-1 env and tax mRNA was detected in the affected synovium as well as in PBL. A number of T-cell clones in the synovium recognized HTLV-I env and tax proteins.

Junctional sequence analysis of synovial T cells showed a lack of highly conserved amino acid motifs in the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of HTLV-I env and tax reactive T cells, suggesting that these cells recognized multiple T-cell epitopes on HTLV-I antigen.

Here, we demonstrate that proliferation and TNFR2 expression was increased in human leukaemic TF-1 cells by granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-3 (IL-3), with TNFR1 expression unaffected. Consequently, they switch from a proliferative to a TNF-induced apoptotic phenotype. Raised TNFR2 expression and susceptibility to TNF-induced apoptosis was not a general effect of proliferation as IL-1beta and IFN-gamma both proliferated TF-1 cells with no effect on TNFR expression or apoptosis. Although raised TNFR2 expression correlated with the apoptotic phenotype, stimulation of apoptosis in GM-CSF-pretreated cells was mediated by TNFR1, with stimulation of TNFR2 alone insufficient to initiate cell death. However, TNFR2 did play a role in apoptotic and proliferative responses as they were blocked by the presence of an antagonistic TNFR2 antibody. Additionally, coincubation with cycloheximide blocked the mitotic effects of GM-CSF or IL-3, allowing only the apoptotic responses of TNF to persist. TNF life/death was also observed in K562, but not MOLT-4 and HL-60 human leukaemic cell types.

Af4 is mutated in the robotic mouse that is characterized by ataxia and Purkinje cell loss. To determine the molecular basis of this mutation, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen and show that Af4 binds the E3 ubiquitin ligases Drosophila seven in absentia (sina) homologues (Siah)-1a and Siah-2 in the brain. Siah-1a and Af4 are expressed in Purkinje cells and colocalize in the nucleus of human embryonic kidney 293T and P19 cells. In vitro binding assays and coimmunoprecipitation reveal a significant reduction in affinity between Siah-1a and robotic mutant Af4 compared with wild-type, which correlates with the almost complete abolition of mutant Af4 degradation by Siah-1a. These data strongly suggest that an accumulation of mutant Af4 occurs in the robotic mouse due to a reduction in its normal turnover by the proteasome. A significant increase in the transcriptional activity of mutant Af4 relative to wild-type was obtained in mammalian cells, suggesting that the activity of Af4 is controlled through Siah-mediated degradation. Another member of the Af4 family, Fmr2, which is involved in mental handicap in humans, binds Siah proteins in a similar manner. These results provide evidence that a common regulatory mechanism exists that controls levels of the Af4/Fmr2 protein family. The robotic mouse thus provides a unique opportunity to understand how these proteins play a role in disorders as diverse as leukemia, mental retardation, and neurodegenerative disease.","['Oliver, Peter L', 'Bitoun, Emmanuelle', 'Clark, Joanne', 'Jones, Emma L', 'Davies, Kay E']","['Oliver PL', 'Bitoun E', 'Clark J', 'Jones EL', 'Davies KE']","['Medical Research Council Functional Genetics Unit, Department of Human Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3QX, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Drosophila', 'Drosophila Proteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors', 'Transfection', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2004/10/02 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/02 05:00'],"['2004/10/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0406196101 [doi]', '0406196101 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Oct 12;101(41):14901-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0406196101.

In this study, we report on differential gene expression patterns that are characteristic for genetically defined B-CLL subtypes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred genetically well-characterized B-CLL samples, together with 11 healthy control samples, were analyzed using oligonucleotide arrays, which test for the expression of some 12,000 human genes. RESULTS: Aiming at microarray-based subclassification, class predictors were constructed using sets of differentially expressed genes, which yielded in zero or low misclassification rates. Furthermore, a significant number of the differentially expressed genes clustered in chromosomal regions affected by the respective genomic losses/gains. Deletions affecting chromosome bands 11q22-q23 and 17p13 led to a reduced expression of the corresponding genes, such as ATM and p53, while trisomy 12 resulted in the upregulation of genes mapping to chromosome arm 12q. Using an unsupervised analysis algorithm, expression profiling allowed partitioning into predominantly VH-mutated versus unmutated patient groups; however, association of the expression profile with the VH mutational status could only be detected in male patients. CONCLUSION: The finding that the most significantly differentially expressed genes are located in the corresponding aberrant chromosomal regions indicates that a gene dosage effect may exert a pathogenic role in B-CLL. The significant difference in the partitioning of male and female B-CLL samples suggests that the genomic signature for the VH mutational status might be sex-related.","['Haslinger, Christian', 'Schweifer, Norbert', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Lichter, Peter', 'Kraut, Norbert', 'Stratowa, Christian', 'Abseher, Roger']","['Haslinger C', 'Schweifer N', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Dohner H', 'Lichter P', 'Kraut N', 'Stratowa C', 'Abseher R']","['Department of Lead Discovery, Boehringer Ingelheim Austria, Dr Boehringer-Gasse 5-11, A-1121 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis']",2004/10/02 05:00,2004/10/23 09:00,['2004/10/02 05:00'],"['2004/10/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2004.12.133 [doi]', '22/19/3937 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2004 Oct 1;22(19):3937-49. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2004.12.133.,,,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Putative risk factors for osteonecrosis have included being female, white race, and older age. Our goal was to define possible genetic risk factors for osteonecrosis among children treated for newly diagnosed ALL. METHODS: Using a candidate gene approach, we determined the genotypes for 16 common polymorphisms in genes likely to affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of antileukemic medications in 64 children with ALL. Therapy included glucocorticoids and antifolates. Magnetic resonance imaging of both hips was used to diagnose osteonecrosis, and was performed at similar times from the start of ALL therapy (P =.61) in the 25 patients with and the 39 patients without osteonecrosis (median, 447 days and 443 days, respectively). RESULTS: In addition to age older than 10 years (odds ratio [OR], 24.2; P =.0001) and white race (OR, 11.1; P =.037), host factors for osteonecrosis included the vitamin D receptor FokI start site CC genotype (OR, 4.5; P =.045), and the thymidylate synthase low activity 2/2 enhancer repeat genotype (OR, 7.4; P =.049). CONCLUSION: Because folate-related and vitamin D-receptor genetic variants have been associated with bone and vasculature morbidity, these pharmacogenetic associations likely reflect the interaction of antileukemic medications with germline sensitivity to drug actions, and might identify ALL patients at highest risk to develop osteonecrosis.","['Relling, Mary V', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Das, Soma', 'Cook, Edwin H', 'Rosner, Gary L', 'Neel, Michael', 'Howard, Scott', 'Ribeiro, Raul', 'Sandlund, John T', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Kaste, Sue C']","['Relling MV', 'Yang W', 'Das S', 'Cook EH', 'Rosner GL', 'Neel M', 'Howard S', 'Ribeiro R', 'Sandlund JT', 'Pui CH', 'Kaste SC']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 N Lauderdale, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA. mary.relling@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Child', 'Female', '*Hip', 'Humans', 'Joint Diseases/etiology/*genetics', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Osteonecrosis/etiology/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Whites']",2004/10/02 05:00,2004/10/23 09:00,['2004/10/02 05:00'],"['2004/10/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2004.11.020 [doi]', '22/19/3930 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2004 Oct 1;22(19):3930-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2004.11.020.,"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM61374/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM61393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have demonstrated previously that TCL1 (a proto-oncogene underlying human T cell prolymphocytic leukemia) interacts with Akt and functions as an Akt kinase co-activator. With the aim to develop an Akt kinase inhibitor, we hypothesized that a peptide, which spans the Akt-binding site, binds to Akt and modulates Akt kinase activity and its downstream biological responses. Indeed, we demonstrated that a peptide, named ""Akt-in"" (Akt inhibitor, NH(2)-AVTDHPDRLWAWEKF-COOH, encompassing the betaA strand of human TCL1), interacted with Akt and specifically inhibited its kinase activity. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies suggested that interaction of Akt-in with the pleckstrin homology domain (PH) of Akt caused conformational changes on the variable loop 1 of Akt, the locus mediating phosphoinositide binding. Consistently, interaction of Akt-in with the Akt PH domain prevented phosphoinositide binding and hence inhibited membrane translocation and activation of Akt. Moreover, Akt-in inhibited not only cellular proliferation and anti-apoptosis in vitro but also in vivo tumor growth without any adverse effect. The roles of Akt, which possesses a PH domain, in intracellular signaling were well established. Hence, Akt inhibitors create an attractive target for anticancer therapy. However, no effective inhibitors specific for Akt have been developed. Akt-in, which inhibits association of phosphatidylinositol with Akt, is the first molecule to demonstrate specific Akt kinase inhibition potency.

We have previously identified a number of candidate genes localized in close proximity to a constitutional inv(5)(p13.1q13.3) breakpoint in one HCL patient. These included beta-hexosaminodase HEXB, frequently mutated in the lysosomal storage disorder Sandhoff disease. We now report that the 5q13.3 breakpoint disrupts a novel evolutionary conserved alternative isoform of HEXB. This isoform directly overlaps, in a cis-antisense fashion, exon 1 of the gene for ectodermal neuronal cortex 1 ENC-1, and was thus named ENC-1AS. ENC-1 has previously been shown to be overexpressed in several malignancies, and is believed to play a critical regulatory role in malignant transformation of various tumors. Importantly, subsequent analysis of ENC-1 in purified primary HCL tumor cells revealed a striking upregulation of ENC-1 in all 26 patients examined, compared with normal peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy donors. Upon further analysis of the ENC-1/ENC-1AS locus, we identified a complex 5' regulatory mechanism involving an inverse expression of the ENC-1 sense and the ENC-1AS transcripts in several tissues supporting the hypothesis that expression of ENC-1AS regulates ENC-1 levels. In addition, we have also found tissue-specific methylation of a 1.2 kb segment encompassing the overlapping ENC-1/ENC-1AS 5' exons, adding to the complexity of the regulation of this locus. Altogether, these results suggest that upregulation of ENC-1 contributes to the development of HCL and provides new information on the possible dysregulation of ENC-1 including expression of a novel antisense gene, ENC-1AS.","['Hammarsund, Marianne', 'Lerner, Mikael', 'Zhu, Chaoyong', 'Merup, Mats', 'Jansson, Monika', 'Gahrton, Gosta', 'Kluin-Nelemans, Hanneke', 'Einhorn, Stefan', 'Grander, Dan', 'Sangfelt, Olle', 'Corcoran, Martin']","['Hammarsund M', 'Lerner M', 'Zhu C', 'Merup M', 'Jansson M', 'Gahrton G', 'Kluin-Nelemans H', 'Einhorn S', 'Grander D', 'Sangfelt O', 'Corcoran M']","['Department of Oncology/Pathology, CCK, Karolinska Hopsital and Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'DNA Primers', 'Hexosaminidase B', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/enzymology/*genetics', 'Microfilament Proteins/*genetics', 'Neuropeptides/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/genetics']",2004/10/02 05:00,2005/03/22 09:00,['2004/10/02 05:00'],"['2004/10/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/hmg/ddh315 [doi]', 'ddh315 [pii]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2004 Dec 1;13(23):2925-36. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddh315.

The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene is an IFN-induced target that encodes a tumor suppressor protein. PML protein is typically localized within discrete speckled nuclear structures termed PML nuclear bodies (NBs). Multiple myeloma cells demonstrate differential responses to IFN treatment, the mechanism of which is largely unknown. Herein, we show that growth inhibition effects of IFN-alpha in myeloma cells correlate with PML NBs and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induction, whereas known IFN targets including signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1), STAT3, p38, and Daxx cannot account for these differential responses. RNAi silencing of PML blocks IFN-alpha-induced apoptosis in myeloma cells and correspondingly down-regulates TRAIL expression. Similarly, stable expression of a dominant negative TRAIL receptor DR5 partially blocks IFN-induced cell death. These results demonstrate that PML and TRAIL play important roles in IFN-induced apoptosis and identify TRAIL as a novel downstream transcriptional target of PML. Identification of PML and PML NBs as effectors of IFN responses provides insights into mechanisms by which tumor cells exhibit resistance to this class of agents and may prove useful in assessing treatment regimens.","['Crowder, Chun', 'Dahle, Oyvind', 'Davis, R Eric', 'Gabrielsen, Odd S', 'Rudikoff, Stuart']","['Crowder C', 'Dahle O', 'Davis RE', 'Gabrielsen OS', 'Rudikoff S']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2004/10/02 05:00,2005/04/22 09:00,['2004/10/02 05:00'],"['2004/10/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-04-1614 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)46822-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Feb 1;105(3):1280-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-04-1614.

We identified 32 different single-point mutations within the kinase domain of Bcr-Abl. The pattern and frequency of mutations in this cell culture-based screen resembled the pattern and frequency observed in resistant patients. We then applied this screen to an alternative Abl kinase inhibitor. Using PD166326, the frequency of resistant colonies emerging at 5 to 10 times the median growth inhibition (IC50) of PD166326 was significantly lower than with imatinib. In addition, PD166326 produced a distinct pattern of Bcr-Abl mutations. The majority of mutations that came up with both imatinib and PD166326 could effectively be suppressed by increasing the dose of PD166326 to 50 to 500 nM. In contrast, only a few mutations could be suppressed by increasing the imatinib dose to 5 to 10 microM.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cardiac involvement by transthoracic echocardiography in MPD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study groups were 36 patients (mean age: 58+/-15 years, 20 female and 16 male) with MPD and 30 age-matched healthy controls. MPD group included 15 essential thrombocythemia (ET), eight chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), seven idiopathic myelofibrosis (MF) and six polcythemia vera patients. RESULTS: Valvular regurgitations were present in 14 patients (39%) and eight controls (27%), (P>0.05). Mitral regurgitation (MR) was more prominent in CML compared to controls (P=0.044). The rates of annular calcifications, valvular thickening, and vegetation like lesions were not different between MPD and control groups. Pulmonary hypertension (PHT) was present in six (17%) patients, but none of the controls (P=0.021). The rates of PHT in CML and MF were significantly higher than controls (P<0.05). The rate of PHT was not different in-between MPD patients with and without thromboembolic events, however, in MPD cases with thromboembolic events PHT was more common compared to controls (P=0.037). CONCLUSION: This study showed that valvular lesions were not more prevalent in MPD.

This may be caused by indirect cytokine effects, but direct effects of infecting agents on the malignant cells are also possible because bacterial molecules can bind to specific receptors expressed by normal and malignant leukocytes. Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is a cell wall component of gram-positive bacteria, and it can activate normal immunocompetent cells through binding to specific cell membrane receptors. METHODS: We investigated effects of LTA derived from Enterococcus faecalis on in vitro cultured (i) normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC); (ii) remaining T cells derived from patients with hematologic malignancies and chemotherapy-induced leukopenia; and (iii) native human AML cells. RESULTS: Increased interleukin 1beta (IL1beta) and IL8 release by in vitro cultured normal PBMC was observed after stimulation with LTA at concentrations > or =5 microg/mL; these levels were lower than for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated cells and LTA antagonized LPS-induced cytokine release by normal PBMC. In most cases LTA did not alter T-cell proliferation for patients with chemotherapy-induced leukopenia. The LTA effects on AML blasts were investigated for 62 consecutive patients. LTA altered either cytokine (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor + stem cell factor + IL3)-dependent proliferation or the release of IL1beta/IL8 for 23 patients; the effects were divergent but increased proliferation/cytokine levels were most commonly observed. CONCLUSION: The LTA derived from E. faecalis can modulate the functional characteristics of normal leukocytes and native human AML blasts.","['Bruserud, Oystein', 'Wendelbo, Oystein', 'Paulsen, Kristin']","['Bruserud O', 'Wendelbo O', 'Paulsen K']","['Division of Hematology, Haukeland University Hospital and The University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. oystein.bruserud@haukeland.no']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enterococcus faecalis/*chemistry', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/physiology', 'Leukopenia/blood/chemically induced', 'Lipopolysaccharides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/physiology', 'Teichoic Acids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/10/02 05:00,2004/11/09 09:00,['2004/10/02 05:00'],"['2004/10/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00307.x [doi]', 'EJH307 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2004 Nov;73(5):340-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00307.x.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Teichoic Acids)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '56411-57-5 (lipoteichoic acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The unusual involvement of these exocrine glands by malignant cells prompted us to conduct a detail characterization of these infiltrating and circulating leukemic T cells, which may provide insight to the pathogenesis of exocrine involvement in ATL. METHODS: Immunophenotyping of peripheral ATL cells and microscopic examinations of various organs prepared by autopsy were performed. Analysis of the repertoire of T-cell receptor (TCR) of parotid gland-infiltrating ATL cells using molecular and immunohistochemical examinations were also performed. RESULTS: Microscopic examinations of various organs prepared by autopsy revealed the predominant and specific exocrine gland infiltration of ATL cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by both TCR spectratyping and complementary determining region (CDR)-3 sequencing analysis of TCR Vbeta of parotid gland-infiltrating T cells revealed a relatively restricted but not single usage of TCR Vbeta. Immunohistochemical analyses of parotid gland specimens detected only a small number of TCR Valphabeta-positive cells in parotid gland-infiltrating ATL cells. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant infiltration of ATL cells in exocrine glands implied that these T cells recognized exocrine gland-specific antigen. However, the absence of both TCR Vbeta mRNA transcripts and TCR Valphabeta protein expression in most ATL cells suggested that antigen recognition via TCR may not have played a major role in adhesion and subsequent infiltration into the exocrine glands in this patient. These results provide important background information to further elucidate the pathogenesis of exocrine gland-specific inflammation.","['Obama, Kosuke', 'Saito, Mineki', 'Higuchi, Itsuro', 'Tara, Mitsutoshi', 'Niina, Kiyoshige', 'Osame, Mitsuhiro']","['Obama K', 'Saito M', 'Higuchi I', 'Tara M', 'Niina K', 'Osame M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Kagoshima City Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan. patagonta@yahoo.co.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Aged', '*Exocrine Glands/pathology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Parotid Gland/pathology', 'Parotid Neoplasms/immunology/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/analysis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2004/10/02 05:00,2004/11/09 09:00,['2004/10/02 05:00'],"['2004/10/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00309.x [doi]', 'EJH309 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2004 Nov;73(5):332-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00309.x.,,,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the decrease in the side-chain glucose groups of schizophyllan, the complex with poly(C) can be considerably stabilized compared with unmodified SPG; for example, the T(m) value after the removal of the side-chain glucose groups from 33.3 (unmodified) to 1.0 is enhanced by 14 degrees C. In addition, the thermal stabilization effect is even operative under the physiological conditions ([NaCl] = 0.15 mol dm(-3)). This effect is exerted owing to the construction of the hydrophobic atmosphere around the complex. Although schizophyllan lost the side-chain glucose groups, it still kept the protection effect of the bound poly(C) chain against RNaseA-mediated hydrolysis as observed for unmodified schizophyllan. The assessment of the cytotoxicity for A375:human malignant melanoma, and HL60:human promyelocytic leukemia revealed that the modified schizophyllan scarcely increases the cytotoxicity.

Genomic RNA exists in virions as dimers, and the overlap of RNA elements that promote dimerization and encapsidation suggests that these processes may be coupled. Both processes are mediated by the nucleocapsid domain (NC) of the retroviral Gag polyprotein. Here we show that dimerization-induced register shifts in base pairing within the Psi-RNA packaging signal of Moloney murine leukaemia virus (MoMuLV) expose conserved UCUG elements that bind NC with high affinity (dissociation constant = 75 +/- 12 nM). These elements are base-paired and do not bind NC in the monomeric RNA. The structure of the NC complex with a 101-nucleotide 'core encapsidation' segment of the MoMuLV Psi site reveals a network of interactions that promote sequence- and structure-specific binding by NC's single CCHC zinc knuckle. Our findings support a structural RNA switch mechanism for genome encapsidation, in which protein binding sites are sequestered by base pairing in the monomeric RNA and become exposed upon dimerization to promote packaging of a diploid genome.","[""D'Souza, Victoria"", 'Summers, Michael F']","[""D'Souza V"", 'Summers MF']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, Maryland 21250, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Conserved Sequence/genetics', 'Dimerization', '*Genome, Viral', 'Guanosine/genetics/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Models, Molecular', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Nucleocapsid/chemistry/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Virus Assembly']",2004/10/01 05:00,2004/10/16 09:00,['2004/10/01 05:00'],"['2004/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/10/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/nature02944 [doi]', 'nature02944 [pii]']",ppublish,Nature. 2004 Sep 30;431(7008):586-90. doi: 10.1038/nature02944.,,,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SHIP-expressing Jurkat cells showed an increased transit time through the G1 phase of the cell cycle, but SHIP did not cause a complete cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.

Our data indicate that restoration of SHIP activity in a human leukemia cell line, which has lost expression of endogenous SHIP, downregulates constitutively activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/GSK-3beta signaling and leads to an increased transit time through the G1 phase of the cell cycle.","['Horn, S', 'Endl, E', 'Fehse, B', 'Weck, M M', 'Mayr, G W', 'Jucker, M']","['Horn S', 'Endl E', 'Fehse B', 'Weck MM', 'Mayr GW', 'Jucker M']","['Center of Experimental Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology I: Cellular Signal Transduction, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Forkhead Box Protein O1', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors', '*G1 Phase', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Retinoblastoma Protein', '*Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein', 'src Homology Domains']",2004/10/01 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/01 05:00'],"['2004/10/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403529 [doi]', '2403529 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Nov;18(11):1839-49. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403529.,,,"['0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FOXO1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O1)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Gsk3b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (INPPL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The enhanced self-renewal capacity of primitive HSCs enables their ability to sustain hematopoiesis throughout decades of life and their ability to repopulate a host when used therapeutically in bone marrow transplantation. However, hematopoietic cell perturbations resulting in unchecked self-renewal participate in leukemogenesis. While mechanisms governing self-renewal are still being uncovered, they are thought to bear relationship to the malignant process in a variety of tumor types and may therefore provide useful therapeutic targets in putative cancer stem cells.

Resistance to apoptosis can promote malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells. Proteins that regulate apoptosis may therefore be critically involved in the development of hematological cancer. A delicate balance between pro- and antiapoptotic mechanisms determines whether a cell death signal can activate the execution of the apoptotic cell death program. The family of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins is a recently identified, novel category of apoptosis-regulatory proteins. IAPs can inhibit the activation of caspases that are the executioners of apoptosis, activated by both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathway. IAPs may thereby set the threshold for apoptosis-activation and play a key role in the regulation of apoptotic cell death. IAPs themselves are also subject to strict regulation through feedback mechanisms. This paper focuses on the role of IAP family proteins in the regulation of apoptosis and discusses implications for their involvement in cancer and possible use for cancer therapy, especially in leukemias and lymphomas.","['de Graaf, A O', 'de Witte, T', 'Jansen, J H']","['de Graaf AO', 'de Witte T', 'Jansen JH']","['Central Hematology Laboratory, University Medical Center Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase Inhibitors', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Proteins/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction']",2004/10/01 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/10/01 05:00'],"['2004/10/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403493 [doi]', '2403493 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Nov;18(11):1751-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403493.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)']",,158,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human uveal melanoma cell lines 92.1 and OCM-1 were incubated with five different concentrations of violacein (10(-5)-10(-9) M), and the total cellular protein content was measured by means of the sulphorhodamine B assay. Dose-response curves were obtained and the concentration inhibiting cell growth by 50% (IC50) together with the concentration inhibiting the net cell growth by 50% (GI50) were calculated for both cell lines. Violacein IC50 and GI50 concentrations to cell line 92.1 were 2.78 x 10(-6) M and 1.69 x 10(-6) M, respectively. The IC50 and GI50 concentrations to cell line OCM-1 were 3.69 x 10(-6) M and 2.12 x 10(-6) M, respectively.

METHODS: A case-control study recruited NHL cases aged 18-64 in parts of England between 1998 and 2001. One control was matched to each case on sex, date of birth and area of residence. Self-reported histories of tobacco and alcohol consumption were collected during face-to-face interviews. RESULTS: Among 700 cases and 915 controls, no association of smoking with the risk of NHL was observed [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.85-1.28]. Risks were not raised with age started smoking, number of years smoked, and number of years stopped smoking.

Restoration of DNA methylation levels rescues these defects. Severely hypomethylated Dnmt[3a-/-,3b-/-] ES cells have increased histone acetylation levels, and those cells that can differentiate aberrantly express extraembryonic markers of differentiation. Dnmt[3a-/-,3b-/-] ES cells with >10% CpG methylation are able to terminally differentiate, whereas Dnmt1-/- ES cells with 20% of the CpG methylated cannot differentiate.

Using a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatographic separation method in combination with mass spectrometric analysis, the present study investigated the alterations in histone H4 methylation/acetylation status and the interplay between H4 methylation and acetylation during in vitro differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia cells and how these modifications affect the chromatin structure. Independently of the type of inducer used (dimethyl sulfoxide, hexamethylenebisacetamide, butyrate, and trichostatin A), we observed a strong increase in non- and monoacetylated H4 lysine 20 (H4-Lys(20)) trimethylation. An increase in H4-Lys(20) trimethylation, however, to a clearly lesser extent, was also found when cells accumulated in the stationary phase. Since we show that trimethylated H4-Lys(20) is localized to heterochromatin, the increase in H4-Lys(20) trimethylation observed indicates an accumulation of chromatin-dense and transcriptionally silent regions during differentiation and during the accumulation of control cells in the stationary phase, respectively. When using the deacetylase inhibitors butyrate or trichostatin A, we found that H4 hyperacetylation prevents H4-Lys(20) trimethylation, but not mono- or dimethylation, and that the nonacetylated unmethylated H4-Lys(20) is therefore the most suitable substrate for H4-Lys(20) trimethylase. Summarizing, histone H4-Lys(20) hypotrimethylation correlates with H4 hyperacetylation and H4-Lys(20) hypertrimethylation correlates with H4 hypoacetylation. The results provide a model for how transcriptionally active euchromatin might be converted to the compacted, transcriptionally silent heterochromatin.","['Sarg, Bettina', 'Helliger, Wilfried', 'Talasz, Heribert', 'Koutzamani, Elisavet', 'Lindner, Herbert H']","['Sarg B', 'Helliger W', 'Talasz H', 'Koutzamani E', 'Lindner HH']","['Department of Medical Chemistry and Biochemistry, Medical University of Innsbruck, Fritz-Pregl-Strasse 3, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Acetylation', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromatin/chemistry/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Heterochromatin/chemistry', 'Histones/*chemistry', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Lysine/*chemistry', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Metalloendopeptidases/pharmacology', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemistry', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Sodium Oxybate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2004/10/01 05:00,2005/02/05 09:00,['2004/10/01 05:00'],"['2004/10/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/10/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M409099200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)81988-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Dec 17;279(51):53458-64. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M409099200.

Promising preclinical data were confirmed in phase I-III trials. Concerning hematologic and cytogenetic response and adverse effects imatinib is superior to interferon alpha. Open questions are treatment duration in patients with good response, long term side effects, persistence of minimal residual disease in almost all patients, development of resistance after long term therapy, and the efficacy of combination treatments. Prospective clinical trials, e. g. CML study IV of the German CML Study Group, should answer these questions. The impact of the various treatment modalities (imatinib, interferon alpha, ara-C, allogeneic stem cell transplantation) will be elucidated.

We aimed to examine, whether the alternative Abl Kinaseinhibitor SKI-DV 2 - 43 may be capable of suppressing the growth of cells expressing mutant forms of Bcr-Abl. METHODS: The proliferation of cells expressing wild-type and mutant forms of Bcr-Abl was measured in the presence of imatinib or the pyrido-pyrimidine SKI-DV 2 - 43. RESULTS: The growth of a cell line expressing wild-type Bcr-Abl was suppressed with higher potency in the presence of SKI-DV 2 - 43 when compared to imatinib. Moreover, SKI-DV 2 - 43 effectively suppressed mutant forms of Bcr-Abl that cause imatinib resistance in patients. CONCLUSION: Therefore, alternative Abl kinase inhibitors might play an important role in the future therapy of Philadelphia-positive leukemias.","['Von Bubnoff, N', 'Peschel, C', 'Duyster, J']","['Von Bubnoff N', 'Peschel C', 'Duyster J']","['III.

The most popular RVs are those derived from the Moloney murine leukaemia virus (MoMLV). One of their main limitations is their inability to transduce noncycling cells. However, they have a relatively simple genome and structure, are easy to use, and are relatively safe for in vivo applications. For the last two decades, the artificial evolution of RVs has paralleled evolution in their applications, which now include those as diverse as the generation of transgenic animals, the stable delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) and gene therapy clinical trials. Recent reports of two successful gene therapy clinical trials in patients with severe immunodeficiency disease in France and Italy, and the development of T-cell acute leukaemia in two of 10 children participating in one of these clinical trials, demonstrate the great potential of RVs, but also some potential risks which may be intrinsically associated with their use. Basic aspects of RVs and vector production were reviewed in detail in a previous supplement of this journal. This article will first summarize some general aspects of retroviruses and RVs. Thereafter, recent developments in gene therapy using RVs, novel applications such as stable RNA interference and some other recent issues related to retroviral integration, including clonality studies after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, retroviral tagging and insertional oncogenesis will be discussed.","['Barquinero, J', 'Eixarch, H', 'Perez-Melgosa, M']","['Barquinero J', 'Eixarch H', 'Perez-Melgosa M']","[""Unitat de Diagnostic i Terapia Molecular, Centre de Transfusio i Banc de Teixits, Psg.

MxA expression was assessed by flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells stained with an antihuman MxA antibody. All data were obtained through the MDS Committee of the Japanese Society of Pediatric Hematology. RESULTS: Twelve patients (67%) had elevated levels of the MxA protein, with rotavirus, RS virus, or CMV infection documented in three of these patients. Although none of the patients had primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, reactivation of the virus was strongly suspected in four children, including two with monosomy 7, each having increased levels of MxA. Southern blot analysis revealed monoclonal integration of the EBV genome into bone marrow mononuclear cells from one of these patients. There was no discernible correlation between increases in the marker protein and the presenting features or course of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Viral infection may be present in two thirds of children with newly diagnosed JMML, but it does not constitute a basis for revising clinical management. The possibility that EBV or other viruses contribute to JMML pathogenesis by stimulating pre-exiting malignant clones warrants further investigation.","['Manabe, Atsushi', 'Yoshimasu, Tetsu', 'Ebihara, Yasuhiro', 'Yagasaki, Hiroshi', 'Wada, Mika', 'Ishikawa, Kumiko', 'Hara, Junichi', 'Koike, Kenichi', 'Moritake, Hiroshi', 'Park, Yong Dong', 'Tsuji, Kohichiro', 'Nakahata, Tatsutoshi']","['Manabe A', 'Yoshimasu T', 'Ebihara Y', 'Yagasaki H', 'Wada M', 'Ishikawa K', 'Hara J', 'Koike K', 'Moritake H', 'Park YD', 'Tsuji K', 'Nakahata T']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan. manabe-luke@umin.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow Cells/virology', 'C-Reactive Protein/analysis', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/blood/complications/epidemiology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/blood/complications/epidemiology', 'Female', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*blood', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*complications/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Monosomy', 'Myxovirus Resistance Proteins', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/blood/complications/epidemiology', 'Rotavirus Infections/blood/complications/epidemiology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Virus Activation', 'Virus Diseases/blood/complications/*epidemiology']",2004/09/30 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/30 05:00'],"['2004/09/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['00043426-200410000-00005 [pii]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2004 Oct;26(10):636-41.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (MX1 protein, human)', '0 (Myxovirus Resistance Proteins)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",,,,,,['MDS Committee of the Japanese Society of Pediatric Hematology'],,,,,,,,

METHODS: Asian race/ethnicity was evaluated using lists of Asian surnames. Average annual incidence rates (per million) for 1988 to 1992 were calculated for non-Hispanic white, black, Hispanic, and Asian children (age <15 years). Proportional incidence ratios (PIRs) for 1988 to 1995 were used to compare Southeast Asian children to non-Hispanic white children. RESULTS: Of the Asian children, 4.2% (30/722) were misclassified by subgroup, predominantly Hmong listed as Laotian. The Asian cancer rate was 134.2 versus 159.2 for non-Hispanic whites. The germ cell tumor rate was higher in Asians (9.9) than in non-Hispanic whites (4.8), but the Wilms tumor rate was two-thirds lower (3.1 vs. 9.2). The rates of Hodgkin lymphoma and central nervous system tumors were lower (2.8 vs. 5.6 and 20.0 vs. 33.8) in Asians than non-Hispanic whites. Compared with non-Hispanic whites, the PIR for Wilms tumor in Southeast Asian children was reduced (PIR = 0.1). Southeast Asian children had increased PIRs for Burkitt lymphoma (PIR = 2.6) and leukemias not classified as acute lymphocytic leukemia or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (PIR = 3.5). CONCLUSIONS: Accurate race/ethnicity classification of Southeast Asian children is a concern. Marked differences were found in the incidence and PIRs of specific cancers among Southeast Asian children, other Asian children, and other children in California.","['Ducore, Jonathan M', 'Parikh-Patel, Arti', 'Gold, Ellen B']","['Ducore JM', 'Parikh-Patel A', 'Gold EB']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California, Davis, Sacramento, California 95817, USA. jmducore@ucdaivs.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asia, Southeastern/ethnology', 'Asians/*statistics & numerical data', 'Blacks/statistics & numerical data', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/epidemiology/ethnology', 'California/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hispanic or Latino/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kidney Diseases/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*ethnology', 'Registries', 'Time Factors', 'Whites/statistics & numerical data', 'Wilms Tumor/epidemiology/ethnology']",2004/09/30 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/30 05:00'],"['2004/09/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['00043426-200410000-00001 [pii]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2004 Oct;26(10):613-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peptides were derived from granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), the placental 27 kDa heat-shock protein (HSP), leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), oviduct glycoprotein (OGP), proliferin (PLF), prolactin (PRL), sperm protein SP56 and mouse zona pellucida subunits 1 and 3 (ZP1, ZP3). Fertility of female BALB/c mice was reduced after immunization with several peptides either conjugated to a carrier protein or in the form of recombinant polyepitopes. The most effective conjugated peptides (SP56, GMCSF and PRL) induced peptide-specific serum antibodies and reduced fertility by 50%. Fertility of mice was also reduced after immunization with polyepitope antigens containing up to five different peptides fused to maltose-binding protein, but antibodies were not produced against all the encoded peptides. The most effective polyepitope antigen (containing PLF, SP56, ZP1 and ZP3 peptides) reduced fertility by 50% but induced only SP56 and ZP1 antibodies. We demonstrate that lack of antibody response to a given peptide epitope (ZP3) can be overcome if repeated copies are used in the polyepitope antigen construct, but the effect varies between mouse strains. We conclude that infertility induced in mice with a range of peptide-based vaccines is dependent on antigen formulation and genetic factors but does not necessarily correlate with peptide-specific antibody levels. In light of these results, strategies to improve the efficacy of peptide-based antifertility vaccines are discussed.","['Hardy, Christopher M', 'Clydesdale, Gavin', 'Mobbs, Karen J']","['Hardy CM', 'Clydesdale G', 'Mobbs KJ']","['Pest Animal Control Cooperative Research Centre, CSIRO Sustainable Ecosystems, GPO Box 284, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia. chris.hardy@csiro.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Reproduction,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",100966036,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/blood', 'Antigens/administration & dosage/genetics', 'Base Sequence', '*Contraception, Immunologic', 'Egg Proteins/immunology', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Female', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Ovary/ultrastructure', 'Peptides/immunology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/immunology', 'Vaccines, Contraceptive/*administration & dosage/genetics', 'Vaccines, Subunit/*administration & dosage/genetics', 'Zona Pellucida Glycoproteins']",2004/09/30 05:00,2004/12/18 09:00,['2004/09/30 05:00'],"['2004/09/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1530/rep.1.00276 [doi]', '128/4/395 [pii]']",ppublish,Reproduction. 2004 Oct;128(4):395-407. doi: 10.1530/rep.1.00276.,,,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Egg Proteins)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Vaccines, Contraceptive)', '0 (Vaccines, Subunit)', '0 (Zona Pellucida Glycoproteins)', '0 (Zp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Zp3 protein, mouse)', '0 (sp56 protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We generated a transgenic mouse line that specifically expressed the chimeric NUP98-HOXA9 gene in the myeloid lineage. While only 20% of the transgenic mice progressed to leukemia after a latency period, myeloid progenitor cells from nonleukemic transgenic mice still exhibited increased proliferative potential. This suggested that the NUP98-HOXA9 fusion induced a preleukemic phase, and other factors were required for complete leukemogenesis. NUP98-HOXA9 expression promoted the onset of retrovirus-induced BXH2 myeloid leukemia. This phenomenon was used to identify cooperative disease genes as common integration sites (CISs). Meis1, a known HOX cofactor, was identified as a CIS with a higher integration frequency in transgenic than in wild-type BXH2 mice. By the same means we identified further 4 candidate cooperative genes, Dnalc4, Fcgr2b, Fcrl, and Con1. These genes cooperated with NUP98-HOXA9 in transforming NIH 3T3 cells.

Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on sample RNA to determine the relative levels of mRNA of 3 nucleoside transporters that mediate fludarabine uptake (human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 [hENT1], human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 2 [hENT2], and human concentrative nucleoside transporter 3 [hCNT3]), deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), and 3 5'-nucleotidases (ecto-5'nucleotidase [CD73], deoxynucleotidase-1 [dNT-1], and cytoplasmic high-Km 5-nucleotidase [CN-II]). Two-dimensional hierarchical cluster analysis of gene expression identified 2 distinct populations of CLL. Cluster 2 patients experienced a 3.4-fold higher risk of disease progression than cluster 1 patients (P = .0058, log-rank analysis).

To determine the impact of GH therapy on growth, the final heights of 90 GH-deficient children who underwent fractionated TBI and HCT for malignancy were evaluated. Changes in height standard deviation (SD) from the diagnosis of GH deficiency to the achievement of final height were compared among 42 who did and 48 who did not receive GH therapy. At HCT, GH-treated patients were younger (P = .001), more likely to have undergone central nervous system irradiation (P = .007), and shorter (P = .005) than patients who did not receive GH therapy. After HCT, GH deficiency was diagnosed at 1.5 years (range, 0.8-9.5 years) for GH-treated and 1.2 years (range, 0.9-8.8 years) for nontreated patients. GH therapy was associated with significantly improved final height in children younger than 10 years at HCT (P = .0001), but GH therapy did not impact the growth of older children. Girls (P = .0001) and children diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (compared with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL] or non-Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL]; P = .02) also showed more rapid growth than their counterparts.

Here, we report that B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells produce leukotriene B(4), and that specific leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors counteracted CD40-dependent activation of B-CLL cells. Studies on the expression of the high-affinity receptor for LTB(4) (BLT1) by flow cytometry analysis showed that the receptor was expressed, to a varying degree, in all investigated B-CLL clones. At a concentration of 100 nM, the drugs BWA4C (a specific 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor) and MK-886 (a specific 5-lipoxygenase activating protein inhibitor) markedly inhibited CD40-induced DNA synthesis (45% and 38%, respectively) and CD40-induced expression of CD23, CD54, and CD150.

Plasma D-lactate was assayed before, 24 and 72 h after the start of four consecutive MTX infusions (5 g/m(2)/24 h) in each patient. Inhibition of glyoxalase I was tested in vitro, using human erythrocyte lysates and yeast enzyme. The elevated initial plasma D-lactate levels (P<0.02) fell significantly (P<0.001) in response to 24 h MTX infusions. In vitro, MTX, folic and folinic acids inhibited the activity of glyoxalase I.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is known to be a differentiating agent in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). In this study, we investigated whether ATRA can differentiate the retinoic acid (RA)-sensitive promyelocytic leukemic cell line, NB4, to DC-like cells and whether these differentiated cells can activate T cells. NB4 cells were differentiated to myeloid cells by 4, 6, and 8 days of ATRA treatment. NB4 cells up-regulated markers found in DCs, including HLA-DR, costimulatory molecules (CD80 and CD86), adhesion molecules (CD40), and chemokine receptors (CCR6) when cultured for 8 days in the presence of 1 microM ATRA. Upregulation of CD83 was also detected on the surface of ATRA-treated NB4 cells versus untreated cells. The addition of cytokines alone, such as GM-CSF or CD40 ligand, did not affect the expression of CD83 in untreated NB4 cells but they up-regulated CD83 in ATRA-treated cells. CD11b was coexpressed with CD80, CD83, and CD86 in ATRA-treated NB4 cells. In a functional assay, ATRA-treated NB4 cells stimulated T cell proliferation when challenged with Staphylococcus enterotoxin B.

Alemtuzumab is particularly effective in clearing malignant lymphocytes from peripheral blood and bone marrow and may therefore facilitate stem-cell transplantation (SCT) in selected patients. The toxicity profile for the antibody is acceptable; the major complications are infusional reactions, which generally subside after the first 1-2 weeks of therapy, and prolonged lymphopenia associated with reactivation of viruses. These can be minimized by careful monitoring and the use of prophylactic therapy.

In a series of 64 B-CLLs, we failed to confirm the prognostic value of the IgVH gene mutational status by using the suggested cutoff. However, the IgVH mutational status maintained its prognostic value only when evidence of antigen-driven selection could be documented. This was accomplished by applying statistical methods aimed at evaluating a significant skewing of replacement mutations from framework to complementary determining regions, as it occurs during germinal center differentiation of B cells.

These selections have been used to recover lines that block early postentry stages of infection, either before reverse transcription or before nuclear entry. The mechanisms of action of these blocks remain unknown. RESULTS: We have devised a method for the selection of genes from cDNA libraries that suppress the block to virus infection, and so restore virus susceptibility. The protocol involves the transformation of pools of resistant cells by cDNA expression libraries, followed by the selection for rare virus-sensitive cells, using multiple rounds of selection after infection by marked viral vector genomes. The suppressor genes were then recovered from these virus sensitive cells, and their ability to restore virus susceptibility was confirmed by reintroduction of these cDNAs into the resistant line. CONCLUSIONS: The identities of these genes provide insights into the mechanism of virus resistance and will help to define new pathways used during retrovirus infection. The methods for gene isolation developed here will also permit the identification of similar suppressors that modify or override other recently identified virus resistance genes.","['Gao, Guangxia', 'Goff, Stephen P']","['Gao G', 'Goff SP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA. gaogx@sun.im.ac.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', '*Drug Resistance, Viral', 'Gene Library', '*Genes, Suppressor', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rats']",2004/09/30 05:00,2006/08/01 09:00,['2004/09/30 05:00'],"['2004/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1186/1742-4690-1-30 [doi]', '1742-4690-1-30 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2004 Sep 28;1:30. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-1-30.,"['R01 CA030488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA30488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",20040928,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)']",,,PMC524375,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently reported that human FcepsilonRI beta-chain gene expression was down-regulated by a transcription factor, MZF-1, through an element in the fourth intron. In the present study, we found that this transcriptional repression by MZF-1 required FHL3 (four and a half LIM domain protein 3) as a cofactor. Yeast two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that FHL3 bound MZF-1 in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of FHL3 in KU812 cells suppressed the beta-chain promoter activity through the element in the fourth intron in an MZF-1-dependent manner. Furthermore, results from pull-down assays and gel-filtration chromatography employing nuclear extracts indicated that MZF-1 and FHL3 formed a complex of high molecular mass with some additional proteins in the nucleus. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, which was reported to decrease FcepsilonRI expression, induced the accumulation of FHL3 in the nucleus, in accordance with the repressive role of FHL3 in beta-chain gene expression.","['Takahashi, Kyoko', 'Matsumoto, Chiyuki', 'Ra, Chisei']","['Takahashi K', 'Matsumoto C', 'Ra C']","['Department of Molecular Cell Immunology and Allergology, Advanced Medical Research Center, Nihon University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, 30-1 Oyaguchi, Kami-machi, Itabashi-ku, Toyko 173-8610, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Introns/genetics', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport', 'Receptors, IgE/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/*physiology', 'Transformation, Genetic', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics/physiology']",2004/09/30 05:00,2005/08/03 09:00,['2004/09/30 05:00'],"['2004/09/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1042/BJ20040775 [doi]', 'BJ20040775 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2005 Feb 15;386(Pt 1):191-200. doi: 10.1042/BJ20040775.,,,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FHL3 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (MS4A2 protein, human)', '0 (MZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,PMC1134781,,,,,['GENBANK/AB158503'],,,,,,

However, its other biological activities are not well-known. Shikonin displayed a strong inhibitory effect against human colorectal carcinoma COLO 205 cells and human leukemia HL-60 cells, with estimated IC(50) values of 3.12 and 5.5 microM, respectively, but were less effective against human colorectal carcinoma HT-29 cells, with an estimated IC(50) value of 14.8 microM. Induce apoptosis was confirmed in COLO 205 cells by DNA fragmentation and the appearance of a sub-G1 DNA peak, which were preceded by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, cytochrome c release, and subsequent induction of pro-caspase-9 and -3 processing. Cleavages of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and DNA fragmentation factor (DFF-45) were accompanied by activation of caspase-9 and -3 triggered by shikonin in COLO 205 cells. Here, we found that shikonin-induced apoptotic cell death was accompanied by upregulation of p27, p53, and Bad and down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L), while shikonin had little effect on the levels of Bax protein. Taken together, we suggested that shikonin-induced apoptosis is triggered by the release of cytochrome c into cytosol, procaspase-9 processing, activation of caspase-3, degradation of PARP, and DNA fragmentation caused by the caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease through the digestion of DFF-45. The induction of apoptosis by shikonin may provide a pivotal mechanism for its cancer chemopreventive action.","['Hsu, Ping-Chi', 'Huang, Yu-Ting', 'Tsai, Mei-Ling', 'Wang, Ying-Jan', 'Lin, Jen-Kun', 'Pan, Min-Hsiung']","['Hsu PC', 'Huang YT', 'Tsai ML', 'Wang YJ', 'Lin JK', 'Pan MH']","['Department of Seafood Science, National Kaohsiung Marine University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Agric Food Chem,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,0374755,IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/drug effects/physiology', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/ultrastructure', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/drug effects/physiology']",2004/09/30 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/30 05:00'],"['2004/09/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jf0495993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Agric Food Chem. 2004 Oct 6;52(20):6330-7. doi: 10.1021/jf0495993.,,,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (caspase-activated DNase inhibitor)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '3IK6592UBW (shikonin)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the only successful transgenic bioreactors have been based on mammals. We have developed two key techniques for obtaining transgenic birds. For bird embryo culture, we identified that the low rate of hatchability of cultured embryos is caused by limited oxygen and calcium availability. In quail embryo culture using a chicken eggshell as a culture vessel, hatchability increased to 80% by the supplement of calcium lactate in addition to oxygen aeration. A fully artificial vessel for quail embryo culture using a gas-permeable Teflon membrane was also designed. Although the hatchability was lower than that of cultures using a surrogate eggshell, we succeeded in hatching of bird embryos using a fully artificial vessel. For transgene introduction, a replication-defective pantropic retroviral vector based on Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) was injected to laid embryos at the blastodermal stage, and the embryos were hatched in vitro to generate G0 birds.

Our investigation aims to study the independent role of socioeconomic factors on the prognosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in Greece. During a 7-year period (1996-2002) 293 cases of incident ALL were diagnosed and followed up in four Childhood Haematology-Oncology Units, which covered over half of all childhood ALL cases nationwide. At the time of diagnosis, information concerning age, gender, maternal schooling, maternal marital status, sibship size, distance of residence from the treating centre, attendance of day care centre and clinical information was recorded. The influence of these factors on survival was studied by modelling the data through Cox's proportional-hazards regression. After adjustment for clinical prognostic factors, children of mothers who were not currently married, were of low educational level or were living far from the treating centre tended to have lower survival (P-values 0.02, 0.14 and 0.08, respectively). There was also evidence that two factors that are predictive of disease occurrence, that is sibship size and attendance of day care centre, may also predict survival (P-values 0.04 and 0.26, respectively). In conclusion, socioeconomic factors are likely to influence survival from ALL at least in some sociocultural contexts. Moreover, there is evidence that factors that could affect incidence of ALL through modulation of herd immunity may also have prognostic implications for this disease.","['Charalampopoulou, A', 'Petridou, E', 'Spyridopoulos, T', 'Dessypris, N', 'Oikonomou, A', 'Athanasiadou-Piperopoulou, F', 'Baka, M', 'Kalmanti, M', 'Polychronopoulou, S', 'Trichopoulos, D']","['Charalampopoulou A', 'Petridou E', 'Spyridopoulos T', 'Dessypris N', 'Oikonomou A', 'Athanasiadou-Piperopoulou F', 'Baka M', 'Kalmanti M', 'Polychronopoulou S', 'Trichopoulos D']","['Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Athens University Medical School, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Cancer Prev,European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP),9300837,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cultural Characteristics', 'Female', 'Greece', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*economics/*pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors', '*Social Class', 'Survival Analysis']",2004/09/29 05:00,2005/01/26 09:00,['2004/09/29 05:00'],"['2004/09/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['00008469-200410000-00007 [pii]', '10.1097/00008469-200410000-00007 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer Prev. 2004 Oct;13(5):397-401. doi: 10.1097/00008469-200410000-00007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to structural and enzymatic proteins, HTLV encodes regulatory (Tax and Rex) and accessory (open reading frame I and II) proteins. The viral Tax and Rex proteins positively regulate virus production. Tax activates viral and cellular transcription to promote T-cell growth and, ultimately, malignant transformation. Rex acts posttranscriptionally to facilitate cytoplasmic expression of viral mRNAs that encode the structural and enzymatic gene products, thus positively controlling virion expression. Here, we report that both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 have evolved accessory genes to encode proteins that act as negative regulators of both Tax and Rex. HTLV-1 p30(II) and the related HTLV-2 p28(II) inhibit virion production by binding to and retaining tax/rex mRNA in the nucleus. Reduction of viral replication in a cell carrying the provirus may allow escape from immune recognition in an infected individual.

We now report that these RNAs are, like genomic RNAs, encapsidated as dimers. These dimers have the same thermostability as MLV genomic RNA dimers; like them, these dimers are more stable if isolated from mature virions than from immature virions. We characterized encapsidated mRNAs containing deletions or truncations of MLV psi or with psi sequences from MLV-related acute transforming viruses. The results indicate that the dimeric linkage in genomic RNA can be completely attributed to the psi region of the genome. While this conclusion agrees with earlier electron microscopic studies on mature MLV dimers, it is the first evidence as to the site of the linkage in immature dimers for any retrovirus. Since the Psi(+) mRNA is not encapsidated as well as genomic RNA, it is only present in a minority of virions. The fact that it is nevertheless dimeric argues strongly that two of these molecules are packaged into particles together. We also found that the kissing loop is unnecessary for this coencapsidation or for the stability of mature dimers but makes a major contribution to the stability of immature dimers. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the packaging signal involves a dimeric structure in which the RNAs are joined by intermolecular interactions between GACG loops.","['Hibbert, Catherine S', 'Mirro, Jane', 'Rein, Alan']","['Hibbert CS', 'Mirro J', 'Rein A']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, P.

Although taxol induces apoptosis of cancer cells, its exact mechanism of action is not yet known. In this study we investigated death receptors, FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD), the activation of caspases-10 and -8 as well as the downstream caspases, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in taxol-induced apoptosis in the CCRF-HSB-2 human lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. Pretreating the cells with neutralizing antibodies to Fas, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha receptor 1, or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptors (DR4 and DR5) did not affect taxol-induced apoptosis, but transfection of the cells with a dominant negative FADD plasmid resulted in inhibition of taxol-induced apoptosis, revealing that taxol induces apoptosis independently of these death receptors but dependently on FADD. Furthermore, the drug induced activation of caspases-10, -8, -6, and -3, cleaved Bcl-2, Bid, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and lamin B, and down-regulated cellular levels of FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) and X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). However, despite the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria in taxol-treated cells, caspase-9 was not activated. Inhibitors of caspases-8, -6, or -3 partially inhibited taxol-induced apoptosis, whereas the caspase-10 inhibitor totally abrogated this process. Taxol-induced apoptosis was also associated with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) and a significant increase in ROS generation. However, increased ROS production was not directly involved in taxol-triggered apoptosis.

However, follistatin and FLRG revealed non-overlapping patterns of expression in various tissues thereby indicating the existence of non-redundant functional roles for these proteins throughout the organism. As known for a long time, follistatin is a biological regulator of activin and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) function in various cellular systems: in particular, it inhibits the effects of activin on hematopoiesis. We therefore investigated the expression and effects of FLRG during human hematopoiesis with particular focus on the effect of this soluble glycoprotein in the regulation of erythropoiesis. For this purpose, we have for the first time, compared the role of Activin A, BMP2 and BMP4 during erythropoiesis, in primary human cells. Our results indicate that, BMP2 acts on early erythroid cells while Activin A acts on a more differentiated population. We report the induction by Activin A and BMP2 of cell commitment towards erythropoiesis in the absence of EPO. This induction involves two key events: increase of EPO-R and the decrease of GATA2 expression. Our results indicate that despite their high structural homology, follistatin and FLRG do not regulate the same signaling targets, therefore highlighting distinct functions and mechanisms for these two proteins in the human hematopoietic system. We thus propose a working model for the regulation of activin or BMP-induced human erythropoiesis by follistatin/FLRG.","['Maguer-Satta, Veronique', 'Rimokh, Ruth']","['Maguer-Satta V', 'Rimokh R']","['INSERM U590, Centre Leon Berard, 69373 Lyon Cedex 08, France. maguer@lyon.fnclcc.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Ireland,Mol Cell Endocrinol,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,7500844,IM,"['Activins/physiology', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/physiology', 'Follistatin-Related Proteins/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibin-beta Subunits/physiology']",2004/09/29 05:00,2005/05/11 09:00,['2004/09/29 05:00'],"['2004/09/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.mce.2004.07.009 [doi]', 'S0303-7207(04)00302-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Endocrinol. 2004 Oct 15;225(1-2):109-18. doi: 10.1016/j.mce.2004.07.009.,,,"['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Follistatin-Related Proteins)', '0 (activin A)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)', '93443-12-0 (Inhibin-beta Subunits)']",,79,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, calyculin A does not discriminate between PP1 and PP2A, while okadaic acid and tautomycin are more selective for PP2A and PP1, respectively. Increased phosphorylation of endogenous marker proteins was used to define concentrations that inhibited each phosphatase in cells. Concentrations of each inhibitor that prevented anisomycin-induced apoptosis correlated with inhibition of PP2A. The inhibitors prevented Bax translocation to mitochondria, indicating inhibition upstream of mitochondria. Tautomycin and calyculin A, but not okadaic acid, also prevented apoptosis induced through the CD95/Fas death receptor, and this protection correlated with inhibition of PP1. The inhibitors prevented Fas receptor oligomerization, FADD recruitment, and caspase 8 activation.

We report that diclofenac, a NSAID, induces growth inhibition and apoptosis of HL-60 cells through modulation of mitochondrial functions regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), Akt, caspase-8, and Bid. ROS generation occurs in an early stage of diclofenac-induced apoptosis preceding cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and DNA fragmentation. N-Acetyl-L-cysteine, an antioxidant, suppresses ROS generation, Akt inactivation, caspase-8 activation, and DNA fragmentation. Cyclic AMP, an inducer of Akt phosphorylation, suppresses Akt inactivation, Bid cleavage, and DNA fragmentation. LY294002, a PI3 kinase inhibitor, enhances Akt inactivation and DNA fragmentation.

Although melatonin is known to be effective as a free radical scavenger and has an anti-cancer effect, carcinogenic properties have also been reported. In relation to its carcinogenic potential, we have examined whether 6-hydroxymelatonin, a major melatonin metabolite, can induce DNA damage in the presence of metal ion using [32P]-5'-end-labeled DNA fragments obtained from genes relevant to human cancer. 6-Hydroxymelatonin induced site-specific DNA damage in the presence of Cu(II). Formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase treatment induced cleavage sites mainly at G residues of the 5'-TG-3' sequence, whereas piperidine treatment induced cleavage sites at T mainly of 5'-TG-3'. Interestingly, 6-hydroxymelatonin strongly damaged G and C of the 5'-ACG-3' sequence complementary to codon 273 of the p53 gene. These results suggest that 6-hydroxymelatonin can cause double-base lesions. DNA damage was inhibited by both catalase and bathocuproine, Cu(I)-specific stabilizer, suggesting that reactive species derived from the reaction of H2O2 with Cu(I) participate in DNA damage. Cytochrome P450 reductase efficiently enhanced 6-hydroxymelatonin-induced oxidative DNA damage and oxygen consumption, suggesting the formation of redox cycle. It is noteworthy that 6-hydroxymelatonin can efficiently induce DNA damage via non-o-quinone type of redox cycle. Formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), a characteristic oxidative DNA lesion, in calf thymus DNA was significantly increased by 6-hydroxymelatonin in the presence of Cu(II). Furthermore, 6-hydroxymelatonin significantly increased the formation of 8-oxodG in human leukemia cell line HL-60 but not in HP100, a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-resistant cell line derived from HL-60. The 6-hydroxymelatonin-induced 8-oxodG formation in HL-60 cells significantly decreased by the addition of bathocuproine or o-phenanthroline.

Our approach to search for non-cross resistant antitumour agents is based on the rational design of derivatives, which have a high kinetics of passive cellular uptake rendering their active efflux by MDR exporting pumps inefficient. Recently, two families of acridine cytotoxic agents were obtained, pyrazoloacridines (PACs) and pyrazolopyrimidoacridines (PPACs). The aim of this study was to examine molecular basis of the reported differences in retaining cytotoxic activity of these derivatives at cellular level against resistant erythroleukaemia K562/DOX (overexpressing P-glycoprotein) cell line. The study was performed using a spectrofluorometric method, which allows continuous monitoring of the uptake and efflux of fluorescent molecules by living cells. It was demonstrated that the presence of two additional rings, pyrazole and pyrimidine, fused to the acridine chromophore structure (PPAC) favoured more rapid cellular diffusion than the presence of only one additional pyrazole ring (PAC). The presence of hydrophobic substituent OCH3 markedly favoured the cellular uptake of pyrazoloacridines and pyrazolopyrimidoacridines while compounds having hydrophilic substituent OH exhibited very low kinetics of cellular uptake. In contrast, it was found that neither structure of the ring system nor the hydrophobic/hydrophilic character of examined substituents determined the rate of active efflux of these compounds by P-glycoprotein. Our data showed that a nearly linear relation exists between the resistance factor (RF) and lnV+ reflecting the impact of the cellular uptake rate (V+) on the ability of these compounds to overcome MDR.","['Tarasiuk, Jolanta', 'Majewska, Ewelina', 'Seksek, Olivier', 'Rogacka, Dorota', 'Antonini, Ippolito', 'Garnier-Suillerot, Arlette', 'Borowski, Edward']","['Tarasiuk J', 'Majewska E', 'Seksek O', 'Rogacka D', 'Antonini I', 'Garnier-Suillerot A', 'Borowski E']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biochemistry, Technical University of Gdansk, Poland. tarasiuk@univ.szczecin.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Acridines/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/09/29 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/29 05:00'],"['2004/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.bcp.2004.06.028 [doi]', 'S0006-2952(04)00465-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2004 Nov 1;68(9):1815-23. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2004.06.028.,,,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'L24XJN68OW (NSC 366140)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(99m)Tc-Hynic-rh-Annexin V scintigraphy (TAVS) enables non-invasive in vivo imaging of treatment-induced apoptosis. We identified the visual patterns of (99m)Tc-Hynic-rh-Annexin V tumour uptake and related these to treatment response. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-three patients with malignant lymphoma (n=26), leukaemia (n=1) NSCLC (n=5), H&NSCC (n=1), scheduled for radiotherapy (n=27), platinum-based chemotherapy (n=5) or concurrent chemoradiation (n=1), underwent TAVS before and early after the start of treatment. Planar and SPECT images were visually examined to assess changes in tumour (99m)Tc-Hynic-rh-Annexin V uptake. Twenty-nine patients were eligible for further analysis. Annexin V uptake before (U(baseline)) and early after (U(post)) the start of treatment was graded using a four-step scale: 0, absent; 1, weak; 2, moderate and 3, intense. The difference between these values (Delta U) was calculated and correlated to tumour response after therapy (Spearman rank correlation test). RESULTS: Weak to moderate U(baseline) was detected in 13/15 patients with a complete response and U(post) was markedly increased in all these cases (Delta U range 1-3). Partial response (n=7) was associated with weak to moderate U(baseline) and a moderately increased U(post) (Delta U range 1-2). In patients with stable disease (n=5), U(baseline) was predominantly weak, without considerable changes in uptake after the start of treatment (Delta U range 0-1). Finally, in case of progressive disease (n=2), either no tumour uptake or a decrease in U(post) was detected (Delta U=-1). A statistically significant correlation was found between changes in (99m)Tc-Hynic-rh-Annexin V tumour uptake and clinical response (correlation coefficient=0.62; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Complete or partial tumour response was associated with a marked increase of (99m)Tc Hynic-rh-Annexin V accumulation early during treatment compared to baseline values. In case of stable or progressive disease, pretreatment scans demonstrated predominantly low (99m)Tc Hynic-rh-Annexin V tumour uptake and no significant increase early after treatment. These results indicate that TAVS might be useful as a predictive test for treatment response.","['Kartachova, Marina', 'Haas, Rick L M', 'Olmos, Renato A Valdes', 'Hoebers, Frank J P', 'van Zandwijk, Nico', 'Verheij, Marcel']","['Kartachova M', 'Haas RL', 'Olmos RA', 'Hoebers FJ', 'van Zandwijk N', 'Verheij M']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, The Netherlands Cancer Institute/Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Radiother Oncol,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,8407192,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Annexin A5', '*Apoptosis', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/*therapy', '*Organotechnetium Compounds', 'Radionuclide Imaging']",2004/09/29 05:00,2005/02/26 09:00,['2004/09/29 05:00'],"['2004/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2004/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.radonc.2004.07.008 [doi]', 'S0167-8140(04)00296-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Radiother Oncol. 2004 Sep;72(3):333-9. doi: 10.1016/j.radonc.2004.07.008.,,,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Organotechnetium Compounds)', '0 (technetium Tc 99m annexin V)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The original authors provided the cohort data. We computed US and local county rate-based standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and internal cohort rate-based relative risks (RR) by categories of four formaldehyde exposure metrics (highest peak, average intensity (AIE), cumulative, and duration), using both NCI categories and an alternative categorization based on tertiles of deaths from all leukemia among exposed subjects. For highest peak exposure, we computed RRs by the duration of time worked in the highest peak category and the time since highest peak exposure. For AIE, we computed RRs by the duration of exposure and the time since first exposure. RESULTS: Our external comparisons revealed that the elevated leukemia and ML RRs and associated trends reported by NCI for highest peak and AIE occurred because null (or slight) to moderate mortality excesses were compared with statistically significant baseline category deficits in deaths. Our alternative categorization of AIE yielded leukemia and ML SMRs close to 1.0 in the highest exposure category, and revealed weaker evidence of a trend in RRs for leukemia and ML. We corroborated NCI's finding of no association for cumulative and duration of formaldehyde exposure. We found no consistent evidence that leukemia or ML risks increased with increasing duration of time spent in a given highest peak exposure (or for AIE, duration of exposure in a given AIE category). We also found no consistent evidence that leukemia or ML risks were greater in the more relevant shorter (less than 20 years) versus longer (20+ years) periods of time from the first highest peak exposure (or for AIE, first exposure). CONCLUSIONS: Our reanalysis provided little evidence to support NCI's suggestion of a causal association between formaldehyde exposure and mortality from leukemia and ML. NCI's key findings for highest peak exposure and AIE do not adequately account for the inordinately large deficits in deaths in the categories used as the baselines for internal rate-based RRs. The NCI findings also do not adequately account for the duration of time subjects spent in the highest peak category (or for AIE, duration of exposure) or the time since their first peak exposure (or for AIE, time since first exposure). Our finding that NCI's suggestion of a causal association is not robust with respect to alternative categorizations of formaldehyde exposure and methods of data analysis casts considerable additional uncertainty regarding the validity of this suggested association.","['Marsh, Gary M', 'Youk, Ada O']","['Marsh GM', 'Youk AO']","['Department of Biostatistics, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA. gmarsh@pitt.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Regul Toxicol Pharmacol,Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,8214983,IM,"['*Cohort Studies', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Environmental Exposure/analysis', 'Formaldehyde/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*mortality', 'National Institutes of Health (U.S.)/*organization & administration', 'Occupational Exposure/analysis', '*Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'United States']",2004/09/29 05:00,2005/09/16 09:00,['2004/09/29 05:00'],"['2004/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.yrtph.2004.05.012 [doi]', 'S0273230004000686 [pii]']",ppublish,Regul Toxicol Pharmacol. 2004 Oct;40(2):113-24. doi: 10.1016/j.yrtph.2004.05.012.,,,['1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also a potent nasal irritant, a cytotoxicant at high doses, and a nasal carcinogen in rats exposed to high airborne concentrations. The normal endogenous concentration of formaldehyde in the blood is approximately 0.1 mM in rats, monkeys, and humans, and it is 2- to 4-fold higher in the liver and nasal mucosa of the rat. Inhaled formaldehyde enters the one-carbon pool, and the carbon atom is rapidly incorporated into macromolecules throughout the body. Oxidation to formate catalyzed by glutathione-dependent and -independent dehydrogenases in nasal tissues is a major route of detoxication and generally precedes incorporation. The possibility that inhaled formaldehyde might induce various forms of distant-site toxicity has been proposed, but no convincing evidence for such toxicity has been obtained in experimental studies. This review summarizes the biological evidence that pertains to the issue of leukemia induction by formaldehyde, which includes: (1) the failure of inhaled formaldehyde to increase the formaldehyde concentration in the blood of rats, monkeys, or humans exposed to concentrations of 14.4, 6, or 1.9 ppm, respectively; (2) the lack of detectable protein adducts or DNA-protein cross-links (DPX) in the bone marrow of normal rats exposed to [3H]- and [14C]formaldehyde at concentrations as high as 15 ppm; (3) the lack of detectable protein adducts or DPX in the bone marrow of glutathione-depleted (metabolically inhibited) rats exposed to [3H]- and [14C]formaldehyde at concentrations as high as 10 ppm; (4) the lack of detectable DPX in the bone marrow of Rhesus monkeys exposed to [14C]formaldehyde at concentrations as high as 6 ppm; (5) the failure of formaldehyde to induce leukemia in any of seven long-term inhalation bioassays in rats, mice, or hamsters; and (6) the failure of formaldehyde to induce chromosomal aberrations in the bone marrow of rats exposed to airborne concentrations as high as 15 ppm or of mice injected intraperitoneally with formaldehyde at doses as high as 25 mg/kg. Biological evidence that might be regarded as supporting the possibility of leukemia induction by formaldehyde includes: (1) the detection of cytogenetic abnormalities in circulating lymphocytes in seven studies of human subjects exposed to ambient concentrations in the workplace (but not in seven other studies of human subjects or in rats exposed to 15 ppm); (2) the induction of leukemia in rats in a single questionable drinking water study with formaldehyde concentrations as high as 1.5 g/L (but not in three other drinking water studies with concentrations as high as 1.9 or 5 g/L); (3) the detection of chromosomal aberrations in the bone marrow of rats exposed to very low concentrations of formaldehyde (0.4 or 1.2 ppm) (but not in another study at concentrations as high as 15 ppm); and (4) an apparent increase in the fraction of protein-associated DNA (assumed to be due to DPX) in circulating lymphocytes of humans exposed to ambient concentrations in the workplace (1-3 ppm). This evidence is regarded as inconsequential for several reasons, including lack of reproducibility, inadequate reporting of experimental methods, inconsistency with other data, or insufficient analytical sensitivity, and therefore, it provides little justification for or against the possibility that inhaled formaldehyde may be a leukemogen. In contrast to these inconclusive findings, the abundance of negative evidence mentioned above is undisputed and strongly suggests that there is no delivery of inhaled formaldehyde to distant sites. Combined with the fact that formaldehyde naturally occurs throughout the body, and that multiple inhalation bioassays have not induced leukemia in animals, the negative findings provide convincing evidence that formaldehyde is not leukemogenic.","[""Heck, Henry d'A"", 'Casanova, Mercedes']","['Heck Hd', 'Casanova M']","['101 Halcyon Cove, Washington, NC 27889, USA. casaheck@cox.net']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Regul Toxicol Pharmacol,Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,8214983,IM,"['Administration, Inhalation', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/physiology', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cricetinae', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/chemistry', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', 'DNA/drug effects/physiology', 'DNA Adducts/chemistry/physiology', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/blood/chemistry', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Formaldehyde/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione/antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/physiology', 'Humans/blood', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Lymphocytes/chemistry/drug effects/physiology', 'Macaca mulatta/blood', 'Mice', 'Oxidoreductases/physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Toxicity Tests/methods', 'Tritium']",2004/09/29 05:00,2005/09/16 09:00,['2004/09/29 05:00'],"['2004/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.yrtph.2004.05.001 [doi]', 'S0273230004000571 [pii]']",ppublish,Regul Toxicol Pharmacol. 2004 Oct;40(2):92-106. doi: 10.1016/j.yrtph.2004.05.001.,,,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,94,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, two recent updated large industrial studies have found positive associations between some measures of formaldehyde exposure and increased leukemia, although another recent update of a large study did not find any association. We examine 18 epidemiology studies of workers exposed to formaldehyde where leukemia rates were reported. We summarize the findings across studies by using meta-analytic techniques to calculate the meta-relative risk values (mRR), confidence intervals, and heterogeneity of the risk estimates for several study characteristics. We also determine if publication or reporting biases may be affecting the estimates. We found a small increase in rate of leukemia overall among embalmers (mRR = 1.6, 95%CI 1.2-6.0), and pathologists/anatomists (mRR = 1.4, 95%CI 1.0-1.9). Industrial workers, who have been reported to have the highest formaldehyde exposures, had a mRR of 0.9 (95%CI 0.8-1.0). There was increased risk with increasing exposure in two large industrial studies, although the increased risk is one of these studies was not seen when an external comparison group is used. Also, another large industrial study with more highly exposure workers found decreased risk of leukemia among the highest exposed group. The long latency for leukemia deaths observed in the two industrial studies that reported increased risk was not consistent with a chemical carcinogen such as benzene. We found limited evidence of publication or reporting bias.

To date, this problem has received most attention in the context of cancer research, especially in tumor classification. Various feature selection methods and classifier design strategies also have been generally used and compared. However, most published articles on tumor classification have applied a certain technique to a certain dataset, and recently several researchers compared these techniques based on several public datasets. But, it has been verified that differently selected features reflect different aspects of the dataset and some selected features can obtain better solutions on some certain problems. At the same time, faced with a large amount of microarray data with little knowledge, it is difficult to find the intrinsic characteristics using traditional methods. In this paper, we attempt to introduce a combinational feature selection method in conjunction with ensemble neural networks to generally improve the accuracy and robustness of sample classification. RESULTS: We validate our new method on several recent publicly available datasets both with predictive accuracy of testing samples and through cross validation. Compared with the best performance of other current methods, remarkably improved results can be obtained using our new strategy on a wide range of different datasets. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, we conclude that our methods can obtain more information in microarray data to get more accurate classification and also can help to extract the latent marker genes of the diseases for better diagnosis and treatment.","['Liu, Bing', 'Cui, Qinghua', 'Jiang, Tianzi', 'Ma, Songde']","['Liu B', 'Cui Q', 'Jiang T', 'Ma S']","['National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100080, P.

It has been noted that ATL is incidentally associated with mother-to-child infection which occurs mainly through breast-feeding, elevated levels of proviral load, and insufficiency in HTLV-I-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. Among these, anti-tumor potentials of HTLV-I-specific CTL have been shown in ex vivo analysis of human HTLV-I-infected individuals and also in vivo experiments by using rat models of HTLV-I-infected lymphomas. In another rat model of HTLV-I-infection, orally infected rats showed significantly higher HTLV-I proviral load but lower HTLV-I-specific cellular immune responses than in intraperitoneally infected rats. As a result, persistent viral load was inversely correlated with levels of virus-specific T-cell responses. HTLV-I-specific T-cell responses in orally infected rats recovered by re-immunization. Conversion of Tax-specific T-cell responses from low to high levels was also observed in an ATL patient who obtained complete remission after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These findings suggest that HTLV-I-specific immune unresponsiveness associated with oral HTLV-I infection may be a potential risk factor for development of ATL, allowing expansion of the infected cell reservoir in vivo, and that immunological strategies targeting Tax may potentially reduce the risk of ATL and induce therapeutic effects on ATL.","['Kannagi, Mari']",['Kannagi M'],"['Department of Immunotherapeutics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Graduate School 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan. kann.impt@tmd.ac.jp']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Uirusu,Uirusu,0417475,IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Products, tax/immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology/transmission/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology', 'Humans', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/*virology', 'Rats', 'Risk Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",2004/09/29 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/29 05:00'],"['2004/09/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.2222/jsv.54.67 [doi]'],ppublish,Uirusu. 2004 Jun;54(1):67-74. doi: 10.2222/jsv.54.67.,,,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)']",,38,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, two patients treated with this gene therapy developed leukemia at a later time, and retroviral vector-mediated gene transfer was considered to trigger leukemogenesis; i.e. insertional mutagenesis caused activation of LMO 2 gene, which was one step toward leukemia development. To cope with this serious problem, basic studies are required to improve the safety of retroviral vectors and to develop the method for site-specific integration of transgenes. In addition, we have to develop technologies such as selective amplifier genes (SAGs), the system for selective expansion of transduced cells, in order to obtain therapeutic efficacy of hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy in many other disorders. Moreover, clinical applications of AAV vector are promising from the standpoint of safety issue, because this vector is derived from non-pathogenic virus. AAV vector is appropriate for gene transfer into neurons, muscles, and hepatocytes. For example, gene therapy for Parkinson's disease is investigated using AAV vectors.

We used a proteomic approach based on two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to search for biomarkers related to the complete remission (CR) state of AML patients. We detected one AML-related protein, which was identified as the B-cell translocation gene 1 (BTG1) protein that belongs to anti-proliferative protein family. In the CR state of AML-M2 and M3 patients (by French-American-British subtype classification), the BTG1 protein was upregulated in bone marrow mononuclear cells. It was also expressed robustly in normal bone marrow mononuclear cells. In addition, the BTG1 levels in AML-M2 patients in a non-remission state after therapy did not increase as they did before therapy. Overexpression of BTG1 mRNA was also observed in the CR state of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-treated AML-M3 patients and ATRA-treated HL-60 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that BTG1 may play a role in the differentiation process of myeloid cells and can therefore be used as a potential treatment-related biomarker for monitoring the remission status of AML-M2 and M3 patients.","['Cho, Jae-We', 'Kim, Jeong Jung', 'Park, Sung Goo', 'Lee, Do Hee', 'Lee, Sang Chul', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon', 'Park, Byoung Chul', 'Cho, Sayeon']","['Cho JW', 'Kim JJ', 'Park SG', 'Lee DH', 'Lee SC', 'Kim HJ', 'Park BC', 'Cho S']","['Department of Microbiology, College of Medicine, Seonam University, Namwon, Chunpook, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Proteomics,Proteomics,101092707,IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",2004/09/28 05:00,2005/04/14 09:00,['2004/09/28 05:00'],"['2004/09/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/28 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pmic.200400968 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteomics. 2004 Nov;4(11):3456-63. doi: 10.1002/pmic.200400968.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '146835-72-5 (BTG1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TLS is very rare in MM with ten reported cases, including approximately 1% of patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell support (ASCT). We report here a patient with refractory MM and deletion 13q, who had received more than four lines of previous treatment, including two ASCT, and had relapsed. The patient received bortezomib, as a single agent, at a dose of 1.3 mg/m(2) twice per week for 2 weeks, in a 3-week cycle, and developed TLS after the second dose of cycle one. Bortezomib therapy, due to the rapidity of its action, may result in TLS in myeloma patients who have rapidly proliferative disease with a high tumour burden. Therefore, TLS should be looked for during the first cycle of bortezomib treatment and suitable precautions should be considered.","['Terpos, Evangelos', 'Politou, Marianna', 'Rahemtulla, Amin']","['Terpos E', 'Politou M', 'Rahemtulla A']","['Department of Haematology, Faculty of Medicine Imperial College, Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Road, W12 0NN London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Boronic Acids/*adverse effects', 'Bortezomib', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Pyrazines/*adverse effects', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/*etiology']",2004/09/28 05:00,2005/07/01 09:00,['2004/09/28 05:00'],"['2004/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/28 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00432-004-0593-4 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2004 Oct;130(10):623-5. doi: 10.1007/s00432-004-0593-4.

METHODS: The expression level of mdr1 mRNA was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Existence of the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenomenon was assessed via cellular uptake of 99mTc-sestamibi (MIBI), a known substrate for P-glycoprotein. A 15-mer phosphorothioate antisense ODN complementary to the sequences located at -1 to 14 of mdr1 mRNA and its corresponding sense ODN were conjugated with the cyclic anhydride of diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (cDTPA) via an amino group linked to the terminal phosphate at the 5' end at pH 8-9. The DTPA-ODN complexes at concentrations of 0.1-17.4 microM were reacted with 111InCl3 at pH 5 for 1 h. The hybridization affinity of labeled ODN was evaluated with size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography following incubation with the complementary sequence. Cellular uptake of labeled ODN was examined in vitro. Furthermore, enhancing effects of synthetic lipid carriers (Transfast) on transmembrane delivery of ODN were assessed. RESULTS: P388/R cells displayed intense mdr1 mRNA expression in comparison with P388/S cells. 99mTc-MIBI uptake in P388/S cells was higher than that in P388/R cells. Specific radioactivity up to 1,634 MBq/nmol was achieved via elevation of added radioactivity relative to ODN molar amount. The hybridization affinity of antisense 111In-ODN was preserved at approximately 85% irrespective of specific activity. Cellular uptake of antisense 111In-ODN did not differ from that of sense 111In-ODN in either P388/S cells or P388/R cells. However, lipid carrier incorporation significantly increased transmembrane delivery of 111In-ODN; moreover, specific uptake of antisense 111In-ODN was demonstrated in P388/R cells. CONCLUSION: Radiolabeling of ODN at high specific radioactivity and specific uptake of antisense 111In-ODN in drug-resistant cells may facilitate future gene imaging of mdr1 mRNA.","['Bai, Jingming', 'Yokoyama, Kunihiko', 'Kinuya, Seigo', 'Shiba, Kazuhiro', 'Matsushita, Ryo', 'Nomura, Masaaki', 'Michigishi, Takatoshi', 'Tonami, Norihisa']","['Bai J', 'Yokoyama K', 'Kinuya S', 'Shiba K', 'Matsushita R', 'Nomura M', 'Michigishi T', 'Tonami N']","['Department of Biotracer Medicine (Nuclear Medicine), Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, 13-1 Takara-machi, Kanazawa, 920-8640 Japan. bjingming@nmd.m.kanazawa-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,101140988,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Indium Radioisotopes/*pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia/*diagnostic imaging/genetics/*metabolism', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotides/*pharmacokinetics', 'RNA/*metabolism', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/pharmacokinetics']",2004/09/28 05:00,2005/07/01 09:00,['2004/09/28 05:00'],"['2004/09/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/28 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00259-004-1666-y [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2004 Nov;31(11):1523-9. doi: 10.1007/s00259-004-1666-y.

Recent data indicate that besides differences in major histocompatibility and minor histocompatibility antigens, cytokine gene polymorphisms have a predictive value for the complication of GVHD. Patients with a high anti-inflammatory IL-10 production have been demonstrated to be protected from GVHD while patients with high TNF-alpha serum levels were more at risk for GVHD. Pharmacological immunosuppression for GVHD prophylaxis and therapy, including unspecific approaches with corticosteroids or methotrexate (MTX), as well as more specific therapy with cyclosporin A (CsA), tacrolimus (FK506), sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), antithymocyte globulin (ATG), and monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against CD3, CD25, CD52, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4, CD40 ligand, or TNF-alpha, have been proven to be effective. Recent data on novel techniques to selectively deplete alloreactive T cells by removal, destruction, or anergy induction while preserving leukemia-specific T-cell clones suggest a clinical benefit from these approaches. Gene-modified T cells that can selectively be depleted and CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells are under investigation for their ability to modulate alloreactivity after HSCT. With a better understanding of the immunopathogenesis of acute GVHD and the technical improvement of recently described therapeutic approaches, such as removal of naive T cells, selection of Th2 cells, suicide gene transduced T cells, and adoptive transfer of regulatory T cells, the use of alloreactivity as a treatment modality may be expanded to nonhematological disease entities such as solid tumors or autoimmune disorders.","['Zeiser, Robert', 'Marks, Reinhard', 'Bertz, Hartmut', 'Finke, Jurgen']","['Zeiser R', 'Marks R', 'Bertz H', 'Finke J']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Albert Ludwigs University Medical Center Freiburg, Hugstetterstr. 55, 79106 Freiburg, Germany. zeiser@mm11.ukl.uni-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications/immunology/*prevention & control/*therapy', 'HLA Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/immunology', ""Peyer's Patches/immunology""]",2004/09/28 05:00,2004/10/22 09:00,['2004/09/28 05:00'],"['2004/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/28 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-004-0890-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2004 Sep;83(9):551-65. doi: 10.1007/s00277-004-0890-7.

This gene rearrangement results in the production of a novel oncoprotein, BCR/ABL, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. There is compelling evidence that the malignant transformation by BCR/ABL is critically dependent on its Abl tyrosine kinase activity. Also the bcr part of the hybrid gene takes part in realization of the malignant phenotype. We supposed that additional mutations accumulate in this region of the BCR/ABL oncogene during the development of the malignant blast crisis in CML patients. In ALL patients having p210 fusion protein the mutations were supposed to be preexisting. Sequencing of PCR product of the BCR/ABL gene (Dbl, PH region) showed that along with single-nucleotide substitutions other mutations, mostly deletions, had occurred. In an ALL patient a deletion of the 5th exon was detected. The size of the deletions varied from 36 to 220 amino acids. For one case of blast crisis of CML changes in the character of actin organization were observed.

We have designed and examined the effects of DNAzymes targeting the PML/RARalpha fusion gene in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). The DNAzymes (DZ1 and DZ3) were designed to cleave the PML/RARalpha transcript at the GC nucleotides at the fusion point and three nucleotides upstream of that respectively. Disabled DNAzymes were synthesised and used as controls. Cell-free cleavage reactions were performed on total RNA from NB4 cell line and PML/RARalpha and RARalpha-amplified RNA fragments (aRNA). Postcleavage examination showed that DZ1 and DZ3 cleave PML/RARalpha efficiently and specifically. NB4 APL cells transfected with DZ1 or DZ3 showed a significant suppression of PML/RARalpha protein expression. These DNAzymes also inhibited the proliferation of NB4 cells, reduced the viability rate, and induced apoptosis in these cells. The disabled DNAzymes showed no effect on NB4 cells. The two DNAzymes did not produce any significant effect on K562 cells, which were used as control cells. DNAzymes are more resistant to serum than ribozymes. These data show that targeting the PML/RARalpha fusion gene with DNAzymes can induce apoptosis in APL cells and may have a role in the treatment of APL. They also show DNAzymes are promising tools for targeting specific genes in leukaemia.","['Kabuli, Majid', 'Yin, John Ahman Liu', 'Tobal, Khalid']","['Kabuli M', 'Yin JA', 'Tobal K']","['Molecular Oncology Group, University Department of Haematology, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Pairing', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/chemistry/drug effects', 'Cell-Free System', 'DNA, Catalytic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Targeting', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'K562 Cells/chemistry/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Liposomes/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2004/09/28 05:00,2005/04/01 09:00,['2004/09/28 05:00'],"['2004/09/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.thj.6200535 [doi]', '6200535 [pii]']",ppublish,Hematol J. 2004;5(5):426-33. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200535.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Catalytic)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Large systematic studies of cytogenetic abnormalities in AML patients from Southeast Asia are not available. The karyotypic patterns in AML patients from a single center in Singapore were studied and compared with reports from other regions of the world to identify possible geographic heterogeneity. METHODS: Analysis was performed on 501 consecutive de novo AML patients diagnosed according to the FAB criteria in the Singapore General Hospital. The cytogenetic findings were analyzed for possible associations between karyotypic pattern and the age, gender, ethnicity as well as morphological (FAB) subtypes. RESULTS: A total of 454 patients were studied of which 275(61%) had abnormal cytogenetics(median age 48 years). The t(15;17) and trisomy 8 were the most frequent karyotypic abnormalities - seen in 52(11%) and 33(7.3%) cases, respectively. Inv(lf) and t(16;16) were uncommon, seen only in five (1.1%) cases. The abnormalities del 5/5q and del 7/7q were seen in 30(6.6%) and 32(7%) of the cases. Complex karyotypes were seen in 78(17%) of the cases.Recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities correlated with the FAB subtypes. In all, 21 novel cytogenetic abnormalities were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Certain differences such as the age at presentation and frequency of recurrent balanced translocations were noted in comparison to previous reports. These point to the need for extensive epidemiological studies to clarify the role of genetic as well as geographic heterogeneity in the pathogenesis of AML.","['Enjeti, Anoop Kumar', 'Tien, Sim Leng', 'Sivaswaren, Christina Rudduck']","['Enjeti AK', 'Tien SL', 'Sivaswaren CR']","['Cytogenetics Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore. ghetsl@sgh,com.sg']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aneuploidy', 'China/ethnology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human/*ultrastructure', 'Ethnicity/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India/ethnology', 'Indonesia/ethnology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Malaysia/ethnology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Singapore/epidemiology']",2004/09/28 05:00,2005/04/01 09:00,['2004/09/28 05:00'],"['2004/09/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.thj.6200544 [doi]', '6200544 [pii]']",ppublish,Hematol J. 2004;5(5):419-25. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200544.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, controlled studies are necessary to elucidate the place of NST in the therapy of high-risk acute leukemias.","['Massenkeil, Gero', 'Nagy, Marion', 'Le Coutre, Philipp', 'Heine, Felicitas', 'Rosen, Oliver', 'Dorken, Berud', 'Arnold, Renate']","['Massenkeil G', 'Nagy M', 'Le Coutre P', 'Heine F', 'Rosen O', 'Dorken B', 'Arnold R']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Charite, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany. gero.massenkeil@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/administration & dosage', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Contraindications', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Infection Control/methods', 'Infections/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycophenolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Mycoses/complications', 'Myeloablative Agonists', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Risk', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2004/09/28 05:00,2005/04/01 09:00,['2004/09/28 05:00'],"['2004/09/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.thj.6200543 [doi]', '6200543 [pii]']",ppublish,Hematol J. 2004;5(5):395-402. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200543.,,,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 95 patients were included in the G-CSF group, 67 in the GM-CSF group, and 74 in the control group. Overall, CSFs showed a trend for a reduced incidence of severe infections and of days with antibiotics. Median time for neutrophil recovery was 17 days with G-CSF, 18 days with GM-CSF, and 21 days without CSF. In Trial 2, duration of hospitalization was significantly lower in the G-CSF group than in the other groups (P < 0.05). Time to neutrophil recovery was also significantly shorter (P < 0.05) and severe infections were lower in the G-CSF group (P = 0.01).

METHODS: Case report and literature review. RESULTS: A 64-year-old man presented with redness and irritation of both eyes. The patient also had blistering lesions on the roof of his mouth, trunk, and buttocks as well as bilateral conjunctival ulceration and symblepharon formation. A complete blood count performed before initiating treatment of presumed mucous membrane pemphigoid revealed a markedly increased white blood cell count (83,920) with a predominance of lymphocytes. Hematologic evaluation including immunophenotyping flow cytometry resulted in the diagnosis of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cyclophosphamide treatment improved his MMP and decreased the white blood cell count. CONCLUSIONS: Mucous membrane pemphigoid has been reported in association with a variety of nonhematologic malignancies. This case suggests that mucous membrane pemphigoid may also occur in B-cell CLL and supports the concept that autoantibodies play a role in the pathogenesis of this cicatricial conjunctival disease.","['Seth, Rajeev K', 'Su, Grant W', 'Pflugfelder, Stephen C']","['Seth RK', 'Su GW', 'Pflugfelder SC']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Cullen Eye Institute, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cornea,Cornea,8216186,IM,"['Conjunctival Diseases/*etiology/pathology', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pemphigoid, Benign Mucous Membrane/*complications/drug therapy', 'Ulcer/*etiology/pathology']",2004/09/28 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/28 05:00'],"['2004/09/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['00003226-200410000-00020 [pii]', '10.1097/01.ico.0000126437.33375.6c [doi]']",ppublish,Cornea. 2004 Oct;23(7):740-3. doi: 10.1097/01.ico.0000126437.33375.6c.,,,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,35,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objectives of the study were to evaluate FeLV LTR variation within the cohort, to determine whether the FeLV-945 LTR was associated uniquely with multicentric lymphoma and to evaluate functional attributes that may have contributed selective advantage to the predominant LTR variants observed. T-cell tumours uniformly contained LTRs with duplicated enhancer sequences, although enhancer duplications conferred little transcriptional advantage. Non-T-cell malignant, proliferative and degenerative diseases contained LTRs with two, three or four tandemly repeated copies of the 21 bp sequence originally identified in FeLV-945. While the length and termini of enhancer duplications were variable, the 21 bp repeat unit was invariant.

Foamy viruses offer distinct advantages over other retroviruses for development as vectors for gene therapy.

The same relative efficiency was found following transduction of cells that had been arrested by gamma-irradiation or with mitomycin C. Cells that were exposed to vector during aphidicolin arrest and were subsequently allowed to cycle were transduced significantly better by PFV than by MLV.

The syndrome associated with t(8;13)(p11;q12) results in expression of the ZNF198-fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1 fusion tyrosine kinase. Current empirically derived cytotoxic chemotherapy is inadequate for treatment of this disease. We hypothesized that small-molecule inhibitors of the ZNF198-FGFR1 fusion would have therapeutic efficacy. We characterized the transforming activity of ZNF198-FGFR1 in hematopoietic cells in vitro and in vivo. Expression of ZNF198-FGFR1 in primary murine hematopoietic cells caused a myeloproliferative syndrome in mice that recapitulated the human MPD phenotype. Transformation in these assays, and activation of the downstream effector molecules PLC-gamma, STAT5, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT, required the proline-rich domains, but not the ZNF domains, of ZNF198. A small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PKC412 (N-benzoyl-staurosporine) effectively inhibited ZNF198-FGFR1 tyrosine kinase activity and activation of downstream effector pathways, and inhibited proliferation of ZNF198-FGFR1 transformed Ba/F3 cells. Furthermore, treatment with PKC412 resulted in statistically significant prolongation of survival in the murine model of ZNF198-FGFR1-induced MPD. Based in part on these data, PKC412 was administered to a patient with t(8;13)(p11;q12) and was efficacious in treatment of progressive myeloproliferative disorder with organomegaly. Therefore, PKC412 may be a useful therapy for treatment of human stem cell leukemia-lymphoma syndrome.","['Chen, Jing', 'Deangelo, Daniel J', 'Kutok, Jeffery L', 'Williams, Ifor R', 'Lee, Benjamin H', 'Wadleigh, Martha', 'Duclos, Nicole', 'Cohen, Sarah', 'Adelsperger, Jennifer', 'Okabe, Rachel', 'Coburn, Allison', 'Galinsky, Ilene', 'Huntly, Brian', 'Cohen, Pamela S', 'Meyer, Thomas', 'Fabbro, Doriano', 'Roesel, Johannes', 'Banerji, Lolita', 'Griffin, James D', 'Xiao, Sheng', 'Fletcher, Jonathan A', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Gilliland, D Gary']","['Chen J', 'Deangelo DJ', 'Kutok JL', 'Williams IR', 'Lee BH', 'Wadleigh M', 'Duclos N', 'Cohen S', 'Adelsperger J', 'Okabe R', 'Coburn A', 'Galinsky I', 'Huntly B', 'Cohen PS', 'Meyer T', 'Fabbro D', 'Roesel J', 'Banerji L', 'Griffin JD', 'Xiao S', 'Fletcher JA', 'Stone RM', 'Gilliland DG']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Transformation, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Zinc Fingers']",2004/09/28 05:00,2004/11/05 09:00,['2004/09/28 05:00'],"['2004/09/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0404438101 [doi]', '0404438101 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Oct 5;101(40):14479-84. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0404438101.

We describe the high resolution CT (HRCT) findings of 13 patients with CMV pneumonia diagnosed after allogenic BMT. The study included 13 consecutive patients who developed CMV pneumonia after BMT and who had HRCT of the chest performed within 24 h of the onset of symptoms. HRCT scans were reviewed by two radiologists who assessed pattern and distribution of findings. There were nine male and four female patients, ranging from 9 years to 56 years of age (mean age 33 years). BMT was performed for treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (54%), severe aplastic anaemia (23%), acute myelogenous leukaemia (15%) and Fanconi's anaemia (8%). The time elapsed until diagnosis ranged from +18 days to +405 days (median of 54 days, mean +81.6 days). The predominant patterns of abnormality on HRCT scans were ground-glass opacities (69%), small centrilobular nodules (69%) and air-space opacities (54%). The abnormalities were distributed in the central and peripheral zones of the lungs in six cases, only in the periphery in four cases, and only in the central zone in three cases.

METHODS: Twenty adult patients with malignant hematologic diseases were paired using statistical methods, and the 10 pairs were divided into 2 equal groups. For non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the treatment regimen adopted intravenous infusion of cytoxan (2 g/d for 1 or 2 d) and VP16 (0.2 g/d for 1 to 3 d), while for acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, Ara-C (2 g/d for 1 to 3 d) and VP16 (0.2 g/d for 1 to 3 d) were used. When the while blood cell count (WBC) was below 1.0 x10(9)/L, G-CSF and GM-CSF were administered subcutaneously at the same dose of 2.5 microg/d.kg in the 10 patients in the experimental group, while the patients in the control group received only 5 microg/d.kg G-CSF, both for 5 to 6 d. After WBC>5.0 x 10(9)/L, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) were separated by CS-3000 pluse separator and CD34+ cells were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The purity of the isolated PBMNC was 95%-99%. In the experimental group, the mean number of CD34+ cells acquired was 9.4 x 10(6)/kg ranging from 8.4 x 10(6) to 10.2 x 10(6)/kg, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) was 42.4 x 10(4)/kg on average ranging from 21.9 x 10(4) to 72.8 x 10(4)/kg, as compared with 4.8 x 10(6)/kg [(4.1-8.3) x10(6)/kg] for CD34+ cells and 28.1 x 10(4)/kg [(7.1-60.2) x 10(4)/kg] for CFU-GM in the control group (P<0.05). No obvious difference was observed between the two groups in terms of the adverse effects of the treatment (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Combined use of G-CSF and GM-CSF can be more effective than the exclusive use of GM-CSF for mobilizing CD34+ cells.","['Meng, Fan-yi', 'Xu, Bing', 'Sun, Jin', 'Yang, Yi', 'Niu, Jing-na']","['Meng FY', 'Xu B', 'Sun J', 'Yang Y', 'Niu JN']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, First Military Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Di Yi Jun Yi Da Xue Xue Bao,Di 1 jun yi da xue xue bao = Academic journal of the first medical college of PLA,9426110,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*biosynthesis', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy']",2004/09/28 05:00,2007/05/05 09:00,['2004/09/28 05:00'],"['2004/09/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/28 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Di Yi Jun Yi Da Xue Xue Bao. 2004 Sep;24(9):1051-2.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper assesses the effect of the change on risk estimates for radiation-related solid cancer and leukemia mortality. The changes in dose estimates were smaller than many had anticipated, with the primary systematic change being an increase of about 10% in gamma-ray estimates for both cities. In particular, an anticipated large increase of the neutron component in Hiroshima for low-dose survivors did not materialize. However, DS02 improves on DS86 in many details, including the specifics of the radiation released by the bombs and the effects of shielding by structures and terrain. The data used here extend the last reported follow-up for solid cancers by 3 years, with a total of 10,085 deaths, and extends the follow-up for leukemia by 10 years, with a total of 296 deaths. For both solid cancer and leukemia, estimated age-time patterns and sex difference are virtually unchanged by the dosimetry revision. The estimates of solid-cancer radiation risk per sievert and the curvilinear dose response for leukemia are both decreased by about 8% by the dosimetry revision, due to the increase in the gamma-ray dose estimates. The apparent shape of the dose response is virtually unchanged by the dosimetry revision, but for solid cancers, the additional 3 years of follow-up has some effect. In particular, there is for the first time a statistically significant upward curvature for solid cancer on the restricted dose range 0-2 Sv. However, the low-dose slope of a linear-quadratic fit to that dose range should probably not be relied on for risk estimation, since that is substantially smaller than the linear slopes on ranges 0-1 Sv, 0-0.5 Sv, and 0- 0.25 Sv. Although it was anticipated that the new dosimetry system might reduce some apparent dose overestimates for Nagasaki factory workers, this did not materialize, and factory workers have significantly lower risk estimates. Whether or not one makes allowance for this, there is no statistically significant city difference in the estimated cancer risk.","['Preston, Dale L', 'Pierce, Donald A', 'Shimizu, Yukiko', 'Cullings, Harry M', 'Fujita, Shoichiro', 'Funamoto, Sachiyo', 'Kodama, Kazunori']","['Preston DL', 'Pierce DA', 'Shimizu Y', 'Cullings HM', 'Fujita S', 'Funamoto S', 'Kodama K']","['Department of Statistics, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan. preston@rerf.or.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colonic Neoplasms/etiology/mortality', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Japan', 'Leukemia/etiology/mortality', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Neoplasms/*etiology/*mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/mortality', 'Neutrons', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Radiometry/*methods', 'Risk', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Time Factors']",2004/09/28 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/28 05:00'],"['2004/09/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['RR3232 [pii]', '10.1667/rr3232 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 2004 Oct;162(4):377-89. doi: 10.1667/rr3232.,,,,,,,,,,['Radiat Res. 2005 Apr;163(4):477; author reply 477.

The practicality and efficacy of TAT is tested by in vitro and in vivo studies in melanoma, leukaemia, colorectal, breast and prostate cancers, and by a phase 1 trial of intralesional TAT for melanoma. The alpha-emitting radioisotope used is Bi-213, which is eluted from the Ac-225 generator and chelated to a cancer specific monoclonal antibody (mab) or protein (e.g. plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 PAI2) to form the alpha-conjugate (AC). Stable alpha-ACs have been produced which have been tested for specificity and cytotoxicity in vitro against melanoma (9.2.27 mab), leukaemia (WM60), colorectal (C30.6), breast (PAI2, herceptin), ovarian (PAI2, herceptin, C595), prostate (PAI2, J591) and pancreatic (PAI2, C595) cancers. Subcutaneous inoculation of 1-1.5 million human cancer cells into the flanks of nude mice causes tumours to grow in all mice. Tumour growth is compared for untreated controls, nonspecific AC and specific AC, for local (subcutaneous) and systemic (tail vein or intraperitoneal) injection models. The 213Bi-9.2.27 AC is injected into secondary skin melanomas in stage 4 patients in a dose escalation study to determine the effective tolerance dose, and to measure kinematics to obtain the equivalent dose to organs. In vitro studies show that TAT is one to two orders of magnitude more cytotoxic to targeted cells than non-specific ACs, specific beta emitting conjugates or free isotopes. In vivo local TAT at 2 days post-inoculation completely prevents tumour formation for all cancers tested so far. Intra-lesional TAT can completely regress advanced sc melanoma but is less successful for breast and prostate cancers. Systemic TAT inhibits the growth of sc melanoma xenografts and gives almost complete control of breast and prostate cancer tumour growth. Intralesional doses up to 450 microCi in human patients are effective in regressing melanomas, with no concomitant complications. These results point to the application of local and systemic TAT in the management of secondary cancer. Results of the phase 1 clinical trial of TAT of subcutaneous, secondary melanoma indicate proof of the principle that TAT can make tumours in patients regress.","['Allen, Barry J', 'Raja, Chand', 'Rizvi, Syed', 'Li, Yong', 'Tsui, Wendy', 'Zhang, David', 'Song, Emma', 'Qu, Chang Fa', 'Kearsley, John', 'Graham, Peter', 'Thompson, John']","['Allen BJ', 'Raja C', 'Rizvi S', 'Li Y', 'Tsui W', 'Zhang D', 'Song E', 'Qu CF', 'Kearsley J', 'Graham P', 'Thompson J']","['Centre for Experimental Radiation Oncology, St George Cancer Care Centre, Kogarah 2217, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Phys Med Biol,Physics in medicine and biology,0401220,IM,"['Alpha Particles', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry', 'Apoptosis', 'Bismuth/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Melanoma/radiotherapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Radioisotopes/therapeutic use', 'Radiotherapy/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Skin Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Time Factors']",2004/09/28 05:00,2005/02/11 09:00,['2004/09/28 05:00'],"['2004/09/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/28 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1088/0031-9155/49/16/016 [doi]'],ppublish,Phys Med Biol. 2004 Aug 21;49(16):3703-12. doi: 10.1088/0031-9155/49/16/016.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', 'U015TT5I8H (Bismuth)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 40 untreated patients with acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukaemia and 40 healthy controls, before the therapy and after remission. The correlation between the activity of the enzymes and the efficacy of therapy were established. The enzyme activities were measured by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), using the method described by Amici. For statistical analysis, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon methods were used. RESULTS: Before the therapy, Pyrimidine 5'nucleotidase I levels in the leukaemic group were found to be significantly elevated when compared to the control group (p<0.001). Also Pyrimidine 5'nucleotidase II levels were significantly elevated before the therapy and during remission (p<0.02 and p<0.001 respectively). The isoenzyme activities were compared in patients who were in remission, who did not respond to therapy and in patients who died during the therapy, but no significant difference was found. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that, Pyrimidine 5'nucleotidase I and II activities can be used as markers for diagnosis and follow up of remission in patients with acute leukaemia.

It has been used to successfully treat graft versus host disease and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CD52 is expressed on normal lymphocytes, monocytes, and some dendritic cell subsets. However, normal Langerhans cells (LC's) in the skin do not bind alemtuzumab. We sought to determine whether the pathologic LC's of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) express CD52 and thus could be targeted by this antibody. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed on both frozen and fixed/paraffin-embedded tissue specimens using either Campath-1G (the parental rat isotype) or Campath-1H (the humanized version of Campath in clinical use). RESULTS: Both Campath-1H and Campath-1G were found to bind to the pathologic LC's in LCH, but not the normal LC's of skin. Specific staining was demonstrated in all (13 of 13) LCH specimens examined, though staining was somewhat variable among specimens, and tended to be weaker in paraffin-embedded specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of CD52 by the pathologic LC's seen in LCH suggests that alemtuzumab may represent a new, targeted therapy for this disease. Such therapy is particularly needed for patients with refractory, high-risk disease. Further investigation of the possible clinical use of this antibody in these patients is warranted.","['Jordan, Michael B', 'McClain, Kenneth L', 'Yan, Xiaotian', 'Hicks, John', 'Jaffe, Ronald']","['Jordan MB', 'McClain KL', 'Yan X', 'Hicks J', 'Jaffe R']","[""Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and The Children's Hospital, Denver, Colorado, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Glycoproteins/analysis/*immunology', 'Histiocytosis, Langerhans-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Langerhans Cells/*immunology']",2004/09/25 05:00,2005/03/18 09:00,['2004/09/25 05:00'],"['2004/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20181 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Mar;44(3):251-4. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20181.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Cd52 protein, rat)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']","['(c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between June and December 2000 patients received prophylactic ciprofloxacin following DI courses. The rates of hospitalization and bacteremias were compared to ALL patients who had received between one and three DI courses prior to June 2000. RESULTS: There were 69 patients who received a total of 194 DIs (controls 130; study group 64). The rate of hospitalization was 90% in the controls and 58% in the study group (P < 0.001). The median hospital stay was 10.1 days for controls and 6.0 for the study group (P < 0.001). Intensive care unit admissions were reduced from 12 to 1.5% (P = 0.02). The overall rate of proven bacteremia was reduced from 22 to 9% (P = 0.028). There were no Gram-negative bacteremias in the study group compared to 10 (7.7%) in the controls (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to historical controls, patients in this study receiving prophylactic ciprofloxacin had a reduced rate and duration of hospitalization and incidence of Gram-negative bacteremia.","['Yousef, Abdelmottaleb A', 'Fryer, Christopher J H', 'Chedid, Fares D', 'Abbas, Adil A H', 'Felimban, Sami K', 'Khattab, Taha M']","['Yousef AA', 'Fryer CJ', 'Chedid FD', 'Abbas AA', 'Felimban SK', 'Khattab TM']","['Princess Noorah Oncology Center, King Abdullaziz Medical City, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Infective Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Bacteremia/*complications/drug therapy/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ciprofloxacin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/microbiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/09/25 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/25 05:00'],"['2004/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20065 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2004 Nov;43(6):637-43. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20065.,,,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)']","['(c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, what is the relationship between TMD and AMKL? Second, what specific genetic alterations contribute to the leukemic process? Finally, what factors lead to the increased predisposition to these myeloid disorders? In this review I will summarize important new insights into the biology of TMD and AMKL gained from the recent discovery that GATA1, a gene that encodes an essential hematopoietic transcription factor, is mutated in the leukemic blasts from nearly all patients with these malignancies. In addition, I will discuss whether assaying for the presence of a GATA1 mutation can aid in the diagnosis of these and related megakaryoblastic leukemias. Future research aimed at defining the activity of mutant GATA-1 protein and identifying interacting factors encoded by chromosome 21 will likely lead to an even greater understanding of this intriguing leukemia.","['Crispino, John D']",['Crispino JD'],"['Ben May Institute for Cancer Research, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA. crispino@huggins.bsd.uchicago.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Child', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/*genetics', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*diagnosis/etiology/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/etiology/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2004/09/25 05:00,2005/01/05 09:00,['2004/09/25 05:00'],"['2004/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20066 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Jan;44(1):40-4. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20066.,"['R01 CA101774/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA101774-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']","['(c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",30,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is best exemplified in cases of children with Down syndrome (DS), who have significantly higher risks of developing leukemia compared to non-DS children and distinctive treatment outcomes, particularly in cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The high event-free survival (EFS) rates of DS AML patients and in particular, patients with megakaryocytic leukemia (AMkL), at least in part reflects an increased sensitivity to cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) secondary to increased expression of the chromosome 21-localized gene, cystathionine-beta-synthase, and potentially global mechanisms which increase the susceptibility of cells to undergo apoptosis. Somatic mutations of the X-linked transcription factor gene, GATA1, have been detected uniformly and exclusively in DS AMkL cases, which may lead to altered expression of GATA1 target genes and alter the metabolism of drugs including ara-C. Hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells with extra copies of chromosome 21, generate higher levels of the active methotrexate (MTX) metabolite, MTX polyglutamates. This is on account of increased intracellular transport of MTX via the reduced folate carrier (RFC) whose gene is localized to chromosome 21 and may also account for the increased MTX-associated toxicity of DS ALL patients. Microarray technology should lead to the identification of additional gene targets linked to the treatment response of specific cytogenetic leukemia subgroups.","['Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Ge, Yubin']","['Taub JW', 'Ge Y']","['Experimental and Clinical Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, Michigan, USA. jtaub@med.wayne.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/adverse effects/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis']",2004/09/25 05:00,2005/01/05 09:00,['2004/09/25 05:00'],"['2004/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20092 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Jan;44(1):33-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20092.,['R01 CA92308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']","['(c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",45,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We investigated 115 patients and 86 controls assessing serum cystatin C concentration (CysC), urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity (NAG), and microalbuminuria. Proteinuria was quantified and electrophoresis performed. Polymorphism of the angiotensin convertase enzyme (ACE) gene was determined by genomic PCR. RESULTS: CysC was elevated in Wilms tumor (WT) patients. Gross proteinuria was observed in 30 patients including three patients with progressive proteinuria who improved on ACE-inhibitor treatment. Neither patients with proteinuria nor the entire study population differed from controls with respect to ACE polymorphism. Pathologically elevated urinary NAG was noted in 38% of leukemia/lymphoma, 54% of solid tumor, 20% of WT survivors. A similar distribution of pathological microalbuminuria was found. CONCLUSIONS: Mild-to-moderate subclinical glomerular and tubular damage can be identified in many childhood cancer survivors.

The aim of the present study was to estimate the incidence of childhood cancer from six Childhood Cancer Registries covering 32% of France. PROCEDURE: Incident cancer cases diagnosed between 1990 and 1999 in children (0-14 years) resident in the administrative areas covered by each Registry were included. Annual age-standardized rates (ASRs) were adjusted by the world population. The estimated annual percent change (EAPC) was used to measure trend towards changes in the annual age-standardized incidence rate. RESULTS: With 4234 registered cases, the ASRs per million children were 137.5 for all cancers combined, 42.3 for leukemia, 29.1 for central-nervous-system tumors, 15.6 for lymphomas, 14.1 for sympathetic-nervous-system tumors, and 9.1 for renal tumors. The ASR of all cancers combined was slightly higher in males (145.8 per million children) than in females (128.7 per million children) with an M/F ratio of 1.2. No significant incidence trend was observed, with an EAPC of +0.2% [IC 95% (-2.5; +3.0); P = 0.89].

Mutations in GATA1 have been identified in trisomy 21 patients with AMKL, and this lesion is thought to be an initial event by virtue of its presence during transient leukemia. Transient leukemia is also observed in phenotypically normal infants albeit much less commonly so. Almost all these infants are mosaic for trisomy 21, and the clinical course of transient leukemia recapitulates that observed in constitutional trisomy 21. We report a phenotypically normal infant with tetrasomy 21 transient leukemia, GATA1 mutation within exon 2, and trisomy 21 mosaicism restricted to the hematopoietic tissue. Two years after diagnosis, low levels of trisomy 21 persisted in the peripheral blood, which resolved 2.5 years after diagnosis. The GATA1 mutation was not detected at last follow-up. The literature review identified 32 phenotypically normal infants with transient leukemia. Ninety-one percent (29 of 32) were observed and three received chemotherapy at diagnosis of transient leukemia. Nineteen percent (6 of 32) developed acute leukemia, and four continued in remission (two died).

Methemoglobinemia is a known complication of dapsone, but its true frequency and pathogenesis in childhood cancer patients are unknown. Additionally, practice guidelines for evaluation and management of dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia are not available. PROCEDURE: We studied 15 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) receiving dapsone for PCP prophylaxis to determine the frequency of methemoglobinemia, and correlate its occurrence with cytochrome b5 reductase (Cb5R) enzyme levels. Ten children with ALL receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethaxazole (TMP-SMX) were studied as controls. All patients underwent physical examination, pulse oximetry, and methemoglobin (metHb) estimation. Commercially available assay was used to measure Cb5R levels. RESULTS: Three (20%) patients receiving dapsone developed symptomatic methemoglobinemia. Average duration of dapsone prophylaxis prior to diagnosis was 6.6 weeks (range 3.5-10 weeks). Mean metHb level in symptomatic patients was 11.67%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0-25.79 (range 7-18%), and 1.37%; 95% CI 0.6-2.14 (range 0.02-3%) in asymptomatic patients (P = 0.09), whereas the mean metHb level in the control group was 0.54%; 95% CI 0.35-0.73 (range 0.1-0.8%) (asymptomatic vs control P < 0.0001). Mean Cb5R level in symptomatic patients was 8.6 IU/g Hb; 95% CI 3.4-13.7 (range 6.9-10.9) compared to 12.5 IU/g Hb; 95% CI 11.1-13.9 (range 10.8-14.6) in asymptomatic patients (P = 0.06). Two symptomatic patients had Cb5R levels at or below 50% of normal, consistent with heterozygosity. Parental studies for Cb5R levels were suggestive of a carrier state in one of each patient's parents. CONCLUSIONS: Heterozygosity for Cb5R deficiency may pre-dispose to methemoglobinemia even on a thrice-weekly regimen of dapsone. Such individuals should avoid subsequent exposure to oxidant agents, if possible. Children with ALL tend to be symptomatic at low levels of metHb and may have delayed detection of methemoglobinemia. Hence, frequent monitoring of patients receiving dapsone is recommended. Monitoring guidelines for dapsone prophylaxis are proposed.","['Williams, Suzan', 'MacDonald, Paula', 'Hoyer, James D', 'Barr, Ronald Duncan', 'Athale, Uma Harish']","['Williams S', 'MacDonald P', 'Hoyer JD', 'Barr RD', 'Athale UH']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Anti-Infective Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytochrome-B(5) Reductase/*pharmacology', 'Dapsone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Methemoglobinemia/*chemically induced/physiopathology/*prevention & control', 'Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2004/09/25 05:00,2005/01/05 09:00,['2004/09/25 05:00'],"['2004/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20164 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Jan;44(1):55-62. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20164.,,,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '8W5C518302 (Dapsone)', 'EC 1.6.2.2 (Cytochrome-B(5) Reductase)']","['(c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

With respect to environmental exposures, it will be important to investigate risk factors associated with childhood leukemia in general (including diagnostic x-rays, pesticides, and other occupational exposures) as well as experiences common to children with Down syndrome (including routine medical screening tests, increased susceptibility to infections, and increased vitamin deficiencies).","['Ross, Julie A', 'Spector, Logan G', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Olshan, Andrew F']","['Ross JA', 'Spector LG', 'Robison LL', 'Olshan AF']","['Division of Pediatric Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA. ross@epi.umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors']",2004/09/25 05:00,2005/01/05 09:00,['2004/09/25 05:00'],"['2004/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20165 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Jan;44(1):8-12. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20165.,"['R01 CA075169/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA75169/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01-CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['(c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",64,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore sought to determine if detection of relapse by blood counts before the onset of symptoms provided any clinical benefit. PROCEDURES: We performed a retrospective review of 72 patients with ALL who suffered isolated or combined hematologic relapses after the completion of therapy. We compared attainment of second remission and survival after relapse among patients who were asymptomatic and diagnosed by routine blood count, those who had symptoms suggestive of relapse and were diagnosed at the time of a scheduled follow-up, and those whose relapse was diagnosed because of the appearance of symptoms. RESULTS: Only 11% of patients who suffered a relapse were asymptomatic at the time of relapse and diagnosed solely by routine blood counts. There were no significant differences in the survival distributions for the three groups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with relapsed ALL, we found no evidence that detection of relapse by routine blood counts before the onset of symptoms leads to a better outcome.","['Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Hijiya, Nobuko', 'Zhou, Yinmei', 'Hancock, Michaell L', 'Rivera, Gaston K', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Rubnitz JE', 'Hijiya N', 'Zhou Y', 'Hancock ML', 'Rivera GK', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. jeffrey.rubnitz@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",2004/09/25 05:00,2005/02/04 09:00,['2004/09/25 05:00'],"['2004/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20166 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Feb;44(2):138-41. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20166.,['P30 CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Aug;45(2):229.

Two types of activating mutations have been described: (1) the internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) and (2) point mutations within the activating loop (FLT3-ALM). Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorder of early childhood. Mutations and other genetic abnormalities of RAS, NF1, and PTPN11 have been implicated as causative events in JMML, but approximately 25% of JMML patients harbor none of these abnormalities. We investigated whether FLT3 mutations might also contribute to JMML pathogenesis, and if present, whether FLT3 status would correlate with disease natural history and prognosis. PROCEDURES: Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and bone marrow samples of 60 patients meeting international JMML diagnostic criteria. Samples were analyzed for FLT3-ITD and FLT3-ALM using polymerase chain reaction and restriction endonuclease digestion. RESULTS: FLT3-ALM was found in 1/60 (1.7%) patients analyzed. Direct sequencing confirmed a C836G mutation. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of the JMML patient with the FLT3-ALM did not differ from the remainder of the cohort. No FLT3-ITD mutations were detected. CONCLUSIONS: This first reported mutational analysis for both FLT3-ITD and FLT3-ALM performed in JMML documents the presence of FLT3 mutations within JMML, but at a sufficiently low prevalence as to be clinically insignificant for most patients. Despite the poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options for JMML patients with refractory disease, compassionate therapy with targeted FLT3 inhibitors should not be considered in this patient population until adequate safety and efficacy data become available.","['Gratias, Eric J', 'Liu, Y Lucy', 'Meleth, Sreelatha', 'Castleberry, Robert P', 'Emanuel, Peter D']","['Gratias EJ', 'Liu YL', 'Meleth S', 'Castleberry RP', 'Emanuel PD']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35233, USA. egratias@alumni.wfu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', '*Point Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2004/09/25 05:00,2005/02/04 09:00,['2004/09/25 05:00'],"['2004/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20176 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Feb;44(2):142-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20176.,"['CA095621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA80916/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK87488/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, several cases of deletions and/or translocations involving this locus have been reported in patients with GCPS. GLI3 is a transcription factor from the GLI-Kruppel gene family that has been implicated in three distinct entities: GCPS, Pallister-Hall syndrome, and postaxial polydactyly type A. The zinc finger protein, subfamily 1, member 1 gene (ZNFN1A1; OMIM 603023), on 7p12, codes for a lymphoid-restricted zinc finger transcription factor, ZNFN1A1, also called IKAROS, that regulates lymphocyte differentiation and has been associated with the development of childhood leukemia. We present the case of a 9-year-old Latin-American boy who was referred for stem cell transplantation because of recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). On evaluation, he was found to have dysmorphic features consistent with GCPS, including a prominent forehead, down-slanting palpebral fissures, 1-2-3 toe syndactyly, broad thumbs and first toes, and mild developmental delay. He had developed ALL at 5 years of age. Chromosome analysis of bone marrow and fibroblastic cells showed an interstitial deletion of chromosome arm 7p, del(7)(p11.2p14), in 74% and 44% of the cells, respectively. We performed FISH analysis with a BAC clone containing the ZNFN1A1 gene and demonstrated that it is contained in the deleted segment. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with GCPS and leukemia. We hypothesize that constitutional deletion of the ZNFN1A1 gene in this patient may have resulted in an increased risk of lymphoid malignancy.","['Mendoza-Londono, Roberto', 'Kashork, Catherine D', 'Shaffer, Lisa G', 'Krance, Robert', 'Plon, Sharon E']","['Mendoza-Londono R', 'Kashork CD', 'Shaffer LG', 'Krance R', 'Plon SE']","['Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Child', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Fibroblasts/pathology', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor', 'Karyotyping', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Male', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Syndactyly/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Zinc Finger Protein Gli3']",2004/09/25 05:00,2005/03/09 09:00,['2004/09/25 05:00'],"['2004/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20100 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2005 Jan;42(1):82-6. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20100.,,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GLI3 protein, human)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein Gli3)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This case, therefore, points to the importance of histological examination of extramedullary tumors in CML for evaluation of disease status and for therapeutic decisions.","['Sakakura, Miho', 'Ohishi, Kohshi', 'Nomura, Kenichi', 'Katayama, Naoyuki', 'Nishii, Kazuhiro', 'Masuya, Masahiro', 'Nakase, Kazunori', 'Shiku, Hiroshi']","['Sakakura M', 'Ohishi K', 'Nomura K', 'Katayama N', 'Nishii K', 'Masuya M', 'Nakase K', 'Shiku H']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, Mie, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', '*Hematopoiesis, Extramedullary', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Retroperitoneal Neoplasms/*pathology']",2004/09/25 05:00,2004/11/13 09:00,['2004/09/25 05:00'],"['2004/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.20165 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2004 Oct;77(2):167-70. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20165.,,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']","['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proHB-EGF is shed by specific metalloproteases, releasing the N-terminal fragment into the extracellular space as a soluble growth factor (HB-EGF) and the C-terminal fragment (HB-EGF-C) into the intracellular space, where it prevents transcriptional repression by the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF). The goal of the present study was to characterize regulation of proHB-EGF shedding and study its temporal variations in HB-EGF-C localization throughout the cell cycle. Quantitative combination analyses of cell surface proHB-EGF and HB-EGF in conditioned medium showed that proHB-EGF shedding occurred during the G(1) cell cycle phase. Laser scanning cytometry (LSC) revealed that HB-EGF-C was internalized into the cytoplasm during the late G1 phase and accumulated in the nucleus beginning in the S phase. Subsequent nuclear export of PLZF occurred during the late S phase. Further, HB-EGF-C was localized around the centrosome following breakdown of the nuclear envelope and was localized to the interzonal space with chromosome segregation in the late M phase. Temporal variations in HB-EGF localization throughout the cell cycle were also characterized by time-lapse imaging of cells expressing YFP-tagged proHB-EGF, and these results were consistent with those obtained in cytometry studies. These results indicate that proHB-EGF shedding and subsequent HB-EGF-C signaling are related with progression of the cell cycle and may provide a clue to understand the unique biological significance of non-receptor-mediated signaling of proHB-EGF in cell growth.","['Toki, Fujio', 'Nanba, Daisuke', 'Matsuura, Nariaki', 'Higashiyama, Shigeki']","['Toki F', 'Nanba D', 'Matsuura N', 'Higashiyama S']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Division of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Ehime University School of Medicine, Shitsukawa, Shigenobu-cho, Onsen-gun, Ehime, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Keratinocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods', 'Peptide Fragments/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/*chemistry', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers']",2004/09/25 05:00,2005/04/09 09:00,['2004/09/25 05:00'],"['2004/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.20175 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2005 Mar;202(3):839-48. doi: 10.1002/jcp.20175.,,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HBEGF protein, human)', '0 (Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)']","['2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parent proxy assessments of HRQOL allow for greater inclusion of children who are developmentally immature, physically ill, or cognitively impaired. METHODS: Parents of children ages 2-18 years who were diagnosed at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles and Children's Hospital San Diego with BT (n = 86) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; n = 170) evaluated their children's HRQOL over the previous week using the parent-proxy versions of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 Generic Core scales, the PedsQL 3.0 Acute Cancer Module, and the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue scales. Multiple regression analyses were used to determine the independent effect of the child's diagnosis on HRQOL. Separate analyses were conducted for patients receiving treatment, patients who had not received treatment for < 12 months, and patients who had not received treatment for > or = 12 months. RESULTS: Patients with BT exhibited more problems than patients with ALL in the physical, social, psychosocial, school, cognitive, and fatigue domains of HRQOL. The Core Physical Health, Core Psychosocial Health, and Fatigue Total scores for patients with BT demonstrated peak improvements for children who had not received treatment for < 12 months and sharp declines for children who had not received treatment for > or = 12 months. The Core Physical Health and Fatigue Total scores for patients with ALL were highest (better HRQOL) for those who had not received treatment for > or = 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients and survivors of BT experienced more fatigue and HRQOL problems than patients with ALL, and HRQOL differed by treatment status.","['Meeske, Kathleen', 'Katz, Ernest R', 'Palmer, Stephanie N', 'Burwinkle, Tasha', 'Varni, James W']","['Meeske K', 'Katz ER', 'Palmer SN', 'Burwinkle T', 'Varni JW']","['Childrens Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA. kmeeske@chla.usc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition', 'Fatigue/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Parents', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology', 'Quality of Life']",2004/09/25 05:00,2004/11/17 09:00,['2004/09/25 05:00'],"['2004/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.20609 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2004 Nov 1;101(9):2116-25. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20609.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, these patients experienced delays in the institution of definitive immunosuppressive therapy for GvHD. We review the growing literature suggesting that no single or combined histologic feature, including tissue eosinophils, is useful in differentiating GvHD from drug eruptions in BMT recipients.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can modulate the activity of cell membrane molecules and influence many cellular behaviors. Therefore, we hypothesized that MMP may also be involved in the membrane-bound M-CSF-mediated juxtacrine mechanism. First, we investigated whether blocking of membrane-bound M-CSF by neutralizing antibody to M-CSF or M-CSF receptor and adding of exogenous M-CSF are able to influence MMP-9 release. Next, we determined whether MMP-9 participated in J6-1 cells proliferation and influence the shedding of membrane-bound M-CSF and its receptor. Current studies show that blockade of the interaction between membrane-bound M-CSF and M-CSF receptor by antibody to M-CSF or M-CSF receptor promotes MMP-9 release. Moreover, we demonstrated that because of M-CSF mediated juxtacrine, lack of MMP-9 promotes J6-1 cell proliferation, in which a decrease in the shedding of cell-surface M-CSFR is involved. Hence, we suggest that membrane-bound M-CSF inhibit MMP-9 release and down-regulated MMP-9 contribute to juxtacrine stimulating in leukemic cell growth.","['Rao, Qing', 'Zheng, Guo-Guang', 'Li, Ge', 'Lin, Yong-Min', 'Wu, Ke-Fu']","['Rao Q', 'Zheng GG', 'Li G', 'Lin YM', 'Wu KF']","['Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",100973463,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'DNA Primers', 'Down-Regulation/*physiology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*physiology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2004/09/25 05:00,2004/11/17 09:00,['2004/09/25 05:00'],"['2004/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['229/9/946 [pii]', '10.1177/153537020422900912 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2004 Oct;229(9):946-53. doi: 10.1177/153537020422900912.,,,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of CCO can promote oxidative stress by increasing mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Because mitochondria have an important role in apoptosis as both a target and source for ROS, enhanced ROS production resulting from inhibition of CCO by Cu deficiency may trigger apoptosis. The present study focuses on the mitochondrial effects of N,N'-bis(2-aminoethyl)-1,3-propanedi-amine (TET), which inhibits CCO by causing cellular Cu deficiency, and the antioxidants ascorbate and alpha-tocopherol in a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60). The following effects were observed: (i) TET reduced both cell growth and viability only in the presence of ascorbate or alpha-tocopherol; (ii) TET reduced CCO activity and increased mitochondrial ROS production as indicated by increased expression of Mn super-oxide dismutase, but the induction of Mn superoxide dismutase was not affected by ascorbate or alpha-tocopherol; (iii) TET acted independently of ascorbate or alpha-tocopherol in disrupting mitochondrial membrane potential; (iv) TET did not increase caspase-8 activity in the absence of ascorbate or alpha-tocopherol; and (v) TET did not increase transfer of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol unless alpha-tocopherol was present. These findings indicate that reduction in CCO activity by TET-induced Cu deficiency increased oxidative stress in HL-60 cells sufficiently to disrupt the electrochemical gradient of the inner mitochondrial membrane but did not trigger cell death. Also, ascorbate and alpha-tocopherol did not alleviate oxidative stress but may have become pro-oxidants, adding to the oxidant burden sufficiently to trigger cell death in TET-treated cells.","['Raymond, Laura J', 'Johnson, W Thomas']","['Raymond LJ', 'Johnson WT']","['USDA, ARS, GFHNRC, P.O.

As a result, there is a rapidly growing population of children and young adult cancer survivors in which the long-term genotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic intervention is unknown. We have previously observed that children treated for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) have significantly increased somatic mutant frequencies (Mfs) (30- to 1300-fold higher) at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) reporter gene in their non-malignant peripheral T cells compared with children at diagnosis or controls. In order to gain insight into the etiology of the observed dramatic increase in Mfs following antineoplastic therapy, we investigated the prevalence of microsatellite instability (MSI), reflective of a defect in DNA mismatch repair (MMR), in children with ALL at diagnosis, during and after chemotherapy and compared them with healthy age-matched controls. MSI analysis using five microsatellite markers was performed on 167 T cell isolates from 40 healthy children and on 842 T cell isolates from 50 patients treated for ALL. High-frequency MSI (MSI-high) was identified in 2 healthy children (5%) and in 2 of 20 ALL subjects at the time of disease recurrence (relapse) (10%). There was no statistically significant difference between the prevalence of MSI-high in patients at the time of ALL relapse and healthy children, nor between the children with ALL at other time points and healthy children. These data indicate that MMR defects, represented by MSI, are not a significant contributor to the elevated HPRT Mfs seen in children treated for ALL. However, in a small number of patients chemotherapy may play a role in the selection of cells with defects in MMR that may have long-term clinical implications.","['Kendall, Heather E', 'Vacek, Pamela M', 'Finette, Barry A']","['Kendall HE', 'Vacek PM', 'Finette BA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Department of Medical Biostatistics, Vermont Cancer Center, University of Vermont, 89 Beaumont Avenue, Burlington, VT 05405, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Repair', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/genetics', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Microsatellite Repeats', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence']",2004/09/25 05:00,2005/02/03 09:00,['2004/09/25 05:00'],"['2004/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/mutage/geh050 [doi]', '19/5/409 [pii]']",ppublish,Mutagenesis. 2004 Sep;19(5):409-12. doi: 10.1093/mutage/geh050.,"['1K01 CA 77737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1P20 RR 16462/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '1R01 CA 090940-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R29 HD 35309/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 22435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The biochemical pharmacology of these drugs suggests that inhibition of purine nucleotide formation through the 6-thioguanine nucleotide metabolites is their key molecular mechanism. However, it is unclear how these metabolites suppress immunity. We hypothesized that azathioprine produces a selective inhibitory effect on activated but not quiescent T lymphocytes. We first established a model system of T lymphocyte culture with azathioprine that produced pharmacologically relevant concentrations of 6-thioguanine nucleotides. Using genome-wide expression profiling, we identified a group of azathioprine-regulated genes in quiescent and activated T lymphocytes. Several genes involved in immunity and inflammation were selectively down-regulated by azathioprine in stimulated but not quiescent cells. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for three of these genes, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 7, and alpha4-integrin, confirmed down-regulated expression of transcript levels. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand protein expression was further studied and found to be inhibited by azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and 6-thioguanine, implying that the inhibitory effects of azathioprine on expression are mediated by 6-thioguanine nucleotides. These results therefore provide a previously unrecognized molecular mechanism for the immunosuppressive properties of thiopurine antimetabolite drugs.","['Thomas, Carlton W', 'Myhre, Gennett M', 'Tschumper, Renee', 'Sreekumar, Raghavakaimal', 'Jelinek, Diane', 'McKean, David J', 'Lipsky, James J', 'Sandborn, William J', 'Egan, Laurence J']","['Thomas CW', 'Myhre GM', 'Tschumper R', 'Sreekumar R', 'Jelinek D', 'McKean DJ', 'Lipsky JJ', 'Sandborn WJ', 'Egan LJ']","['Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st St. SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,IM,"['Annexin A5', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Azathioprine/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coloring Agents', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunity/genetics', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Inflammation/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Propidium', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2004/09/25 05:00,2005/03/19 09:00,['2004/09/25 05:00'],"['2004/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1124/jpet.104.074815 [doi]', 'jpet.104.074815 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2005 Feb;312(2):537-45. doi: 10.1124/jpet.104.074815.

The main objective of this study was to investigate the pattern of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion by human endometrial epithelium, and their regulation by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and other growth factors present at the embryonic-endometrial interface. METHODS: Endometrial epithelial cells (EEC) were isolated from biopsies collected at both proliferative and secretory phases of fertile women. RESULTS: HCG (1-50 IU/ml) increased LIF secretion by EEC cultures derived from follicular phase (up to 285+/-75%) or from secretory phase (up to 212+/-16%). In contrast, hCG reduced IL-6 secretion by EEC in both phases. The hCG/LH receptor gene was transcribed by EEC as evidenced by RT-PCR. Insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2 increased LIF secretion by EEC. Transforming growth factor beta1 stimulated LIF and reduced IL-6 secretion. CONCLUSIONS: Through hCG, the blastocyst may be involved in the control of its implantation (via an increase of proimplantatory LIF) and tolerance (via an inhibition of proinflammatory IL-6). Other growth factors present at the embryonic-endometrial interface are also involved in the control of LIF and IL-6 endometrial secretion.","[""Perrier d'Hauterive, S"", 'Charlet-Renard, C', 'Berndt, S', 'Dubois, M', 'Munaut, C', 'Goffin, F', 'Hagelstein, M-T', 'Noel, A', 'Hazout, A', 'Foidart, J-M', 'Geenen, V']","[""Perrier d'Hauterive S"", 'Charlet-Renard C', 'Berndt S', 'Dubois M', 'Munaut C', 'Goffin F', 'Hagelstein MT', 'Noel A', 'Hazout A', 'Foidart JM', 'Geenen V']","['Center of Immunology and Laboratory of Tumour and Developmental Biology, Institute of Pathology CHU-B23, University of Liege, B-4000 Liege-Sart Tilman, Belgium. sperrier@ulg.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Embryo Implantation', 'Endometrium/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Epithelium/metabolism', 'Female', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Menstrual Cycle/physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptors, LH/drug effects/genetics/metabolism']",2004/09/25 05:00,2005/03/24 09:00,['2004/09/25 05:00'],"['2004/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/humrep/deh450 [doi]', 'deh450 [pii]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2004 Nov;19(11):2633-43. doi: 10.1093/humrep/deh450.

We evaluated the ability of the investigational antileukemic agent adaphostin to induce apoptosis in CLL B cells and synergize with fludarabine in vitro. Analysis by annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining revealed that the concentration of adaphostin required to induce 50% cell death (IC50) at 24 hours was 4.2 microM (range, 1.10-11.25 microM; median, 4.25 microM; n=29) for CLL isolates and more than 10 microM for B and T cells from healthy donors. Immunoblots demonstrated adaphostin induced poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and cleavage of caspase-3 substrates, suggesting that adaphostin induces apoptosis. Adaphostin increased the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within CLL B cells, and the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine blocked both adaphostin-induced ROS generation and apoptosis. Adaphostin also caused a decrease in the level of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. When adaphostin was combined with fludarabine (F-ARA-AMP), a synergistic effect on cell death was observed in all 10 CLL samples. These findings not only indicate that adaphostin induces apoptosis selectively in CLL B cells through a mechanism that involves ROS generation but also demonstrate its ability to augment the effects of fludarabine. Further preclinical development of adaphostin as a novel agent for the treatment of CLL appears warranted.","['Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Lee, Yean K', 'Bone, Nancy D', 'Strege, Ann K', 'Narayanan, Ven L', 'Sausville, Edward A', 'Geyer, Susan M', 'Kaufmann, Scott H', 'Kay, Neil E']","['Shanafelt TD', 'Lee YK', 'Bone ND', 'Strege AK', 'Narayanan VL', 'Sausville EA', 'Geyer SM', 'Kaufmann SH', 'Kay NE']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, 200 First St, SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. shanafelt.tait@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adamantane/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*pharmacology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",2004/09/25 05:00,2005/03/25 09:00,['2004/09/25 05:00'],"['2004/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-06-2205 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)45823-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Mar 1;105(5):2099-106. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-06-2205.

We hypothesized that treatment resistance is an intrinsic feature of ALL cells reflected in the gene expression pattern and that resistance to chemotherapy can be predicted before treatment. To test these hypotheses, gene expression signatures of ALL samples with high MRD load were compared with those of samples without measurable MRD during treatment. We identified 54 genes that clearly distinguished resistant from sensitive ALL samples. Genes with low expression in resistant samples were predominantly associated with cell-cycle progression and apoptosis, suggesting that impaired cell proliferation and apoptosis are involved in treatment resistance.

Conversely, a stable expression of the cDNA of hsp70 in the reverse orientation attenuated not only hsp70 but also signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5) and Bcl-x(L) levels. This increased apoptosis induced by cytarabine, etoposide, or Apo-2L/TRAIL. Ectopic expression of hsp70 in HL-60 cells (HL-60/hsp70) inhibited Ara-C and etoposide-induced Bax conformation change and translocation to the mitochondria; attenuated the accumulation of cytochrome c, Smac, and Omi/HtrA2 in the cytosol; and inhibited the processing and activity of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Hsp70 was bound to death receptors 4 and 5 (DR4 and DR5) and inhibited Apo-2L/TRAIL-induced assembly and activity of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). HL-60/hsp70 cells exhibited increased levels and DNA binding activity of STAT5, which was associated with high levels of Pim-2 and Bcl-x(L) and resistance to apoptosis. Expression of the dominant negative (DN) STAT5 resensitized HL-60/hsp70 cells to cytarabine, etoposide, and Apo-2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis.

In our laboratory, cells from a patient with such CD4(+)CD56(+) lineage-negative leukemia were unexpectedly found to also express the myeloid marker CD33. To confirm the diagnosis of pDC leukemia despite the CD33 expression, we demonstrated that the leukemic cells indeed exhibited pDC phenotypic and functional properties. In 7 of 8 other patients with CD4(+)CD56(+) pDC malignancies, we were able to confirm that the tumor cells expressed CD33 although with variable expression levels. CD33 expression was shown by flow cytometry, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and immunoblot analysis. Furthermore, CD33 monoclonal antibody stimulation of purified CD4(+)CD56(+) leukemic cells led to cytokine secretion, thus confirming the presence of a functional CD33 on these leukemic cells. Moreover, we found that circulating pDCs in healthy individuals also weakly express CD33. Overall, our results demonstrate that the expression of CD33 on CD4(+)CD56(+) lineage-negative cells should not exclude the diagnosis of pDC leukemia and underline that pDC-specific markers should be used at diagnosis for CD4(+)CD56(+) malignancies.","['Garnache-Ottou, Francine', 'Chaperot, Laurence', 'Biichle, Sabeha', 'Ferrand, Christophe', 'Remy-Martin, Jean-Paul', 'Deconinck, Eric', 'de Tailly, Patrick Darodes', 'Bulabois, Benedicte', 'Poulet, Jacqueline', 'Kuhlein, Emilienne', 'Jacob, Marie-Christine', 'Salaun, Veronique', 'Arock, Michel', 'Drenou, Bernard', 'Schillinger, Francoise', 'Seilles, Estelle', 'Tiberghien, Pierre', 'Bensa, Jean-Claude', 'Plumas, Joel', 'Saas, Philippe']","['Garnache-Ottou F', 'Chaperot L', 'Biichle S', 'Ferrand C', 'Remy-Martin JP', 'Deconinck E', 'de Tailly PD', 'Bulabois B', 'Poulet J', 'Kuhlein E', 'Jacob MC', 'Salaun V', 'Arock M', 'Drenou B', 'Schillinger F', 'Seilles E', 'Tiberghien P', 'Bensa JC', 'Plumas J', 'Saas P']","['Etablissement Francais du Sang Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Unite mixte EFS/Universite EA2284/Inserm U645, IFR133, Besancon, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*blood', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/immunology', 'CD3 Complex/blood', 'CD4 Antigens/blood', 'CD55 Antigens/blood', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/immunology', 'Male', 'Plasma Cells/*immunology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",2004/09/25 05:00,2005/04/22 09:00,['2004/09/25 05:00'],"['2004/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-06-2416 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)46819-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Feb 1;105(3):1256-64. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-06-2416.

METHODS: The bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) of 10 patients with MDS, including 4 cases of refractory anemia (RA), 1 case of refractory thrombocytopenia (RTC), 4 cases of RA with excess blasts (RAEB), and 1 case of RAEB in transformation (RAEBt), were isolated and the total RNA was extracted and underwent transcriptome analysis by using customized cDNA microarray with 500 gene clones. Seventeen specimens of normal bone marrow, as controls, were collected from the ribs of 17 patients with chest tumors. Cluster software was used to make analysis. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was carried out to confirm the results of microarray analysis. RESULTS: 95 genes, such as the genes of thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), MAX dimerization protein (MAD), DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3), ets variant gene 1 (ETV1), G1 to S phase transition 1 (GSPT1), were shown to be abnormally expressed in at least 5 MDS patients compared to the normal controls, involving cell growth and differentiation regulation, cell cycle control, signaling, and redox. The 10 MDS patients in different stages were clustered into two distinct groups, whereas a case with refractory thrombocytopenia and other RA patients were clustered into two subgroups. Semiquantitative RT-PCR revealed the identical results in 3 (60%) of the 5 genes determined by microarray analysis. Further analysis on samples from 50 MDS patients confirmed the different expression levels of RNA helicase-related protein (RNAHP), GSPT1, and DDIT3 between the MDS patients and the normal controls. CONCLUSION: The technology of microarray can reveal the intrinsic molecular features of MDS patients and the detection of DDIT3 and RNAHP expression may be useful for the diagnosis of MDS.","['Qian, Jun', 'Chen, Zi-xing', 'Wang, Wei', 'Cen, Jian-nong', 'Xue, Yong-quan']","['Qian J', 'Chen ZX', 'Wang W', 'Cen JN', 'Xue YQ']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Leukemia Research Division, First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou 215006, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/metabolism', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2004/09/25 05:00,2005/08/27 09:00,['2004/09/25 05:00'],"['2004/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2004 Aug 2;84(15):1260-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are numerous known genetic prognostic variables in ALL, which include T cell ALL, the hyperdiploid karyotype and the translocations: t(12;21)[TEL-AML1], t(4;11)[MLL-AF4], t(9;22)[BCR-ABL], and t(1;19)[E2A-PBX]. ALL has been studied at the molecular level through expression profiling resulting in un-validated expression correlates of these prognostic indices. To date, the great wealth of expression data, which has been generated in disparate institutions, representing an extremely large cohort of samples has not been combined to validate any of these analyses. The majority of this data has been generated on the Affymetrix platform, potentially making data integration and validation on independent sample sets a possibility. Unfortunately, because the array platform has been evolving over the past several years the arrays themselves have different probe sets, making direct comparisons difficult. To test the comparability between different array platforms, we have accumulated all Affymetrix ALL array data that is available in the public domain, as well as two sets of cDNA array data. In addition, we have supplemented this data pool by profiling additional diagnostic pediatric ALL samples in our lab. Lists of genes that are differentially expressed in the six major subclasses of ALL have previously been reported in the literature as possible predictors of the subclass. RESULTS: We validated the predictability of these gene lists on all of the independent datasets accumulated from various labs and generated on various array platforms, by blindly distinguishing the prognostic genetic variables of ALL. Cross-generation array validation was used successfully with high sensitivity and high specificity of gene predictors for prognostic variables. We have also been able to validate the gene predictors with high accuracy using an independent dataset generated on cDNA arrays. CONCLUSION: Interarray comparisons such as this one will further enhance the ability to integrate data from several generations of microarray experiments and will help to break down barriers to the assimilation of existing datasets into a comprehensive data pool.","['Mitchell, Stephanie A', 'Brown, Kevin M', 'Henry, Michael M', 'Mintz, Michelle', 'Catchpoole, Daniel', 'LaFleur, Bonnie', 'Stephan, Dietrich A']","['Mitchell SA', 'Brown KM', 'Henry MM', 'Mintz M', 'Catchpoole D', 'LaFleur B', 'Stephan DA']","[""Research Center for Genetic Medicine, Children's National Medical Center, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, D.C. 20037, USA. smitchell@cnmcresearch.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Validation Study']",England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,IM,"['Bone Marrow/chemistry/pathology', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods/*standards', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genes, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/standards', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods/*standards', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics']",2004/09/25 05:00,2005/07/29 09:00,['2004/09/25 05:00'],"['2004/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1186/1471-2164-5-71 [doi]', '1471-2164-5-71 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2004 Sep 23;5:71. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-5-71.,['7R21CA095618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],20040923,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,,PMC522810,,,,,,,,,,,

The AKR/J mouse genome carries the AK virus, which leads within 1 year to spontaneous development of thymic lymphoblastic lymphoma. Beginning at an age of 4-5 weeks, groups of 160 female mice were sham-exposed or exposed to 50 Hz magnetic fields at 1 or 100 microT for 24 h per day, 7 days per week, for 38 weeks. Animals were checked visually daily and were weighed and palpated weekly. There was no effect of magnetic-field exposure on body weight gain or survival rate, and lymphoma incidence did not differ between exposed and sham-exposed animals.

Until recently, BMT was used primarily to replace a malignant, genetically abnormal or deficient immunohematopoietic compartment and therefore, highly toxic myeloablative regimens were considered mandatory for more effective eradication of all undesirable host-derived hematopoietic cells, including stem cells and their progeny. Our preclinical and ongoing clinical studies indicated that much more effective eradication of host immunohematopoietic system cells can be mediated by donor lymphocytes in the process of adoptive allogeneic cell therapy following BMT. Thus, eradication of all malignant cells, especially in patients with CML and, to a lesser extent, in patients with other hematologic malignancies can be accomplished despite complete resistance of puch tumor cells to maximally tolerated doses of chemoradiotherapy. Our cumulative experience suggested that graft-versus-malignancy effects might be used as a tool for eradication of otherwise resistant tumor cells of host origin. We speculated that the therapeutic benefit of BMT may be improved by using safer conditioning for engraftment of donor stem cells induce host-versus-graft unresponsiveness to enable engraftment of donor lymphocytes for subsequent induction of graft-versus-malignancy effects, or even graft-versus-autoimmunity and graft-versus-genetically abnormal cells. In other words, focusing on more selective and smarter rather than stronger modalities. Effective BMT procedures may be accomplished without lethal conditioning of the host, using a new, well-tolerated and user-friendly non-myeloablative regimen, thus eliminating or minimizing immediate and late procedure-related toxicity and mortality. It appears that initial induction of graft tolerance, mediated by engraftment of donor stem cells, leads to durable engraftment of immunocompetent donor lymphocytes, which may be necessary for induction of effective biologic warfare against host-type immunohematopoietic cells. Consequently, stem-cell therapy following induction of transplantation tolerance by selective elimination of alloreactive donor lymphocytes may represent the treatment of choice for a wide range of otherwise incurable diseases, including cancer (hematologic malignancies and certain metastatic solid tumors), genetic disorders (hemoglobinopathies and enzyme deficiency disorders), diseases caused by self-reactive lymphocytes (autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis) to mention just a few. Using reduced intensity conditioning, non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST) can be accomplished with no major procedure-related toxicity or mortality. Thus, NST offers the feasibility of safe stem cell transplantation and cell-mediated procedures for a large and constantly growing spectrum of clinical indications for all patients in need without lower or upper age limit. Future strategies currently under investigation include developing new approaches for control of alloreactivity of host-versus-graft and graft-versus host reactivity reactions and developing better approaches for maximizing the capacity of donor lymphocytes to eliminate cancer cells more selectively, while avoiding or minimizing GVHD for safer and more effective treatment of patients in need of BMT.","['Slavin, Shimon', 'Aker, Mehmet', 'Shapira, Michael Y', 'Resnick, Igor', 'Bitan, Menachem', 'Or, Reuven']","['Slavin S', 'Aker M', 'Shapira MY', 'Resnick I', 'Bitan M', 'Or R']","['Deptartment of Bone Marrow Transplantation & Cancer Immunotherapy, The Danny Cunniff Leukemia Research Laboratory, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Clin Transpl,Clinical transplants,8812419,IM,"['Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*surgery', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Fanconi Anemia/*surgery', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/surgery', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Neoplasms/*surgery', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods']",2004/09/25 05:00,2004/10/06 09:00,['2004/09/25 05:00'],"['2004/09/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Transpl. 2003:275-82.,,,,,38,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two major adverse effects of ATRA therapy are hyperleukocytosis and retinoic acid syndrome. In order to prevent these adverse effects, low-dose ATRA therapy (25 mg/m2/d) has been tried in adults. Accordingly we assessed the pharmacokinetics of low-dose ATRA in children with cancer. Four children (one with APL and three with other advanced cancer) were administered ATRA and its pharmacokinetics were evaluated.

The objective of this randomized study was to evaluate the impact of mode of administration of MTZ on the response and recurrence rates in newly diagnosed patients with AML and to compare the toxicity patterns associated with bolus and continuous infusion (CI) of MTZ. From March 1987 to March 1994, 40 newly diagnosed patients with AML were randomized to receive either bolus or CI-MTZ, administered for 3 days at 10 mg/m2/day in combination with CI-cytarabine for 7 days at 100 mg/m2/day. Patients achieving complete remission (CR) received two consolidation cycles followed by monthly maintenance cycles, aiming a total of 12 cycles of chemotherapy. Fifteen patients (75%) in the bolus arm and 16 patients (80%) in the CI arm achieved CR. There were no significant differences in rates of early death and time to myeloid recovery between the two groups. After 11 years from the initiation of the study, median disease-free survival (DFS) in bolus and CI groups were 19 and 29 months after a median follow-up of 10 and 14 months, respectively. DFS rates at 10 years were 16.7% in the bolus group and 28.6% in the CI group (p = 0.36). Overall survival (OS) rates during the same period were 10.7 and 21.3% in the bolus and CI groups, respectively (p = 0.26). No relapse was observed in either group after 4 years. In patients younger than 40 years of age, DFS and OS were found to be significantly longer in the CI arm (p = 0.02 and p = 0.03, respectively). Mild asymptomatic cardiotoxicity associated with a decrease of 10 to 20% in the ejection fraction occurred in a patient in CI-MTZ arm and in two patients in the bolus arm. None of these patients showed any evidence of cardiac failure during their subsequent follow-up. Grade III-IV alopecia (p = 0.05) and grade I-II hepatotoxicity (p = 0.01) were more frequent in the CI arm. A tendency for higher frequency of grade III-IV nausea was observed in the bolus arm (9 vs. 3%, p = 0.10). As a conclusion, bolus and CI administration of MTZ were equally effective and tolerated well. Development of new anti-leukemia agents with novel treatment approaches is still needed to improve the high relapse rates in patients with AML who do not have an HLA-matched donor.","['Koc, Yener', 'Oyan, Basak', 'Kars, Ayse', 'Tekuzman, Gulten', 'Canpinar, Hande', 'Kansu, Emin']","['Koc Y', 'Oyan B', 'Kars A', 'Tekuzman G', 'Canpinar H', 'Kansu E']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Institute of Oncology, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey. yenerkocmd@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Review']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/*administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.726 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2004 Jun;22(2):43-53. doi: 10.1002/hon.726.,,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']","['Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",33,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although many malignant disorders are related to cytogenetic alterations, there is not a consistent chromosomal translocation that could serve as a tumour marker for the monitoring of MRD. ALL are derived from B-lymphocytes in 80% of cases. In the early stages of their maturation, the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (IgH) undergo rearrangements among their V, D, and J segments, giving rise to the Complementary Determining Regions (CDR). Among these, CDR3 is considered unique for each lymphocyte and used as a tumour-specific marker in B-ALL patients. In this study, the CDR3 was labelled with digoxigenin and used as a patient-specific probe to test its sensitivity for further detection of MRD. Fourteen pretreatment samples of bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) from B-ALL patients were included. Tumour-specific probes were designed from each clonal product by elimination of the consensus sequences. Ten digoxigenin-labelled probes were hybridized with a mixture of their respective clonal DNA and the polyclonal product from a normal healthy donor, in serial dilutions from 1:1 up to 1:10(7). A sensitivity range of 1:10(3)-1:10(6) was obtained, with an average of 1:10(5). Crossed tests performed in four patients, showed right probe specificity in all cases. We propose that the design of allele-specific probes with chemiluminescent labelling, represents a reliable, sure and sensitive alternative methodology for MRD detection in patients with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Leal, E', 'Jaloma-Cruz, A R', 'Barros-Nunez, P']","['Leal E', 'Jaloma-Cruz AR', 'Barros-Nunez P']","['Division de Genetica, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente, IMSS, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,"['Alleles', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Complement System Proteins', '*Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'Digoxigenin/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Prognosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.727 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2004 Jun;22(2):55-61. doi: 10.1002/hon.727.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NQ1SX9LNAU (Digoxigenin)']","['Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",28,,,,,,,,,,,,

GUT-70 activated the caspase 2, 3, 8 and 9, and induced the apoptosis in leukemic cells, which was inhibited by caspase inhibitors. GUT-70 induced anti-leukemic effects independent of the p53-p2l(WAFl/CIP1) pathway and increased the overall expression of p27(KIP1) and p57(KIP2), to stop the cell cycle at the G(1)/S transition.

We have demonstrated recently that a novel non-ABC transporter, RLIP76 (RALBP1) can also mediate ATP-dependent transport of GSH-conjugates (GS-E) as well as doxorubicin (DOX). We demonstrate RLIP76 reconstituted in artificial liposomes can catalyze ATP-dependent transport of LTC(4), which can be modulated by PKC-alpha. The ATPase activity of E. coli expressed homogenous RLIP76 was stimulated in a saturable fashion by LTC(4) with half maximal stimulation at 130 nM. Proteoliposomes reconstituted with RLIP76 catalyzed temperature and osmolar sensitive ATP-dependent transport of LTC(4) with K(m) values of 5.1 mM and 210 nM for ATP and LTC(4), respectively. V(max) for transport was found to be 3.2 nmol/min/mg. Colchicine inhibited LTC(4) transport to 50% at 5.8 microM. PKC-alpha catalyzed phosphorylation of RLIP76 and increased its transport activity by 2-3-fold. Membrane vesicles prepared from the small (SCLC) and non-small (NSCLC) lung cancer cell lines as well as HL-60 (leukemia) and U937 (lymphoma) cell lines exhibited ATP-dependent transport of LTC(4), which was inhibited by anti-RLIP76 antibodies. The rate of transport of LTC(4) in SCLC (H69, H378) was half of that observed in NSCLC cell lines but after transfection with RLIP76, the transport rate of LTC(4) in H69 became comparable to that in NSCLC cell lines. Anti-RLIP76 antibodies inhibited LTC(4) transport by 67-81% in all 8 cell lines examined, whereas N-19 anti-MRP1 antibodies inhibited transport of LTC(4) by only 11-26%. These results suggest that RLIP76 is the major LTC(4) transporter in cancer cells and that its transport activity is regulated by PKC-alpha-mediated phosphorylation.","['Sharma, Rajendra', 'Singhal, Sharad S', 'Wickramarachchi, Dilki', 'Awasthi, Yogesh C', 'Awasthi, Sanjay']","['Sharma R', 'Singhal SS', 'Wickramarachchi D', 'Awasthi YC', 'Awasthi S']","['Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics, University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Galveston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukotriene C4/*metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.20516 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2004 Dec 20;112(6):934-42. doi: 10.1002/ijc.20516.,"['CA 104661/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 77495/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES012171/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (RALBP1 protein, human)', '2CU6TT9V48 (Leukotriene C4)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']","['(c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies of multiple-species candidemia (MSC) have rarely been reported. METHODS: The authors identified 33 patients with cancer who had candidemia (diagnosed between 1993 and 2000) caused by more than 1 Candida species. This group of 33 patients was compared with a control group of 66 patients with cancer who had C. albicans candidemia that arose soon before or soon after each case of MSC that was investigated in the current study. RESULTS: Patients with MSC, compared with control patients, were more likely to have leukemia (33% vs. 8%; P = 0.001), to have had prolonged neutropenia before the onset of their infection (mean +/- standard deviation, 10 +/- 17 days vs. 3 +/- 6 days; P = 0.02), and to have received chemotherapy within 1 month before their infection (42% vs. 18%; P = 0.01). Patients with MSC also had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores at the onset of infection (score > or = 16, 45% vs. 26%; P = 0.05) and were more likely to have received previous antifungal prophylaxis compared with patients who had candidemia caused by C. albicans (33% vs. 11%; P = 0.006). The response of C. albicans candidemia to single-agent antifungal therapy was significantly better than that of MSC (69% vs. 35% P = 0.004).

They follow complex life cycles, which are still only partly understood at the molecular level. Maturation of newly formed retroviral particles is an essential step in production of infectious virions, and requires proteolytic cleavage of Gag polyproteins in the immature particle to form the matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid proteins present in the mature virion. Capsid proteins associate to form a dense viral core that may be spherical, cylindrical or conical depending on the genus of the virus. Nonetheless, these assemblies all appear to be composed of a lattice formed from hexagonal rings, each containing six capsid monomers. Here, we describe the X-ray structure of an individual hexagonal assembly from N-tropic murine leukaemia virus (N-MLV). The interface between capsid monomers is generally polar, consistent with weak interactions within the hexamer. Similar architectures are probably crucial for the regulation of capsid assembly and disassembly in all retroviruses. Together, these observations provide new insights into retroviral uncoating and how cellular restriction factors may interfere with viral replication.","['Mortuza, Gulnahar B', 'Haire, Lesley F', 'Stevens, Anthony', 'Smerdon, Stephen J', 'Stoye, Jonathan P', 'Taylor, Ian A']","['Mortuza GB', 'Haire LF', 'Stevens A', 'Smerdon SJ', 'Stoye JP', 'Taylor IA']","['Division of Protein Structure, National Institute for Medical Research, The Ridgeway, Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Capsid/chemistry', 'Capsid Proteins/*chemistry', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*chemistry', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Virus Assembly']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/10/06 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/nature02915 [doi]', 'nature02915 [pii]']",ppublish,Nature. 2004 Sep 23;431(7007):481-5. doi: 10.1038/nature02915.,,,['0 (Capsid Proteins)'],,,,,,,,,['Nature. 2004 Oct 21;431(7011):1017'],,,,,

Unlike p53, which is mutated in half of human cancers, p73 is rarely mutated. However, altered expression of the p73 gene has been reported in neuroblastoma, lung cancer, prostate cancer and renal cell carcinoma. To investigate the potential involvement of p73 in acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), we analyzed 71 samples from AML patients for the expression pattern of N-terminal transactivation-p73alpha (TA-p73alpha), its spliced isoforms and N-terminal-deleted-p73 transcripts (DeltaN-p73). We detected p73 gene expression in AML irrespective of FAB (French-American-British) subtypes. Notably, the analysis of DeltaN-p73 expression, which has been reported to inactivate both p53 and p73 antitumor effects, revealed a rather peculiar pattern. In fact, DeltaN-p73 transcript and protein were detectable in 27/28 (96.4%) cases of M0, M1, M2, M4, M5 and M6 AML and in 13/41 (31.7%) cases of PML-RARalpha-positive M3 AML (P<0.01). Thus, the distinct gene expression profile of p73 further supports the notion that acute promyelocytic leukemia is a biologically different subset of AML.","['Rizzo, M G', 'Giombini, E', 'Diverio, D', 'Vignetti, M', 'Sacchi, A', 'Testa, U', 'Lo-Coco, F', 'Blandino, G']","['Rizzo MG', 'Giombini E', 'Diverio D', 'Vignetti M', 'Sacchi A', 'Testa U', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Blandino G']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, Regina Elena Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy. rizzo@ifo.it <rizzo@ifo.it>']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403483 [doi]', '2403483 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Nov;18(11):1804-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403483.,,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether the two genetic MTHFR polymorphisms (677C>T and 1298A>C) are associated with an increased risk for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or may predict disease progression. Moreover, we measured potential genotype effects on apoptosis of B-CLL cells.Allele frequencies and genotype distributions for both polymorphisms were not significantly different in 111 patients vs 92 healthy controls. While progression-free survival (PFS) was not significantly different in individuals with CLL including all stages, in patients with Binet stage A PFS was significantly longer in patients displaying the MTHFR 677CC (P=0.043) and the MTHFR 1298A/C or CC genotypes (P=0.019). In a multivariate analysis, MTHFR haplotype (677CC plus 1298CC or A/C) was the best independent prognostic factor for PFS compared with other known prognostic factors. Spontaneous apoptosis of B-CLL cells in vitro was significantly increased in the favorable risk group with MTHFR 677CC and MTHFR 1298AC, which may constitute the cellular basis of the observed associations.

We examined AID expression in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) of germinal center B-cell (GCB)-like and activated B-cell (ABC)-like subtypes. These two types of DLBCL are characterized by high and low expression of GC-specific genes, respectively. AID expression was detected in both GCB- and ABC-like DLBCL, thus demonstrating a dissociation between AID expression and that of other GC genes. We also tested for the presence of intraclonal heterogeneity in immunoglobulin and BCL6 genes in those same tumors and in follicle center lymphomas (FCL) that transformed to DLBCL. The level of AID expression did not correlate with the presence of intraclonal sequence heterogeneity in either IgV(H) or BCL6. Our findings suggest that lymphomas maintain some but not all of the gene expression signatures of their normal B-cell counterparts. The fact that AID expression can be elevated without intraclonal sequence heterogeneity raises the possibility that other factors are required for SHM in these tumors. We found decreased levels of AID expression in DLBCL that evolved from FCL and which had acquired new mutations in their BCL6 genes. This dissociation suggests that AID expression and SHM may occur at the time prior to the clinical detection of transformed lymphoma.","['Lossos, I S', 'Levy, R', 'Alizadeh, A A']","['Lossos IS', 'Levy R', 'Alizadeh AA']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, FL 33136, USA. ilossos@med.miami.edu <ilossos@med.miami.edu>']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Cytidine Deaminase', 'Cytosine Deaminase/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Germinal Center/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*enzymology/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/enzymology/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*enzymology/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403488 [doi]', '2403488 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Nov;18(11):1775-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403488.,"['CA33399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0 (BCL6 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CPEC treatment (50 nM) depleted intracellular CTP and induced a specific S-phase arrest and erythroid differentiation of human erythroleukemia K562 cells. The equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT1, 2) facilitated uptake of CPEC into K562 cells as evidenced by both NBMPR and dipyridamole inhibition of CPEC-mediated CTP depletion and erythroid differentiation. Incubation with the pyridinylimidazole p38 MAPK inhibitors, SB203580 or SB220025, suppressed both the CPEC-induced cell cycle arrest and differentiation of K562 cells. SB203580 also prevented the cell cycle arrest and erythroid differentiation of K562 cells induced by Leflunomide (LEF), a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the de novo pyrimidine pathway, without affecting LEF-induced depletion of pyrimidine pools. Finally, selective knockdown of p38 MAPK by using Smart Pooltrade mark siRNA to p38 MAPK significantly decreased the CPEC-induced differentiation of K562 cells.

Coexposure of cells to marginally toxic concentrations of TRAIL and FP (24 h) synergistically increased mitochondrial injury (eg, cytochrome c, AIF, Smac/DIABLO release), cytoplasmic depletion of Bax, activation of Bid as well as caspase-8 and -3, PARP cleavage, and apoptosis. Coadministration of TRAIL markedly increased FP-induced apoptosis in leukemic cells ectopically expressing Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), or a phosphorylation loop-deleted form of Bcl-2 (DeltaBcl-2), whereas lethality was substantially attenuated in cells ectopically expressing CrmA, dominant-negative-FADD, or dominant-negative-caspase-8. TRAIL/FP induced no discernible changes in FLIP, DR4, DR5, Mcl-1, or survivin expression, modest declines in levels of DcR2 and c-IAP, but resulted in the marked transcriptional downregulation of XIAP. Moreover, cells stably expressing an XIAP-antisense construct exhibited a pronounced increase in TRAIL sensitivity comparable to degrees of apoptosis achieved with TRAIL/FP. Conversely, enforced XIAP expression significantly attenuated caspase activation and TRAIL/FP lethality. Together, these findings suggest that simultaneous activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways by TRAIL and FP synergistically induces apoptosis in human leukemia cells through a mechanism that involves FP-mediated XIAP downregulation.","['Rosato, R R', 'Dai, Y', 'Almenara, J A', 'Maggio, S C', 'Grant, S']","['Rosato RR', 'Dai Y', 'Almenara JA', 'Maggio SC', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Complement Membrane Attack Complex', 'Complement System Proteins', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flavonoids/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Flavoproteins/metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperidines/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403491 [doi]', '2403491 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Nov;18(11):1780-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403491.,"['CA100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0 (AIFM1 protein, human)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Complement Membrane Attack Complex)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Flavoproteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SC5b-9 protein complex)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using ALCL cell lines, we show by coimmunoprecipitation experiments that SOCS3 physically binds with JAK3 in vitro, and that JAK3 inhibition by WHI-P154 downregulates SOCS3 expression. Western blot analysis confirmed expression of SOCS3 and also showed coexpression of phosphorylated (activated) STAT3 (pSTAT3). Direct sequencing of the SOCS3 gene showed no mutations or alternative splicing. In ALCL tumors that were assessed by immunohistochemistry, nine of 12 (75%) ALK+ tumors were SOCS3 positive and eight (67%) coexpressed pSTAT3. In comparison, 18 of 25 (72%) ALK-- tumors were SOCS3 positive and seven (28%) coexpressed pSTAT3.

Immunohistochemical analysis of the implanted bone revealed that the majority of bone marrow (BM) microenvironment cells such as blood vessels, osteoclasts and osteoblasts were of rabbit origin. The implanted bones were directly injected with myeloma cells from 28 patients. Successful engraftment of unseparated BM cells from 85% of patients and CD138-selected myeloma plasma cells from 81% of patients led to the production of patients' M-protein isotypes and typical myeloma manifestations (osteolytic bone lesions and angiogenesis of rabbit origin). Myeloma cells grew exclusively in the rabbit bone, but were able to metastasize into another bone at a remote site in the same mouse. Cells from patients with extramedullary disease also grew along the outer surface of the rabbit bones. This demonstrates the ability of SCID-rab model, marked by a nonmyelomatous, nonhuman, and nonfetal microenvironment, to support the growth of CD138-expressing myeloma cells.

Several lines of evidence suggest that these genes are implicated in GC-induced apoptosis upstream of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. These genes were upregulated by GC even in the presence of an inhibitor of protein synthesis, cycloheximide, indicating that they are direct target genes of glucocorticoid receptors. DSCR1 is reported to have four isoforms, each of which has a distinct first exon, E1-E4. Among these isoforms, the one with E1 was selectively upregulated by GC. GZMA and FKBP5 have a cluster of putative glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) in introns 1 and 2, respectively, that was identified to be responsible for the response to GC. They were composed of one complete (A/T)G(A/T)(A/T)C(A/T) sequence surrounded by two incomplete (A/T)G(A/T)(A/T)C(A/T) sequences separated by one to four nucleotides.

In this study, three strategies for delivering antigens to DC, namely apoptotic bodies (Apo-DC), tumor lysates, and tumor RNA were studied in an autologous setting. In all six CLL patients, Apo-DC induced higher HLA-restricted, T cell responses than DC pulsed with tumor lysate or RNA. Real-time PCR confirmed higher expression of genes for IL-2 and IFN-gamma in T cells stimulated with Apo-DC. Concurrently, no IL-10 and low IL-4 responses indicated that the immune response was primarily of the Th1 type. Enzyme-linked immunospot assay revealed high IFN-gamma secretion by T cells when Apo-DC was used to stimulate autologous T cells in all patients.

Pulse labeling showed that aged mice (24 months of age) had fewer new interneurons in the olfactory bulb than did young adult (2 months of age) mice. However, the aged mice had more olfactory interneurons in total than their younger counterparts. Aged mice exhibited no differences from young adult mice in their ability to discriminate between two discrete odors but were significantly poorer at performing discriminations between similar odors (fine olfactory discrimination). Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor heterozygote mice, which have less neurogenesis and fewer olfactory interneurons than their wild-type counterparts, performed more poorly at fine olfactory discrimination than the wild types, suggesting that olfactory neurogenesis, rather than the total number of interneurons, was responsible for fine olfactory discrimination. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses revealed a selective reduction in expression levels of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) signaling elements in the aged forebrain subventricular zone. Waved-1 mutant mice, which express reduced quantities of transforming growth factor-alpha, the predominant EGFR ligand in adulthood, phenocopy aged mice in olfactory neurogenesis and performance on fine olfactory discrimination tasks. These results suggest that the impairment in fine olfactory discrimination with age may result from a reduction in EGF-dependent olfactory neurogenesis.","['Enwere, Emeka', 'Shingo, Tetsuro', 'Gregg, Christopher', 'Fujikawa, Hirokazu', 'Ohta, Shigeki', 'Weiss, Samuel']","['Enwere E', 'Shingo T', 'Gregg C', 'Fujikawa H', 'Ohta S', 'Weiss S']","['Genes and Development Research Group, Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Calgary Faculty of Medicine, Calgary, Alberta T2N 4N1, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,IM,"['Aging/metabolism/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Count', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Discrimination, Psychological/*physiology', 'ErbB Receptors/*metabolism', 'Heterozygote', 'Interneurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Lateral Ventricles/cytology/growth & development/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Olfactory Bulb/cytology/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Smell/genetics/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Transforming Growth Factor alpha/genetics']",2004/09/24 05:00,2005/07/08 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2751-04.2004 [doi]', '24/38/8354 [pii]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2004 Sep 22;24(38):8354-65. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2751-04.2004.,,,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",,,PMC6729689,,,,,,,,,,,

The transcriptional activation function of Pax-5 requires an intact N-terminal DNA-binding domain and is strongly influenced by the C-terminal transactivation domain. We report the identification and characterization of five human Pax-5 isoforms, which occur through the alternative splicing of exons that encode for the C-terminal transactivation domain. These isoforms arise from the inclusion or exclusion of exon 7, exon 8, and/or exon 9. Three of the Pax-5 isoforms generate novel protein sequences rich in proline, serine, and threonine amino acids that are the hallmarks of transactivation domains. The Pax-5 isoforms are expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, cancerous and non-cancerous B cell lines, as well as in primary B cell lymphoma tissue. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that the isoforms possess specific DNA binding activity and recognize the PAX-5 consensus binding sites. In reporter assays using the CD19 promoter, the transactivation properties of the various isoforms were significantly influenced by the changes in the C-terminal protein sequence.

However, despite its putative tumor-suppressor function, little is known of the contribution of EXT1 to human sporadic malignancies. Here, we report that EXT1 function is abrogated in human cancer cells by transcriptional silencing associated with CpG island promoter hypermethylation. We also show that, at the biochemical and cellular levels, the epigenetic inactivation of EXT1, a glycosyltransferase, leads to the loss of heparan sulfate (HS) synthesis. Reduced HS production can be reversed by the use of a DNA demethylating agent. Furthermore, the re-introduction of EXT1 into cancer cell lines displaying methylation-dependent silencing of EXT1 induces tumor-suppressor-like features, e.g. reduced colony formation density and tumor growth in nude mouse xenograft models. Screening a large collection of human cancer cell lines (n=79) and primary tumors (n=454) from different cell types, we found that EXT1 CpG island hypermethylation was common in leukemia, especially acute promyelocytic leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and non-melanoma skin cancer.

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in transcriptional activation of GM3 synthase during differentiation of PMA-induced HL-60 cells are not well understood. As evidenced by western blot analysis, PMA induced the marked activation of protein kinase C (PKC)/extracellular regulated kinases (ERKs) signal transduction pathway during the differentiation of HL-60 cells. In addition, PKC/ERKs activation induced by PMA in HL-60 cells led to the phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) as a transcription factor. In PMA-stimulated HL-60 cells, the PKC/ERKs-dependent CREB activation regulated expression of GM3 synthase, inducing a synthesis of ganglioside GM3 product. On the other hand, although ganglioside GM3 was shown to be able to induce the differentiation of HL-60 cells into the monocyte/macrophage lineage, effect of ganglioside GM3 on expression of CD11b as a differentiation marker in HL-60 cells has been not reported yet. Interestingly, the increased ganglioside GM3 through PKC/ERKs/CREB-dependent pathway by PMA resulted in an increase of CD11b surface antigen expression and induction of HL-60 cells adherence. Treatment with L-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP), glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, decreased induction of not only CD11b expression but also cellular adherence by reduction of PMA-induced ganglioside GM3. Furthermore, treatment of HL-60 cells with exogenous ganglioside GM3 induced CD11b expression. These results show that the enhanced expression of GM3 synthase through PKC/ERKs-dependent CREB activation by PMA is associated with the differentiation of HL-60 cells by inducing expression of CD11b known as a monocyte/macrophage differentiation maker.","['Chung, Tae-Wook', 'Choi, Hee-Jung', 'Lee, Young-Choon', 'Kim, Cheorl-Ho']","['Chung TW', 'Choi HJ', 'Lee YC', 'Kim CH']","['National Research Laboratory for Glycobiology, MOST, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Glycobiology,Glycobiology,9104124,IM,"['CD11b Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Sialyltransferases/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', '*Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2004/09/24 05:00,2005/08/16 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/glycob/cwh156 [doi]', 'cwh156 [pii]']",ppublish,Glycobiology. 2005 Mar;15(3):233-44. doi: 10.1093/glycob/cwh156.

The major intestinal folate transport activity has a low-pH optimum, and the current paradigm is that this process is mediated by the reduced folate carrier (RFC), despite the fact that this carrier has a neutral pH optimum in leukemia cells. The current study addressed the question of whether constitutive low-pH folate transport activity in IEC-6 cells is mediated by RFC. Two independent IEC-6 sublines, IEC-6/A4 and IEC-6/PT1, were generated by chemical mutagenesis followed by selective pressure with antifolates. In IEC-6/A4 cells, a premature stop resulted in truncation of RFC at Gln(420). A green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion with the truncated protein was not stable. In IEC-6/PT1 cells, Ser(135) was deleted, and this alteration resulted in the failure of localization of the GFP fusion protein in the plasma membrane. In both cell lines, methotrexate (MTX) influx at neutral pH was markedly decreased compared with wild-type IEC-6 cells, but MTX influx at pH 5.5 was not depressed. Transient transfection of the GFP-mutated RFC constructs into RFC-null HeLa cells confirmed their lack of transport function. These results indicate that in IEC-6 cells, folate transport at neutral pH is mediated predominantly by RFC; however, the folate transport activity at pH 5.5 is RFC independent. Hence, constitutive folate transport activity with a low-pH optimum in this intestinal cell model is mediated by a process entirely distinct from that of RFC.","['Wang, Yanhua', 'Rajgopal, Arun', 'Goldman, I David', 'Zhao, Rongbao']","['Wang Y', 'Rajgopal A', 'Goldman ID', 'Zhao R']","['Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and the Albert Einstein Cancer Research Center, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,American journal of physiology.

It has been shown to be an effective treatment for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). These cancers are characterized by activating mutations of the Abl and c-Kit tyrosine kinases, respectively. To determine whether imatinib mesylate could be a potentially useful agent in the treatment of endometrial cancer, we assessed the expressions of Abl, c-Kit, and PDGFR in both primary and recurrent endometrial carcinoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed immunohistochemical analysis on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections from 63 patients: 33 with endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC), 11 with uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC), 12 with recurrent EEC, and seven with recurrent UPSC. The sections were stained with commercially available antibodies for Abl, PDGFR, and c-Kit. The sections were also stained for phosphorylated Abl and phosphorylated PDGFR. RESULTS: Among the primary EEC, 28/33 (85%) stained positively for Abl and 30/33 (91%) were positive for PDGFR. Of the primary UPSC, 8/11 (73%) were positive for Abl. In addition, 8/11 (73%) of the primary UPSC tumors were positive for PDGFR. Neither the primary EEC (0/33) nor the primary UPSC (0/11) expressed c-Kit. Of the recurrent EEC tumors, 11/12 (92%) were positive for Abl expression, 12/12 (100%) were positive for PDGFR, and 2/8 (25%) were positive for c-Kit. Of the recurrent UPSC, 6/7 (86%) were positive for Abl, 7/7 (100%) were positive for PDGFR, and 2/4 (50%) for c-Kit. In addition, the majority of primary and recurrent tumors were positive for phosphorylated Abl (primary EEC, 91%; primary UPSC, 64%; recurrent EEC, 83%; recurrent UPSC, 86%), and phosphorylated PDGFR (primary EEC, 46%; primary UPSC, 40%; recurrent EEC, 58%; recurrent UPSC, 100%). Within the EEC primary tumors, the differences in kinase expression by grade of tumor were not significant except for PDGFR kinase; the lower grade tumors (1 and 2) had more PDGFR expression than the grade 3 tumors (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of primary and recurrent EEC, as well as primary and recurrent UPSC express Abl and PDGFR.

The bleeding tendency of these patients may result from dysregulated platelet production, resulting in thrombocytopenia as well as qualitative platelet defects. The present study examined platelet function at diagnosis in 50 AML patients by whole blood flow cytometry. Following in vitro platelet agonist stimulation, platelet activation markers were analysed and compared with 20 healthy individuals. To detect recent in vivo platelet activation, plasma soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin) was measured. Flow cytometric analysis of platelet activation markers demonstrated reduced CD62P [35.6 vs. 118.5 x 10(3) molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome (MESF); P < 0.0001], CD63 (11.3 vs. 50.7 x 10(3) MESF; P < 0.0001), and PAC-1 (41.5 vs. 90.5%; P = 0.0001) while reductions in CD42b were abnormal (45.6 vs. 70%; P < 0.0001). sP-selectin levels were similar in patients and healthy controls (0.04 vs. 0.27 fg/platelet; P = 0.84). The presented data indicate that AML pathogenesis may result in multiple platelet defects, involving adhesion, aggregation, and secretion and demonstrate that flow cytometry is a feasible method for platelet function analysis in patients with thrombocytopenia.","['Leinoe, E B', 'Hoffmann, M H', 'Kjaersgaard, E', 'Johnsen, H E']","['Leinoe EB', 'Hoffmann MH', 'Kjaersgaard E', 'Johnsen HE']","['The Research Laboratory, Department of Haematology, Herlev University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark. leinoe@dadlnet.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adenosine Diphosphate/pharmacology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects/*physiology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'P-Selectin/blood', 'Platelet Activation/drug effects', 'Platelet Aggregation/drug effects', 'Platelet Function Tests/methods', 'Receptors, Thrombin/physiology']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05156.x [doi]', 'BJH5156 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Oct;127(1):76-84. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05156.x.,,,"['0 (P-Selectin)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombin)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)']",['Copyright 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Employing a multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay identifying 27 fusion transcripts we prospectively analysed blood and/or bone marrow samples from 390 patients referred for diagnosis and treatment for acute leukaemia and chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD) from a geographically well-defined region in Denmark. A total of 233 patients were diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), 95 with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) origin and 62 patients were recorded as CMPD. Twenty-three percent AML, 32% ALL and 55% CMPD patients exhibited chromosomal aberrations detected by the multiplex RT-PCR. Cytogenetically cryptic translocations were seen in 15% of the cases. Conversely, the cytogenetic analysis identified chromosomal aberrations other than translocations in 45% of AML cases and 63% of ALL cases. We conclude that, while the fraction of translocation positive leukaemia patients in an unselected cohort is lower than hitherto believed, a molecular approach to their diagnosis is worthwhile, partly for identifying cryptic and rare translocations, partly for monitoring MRD.","['Olesen, Lene Hyldahl', 'Clausen, Niels', 'Dimitrijevic, Andreja', 'Kerndrup, Gitte', 'Kjeldsen, Eigil', 'Hokland, Peter']","['Olesen LH', 'Clausen N', 'Dimitrijevic A', 'Kerndrup G', 'Kjeldsen E', 'Hokland P']","['Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05161.x [doi]', 'BJH5161 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Oct;127(1):59-66. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05161.x.,,,,['Copyright 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we evaluate whether bcl-2 expression quantified by four-colour flow cytometry can be effectively used to discriminate precursor B-ALL blasts from normal B-cell precursors (haematogones) and function as a leukaemia-specific marker. Levels of bcl-2 in the 22 precursor B-ALL cases studied were found to be significantly higher (over sixfold higher on average) than those present in haematogone populations from 22 control marrow specimens. Higher relative levels of bcl-2 expression in the B-ALL cases were maintained with respect to both immature CD34+ and more mature CD34- haematogone subsets, and appeared stable. Dilutional studies indicated that multiparameter flow cytometry analysis using bcl-2 could identify precursor B-ALL blasts representing as few as 1% of CD19+ cells or 0.01% of total leucocytes in bone marrow specimens containing substantial numbers of haematogones.

Internal tandem duplications (ITDs) of the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) receptor are the most common mutations in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Both ITDs and pgp positivity confer an adverse clinical prognosis. FLT3 inhibitors induce variable apoptosis in cell lines transfected with FLT3 ITDs. We studied the effect of herbimycin A, AG1296 and PKC412 on primary AML blasts. All compounds showed significantly higher cell kill after 48-h incubation in samples with an ITD compared with wild type (Herbimicin P < 0.001; AG1296 P = 0.001, PKC412, P = 0.002). Pgp-positive samples were significantly less sensitive to herbimycin and AG1296 than pgp-negative samples, although neither molecule inhibited the efflux function of pgp. The concurrent incubation with the pgp inhibitor PSC833 resulted in an enhanced cell kill in 4/5 ITD pgp-positive samples versus two of nine ITD pgp-negative samples. PKC412 inhibited pgp function and induced cell death in FLT3 ITD/pgp-positive samples. We conclude that AML samples with a FLT3 ITD are more susceptible to these inhibitors than wild-type samples. However, the expression of pgp in cells with FLT3 ITDs can reduce their sensitivity to FLT3 inhibitors and therefore pgp expression should be assessed in clinical trials of FLT3 inhibitors.","['Hunter, Hannah M', 'Pallis, Monica', 'Seedhouse, Claire H', 'Grundy, Martin', 'Gray, Claire', 'Russell, Nigel H']","['Hunter HM', 'Pallis M', 'Seedhouse CH', 'Grundy M', 'Gray C', 'Russell NH']","['Nottingham City Hospital NHS Trust, Nottingham, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05145.x [doi]', 'BJH5145 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Oct;127(1):26-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05145.x.,,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",['Copyright 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

TLS results from the rapid destruction of malignant cells and the abrupt release of intracellular ions, nucleic acids, proteins and their metabolites into the extracellular space. These metabolites can overwhelm the body's normal homeostatic mechanisms and cause hyperuricaemia, hyperkalaemia, hyperphosphaetemia, hypocalcaemia and uraemia. TLS can lead to acute renal failure and can be life-threatening. Early recognition of patients at risk and initiation of therapy for TLS is essential. There is a high incidence of TLS in tumours with high proliferative rates and tumour burden such as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and Burkitt's lymphoma. The mainstays of TLS prophylaxis and treatment include aggressive hydration and diuresis, control of hyperuricaemia with allopurinol prophylaxis and rasburicase treatment, and vigilant monitoring of electrolyte abnormalities. Urine alkalinization remains controversial. Unfortunately, there have been few comprehensive reviews on this important subject. In this review, we describe the incidence, pathophysiological mechanisms of TLS and risk factors for its development.

Because of this ability, retroviral vectors were designed with the goal of gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The ability to genetically modify HSCs provides a vehicle for durable expression of potentially therapeutic transgenes in all lineages of mature blood cells for the lifetime of the patient. Combined with bone marrow transplant, retroviral gene transfer has many potential applications for a wide range of blood diseases. Advances in the development of oncoretroviral vectors based on murine leukemia viruses (MLV) and more recent development of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-based vectors have greatly increased the gene transfer efficiency. Optimization of methods for gene transfer using MLV-based vectors has substantially improved marking levels in mice, with lower levels in large animals and in human clinical trials. With advances in gene transfer technology has also come renewed concern about insertional mutagenesis and activation of oncogenes. Advanced techniques for integration site analysis combined with sequence comparison using mouse and human genome databases has now made it possible to begin to understand the spectrum of possible integration sites for both MLV- and HIV-based vectors. Furthermore, other studies have shown positive and negative dosage-dependent effects of transgene expression in mouse and human cells. Therefore, vector design and safety testing are at the forefront of the field of gene therapy and this review discusses recent developments.","['Haviernik, Peter', 'Bunting, Kevin D']","['Haviernik P', 'Bunting KD']","['Hematopoiesis Department, Jerome H.

As components of different mRNA-protein complexes, hnRNP K and hnRNP E1/E2 function in the control of mRNA translation and mRNA stability in haematopoietic cell differentiation.","['Ostareck-Lederer, Antje', 'Ostareck, Dirk H']","['Ostareck-Lederer A', 'Ostareck DH']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Institute of Biochemistry, Martin-Luther-University, Kurt-Mothes-Str. 3, 06120 Halle (Saale), Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Biol Cell,Biology of the cell,8108529,IM,"['Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Erythropoiesis/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein K/*metabolism', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Reticulocytes/metabolism']",2004/09/24 05:00,2005/11/01 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/j.biolcel.2004.03.010 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Cell. 2004 Aug;96(6):407-11. doi: 10.1016/j.biolcel.2004.03.010.,,,"['0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein K)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 1.13.11.33 (Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase)']",,47,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is one of the most frequently deregulated genes in T-ALL, although the precise role of HOX11 in leukemogenesis as well as in normal development remains obscure. To gain more insight into the functional role of HOX11, we utilized a microarray model system to characterize the gene expression network that it directs. Using one of our T-ALL cell lines that had been stably transfected to express HOX11 and high-density oligonucleotide HG-U95A arrays, we identified a large number of differentially expressed genes in response to the enforced expression of HOX11. We focused on examining genes found to be up-regulated according to the microarray analysis and selected three putative target genes, NFKB2, SMARCD3, and NR4A3, for further investigation. We could not only confirm the up-regulation of NR4A3 by an independent method in all clones expressing HOX11, but luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that the effect that HOX11 exerted on the proximal promoter of NR4A3 was dependent on the presence of an intact homeodomain, providing support for the idea that HOX11 manifests its regulatory function via its action as a transcription factor.","['Hoffmann, Katrin', 'Dixon, Darcelle N', 'Greene, Wayne K', 'Ford, Jette', 'Taplin, Ross', 'Kees, Ursula R']","['Hoffmann K', 'Dixon DN', 'Greene WK', 'Ford J', 'Taplin R', 'Kees UR']","[""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Institute for Child Health Research and Centre for Child Health Research, University of Western Australia, P.O.

Following resolution of neutropenia, patients may require radical surgical debridement with negative margins of resection for complete eradication of the fungal infection.

The tyrosine kinase receptor, c-kit, is a growth factor receptor that is expressed in a variety of tumors including Ewing sarcoma. Blockade of c-kit by imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp, East Hanover, NJ) has been successfully used in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors. Detection of c-kit expression in Ewing sarcoma indicates a possible role of c-kit in tumor progression and a potential use of anti-c-kit therapy in Ewing sarcoma. Ki-67 is a proliferation marker found at all stages of the cell cycle. Expression of c-kit and Ki-67 was studied in 17 patients with Ewing sarcoma. Sections from paraffin-embedded tumor samples were immunostained, using standard immunohistochemical protocols, with c-kit and Ki-67 monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal c-kit antibody without antigen retrieval, and c-kit polyclonal antibody with antigen retrieval. Eleven out of 17 cases (65%) stained with c-kit monoclonal antibody; the staining was diffuse in 6/17 (35%) cases. C-kit expression did not correlate with Ki-67 proliferation rates. Using the polyclonal c-kit-antibody without antigen retrieval methods, c-kit expression was demonstrated in 1/11 (9%) cases. Incorporating antigen retrieval methods, c-kit expression increased to 53%. Concordance between monoclonal antibodies in detecting c-kit expression was observed in 12/17 cases (71%). We conclude that c-kit is variably expressed in Ewing sarcoma, using either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies.

This finding prompts us to study the usefulness of STC-1 for monitoring acute leukemia. The levels of STC-1 transcripts increased in patients with acute leukemia at diagnosis and relapse, as judged by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Levels of transcripts rapidly decreased to within the cut-off levels, when the blast numbers decreased with chemotherapy.

All of 7 patients relapsed 1 to 4 months after they showed an elevated level of the transcripts in clinical remission.

To examine these events, we followed the localization of L2 and packaged DNA after entry of infectious virions or L1/L2 pseudovirions. Confocal microscopic analyses of HeLa cells showed a time-dependent uncoating of capsids in cytoplasmic vesicles and the accumulation of both L2 and viral DNA at distinct nuclear domains identified as nuclear domain 10 (ND10). Both L2 and the pseudogenome had a punctate distribution and localized to ND10 in promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML)-expressing cells, whereas L2 had a diffuse nuclear distribution in PML-/- cells. The number of pseudovirus-infected cells was an order of magnitude higher in the PML+ cells compared with the PML-/- cells, and viral genome transcription after infection with authentic bovine papillomavirus virions was similarly elevated in PML+ cells. The results identify a role for PML in the enhancement of viral infectivity in the early part of the life cycle. We propose a model in which L2 chaperones the viral genome to ND10 to efficiently initiate viral transcription.","['Day, Patricia M', 'Baker, Carl C', 'Lowy, Douglas R', 'Schiller, John T']","['Day PM', 'Baker CC', 'Lowy DR', 'Schiller JT']","['Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. pmd@nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Bovine papillomavirus 1/growth & development/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Capsid Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/virology', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Papillomavirus Infections/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Pseudogenes/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Zinc Fingers']",2004/09/24 05:00,2005/02/08 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0404229101 [doi]', '0404229101 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Sep 28;101(39):14252-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0404229101.

Tazarotene is a prodrug selective for RARbeta/gamma, thereby motivating interest in determining whether tazarotene might activate putative tumor suppressor activity. Using HL-60 human myeloblastic leukemia cells, a cell line that undergoes G0 cell cycle arrest and myeloid differentiation in response to retinoic acid (RA), tazarotene failed to cause extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, a requirement for retinoic acid (RA)-induced G0 arrest and differentiation; retinoblastoma (RB) hypophosphorylation, another characteristic of RA-induced G0 arrest and cell differentiation; G0 arrest; or differentiation into mature myeloid cells. However, when used in combination with a retinoid X receptor (RXR)-selective ligand, tazarotene caused ERK activation, RB tumor suppressor protein hypophosphorylation, G0 arrest, and myeloid differentiation. The kinetics of G0 arrest and differentiation was similar to that of RA. Dose-response studies showed that diminishing tazarotene progressively diminished both induced cell differentiation and G0 arrest, where the doses for cellular effects were consistent with the transcriptional transactivation data. For either tazarotene or an RARalpha-selective ligand, diminishing the coadministered RXR-selective ligand diminished both induced differentiation and G0 arrest. Tazarotene could propel either early or late portions of the period leading to differentiation and G0 arrest and was interchangeable with an RARalpha-selective ligand. Tazarotene used with RXR-selective ligand may thus be a useful antineoplastic agent in differentiation induction therapy as exemplified by the prototypical RA treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia.","['Yen, Andrew', 'Fenning, Robert', 'Chandraratna, Roshantha', 'Walker, Patricia', 'Varvayanis, Susi']","['Yen A', 'Fenning R', 'Chandraratna R', 'Walker P', 'Varvayanis S']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA. ay13@cornell.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Ligands', 'Nicotinic Acids/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prodrugs/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Retinoid X Receptors/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects']",2004/09/24 05:00,2005/03/25 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1124/mol.104.003475 [doi]', 'mol.104.003475 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2004 Dec;66(6):1727-37. doi: 10.1124/mol.104.003475.

We have investigated the effect of PMB on responses mediated by the P2X(7)R in HEK293 and K562 cells transfected with P2X(7) cDNA and in mouse and human macrophages. In addition, in view of the potential exploitation of P2X(7)-directed agonists in antitumor therapy, we also investigated the effect of PMB in B lymphocytes from patients affected by chronic lymphocytic leukemia. PMB, at an optimal concentration dependent on the given cell type, greatly potentiated the effect of nucleotide-mediated P2X(7) stimulation. In particular, ATP-mediated Ca(2+) influx, plasma membrane permeabilization, and cytotoxicity were enhanced to an extent that, in the presence of PMB, cells were killed by otherwise ineffective nucleotide concentrations. The synergistic effect due to the combined application of ATP and PMB was prevented by incubation with the irreversible P2X blocker oxidized ATP (oATP), but not with the reversible antagonist 1-(N,O-bis(1,5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-N-methyl-l-tyrosyl)-4-phenilpiperazine (KN-62). Cells lacking P2X(7) were fully insensitive to the combined stimulation with PMB and ATP. Furthermore, PMB at the concentrations used had no untoward effects on cell viability. These results point to PMB as a useful tool for the modulation of P2X(7)R function and suggest that care should be used in the evaluation of ATP-stimulated immune cell responses in the presence of PMB as they may not solely be affected by removal of contaminating LPS.","['Ferrari, Davide', 'Pizzirani, Cinzia', 'Adinolfi, Elena', 'Forchap, Sylvia', 'Sitta, Barbara', 'Turchet, Laura', 'Falzoni, Simonetta', 'Minelli, Mattia', 'Baricordi, Roberto', 'Di Virgilio, Francesco']","['Ferrari D', 'Pizzirani C', 'Adinolfi E', 'Forchap S', 'Sitta B', 'Turchet L', 'Falzoni S', 'Minelli M', 'Baricordi R', 'Di Virgilio F']","['Department of Experimental and Diagnostic Medicine, Sections of General Pathology, University of Ferrara, Italy. dfr@unife.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Ethidium/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/drug effects/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Polymyxin B/*pharmacology', '*Purinergic P2 Receptor Antagonists', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2X7', 'Transfection']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/11/16 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['173/7/4652 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.173.7.4652 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2004 Oct 1;173(7):4652-60. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.173.7.4652.,,,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (P2RX7 protein, human)', '0 (P2rx7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Purinergic P2 Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2X7)', ""54970-91-1 (2',3'-dialdehyde ATP)"", '63HM46XPOW (KN 62)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EN464416SI (Ethidium)', 'J2VZ07J96K (Polymyxin B)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, because chromatin in its higher order structure cannot be transcribed, the entire Ig H chain locus must be unfolded in naive B cells. We have also established that IL-4 and anti-CD40 act by enhancing transcription in the majority of cells, rather than by activating transcription in more of the cells. Transcriptional activity in the human H chain locus rules out the perturbation of chromatin higher order structure as a factor in isotype determination.

In particular, it is yet unclear whether endogenous factors can regulate both angiogenesis and inflammation. Here, we show that the endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor, angiostatin (containing kringle domains 1-4 of plasminogen), serves an anti-inflammatory role, since the kringles 1-3 and its kringle 4 directly interact with leukocyte beta1- and beta2-integrins, respectively. In particular, a specific interaction between kringle 4 and alphaMbeta2-integrin (Mac-1) but not leukocyte function antigen 1 (LFA-1) was identified. Angiostatin thereby inhibited beta1- and beta2-integrin-mediated adhesion of leukocytes to extracellular matrix proteins and the endothelium as well as their transmigration through the endothelium in vitro. Moreover, angiostatin blocked the peritonitis-induced neutrophil emigration in vivo. In addition, through its interaction with Mac-1, angiostatin reduced activation of the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB), as well as the NFkappaB-related expression of tissue factor, a potent initiator of hemostasis following vascular injury. Finally, angiostatin forms were generated in vivo following skin injury/inflammation and were detectable during the following entire period of wound healing peaking at the terminal phase of the healing process. Taken together, over and above inhibition of neovascularization, angiostatin was identified as an antiadhesive/anti-inflammatory substance. These observations could provide the basis for new therapeutic applications of angiostatin to target chronic inflammatory processes in different pathologic situations.","['Chavakis, Triantafyllos', 'Athanasopoulos, Athanasios', 'Rhee, Joong-Sup', 'Orlova, Valeria', 'Schmidt-Woll, Thomas', 'Bierhaus, Angelika', 'May, Andreas E', 'Celik, Ilhan', 'Nawroth, Peter P', 'Preissner, Klaus T']","['Chavakis T', 'Athanasopoulos A', 'Rhee JS', 'Orlova V', 'Schmidt-Woll T', 'Bierhaus A', 'May AE', 'Celik I', 'Nawroth PP', 'Preissner KT']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Universitat Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Angiostatins/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Endothelium, Vascular/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Leukocytes/*cytology/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Peritonitis/drug therapy']",2004/09/24 05:00,2005/04/22 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-01-0166 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)46791-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Feb 1;105(3):1036-43. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-01-0166.

The leukemia consists of an overabundance of activated T cells, which express CD25 on their cell surfaces. Presently, there is no accepted curative therapy for ATL. Flavopiridol, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, has potent antiproliferative effects and antitumor activity. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of flavopiridol alone and in combination with humanized anti-Tac antibody (HAT), which recognizes CD25, in a murine model of human ATL. The ATL model was established by intraperitoneal injection of MET-1 leukemic cells into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice. Either flavopiridol, given 2.5 mg/kg body weight daily for 5 days, or HAT, given 100 microg weekly for 4 weeks, inhibited tumor growth as monitored by serum levels of human beta-2-microglobulin (beta2mu; P < .01), and prolonged survival of the leukemia-bearing mice (P < .05) as compared with the control group. Combination of the 2 agents dramatically enhanced the antitumor effect, as shown by both beta2mu levels and survival of the mice, when compared with those in the flavopiridol or HAT alone group (P < .01).

In addition to cholesterol, other non-sterol mevalonate derivatives are necessary for DNA synthesis, such as the phosphorylated forms of isopentane, farnesol, geranylgeraniol, and dolichol. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the role of cholesterol in mitosis. For this, human leukemia cells (HL-60) were incubated in a cholesterol-free medium and treated with SKF 104976, which inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis by blocking sterol 14alpha-demethylase, and the expression of relevant cyclins in the different phases of the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. Prolonged cholesterol starvation induced the inhibition of cytokinesis and the formation of polyploid cells, which were multinucleated and had mitotic aberrations. Supplementing the medium with cholesterol completely abolished these effects, demonstrating they were specifically due to cholesterol deficiency. This is the first evidence that cholesterol is essential for mitosis completion and that, in the absence of cholesterol, the cells fail to undergo cytokinesis, entered G1 phase at higher DNA ploidy (tetraploidy), and then progressed through S (rereplication) into G2, generating polyploid cells.","['Fernandez, Carlos', 'Lobo Md, Maria del Val T', 'Gomez-Coronado, Diego', 'Lasuncion, Miguel A']","['Fernandez C', 'Lobo Md Mdel V', 'Gomez-Coronado D', 'Lasuncion MA']","['Servicio de Bioquimica-Investigacion, Hospital Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cholesterol/deficiency/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Chromosome Aberrations/drug effects', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects/genetics', 'G2 Phase/drug effects/genetics', 'Giant Cells/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lanosterol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Mitosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Oxidoreductases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Polyploidy', 'S Phase/drug effects/genetics', 'Sterol 14-Demethylase']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.06.029 [doi]', 'S0014-4827(04)00385-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2004 Oct 15;300(1):109-20. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.06.029.,,,"['0 (CYP51A1 protein, human)', '0 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '136209-43-3 (SK&F 104976)', '1J05Z83K3M (Lanosterol)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.14.14.154 (Sterol 14-Demethylase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prevalence of ALL in patients >60 years of age is reported to be between 16% and 31% of all adult cases. The biology of ALL in older patients seems to be significantly different from that in younger patients and may, at least in part, explain poor treatment outcome. Immunophenotyping and cytogenetic characteristics are among the most important biological differences in comparison with younger adults. The frequency of pre B-cell ALL and common ALL is higher and T-cell ALL subtype is under-represented in elderly populations compared with younger patients. The frequency of the Philadelphia chromosome also seems to increase with age and adversely influences complete remission rate and survival. Few reports on the effectiveness and toxicity of therapeutic programmes concerning exclusively older patients with ALL have been published so far and only some of them were prospective studies. In some of the studies age-adapted approaches have been applied in which protocols processed earlier for younger patients have been adopted for older patients. In such modified protocols chemotherapy was usually less aggressive, especially if it was given for patients with comorbidities and poor performance status. Consequently, in several studies elderly patients received suboptimal treatment. Death during induction chemotherapy was observed in 7-42% of the patients in particular reports. The overall response rate varied from 12% to 85%. The median overall survival (OS) durations in patients who received a curative approach ranged from 3 to 14 months and from 1 to 14 months in patients treated palliatively. Poor performance status, comorbidities and high early mortality during intensive chemotherapy are the main reasons for poor treatment results and short OS time.

The ability to achieve a durable second remission is complicated by toxicity and resistant disease. We report a novel combination of chemotherapy for relapsed pediatric ALL. PROCEDURE: Thirty pediatric patients with relapsed medullary (n = 18) and extra-medullary (n = 12) ALL were enrolled at three pediatric institutions. Following receipt of induction and the first Block A and Block B of intensification, each patient was evaluated for toxicity, efficacy in achieving remission, and long-term survival. Additionally, minimal residual disease (MRD) detection by multidimensional flow cytometry (MDF) was performed. RESULTS: During induction, the major non-hematopoeitic toxicities were mucositis (30% of patients) and bacteremia (50% of patients). Two patients (7%) died of toxicity during induction. Toxicity during intensification Block 1A and 1B was markedly reduced. Eight-nine percent of patients with marrow disease achieved a remission following induction and intensification. The event-free survival (EFS) for all patients at 2 and 4 years were 60% (95% CI: 42-78%) and 49% (95% CI: 30-68%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This regimen for patients with relapsed ALL was successful in achieving a second remission for the majority of patients with acceptable toxicity.","['Thomson, Blythe', 'Park, Julie R', 'Felgenhauer, Judy', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Holcenberg, John', 'Geyer, J Russell', 'Avramis, Vassilios', 'Douglas, James G', 'Loken, Michael R', 'Hawkins, Douglas S']","['Thomson B', 'Park JR', 'Felgenhauer J', 'Meshinchi S', 'Holcenberg J', 'Geyer JR', 'Avramis V', 'Douglas JG', 'Loken MR', 'Hawkins DS']","[""Seattle Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center, Seattle, Washington, USA. blythe.thompson@seattlechildrens.org""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Bacteremia/chemically induced', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Mesna/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Mouth Mucosa/pathology', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/11/04 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20128 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2004 Oct;43(5):571-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20128.,,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'NR7O1405Q9 (Mesna)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']","['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such polymorphisms can lead to considerable variation in the activities of these enzymes, which are crucial in carcinogen and drug metabolism. These variations could play a role in the risk of developing paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) by their varying action on environmental carcinogens. PROCEDURE: The present study looked for two polymorphisms (m1 and m2) in the CYP1A1, CYP2D6*4 genes and deletions of the glutathione S-transferases (GSTM1 and GSTT1) in 118 paediatric ALL patients and 118 age matched control children. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) were used to study gene polymorphisms. RESULTS: In children with ALL, CYP1A1 m1 polymorphism was evident in 42.4% of subjects and CYP1A1 m2 in 37.3%. These were significantly different from the results obtained for control children (20.3% for CYP1A1 m1 and 19.5% for m2). Subjects with CYP1A1 m1 homozygous variant had a sixfold risk and CYP1A1 m2 a fourfold risk. In contrast, CYP2D6*4 was more prevalent in the controls than in the cases. Subjects with GSTM1 deletions had increased risk of ALL (OR = 2.1, P = 0.009). The odds ratios for both CYP1A1 m1 and m2 homozygous polymorphisms being associated with childhood ALL was 5.67 (95% CI = 2.11-15.27). The odds ratios for both GSTM1 and GSTT1 deletions being associated with ALL was 2.78 (95% CI = 0.67-11.56). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that genetic polymorphisms of xenobiotic metabolising enzymes appear to influence susceptibility to childhood ALL.","['Joseph, Thomas', 'Kusumakumary, P', 'Chacko, Priya', 'Abraham, Annie', 'Radhakrishna Pillai, M']","['Joseph T', 'Kusumakumary P', 'Chacko P', 'Abraham A', 'Radhakrishna Pillai M']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Drug Development and Chemoinformatics, Regional Cancer Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biotransformation', 'Carcinogens/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/*genetics', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*genetics', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'India/ethnology', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/ethnology/etiology/*genetics', 'Xenobiotics/metabolism']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/11/04 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20074 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2004 Oct;43(5):560-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20074.,,,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Xenobiotics)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (GSTT2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']","['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2004 Oct;43(5):539-41.

Imatinib mesylate (STI-571, Gleevec) and reduced intensity conditioning stem cell transplantation (RIC) are two promising new tools that offer potential for decreasing therapy associated morbidity for patients with CML. RESULTS: Large trials have shown significant responses in chronic phase patients treated with imatinib and reasonable but short-lived responses in advanced phase CML. Data from adult studies is beginning to define populations likely to progress or have prolonged responses to imatinib, and some adult treatment paradigms are moving toward reserving transplantation until patients are at risk of failure with imatinib. Early trials of RIC transplantation in CML show decreased transplant related morbidity with efficacy similar to conventional transplantation, but the approach has yet to be verified in phase III studies. Data in pediatric patients with imatinib and RIC transplantation is limited. CONCLUSIONS: Studies with imatinib are underway in pediatrics, but whether pediatric dosing schemes will lead to outcomes similar to adults is unknown. Because HLA-matched myeloablative transplantation offers a high rate of cure in the pediatric population, clinical studies assessing the role of imatinib mesylate and RIC transplantation should be planned carefully in order to avoid sub-optimal outcomes.","['Pulsipher, Michael A']",['Pulsipher MA'],"[""Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Utah/Primary Children's Medical Center, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. michael.pulsipher@hsc.utah.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Decision Making', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/11/04 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20062 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2004 Oct;43(5):523-33. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20062.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']","['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",58,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of these chimeras are rather common, such as MLL/MLLT3(AF9), but many are quite rare, with some, for example, MLL/GRAF, described only in a single case. The MLL/GRAF fusion, in which the reciprocal hybrid was not expressed, suggesting that the former transcript was the leukemogenic one, was detected in a juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia with a t(5;11)(q31;q23). Here, we report a second case--an infant acute monocytic leukemia (AML M5b)--with an MLL/GRAF fusion. By conventional G-banding, the karyotype was normal. However, Southern blot and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses revealed that MLL was rearranged and that the 5' part of the MLL gene was inserted into 5q in the vicinity of 5q31, which harbors GRAF. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed that exon 9 of MLL was fused in-frame with exon 19 of GRAF. Extralong genomic PCR with subsequent sequence analysis demonstrated that the breakpoints occurred in intron 9 of MLL, nine base pairs (bp) downstream from exon 9, and in intron 18 of GRAF, 117 bp downstream from exon 18. A 6-bp insertion (ACACTC) of unknown origin was present at the junction. The putative MLL/GRAF fusion protein would retain the AT-hook DNA-binding domain, the DNA methyl transferase motif, the transcription repression domain of MLL, and the SH3 domain of GRAF. As expected, the reciprocal GRAF/MLL was neither expressed nor generated at the genomic level as a consequence of the ins(5;11)(q31;q23q23). On the basis of the now-reported two cases with MLL/GRAF, we conclude that this transcript--but not the reciprocal one--characterizes a rare genetic subgroup of infant AML.","['Panagopoulos, Ioannis', 'Kitagawa, Ashly', 'Isaksson, Margareth', 'Morse, Helena', 'Mitelman, Felix', 'Johansson, Bertil']","['Panagopoulos I', 'Kitagawa A', 'Isaksson M', 'Morse H', 'Mitelman F', 'Johansson B']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University Hospital, SE-221 85 Lund, Sweden. ioannis.panagopoulos@klingen.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Exons', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2004/09/24 05:00,2005/08/20 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20097 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2004 Dec;41(4):400-4. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20097.,,,"['0 (ARHGAP26 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']","['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,['Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2005 Aug;43(4):424-6.

In contrast, the structurally similar but bivalent diabody and single-chain diabody demonstrated nearly no antitumor activity in an autologous system. tanDb-induced activation and proliferation of T cells occurred only in the presence of CD19+ target cells. Expression of the B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) molecules on the surface of leukemia cells made unnecessary the additional CD28-costimulation of T cells. When only a few tanDb molecules were present, the effect of CD28 costimulation on T-cell activation was more pronounced. Depending on the patient sample, we observed a 10- to 1,000-fold decrease of the half-maximal concentrations of tanDb for cell lysis. Upon CD28 crosslinking by agonistic MAb, specific tumor cell lysis was found at tanDb concentrations as low as 0.5 pM. These data demonstrate that the tetravalent CD19xCD3 tanDb might be a promising tool for the immunotherapy of human B-cell leukemias and lymphomas.","['Reusch, Uwe', 'Le Gall, Fabrice', 'Hensel, Manfred', 'Moldenhauer, Gerhard', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Little, Melvyn', 'Kipriyanov, Sergey M']","['Reusch U', 'Le Gall F', 'Hensel M', 'Moldenhauer G', 'Ho AD', 'Little M', 'Kipriyanov SM']","['Affimed Therapeutics, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'CD28 Antigens/*immunology', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.20417 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2004 Nov 10;112(3):509-18. doi: 10.1002/ijc.20417.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ADI inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in human leukemic CEM cells in a dose-dependent manner. Simultaneous treatment with ADI and DEX showed synergistic effects on DNA fragmentation and LDH release. In addition, ADI exerted its anti-proliferative activity against DEX-resistant CEM cells. ADI suppressed expression of c-myc, a potential key regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis, and increased expression of p27Kip1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. These results suggest that ADI efficiently increases the anti-cancer effect of DEX on human leukemic CEM cells through G1 cell cycle arrest involving downregulation of c-myc and upregulation of p27Kip1.","['Noh, Eun-Joo', 'Kang, Sang-Wook', 'Shin, Yong-Jae', 'Choi, Sang-Hyun', 'Kim, Chan-Gil', 'Park, In-Sun', 'Wheatley, Denys N', 'Min, Bon-Hong']","['Noh EJ', 'Kang SW', 'Shin YJ', 'Choi SH', 'Kim CG', 'Park IS', 'Wheatley DN', 'Min BH']","['Department of Pharmacology and BK21 Program for Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Korea University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrolases/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.20435 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2004 Nov 10;112(3):502-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.20435.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.3.6 (arginine deiminase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied these effects in MA-11 human breast cancer cells treated with 425.3PE, an unmodified PE covalently linked to the 425.3 antibody, which targets the EGF receptor. This IT induced efficient inhibition of protein synthesis with simultaneous induction of apoptosis. Thus, treatment of cells with 10 ng/ml of IT for 5 hr caused 85% inhibition of protein synthesis in parallel with caspase-3, -8 and -9 activation and PARP inactivation. Even after 72 hr of IT treatment, preincubation with the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK caused a significant increase in cell survival without affecting IT-induced protein synthesis inhibition. Interestingly, a combination of z-VAD-FMK and the cathepsin B/L inhibitor z-FA-FMK prevented completely IT-induced cell death in MA-11 cells after 24 hr, indicating that cathepsin activation may be important for optimal induction of IT-induced cell death. IT treatment caused after 2.5 hr a significant decrease in the level of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 but not of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Furthermore, Mcl-1 expression was not sensitive to caspase inhibitors but was totally prevented by the lactacystin proteasome inhibitor, suggesting that IT-induced apoptosis may be triggered by a reduction in the Mcl-1 level. Mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi mito) decreased concurrently with caspase activation, showing the involvement of DeltaPsi mito as a regulator of IT-induced apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that 425.3PE-mediated cell death involves simultaneous induction of apoptosis and protein synthesis inhibition in MA-11 cells, thus contributing to an understanding of the mechanisms involved in IT-induced apoptosis.","['Andersson, Yvonne', 'Juell, Siri', 'Fodstad, Oystein']","['Andersson Y', 'Juell S', 'Fodstad O']","['Department of Tumor Biology and Institute for Cancer Research, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo, Norway. y.g.andersson@klinmed.uio.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['ADP Ribose Transferases/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bacterial Toxins/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cathepsins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'ErbB Receptors/immunology', 'Exotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virulence Factors/*pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.20371 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2004 Nov 10;112(3):475-83. doi: 10.1002/ijc.20371.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (toxA protein, Pseudomonas aeruginosa)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microarray data showed HACS1 expression is up-regulated in activated human B cells treated with interleukin (IL)-4, CD40L, and anti-immunoglobulin (Ig)M and clustered with genes involved in signaling, including TNF receptor-associated protein 1, signaling lymphocytic activation molecule, IL-6, and DEC205. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that HACS1 is up-regulated by IL-4, IL-13, anti-IgM, and anti-CD40 in human peripheral blood B cells. In murine spleen B cells, Hacs1 can also be up-regulated by lipopolysaccharide but not IL-13. Induction of Hacs1 by IL-4 is dependent on Stat6 signaling and can also be impaired by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase C, and nuclear factor kappaB. HACS1 associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins after B cell activation and binds in vitro to the inhibitory molecule paired Ig-like receptor B. Overexpression of HACS1 in murine spleen B cells resulted in a down-regulation of the activation marker CD23 and enhancement of CD138 expression, IgM secretion, and Xbp-1 expression. Knock down of HACS1 in a human B lymphoma cell line by small interfering ribonucleic acid did not significantly change IL-4-stimulated B cell proliferation. Our study demonstrates that HACS1 is up-regulated by B cell activation signals and is a participant in B cell activation and differentiation.","['Zhu, Yuan Xiao', 'Benn, Sally', 'Li, Zhi Hua', 'Wei, Ellen', 'Masih-Khan, Esther', 'Trieu, Young', 'Bali, Meenakshi', 'McGlade, C Jane', 'Claudio, Jaime O', 'Stewart, A Keith']","['Zhu YX', 'Benn S', 'Li ZH', 'Wei E', 'Masih-Khan E', 'Trieu Y', 'Bali M', 'McGlade CJ', 'Claudio JO', 'Stewart AK']","['Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, McLaughlin Centre for Molecular Medicine, University of Toronto, Ontario M5G 2C1, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport/*genetics/physiology', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'STAT6 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/physiology', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/10/22 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1084/jem.20031816 [doi]', 'jem.20031816 [pii]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2004 Sep 20;200(6):737-47. doi: 10.1084/jem.20031816.,,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (SAMSN1 protein, human)', '0 (SLy2 protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT6 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT6 protein, human)', '0 (Stat6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,PMC2211965,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these, 160 pts (49%) had increased serum LDH. The analysis of LDH isoenzyme profiles in all patients showed increased percentages of isoenzyme 2 in patients with NHL, CLL and myeloproliferative syndromes, but not in samples from patients with myeloma or Hodgkin's disease. Isoenzyme alterations were then analyzed for their prognostic value in patients with NHL. In univariate analyses, increased isoenzyme 2 percentages, increased isoenzyme 3 values, total serum LDH, performance status, stage and tumour aggressiveness were prognostic variables for survival. In a multivariate analysis increased LDH isoenzyme 3 values, high isoenzyme 2 percentages and the performance status, but not total serum LDH, were independent prognostic factor for survival. High isoenzyme 3 values were predictive of early death in NHL patients. In patients with relapsing NHL, the overall survival was 12 months in patients with normal isoenzyme 3 but only 2 months in patients with increased isoenzyme 3 values.

Routine chromosome analysis of the bone marrow showed a very subtle rearrangement involving the short arm of chromosome 10 and the long arm of chromosome 11 in the abnormal cells. To clarify the nature of this rearrangement, we hybridized the MLL break-apart probe to previously G-banded slides. The rearrangement was interpreted as a small inversion within the band 11q23, separating the 5' MLL from the 3' MLL region. This segment on the long arm of chromosome 11 containing the rearranged MLL locus was either inserted in or translocated to the short arm of chromosome 10 at approximately band 10p12. The inversion affecting MLL may have followed insertion or preceded it. Molecular characterization of this rearrangement was not possible, due to limited sample material. There have been previous reports of rearrangements of MLL with the MLLT10 (alias AF10) gene locus at 10p12, including an interstitial inverted insertion of 11q13q23 in one case and insertion of 11q14q23 at 10p12 in another. These both resulted in a large derivative chromosome 10 and transcription of an MLL/MLLT10 fusion product. To our knowledge, the novel and cryptic rearrangement detected in our patient has not been described previously. A follow-up study of the patient's bone marrow at the end of induction therapy showed no morphologic evidence of residual leukemia and both FISH and chromosome analyses were normal.","['Tirado, C A', 'Lager, J', 'Rosoff, P M', 'Golembiski-Ruiz, V', 'Gong, J Z', 'Goodman, B K']","['Tirado CA', 'Lager J', 'Rosoff PM', 'Golembiski-Ruiz V', 'Gong JZ', 'Goodman BK']","['Cytogenetics Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Box 3631, Durham, NC 27710, USA. carlostirado@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/10/27 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2003/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/14 00:00 [revised]', '2004/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2004.01.018 [doi]', 'S0165-4608(04)00037-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2004 Oct 1;154(1):57-9. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2004.01.018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By flow cytometry, the immunophenotype of SR-1 was found to be compatible with a myeloid lineage (CD13+, CD33+, HLA-DR+, anti-MPO+). Conventional cytogenetics showed a three-way reciprocal translocation involving 7p22, 9q34, and 22q11.2, i.e., a variant Philadelphia chromosome translocation. The BCR/ABL rearrangement was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. To determine the tumorigenicity of the SR-1 cell line in vivo, cells were injected subcutaneously into severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Four weeks later, tumors had grown and showed the same laboratory findings as in SR-1.

These vectors, therefore, contain no coding sequence for the gag, pol, or env gene that can be used for homologous recombination with sequences introduced in the packaging system for a recombinant competent retrovirus (RCR) generation. A strong splice acceptor site obtained from the exon/intron junction of either the chimpanzee EF1-alpha gene or the human CMV major immediate early gene was placed downstream of the MoMSV packaging signal (Psi), significantly improving the efficiency of transgene expression. The 5' LTR U3 sequence was replaced with an extended human CMV major immediate early gene enhancer/promoter for a strong expression of full-length messages from the viral backbone, helping to maintain high levels of viral titer.

Previously, we showed that Axl expression correlated with neointima formation in balloon-injured rat carotid, and that Axl expression was highly regulated by angiotensin II. In the present study we tested the mechanisms by which Axl regulates vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) growth focusing on its ability to inhibit apoptosis. Treatment of cultured rat aortic VSMC for 24 h with 0% serum resulted in 19.8 +/- 1.4% apoptotic cells. Treatment of VSMC with 100 ng/ml Gas6 (the putative ligand for Axl) decreased apoptosis to 8.9 +/- 0.7% (P = 0.002, N = 17) as compared to a decrease with 10% serum to 3.0 +/- 0.2% (P = 0.001, N = 17). The ability of Gas6 to prevent apoptosis required both Gas6 binding to Axl and Axl kinase activity since treatment with a soluble, competitive Axl extracellular domain protein or transfection of a kinase inactive mutant (Axl-K567R) completely prevented the anti-apoptotic effect. Prevention of apoptosis by Gas6-Axl required activation of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K) as shown by treatment with LY294002 or transfection of an Axl deletion mutant that does not bind PI3K (Axl- triangle up PI3K). There was no significant role for ERK1/2 in the anti-apoptotic effects of Gas6-Axl since ERK1/2 activity was maintained in cells transfected with Axl- triangle up PI3K and Axl-K567R. These findings establish the Gas6-Axl-PI3K-Akt pathway as an anti-apoptotic mechanism for VSMC that may be important in the response to vascular injury.","['Melaragno, Matthew G', 'Cavet, Megan E', 'Yan, Chen', 'Tai, Lung-Kuo', 'Jin, Zheng-Gen', 'Haendeler, Judith', 'Berk, Bradford C']","['Melaragno MG', 'Cavet ME', 'Yan C', 'Tai LK', 'Jin ZG', 'Haendeler J', 'Berk BC']","['Center for Cardiovascular Research, Department of Medicine, Aab Institute for Biomedical Sciences, University of Rochester, Box MED, Rochester, NY 14642, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Mol Cell Cardiol,Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,0262322,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/cytology/*physiology', 'Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Artery/cytology', 'Rats', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Sequence Deletion/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",2004/09/24 05:00,2005/03/02 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/10 00:00 [revised]', '2004/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.yjmcc.2004.06.018 [doi]', 'S0022-2828(04)00204-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Mol Cell Cardiol. 2004 Oct;37(4):881-7. doi: 10.1016/j.yjmcc.2004.06.018.,"['F32 HL 09780/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 491921/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 59975/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL 07828/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0 (Chromones)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (growth arrest-specific protein 6)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (axl receptor tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Akt1 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it remains uncertain whether apoptotic defects are essential for tumor maintenance. To test this, we generated mice expressing a conditional BCL-2 gene and constitutive c-myc that develop lymphoblastic leukemia. Eliminating BCL-2 yielded rapid loss of leukemic cells and significantly prolonged survival, formally validating BCL-2 as a rational target for cancer therapy. Loss of this single molecule resulted in cell death, despite or perhaps attributable to the presence of other oncogenic events.

To gain information on the possible involvement of this transcription factor in the non-responsiveness of acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) patients to ATRA, we compared the endogenous expression levels of Scl and its transcription complex partners [i.e., Rbtn1 (LMO1), Rbtn2 (LMO2), Ldb1, and GATA family proteins] in leukemic blast cells from patients with AML and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), and determined the effects of lithium chloride alone or in combination with ATRA on the capacity of blast cells to differentiate during short-term ex vivo culture. Levels of Scl, Rbtn2, GATA1, and Ldb1 expression were comparable in AML and APL blasts, while the levels of expression of Rbtn1, GATA2, and GATA3 were absent or markedly lower in APL cells. Differentiation markers (cell surface myeloid antigens CD11b, CD15, CD14, and CD33) were also analyzed in blast cells. ATRA produced changes in at least one surface antigen differentiation marker in 89% of patient blasts, while LiCl caused such changes in 72% of the leukemic cells of patients. The combination of LiCl and ATRA induced the differentiation of leukemic blasts from 94% of patients. Although the expression of the transcription factors did not act as individual predictors of responsiveness or non-responsiveness to the inducers of differentiation, ATRA or ATRA plus LiCl, the addition of LiCl to ATRA increased the differentiation response over that of ATRA alone in a number of leukemic samples. These findings suggest that the combination of LiCl and ATRA may produce some clinical benefit in the treatment of the myeloid leukemias.","['Rice, Anna M', 'Holtz, Kathleen M', 'Karp, Judith', 'Rollins, Sandra', 'Sartorelli, Alan C']","['Rice AM', 'Holtz KM', 'Karp J', 'Rollins S', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lithium Chloride/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/11/17 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2003/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.leukres.2004.03.017 [doi]', 'S0145212604001237 [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2004 Nov;28(11):1227-37. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2004.03.017.,['R24 CA-82888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'G4962QA067 (Lithium Chloride)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While monocytes-macrophages itself produce cytokines, a vicious circle may lead to an ineffective function of the microenvironment resulting in ineffective haematopoieses and increased transplant-related complications.","['Kasper, Christoph', 'Lubking, Anna', 'Beelen, Dietrich W', 'Duhrsen, Ullrich']","['Kasper C', 'Lubking A', 'Beelen DW', 'Duhrsen U']","['Department of Medicine IV (Haematology and Oncology), Martin-Luther-University, Halle-Wittenberg, Ernst-Grube-Street 40, Halle (Saale) D-06120, Germany. christoph.kasper@web.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/*drug effects']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/11/17 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2003/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.leukres.2004.03.012 [doi]', 'S0145212604001158 [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2004 Nov;28(11):1217-20. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2004.03.012.,,,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twelve MS were seen and the frequency account for only 2% of all acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients observed in our department in the same period. Median age was 45 years (range: 4-84). All had been initially misdiagnosed as malignant lymphoma (ML) and a median of 2.9 months (range: 1-6) elapsed between the misdiagnosis and the correct of MS, effectuated in our department. At that time, a bone marrow examination revealed a myelodysplastic condition in seven patients, an infiltration by blast cells >30% in two patients, and normal features in the other three. In the non-leukemic patients a median of 5 months (range: 2-44 months) elapsed between the diagnosis of MS and acute leukemia. In all, 10 patients received intensive treatment. A total of seven patients (70%) achieved MS complete remission (CR). Patients who presented isolated skin localization and received only radiotherapy, obtained a MS-CR, but subsequently developed AML. Only in patients who were treated within 4 months from the initial ML diagnosis we achieved complete remission of both MS and leukemia, whereas in patients who were treated after this time, we obtained a complete disappearance of MS without response at the bone-marrow level, irrespectively of the specific therapy regimen. Median survival time from MS diagnosis was 7 months (range: 1-49 months), and only one patient is still alive, 49 months after bone marrow transplantation. Our data stress the importance of an accurate and prompt identification of this rare form of AML, and suggest that, even in patients with isolated MS, the early administration of AML-like intensive chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation might reduce the risk of subsequently developing systemic disease.","['Breccia, Massimo', 'Mandelli, Franco', 'Petti, Maria C', ""D'Andrea, Mariella"", 'Pescarmona, Edoardo', 'Pileri, Stefano A', 'Carmosino, Ida', 'Russo, Eleonora', 'De Fabritiis, Paolo', 'Alimena, Giuliana']","['Breccia M', 'Mandelli F', 'Petti MC', ""D'Andrea M"", 'Pescarmona E', 'Pileri SA', 'Carmosino I', 'Russo E', 'De Fabritiis P', 'Alimena G']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, La Sapienza University, Rome, Italy. breccia@bce.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms/diagnosis/immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Sarcoma/diagnosis/immunology/*pathology/therapy']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/11/17 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.leukres.2004.01.022 [doi]', 'S0145212604001146 [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2004 Nov;28(11):1165-9. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2004.01.022.,,,,,23,,,,,,,,,,,,

Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) is an imprinted gene that is known to be involved in the regulation of normal cell growth and that is overexpressed by a variety of tumors. The expression of IGF-2 in bone marrow cells is largely unknown. In order to elucidate gene expression level, protein expression pattern, and a potential role of IGF-2 in the pathogenesis of Ph- CMPD, we quantitatively analyzed the expression of the IGF-2 gene in bone marrow cells of 69 cases with Ph- CMPD and 31 control cases by applying real-time RT-PCR. IGF-2 gene expression in idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF) was significantly increased by up to 11-fold as compared to the control group (P < 0.0001). IMF also expressed higher IGF-2 gene level as compared to essential thrombocythaemia (ET) and polycythaemia vera (PV) (P < 0.0001, P = 0.005, respectively). Paranuclear IGF-2 protein could be demonstrated in IMF, ET, and PV exclusively in megakaryocytes and myeloid progenitor cells in contrast to undetectable IGF-2 protein in control cases. We conclude that overexpression of the IGF-2 gene is a pathogenic feature in IMF. In addition, an abundant translational and post-translational processing could explain the accumulation of IGF-2 protein detectable in all Ph- CMPD entities in contrast to non-neoplastic haematopoiesis. We conclude that IGF-2 represents a new molecular target for evaluation of underlying fundamental pathomechanisms in Ph- CMPD.","['Bock, Oliver', 'Tessema, Mathewos', 'Serinsoz, Ebru', 'von Wasielewski, Reinhard', 'Busche, Guntram', 'Kreipe, Hans']","['Bock O', 'Tessema M', 'Serinsoz E', 'von Wasielewski R', 'Busche G', 'Kreipe H']","['Institute of Pathology, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Carl-Neuberg-Strasse 1, 30625, Germany. bock.oliver@mh-hannover.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Chronic Disease', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/11/17 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2003/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.leukres.2004.03.009 [doi]', 'S0145212604000918 [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2004 Nov;28(11):1145-51. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2004.03.009.,,,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The potency of the compounds for inducing the translocation response appears to be only qualitatively related to their binding affinity for PKC, highlighting the importance of using binding affinity in conjunction with real-time measurements of protein localization for the pharmacological profiling of biologically active agents.","['Baryza, Jeremy L', 'Brenner, Stacey E', 'Craske, Madeleine L', 'Meyer, Tobias', 'Wender, Paul A']","['Baryza JL', 'Brenner SE', 'Craske ML', 'Meyer T', 'Wender PA']","['Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Chem Biol,Chemistry & biology,9500160,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Lactones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Macrolides', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Structure', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2004/09/24 05:00,2005/03/04 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2004/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.chembiol.2004.06.014 [doi]', 'S1074552104002285 [pii]']",ppublish,Chem Biol. 2004 Sep;11(9):1261-7. doi: 10.1016/j.chembiol.2004.06.014.,"['CA31845/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'MH064801/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This activation was detectable 3 min after lesioning, increased during the next 15 min and remained high for several hours. Erk1/2 activation was also observed as early as 15 min after lesioning. Activation of these MAP kinases was seen in both the external sheaths and the endoneurium. The separation of the external sheaths from the endoneurium accelerated the p38MAP kinase activation. To evaluate whether the injury-activated MAP kinase cascades are implicated in the rapid gene induction observed after nerve lesion, experiments were performed with an ex vivo model. Segments of sciatic nerves were incubated in oxygenated Krebs-Ringer buffer. MAP kinases were activated at 15 min and remained active after 6 h. Induction of mRNA was also observed for nerve growth factor (NGF), interleukin 6 (IL-6), leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and deiodinases of type 2 (D2) and type 3 (D3). Thus, the ex vivo model mimics events occurring in the animal after nerve section. Finally, nerve segments were incubated in the presence of specific inhibitors of Erk1/2 activation (U0126) and of p38MAP kinase activity (SB203580). U0126 inhibited D3, LIF and to a lesser extent NGF mRNA induction, but did not affect significantly the induction of D2 and IL-6 mRNAs. SB203580 inhibited the expression of the genes for D3 and LIF. We conclude that MAP kinase cascades, activated by nerve transection, are involved in the rapid gene induction in the nerve.","['Zrouri, H', 'Le Goascogne, C', 'Li, W W', 'Pierre, M', 'Courtin, F']","['Zrouri H', 'Le Goascogne C', 'Li WW', 'Pierre M', 'Courtin F']","['U488 Inserm, 80 rue du Gl Leclerc 94276 Le Kremlin-Bicetre cedex France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur J Neurosci,The European journal of neuroscience,8918110,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Growth Substances/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Nerve Growth Factor/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sciatic Nerve/injuries/*physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/12/23 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1460-9568.2004.03641.x [doi]', 'EJN3641 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Neurosci. 2004 Oct;20(7):1811-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2004.03641.x.,,,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '9061-61-4 (Nerve Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Six days of valproate exposure increased by up to fivefold the number and percentage of tubulin beta III-immunopositive neurons, increased neurite outgrowth, and decreased by fivefold the number of astrocytes without changing the number of cells. Valproate also promoted neuronal differentiation in human fetal forebrain stem cell cultures. The neurogenic effects of valproate on rat stem cells exceeded those obtained with the neurotrophins brain-derived growth factor (BDNF) or NT-3, and slightly exceeded the effects obtained with another mood stabilizer, lithium. No effect was observed with carbamazepine. Most of the newly formed neurons were GABAergic, as shown by 10-fold increases in neurons that immunostained for GABA and the GABA-synthesizing enzyme GAD65/67. Double immunostaining for bromodeoxyuridine and tubulin beta III showed that valproate increased by four- to fivefold the proliferation of neuronal progenitors derived from rat stem cells and increased cyclin D2 expression. Valproate also regulated the expression of survival genes, Bad and Bcl-2, at different times of treatment. The expression of prostaglandin E synthase, analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR, was increased by ninefold as early as 6 h into treatment by valproate. The enhancement of GABAergic neuron numbers, neurite outgrowth, and phenotypic expression via increases in the neuronal differentiation of neural stem cell may contribute to the therapeutic effects of valproate in the treatment of bipolar disorder.","['Laeng, Pascal', 'Pitts, Richard L', 'Lemire, Andrew L', 'Drabik, Christopher E', 'Weiner, Arin', 'Tang, Haiping', 'Thyagarajan, Rathi', 'Mallon, Barbara S', 'Altar, C Anthony']","['Laeng P', 'Pitts RL', 'Lemire AL', 'Drabik CE', 'Weiner A', 'Tang H', 'Thyagarajan R', 'Mallon BS', 'Altar CA']","['Gene Discovery, Psychiatric Genomics, Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland 20878, USA. plaeng@psygenomics.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/drug effects/physiology', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Count/methods', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin D2', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Glutamate Decarboxylase/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lithium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Neurons/*drug effects/physiology', 'Prosencephalon/*cytology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/*metabolism']",2004/09/24 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1471-4159.2004.02725.x [doi]', 'JNC2725 [pii]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 2004 Oct;91(1):238-51. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2004.02725.x.,,,"['0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (Bad protein, rat)', '0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '56-12-2 (gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 4.1.1.15 (Glutamate Decarboxylase)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'G4962QA067 (Lithium Chloride)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Standard cytogenetics and fluorescent hybridization in situ (FISH) with a probe to the centrometic sites of X/Y chromosomes were used in examination of 2 patients with acute promyelocytic and acute non-differentiated leukemia after allogenic TBM from donors of the opposite gender. Bone marrow was studied 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 17, 18 months after the transplantation. RESULTS: One of the patient in leukemia recurrence there were 72% cells with one X chromosome with unknown origin. 28% donor cells were with genotype XX. The primary archival cytological sample of the recipient's bone marrow 68% cells did not contain Y chromosome. Thus, the clone with Y loss is the recipient's clone and leukemia after transplantation developed from the recipient's cells. The other patient had only 8% dividing cells with her karyotype XX with translocation t(10;11) while 92% metaphases were donor's ones; the interphase cells ratio was 75% of host cells and 25% donor cells. This confirms leukemia origin from the recipient's cells.

While standard caryotyping depends on mytotic activity of donor and host cell populations, use of only one cytogenetic test for determination of leukemia origin after TBM may provoke diagnostic errors.","['Vinogradova, O A', 'Savchenko, V G', 'Domracheva, E V', 'Parovichnikova, E N', 'Diachenko, L V', 'Alimova, G A', 'Mendeleeva, L P', 'Liubimova, L S', 'Sokolov, A N', 'Zhelnova, E I', 'Pokrovskaia, O S']","['Vinogradova OA', 'Savchenko VG', 'Domracheva EV', 'Parovichnikova EN', 'Diachenko LV', 'Alimova GA', 'Mendeleeva LP', 'Liubimova LS', 'Sokolov AN', 'Zhelnova EI', 'Pokrovskaia OS']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromosomes, Human, X/chemistry', 'Chromosomes, Human, Y/chemistry', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology/*surgery', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Recurrence', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2004/09/24 05:00,2005/03/30 09:00,['2004/09/24 05:00'],"['2004/09/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2004;76(7):28-34.,,,,,,,,Vozmozhna li leikemicheskaia transformatsiia donorskikh kletok?,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 44 ABM transplantations were performed in 37 CML patients in the chronic phase and 7 patients in acceleration or blast crisis. RESULTS: A complete molecular remission was achieved in 26 (59%) patients: 67.6% after ABM transplantation in the chronic phase and only 14.3% after myelotransplantation in non-chronic phase. Follow-up was 8-150 months (median--59 months). Early lethality after ABM transplantation in the chronic phase was under 14%. A phase of the disease plays a key role in ABM transplantation. If it is made in a chronic phase, CML recurrence rate is low (in our series it was 14%), efficacy of donor's bone marrow lymphocyte transfusions is high. The second complete molecular remission was achieved in 3 of 4 cases of posttransplantation recurrences. Probability of maintenance of a complete remission after ABM transplantation in a chronic phase was 75%, recurrence-free survival--64%, uneventful survival 55% for 90 months.

Morphologic, immunologic and cytogenetic studies were performed in two cases of Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in order to better delineate the clinicobiological features of this cytogenetic subset of AL. Sequential cytoimmunologic studies in patient 1 documented a lineage switch from pro-B ALL with a minor myeloid component at diagnosis to minimally differentiated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at relapse. In this patient the major breakpoint cluster region (M-bcr) was in a rearranged configuration and all metaphase cells showed t(9;22)(q34;q11), both at diagnosis and at relapse. In patient 2 a diagnosis of Ph+ early T-cell ALL with minor myeloid component was made. In this patient the M-bcr was in a germline configuration. Cytogenetic studies documented the presence of the Ph chromosome in all metaphases from a lymphoid cell population obtained by fine-needle aspiration of an enlarged lymph node, and from a bone marrow cell fraction enriched in granulocyte precursors. This finding suggests multilineage involvement in this patient. Lineage switch and multilineage involvement in two patients suggest that a pluripotent stem cell may be affected rather frequently in patients with Ph+ AL.

In addition, the effectiveness of alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN) in low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (LG-NHL) and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) has been demonstrated in several clinical trials. METHODS: In a phase II study of 45 patients with B-CLL and 28 with LG-NHL, we used FLU as second and third-line chemotherapy. Dosages of 25 mg/m2 were given in 30-minute infusions for 5 consecutive days. Treatment was repeated every 28 days depending on patients' clinical status for a maximum of 6 cycles. Entrance in the human lymphoblastoid alpha-IFN maintenance portion of the study depended on response to initial FLU. Following randomization we administered alpha-IFN, or no therapy at all, to patients who obtained a complete or a partial response after FLU therapy. The alpha-IFN dose was 3 x 10(6) U three times per week until disease progression. RESULTS: Twenty-one B-CLL patients achieved major responses, as did 17 of those with LG-NHL. Twenty-four of the former group and 11 of the latter failed to respond or obtained only a minor response. The 38 patients who responded well and entered the second part of the trial showed significant prolongation of remission duration with maintenance alpha-IFN. CONCLUSIONS: In consideration of its significant activity, the role of FLU in the management of lymphoproliferative disorders needs to be evaluated further; at the same time, this preliminary analysis seems to indicate that maintenance alpha-IFN may extend remission duration in B-CLL and LG-NHL.","['Zinzani, P L', 'Levrero, M G', 'Lauria, F', 'Rondelli, D', 'Zaja, F', 'Russo, D', 'Fanin, R', 'De Rossi, G', 'Mauro, F R', 'Bendandi, M', 'Gozzetti, A', 'Dianzani, F', 'Mandelli, F', 'Tura, S']","['Zinzani PL', 'Levrero MG', 'Lauria F', 'Rondelli D', 'Zaja F', 'Russo D', 'Fanin R', 'De Rossi G', 'Mauro FR', 'Bendandi M', 'Gozzetti A', 'Dianzani F', 'Mandelli F', 'Tura S']","['Istituto di Ematologia ""L. e A.

METHODS: In order to define serum levels of GM-CSF and G-CSF in subjects affected by CML, the sera of 17 patients with CML in chronic phase treated either with hydroxyurea or interferon-alpha were tested by specific enzyme immunoassays. Fifteen age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were used as normal controls. RESULTS: Eight out of the 17 patients (44%) with CML showed detectable (> 3 pg/mL) serum levels of GM-CSF (range 3.9-55 pg/mL). Detectable levels (> 50 pg/mL) of G-CSF were observed in 9 of these patients (52%) (range 150-2,830 pg/mL). On the contrary, among the normal controls only one had detectable GM-CSF concentrations, and none had detectable G-CSF concentrations. The highest concentrations of both GM-CSF and G-CSF were seen in patients with the highest white blood cell counts, although a linear correlation between the levels of these growth factors and the number of circulating leukocytes was not demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that significant amounts of both endogenous GM-CSF and G-CSF are detectable in the serum of a substantial percentage of patients with CML in chronic phase. The pathophysiological meaning of this finding remains to be determined.","['Balleari, E', 'Bason, C', 'Visani, G', 'Gobbi, M', 'Ottaviani, E', 'Ghio, R']","['Balleari E', 'Bason C', 'Visani G', 'Gobbi M', 'Ottaviani E', 'Ghio R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*blood', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*blood', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*blood/drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood']",1994/01/01 00:00,2005/03/25 09:00,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1994 Jan-Feb;79(1):7-12.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,,,['Haematologica. 1994 Jan-Feb;79(1):1-3.

Voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies (VGCC) were measured in five patients and were positive in four. All patients had low compound muscle action potential (CMAP) at rest, a decrement in CMAP amplitude of 20-47% at 3 Hz repetitive nerve stimulation, and an increment of 200-700% at 40 Hz. In three patients the syndrome was associated with histologically verified small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). In the younger patient (40 years old), a lymph node biopsy performed nine years before the diagnosis of LEMS, had shown an atypical microcellular cancer of undetermined origin, which was treated with chemotherapy. LEMS 9 years after the diagnosis of cancer has not been described previously. The fifth patient had a two years history of bladder cancer (grade II).

We report here that activation of signaling pathway after blockade of tyrosine phosphorylation by PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chloro-phenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine), a potent and selective inhibitor of the Src-family tyrosine kinase, can lead to cell death in murine B cell leukemia, 70Z/3. Death from PP2 occurred by apoptosis as indicated by the induction of caspase activation and annexin V/propidium iodide staining. Interestingly, PP2 was found to be able to enhance the DNA binding activity of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) before induction of apoptosis without accompanying by increased phosphorylation of inhibitor of NF-kappaB-alpha (IkappaB-alpha). Additionally, immunoblotting analysis with PP2-treated cell extract demonstrated that, compared to other protein kinase C (PKC) isotypes, the translocation of novel PKC isotypes from the cytosol to membrane fraction was sustained for a longer time. These data suggest that the inhibition of Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation by PP2 may tilt the balance between each PKC isotypes, which in turn, activate NF-kappaB transcription factor, leading to apoptosis.","['Lee, Michael', 'Kim, Ji-Young', 'Koh, Woo Suk']","['Lee M', 'Kim JY', 'Koh WS']","['Korea Institute of Toxicology, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, P.O.

METHODS: To determine the causes of and risk factors for death unrelated to refractory leukemia, to disease recurrence, or to second malignancy, the authors reviewed the records of 1011 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 260 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated between 1984 and 1999 and between 1983 and 2002, respectively, at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (Memphis, TN). Data for patients who underwent stem cell transplantation were censored at the time of transplantation. RESULTS: For patients with ALL, the estimated 10-year cumulative incidence of death was 2.9% +/- 5.3%. Age was the only predictor of death. Patients with ALL 1-9 years old had a significantly lower risk of death than did younger or older patients (P = 0.002). For patients with AML, the estimated 5-year cumulative incidence of death was 7.6% +/- 1.9%. Increasing age and increasing leukocyte count were significantly associated with increased risk of death. For patients with ALL and with AML, the incidence of death remained relatively constant during the time periods studied. Infection was the most common cause of death. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, the authors determined that children > or = 10 years of age are at increased risk of death during therapy for ALL and AML.","['Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Lensing, Shelly', 'Zhou, Yinmei', 'Sandlund, John T', 'Razzouk, Bassem I', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Rubnitz JE', 'Lensing S', 'Zhou Y', 'Sandlund JT', 'Razzouk BI', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105-2794, USA. jeffrey.rubnitz@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/*therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects']",2004/09/21 05:00,2004/10/27 09:00,['2004/09/21 05:00'],"['2004/09/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.20532 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2004 Oct 1;101(7):1677-84. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20532.,['P30 CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],['(c) 2004 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

At The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX), Aspergillus terreus is second to A. fumigatus as the most common cause of IA. In the current study, the authors compared the risk factors and outcomes associated with IA caused by A. terreus and IA caused by A. fumigatus. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 300 patients who received care at our institution between 1995 and 2001 and who had cultures that were positive for Aspergillus infection, including 90 patients whose cultures were positive for A. fumigatus and 70 patients whose cultures were positive for A. terreus. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with IA caused by A. terreus and 33 patients with IA caused by A. fumigatus were evaluated. The two groups were comparable in terms of age, gender, and underlying disease. Leukemia was the most common underlying malignancy (84%). More than 40% of patients in each group had undergone bone marrow transplantation. There was a trend toward a higher frequency of neutropenia among patients with IA caused by A. terreus (P = 0.12). IA caused by A. terreus was considered to be nosocomial in origin significantly more frequently compared with IA caused by A. fumigatus (P = 0.03). In vitro, A. terreus was found to be more resistant to amphotericin B (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC90], 4.0 microg/mL) than to antifungal therapy (MIC90, 1.0 Hg/mL) in the isolates that were tested (< 50% of all isolates). The overall rate of response to antifungal therapy was 39% for patients with A. fumigatus infection, compared with 28% for patients with A. terreus infection (P = 0.43). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the decreased in vitro susceptibility of A. terreus (relative to A. fumigatus) to amphotericin B, the two groups within the current patient population had comparably poor responses to amphotericin B preparation and somewhat improved responses to posaconazole.","['Hachem, Ray Y', 'Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P', 'Boktour, Maha R', 'Afif, Claude', 'Cooksley, Catherine', 'Bodey, Gerald P', 'Chatzinikolaou, Ioannis', 'Perego, Cheryl', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Raad, Issam I']","['Hachem RY', 'Kontoyiannis DP', 'Boktour MR', 'Afif C', 'Cooksley C', 'Bodey GP', 'Chatzinikolaou I', 'Perego C', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Raad II']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control, and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA. rhachem@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amphotericin B/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Aspergillosis/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Aspergillus/*drug effects', 'Aspergillus fumigatus/drug effects', 'Cross Infection/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Drug Resistance, Fungal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Opportunistic Infections/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Triazoles/therapeutic use']",2004/09/21 05:00,2004/10/27 09:00,['2004/09/21 05:00'],"['2004/09/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.20554 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2004 Oct 1;101(7):1594-600. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20554.,,,"['0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",['(c) 2004 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, the authors set out to assess the reported association between breast carcinoma treatment and leukemia risk. METHODS: A registry of all patients with breast carcinoma who were treated at a community-based institution since 1989 (updated annually for recurrence and/or vital status) was linked to the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database to confirm complete ascertainment of leukemia cases occurring within this registry population. Incidence rates were calculated for women who were treated for primary Stage 0-III breast carcinoma and had a follow-up duration of > or = 24 months (n = 2866). Patients who did not undergo surgery (n = 5), patients for whom chemotherapy records were incomplete or who received nonstandard chemotherapy regimens (n = 69), patients who underwent stem cell transplantation (n = 83), and patients who were lost to follow-up or who had unknown disease status at follow-up (n = 81) were excluded from the analysis (total, n = 238). RESULTS: Among patients diagnosed with breast carcinoma between 1992 and 1999, the crude overall leukemia incidence rate was 0.28%, and the acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) incidence rate was 0.11%. The average follow-up duration was 5.46 years (minimum, 2 years). Eight incident cases of leukemia were documented (2 cases of AML, 1 case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 1 case of MDS/refractory anemia with excess blasts, 2 cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia, and 2 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia). National age-adjusted overall leukemia incidence rates for the period 1996-1998 predict the occurrence of 9 cases (incidence rate, 0.31%) in the current cohort of women ages 21-94 years. The incidence of leukemia by treatment category was as follows: no surgery/no chemotherapy/no radiotherapy, 2 of 154 patients (1.30%); surgery/no chemotherapy/radiotherapy, 4 of 1403 patients (0.29%); surgery/chemotherapy/no radiotherapy, 0 of 352 patients (0%); and surgery/chemotherapy/radiotherapy, 2 of 957 patients (0.21%).

The graft-versus-leukemia effect, an immune mechanism mediated by the donor immune system, is an important component of the therapeutic effect of allogeneic transplantation. Recent data from experimental animal models and from preliminary clinical experience suggest that a graft-versus-tumor effect, analogous to the graft-versus-leukemia effect, may be generated against solid tumors such as renal cell cancer, breast cancer, and other malignancies. The use of non-myeloablative, immunosuppressive conditioning regimens offers the opportunity to achieve a full-donor engraftment with reduced transplant-related complications and mortality, enabling also patients of advanced age and with co-morbidities to receive an allografting. Advanced renal cell cancer, an essentially incurable disease, has emerged from pilot studies as a disease susceptible to the graft-versus-tumor effect. Future studies will demonstrate if the tumor responses observed after allografting will translate into a clinically meaningful survival advantage. Other tumors in which tumor responses have been observed are: breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, soft-tissue sarcoma, and others. Advanced melanoma may not be amenable to graft-versus-tumor effect. Future studies will point to the identification, isolation and cloning of target antigen(s) of graft-versus-tumor effect, to further reduce toxicities and to achieve a selective cell-mediated immunotherapy.","['Bregni, Marco', 'Bernardi, Massimo', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Peccatori, Jacopo']","['Bregni M', 'Bernardi M', 'Ciceri F', 'Peccatori J']","['Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Istituto H San Raffaele, Via Olgettina 60, 20132 Milano, Italy. marco.bregni@hsr.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Springer Semin Immunopathol,Springer seminars in immunopathology,7910384,IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/immunology/therapy', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/immunology/therapy', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2004/09/21 05:00,2005/06/14 09:00,['2004/09/21 05:00'],"['2004/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/14 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00281-004-0164-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Springer Semin Immunopathol. 2004 Nov;26(1-2):95-108. doi: 10.1007/s00281-004-0164-4.

After a high intensity conditioning regimen the HLA barrier is overcome by infusing a graft containing a megadose of T cell-depleted progenitor cells. Nowadays, for graft processing automated peripheral blood CD34(+) cell immunoselection is time and labor saving and ensures a high CD34(+) cell recovery rate. Besides providing 4.5 log T cell depletion of the graft, it guarantees a 3.5 log B cell depletion, which helps prevent EBV-related lymphoproliferative disorders. Excellent engraftment rates are associated with a very low incidence of graft-versus-host disease and regimen-related mortality even in patients who are over 40 years old. Overall, event-free survival and transplant-related mortality compare favorably with reports from unrelated matched transplants. Donor natural killer cell alloreactivity also plays a role in improving outcome in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. These results show the haploidentical transplant to be a viable, alternative source of stem cells for adults with acute leukemia at high-risk of relapse who do not have matched donors, and encourage extending it to patients with an indication to transplant.","['Aversa, Franco', 'Martelli, Massimo F']","['Aversa F', 'Martelli MF']","['Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Via Brunamonti, 06123 Perugia, Italy. aversa@unipg.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Springer Semin Immunopathol,Springer seminars in immunopathology,7910384,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens', 'Haplotypes', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Recurrence', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2004/09/21 05:00,2005/06/14 09:00,['2004/09/21 05:00'],"['2004/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/14 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00281-004-0161-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Springer Semin Immunopathol. 2004 Nov;26(1-2):155-68. doi: 10.1007/s00281-004-0161-7.

Likewise, when something goes awry within a stem cell, it is likely to have far-reaching effects, since stem cells persist throughout the lifetime of the individual. Two significant biological phenomena that involve stem cells are the inevitable process of aging and a major health issue whose incidence increases with aging: cancer. In this review, we summarize evidence and theories concerning these two stem cell processes. The inability of stem cells to be passaged indefinitely in mice and the data supporting regular replication of the quiescent stem cell pool are discussed. Further, the current evidence indicating a stem cell origin of acute myeloid leukemia, including examples from both experimental mouse models and human clinical samples, is evaluated. Finally, we propose a model in which aging of the stem cell population of the hematopoietic system in particular can create conditions that are permissive to leukemia development; in fact, we suggest that aging is a secondary event in leukemogenesis.","['Bell, Deborah R', 'Van Zant, Gary']","['Bell DR', 'Van Zant G']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington 40536-0093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aging/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured/cytology/transplantation', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Disease Progression', 'Forecasting', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Stem Cells/*cytology']",2004/09/21 05:00,2004/10/22 09:00,['2004/09/21 05:00'],"['2004/09/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1207949 [doi]', '1207949 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Sep 20;23(43):7290-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207949.,"['R01 AG016653/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG022859/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG20917/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",,['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)'],,89,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the majority of the cancer cells have a limited ability to divide, a population of cancer stem cells that has the exclusive ability to extensively proliferate and form new tumors can be identified based on marker expression. Growing evidence suggests that pathways that regulate the self-renewal of normal stem cells are deregulated in cancer stem cells resulting in the continuous expansion of self-renewing cancer cells and tumor formation.

However, evidence in leukemia and more recently in solid tumors such as breast cancer suggests that the tumor cell population is heterogeneous with respect to proliferation and differentiation. Recently, several groups have described the existence of a cancer stem cell population in human brain tumors of different phenotypes from both children and adults. The finding of brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) has been made by applying the principles for cell culture and analysis of normal neural stem cells (NSCs) to brain tumor cell populations and by identification of cell surface markers that allow for isolation of distinct tumor cell populations that can then be studied in vitro and in vivo. A population of brain tumor cells can be enriched for BTSCs by cell sorting of dissociated suspensions of tumor cells for the NSC marker CD133. These CD133+ cells, which also expressed the NSC marker nestin, but not differentiated neural lineage markers, represent a minority fraction of the entire brain tumor cell population, and exclusively generate clonal tumor spheres in suspension culture and exhibit increased self-renewal capacity. BTSCs can be induced to differentiate in vitro into tumor cells that phenotypically resembled the tumor from the patient. Here, we discuss the evidence for and implications of the discovery of a cancer stem cell in human brain tumors. The identification of a BTSC provides a powerful tool to investigate the tumorigenic process in the central nervous system and to develop therapies targeted to the BTSC. Specific genetic and molecular analyses of the BTSC will further our understanding of the mechanisms of brain tumor growth, reinforcing parallels between normal neurogenesis and brain tumorigenesis.","['Singh, Sheila K', 'Clarke, Ian D', 'Hide, Takuichiro', 'Dirks, Peter B']","['Singh SK', 'Clarke ID', 'Hide T', 'Dirks PB']","['The Arthur and Sonia Labatt Brain Tumor Research Centre, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Brain/cytology', 'Brain Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Child', 'Glioma/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/pathology', 'Primates', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology']",2004/09/21 05:00,2004/10/22 09:00,['2004/09/21 05:00'],"['2004/09/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1207946 [doi]', '1207946 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Sep 20;23(43):7267-73. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207946.,,,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],,54,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, most (if not all) of the critical hematopoietic transcription factor genes identified in mammals have orthologues in zebrafish. As in other vertebrates, all of the teleost blood lineages are believed to originate from a pool of pluripotent, self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells. Here, we provide a detailed review of the timing, anatomical location, and transcriptional regulation of zebrafish 'primitive' and 'definitive' hematopoiesis as well as discuss a model of T-cell leukemia and recent advances in blood cell transplantation.

Converging evidence at the interface of cellular, molecular and numerical studies suggests that diversity is generated by the chaotic dynamics of transcription factor networks within a cell and of the combination of growth factors and cytokines in the environment, both involving cooperation and competition. Current evidence indicates that HSCs are primed for multilineage gene expression. A subtle shift in transcription factor dosage is sufficient to perturb this equilibrium and to drive lineage commitment that involves a resolution of complexity at the molecular level and a transition towards less chaotic behavior. This dynamical instability establishes a state of responsiveness to extrinsic signals. Evolutionary conserved environmental cues that drive pattern formation or migratory behavior during embryonic development operate in the adult to influence the decision between self-renewal and differentiation in HSCs, as exemplified by the role of Notch1, Wnt proteins, BMPs and VEGF. In contrast, a network of cytokines uniquely present in mammalians influences later developmental stages, from progenitors with more restricted potentials (tri-, bi- or unipotent) to mature functional cells. These cytokines have co-opted the ancient Jak-STAT pathway but also appear to trigger lineage-affiliated transcription factors, thus linking environmental signaling to cell fate decisions.","['Hoang, Trang']",['Hoang T'],"['Institute of Immunology and Cancer, University of Montreal, Quebec H3C 3J7, Canada. trang.hoang@umontreal.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Biological Evolution', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Drosophila melanogaster/cytology/genetics/growth & development', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*classification/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Organ Specificity', 'Species Specificity', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Transcription Factors/physiology']",2004/09/21 05:00,2004/10/22 09:00,['2004/09/21 05:00'],"['2004/09/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1207937 [doi]', '1207937 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Sep 20;23(43):7188-98. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207937.,,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,106,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, as a focal point for both scientific and therapeutic endeavors, leukemic stem cells (LSC) represent a critical area of investigation.

There is overwhelming evidence that virtually all cancers are clonal and represent the progeny of a single cell. What is less clear for most cancers is which cells within the tumor clone possess tumorigenic or 'cancer stem cell' (CSC) properties and are capable of maintaining tumor growth. The concept that only a subpopulation of rare CSC is responsible for maintenance of the neoplasm emerged nearly 50 years ago. Testing of this hypothesis is most advanced for the hematopoietic system due to the establishment of functional in vitro and in vivo assays for stem and progenitor cells at all stages of development. This body of work led to conclusive proof for CSC with the identification and purification of leukemic stem cells capable of repopulating NOD/SCID mice. This review will focus on the historical development of the CSC hypothesis, the mechanisms necessary to subvert normal developmental programs, and the identification of the cell in which these leukemogenic events first occur.","['Warner, Jennifer K', 'Wang, Jean C Y', 'Hope, Kristin J', 'Jin, Liqing', 'Dick, John E']","['Warner JK', 'Wang JC', 'Hope KJ', 'Jin L', 'Dick JE']","['Division of Cell and Molecular Biology, University Health Network, University of Toronto, 620 University Ave, ON M5G 2C1, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology/transplantation', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Telomere/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2004/09/21 05:00,2004/10/22 09:00,['2004/09/21 05:00'],"['2004/09/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1207933 [doi]', '1207933 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Sep 20;23(43):7164-77. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207933.,,,,,155,,,,,,,,,,,,

For mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, self-renewal is dependent on signals from the cytokine leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and from either serum or bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). In addition to the extrinsic regulation of gene expression, intrinsic transcriptional determinants are also required for maintenance of the undifferentiated state. These include Oct4, a member of the POU family of homeodomain proteins and a second recently identified homeodomain protein, Nanog. When overexpressed, Nanog allows ES cells to self-renew in the absence of the otherwise obligatory LIF and BMP signals. Although Nanog can act independent of the LIF signal, a contribution of both pathways provides maximal self-renewal efficiency. Nanog function also requires Oct4. Here, we review recent progress in ES cell self-renewal, relate this to the biology of teratocarcinomas and offer testable hypotheses to expose the mechanics of ES cell self-renewal.","['Chambers, Ian', 'Smith, Austin']","['Chambers I', 'Smith A']","[""MRC Centre Development in Stem Cell Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Research, University of Edinburgh, King's Buildings, West Mains Rd., EH9 3JQ, Scotland, UK. ichambers@ed.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor/cytology/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Cytokines/pharmacology/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology', 'Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology/physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Receptors, Cytokine/physiology', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/drug effects/physiology', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Teratocarcinoma/*pathology', 'Testicular Neoplasms/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/pharmacology/physiology']",2004/09/21 05:00,2004/10/22 09:00,['2004/09/21 05:00'],"['2004/09/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1207930 [doi]', '1207930 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Sep 20;23(43):7150-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207930.,,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NANOG protein, human)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,98,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pak1 and PGM were colocalized in model cell systems and showed functional interactions in a physiological setting. Strong direct interaction of PGM with Pak1 but not Pak2, Pak3, or Pak4 was observed. PGM binding was within 75-149 amino acids (aa) of Pak1, while Pak1 binding to PGM was in the N-terminal 96 aa. Pak1-mediated phosphorylation of PGM selectively on threonine 466 significantly increased PGM enzymatic activity and could be blocked by transfection with a dominant-negative Pak1 expression vector and by Pak1-specific small inhibitory RNA. Stable transfection of PGM into PGM-deficient K562 leukemia cells further demonstrated the role of Pak1 in regulating PGM activity. The results presented here provide new evidence that the cell signaling kinase Pak1 is a novel regulator of glucose metabolism through its phosphorylation and regulation of PGM activity. These findings suggest a new mechanism whereby growth factor signaling may coordinately integrate metabolic regulation with established signaling functions of cell cycle regulation and cell growth.","['Gururaj, Anupama', 'Barnes, Christopher J', 'Vadlamudi, Ratna K', 'Kumar, Rakesh']","['Gururaj A', 'Barnes CJ', 'Vadlamudi RK', 'Kumar R']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxycycline/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphoglucomutase/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'p21-Activated Kinases']",2004/09/21 05:00,2004/11/17 09:00,['2004/09/21 05:00'],"['2004/09/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1207969 [doi]', '1207969 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Oct 21;23(49):8118-27. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207969.,"['CA80066/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (p21-Activated Kinases)', 'EC 5.4.2.2 (PGM1 protein, human)', 'EC 5.4.2.2 (Phosphoglucomutase)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MLL is the mammalian counterpart of the Drosophila trithorax (trx) gene, involved in maintaining active gene expression states. We have used transgenic Drosophila to assess the molecular targets and cellular processes affected by MLL and two of its leukemic fusion proteins. We find that whereas expression of normal human MLL in flies does not result in phenotypic alterations, overexpressing the human MLL-AF9 and MLL-AF4 proteins causes larval to pupal lethality, which interestingly resembles the phenotypes displayed by certain Drosophila trx mutant alleles. MLL-AF9 and MLL-AF4 transgenic flies exhibit antagonistic alterations in cell cycle progression. Additionally, flies expressing MLL-AF9 display impairment in higher order chromatin integrity, evidenced in decondensation of mitotic figures. The effects of MLL fusion proteins in Drosophila suggest that alteration of chromatin structure by MLL fusion proteins may contribute to the lethal phenotype. Our results indicate that the mode(s) of action of MLL-AF9 in Drosophila varies from that of MLL-AF4. Taken together, the expression of MLL fusion proteins in Drosophila provides a new and powerful system to reveal and characterize biological activities associated with MLL fusion proteins.","['Muyrers-Chen, Inhua', 'Rozovskaia, Tatiana', 'Lee, Nara', 'Kersey, John H', 'Nakamura, Tatsuya', 'Canaani, Eli', 'Paro, Renato']","['Muyrers-Chen I', 'Rozovskaia T', 'Lee N', 'Kersey JH', 'Nakamura T', 'Canaani E', 'Paro R']","['ZMBH, University of Heidelberg, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Brain/cytology/metabolism', '*Cell Cycle', 'Chromosomes/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drosophila/*cytology/embryology/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/cytology/embryology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Larva/genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'Pupa/genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'Thioredoxins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2004/09/21 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/21 05:00'],"['2004/09/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1207904 [doi]', '1207904 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Nov 11;23(53):8639-48. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207904.,,,"['0 (DHD protein, Drosophila)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that Mcl-1 is a new substrate for caspases during induction of apoptosis. Mcl-1 cleavage occurs after Asp127 and Asp157 and generates four fragments of 24, 19, 17 and 12 kDa in both intact cells and in vitro, an effect prevented by selective caspase inhibitors. As a consequence, the resulting protein that lacks the first 127 or 157 amino acids contains only the BH1-BH3 domains of Bcl-2 family members. Mutation of Asp127 and Asp157 abolishes the generation of the 24 and 12 kDa fragments and that of the 19 and 17 kDa fragments, respectively. Interestingly, when expressed in HeLa cells Mcl-1 wt and Mcl-1 Delta127 showed a markedly different intracellular distribution. Mcl-1 wt colocalized with alpha-Tubulin near the internal face of the plasma membrane, while Mcl-1 Delta127 coassociated with Bim-EL at the mitochondrial level. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments also demonstrated that Mcl1 Delta127 exhibited increased binding to Bim when compared to Mcl-1 wt. Finally, Mcl-1 wt unlike Mcl-1 Delta127 inhibited Bim-EL-induced caspase activation. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that cleavage of Mcl-1 by caspases modifies its subcellular localization, increases its association with Bim and inhibits its antiapoptotic function.","['Herrant, Magali', 'Jacquel, Arnaud', 'Marchetti, Sandrine', 'Belhacene, Nathalie', 'Colosetti, Pascal', 'Luciano, Frederic', 'Auberger, Patrick']","['Herrant M', 'Jacquel A', 'Marchetti S', 'Belhacene N', 'Colosetti P', 'Luciano F', 'Auberger P']","['INSERM U526, Physiopathologie de la Survie et de la Mort Cellulaires et Infections Virales, Equipe Labellisee par la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, IFR50, Faculte de Medecine, Avenue de Valombrose, 06107 Nice Cedex 2, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",2004/09/21 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/21 05:00'],"['2004/09/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1208069 [doi]', '1208069 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Oct 14;23(47):7863-73. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208069.,,,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 1225 patients with de novo AML were separated according to age as follows: A1: 16 to 49 years (n=442), A2: 50 to 59 years (n=246), A3: 60-69 years (n=333), A4: 70 years and older (n=204). DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients were categorized with respect to cytogenetics into 5 groups: C1: t(15;17) (n=107), C2: CBF-AML/inv(16)/t(8;21) (n=171), C3: 11q23/MLL (n=42), C4: complex aberrant karyotype (n=130), C5: other: normal, other abnormalities, 5q-/-5, 7q-/-7, inv(3)/t(3;3), other 3q abnormalities (n=746). For each age category univariate cox regression analysis was performed using age as a continuous variable and C1 to C5 as dichotomous variables. RESULTS: In cohort A1 all parameters were significantly associated with overall survival (OS). However, in multivariate analysis all cytogenetic parameters were independently correlated with OS, while age was not. In cohort A2 only CBF and complex aberrant karyotype were significantly correlated with OS. In A3 t(15;17), complex karyotype and age, and in A4 only complex karyotype and age were significantly associated with OS in univariate and multivariate analyses. Within all cytogenetic subgroups except AML 11q23/MLL there were significant associations between age and OS. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: (i) Both age and cytogenetics are independent prognostic parameters in AML;(ii) up to the age of 49 years age has no major impact on prognosis while the karyotype has; (iii) in patients 50 years and older the influence of age on outcome increases, and (iv) cytogenetics show an independent effect on survival also in patients over 60 years old.","['Schoch, Claudia', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Schoch C', 'Kern W', 'Schnittger S', 'Buchner T', 'Hiddemann W', 'Haferlach T']","['Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany. claudia.schoch@med3.med.uni-muenchen.de <claudia.schoch@med3.med.uni-muenchen.de>']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/genetics/*mortality/surgery', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2004/09/21 05:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2004/09/21 05:00'],"['2004/09/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2004 Sep;89(9):1082-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with a normal karyotype constitute the largest single group; multiple chromosome rearrangements involving three or more chromosomes occur in 5 10% of AML patients. The pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying both groups are largely unknown. In the current study, we have systematically combined transcriptional profiles with cytogenetic data from 15 AML patients with either normal or complex karyotypes. DESIGN AND METHODS: The expression profiles were investigated by unsupervised hierarchical clustering, supervised cluster analysis, and comparative genomic microarray analysis. In addition, the samples were analyzed by G-banding and/or spectral karyotyping and comparative genomic hybridization. RESULTS: Our results show that AML with complex karyotypes exhibit a gene expression profile that is specific to this group of patients. The differentially expressed genes included several located on 5q and 7q, as well as genes involved in controlling cell division. We also found that DNA gains and losses caused by multiple chromosome rearrangements result in altered gene expression in a gene-dosage-dependent manner. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These data provide insight into the mechanisms of multiple chromosome rearrangements and further demonstrate that the expression patterns of AML are strongly linked to the karyotypic status, even for the relatively undefined cytogenetic subgroup AML with complex karyotype.","['Lindvall, Charlotta', 'Furge, Kyle', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus', 'Guo, Xiang', 'Haab, Brian', 'Blennow, Elisabeth', 'Nordenskjold, Magnus', 'Teh, Bin Tean']","['Lindvall C', 'Furge K', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Guo X', 'Haab B', 'Blennow E', 'Nordenskjold M', 'Teh BT']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Hospital and Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. charlotta.lindvall@vai.org <charlotta.lindvall@vai.org>']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', '*Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Spectral Karyotyping', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2004/09/21 05:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2004/09/21 05:00'],"['2004/09/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2004 Sep;89(9):1072-81.,,,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the existence of high-avidity T cells recognizing endogenously processed BCR/ABL-specific proteins. DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed binding studies of BCR/ABL-specific peptides, proteosomal digestion of BCR/ABL breakpoint overlapping protein, mass spectrometry of eluates from HLA-*0301-transduced K562 cells, and tried to isolate peptide-specific T-cells using tetramers. RESULTS: We confirmed the binding of the BCR/ABL-specific peptides KQSSKALQR to HLA-A*0301 and GFKQSSKAL to HLA-B*0801. Proteasomal digestion showed cleavage sites leading to KQSSKALQR but not to GFKQSSKAL. Using mass spectrometry KQSSKALQR could not be detected in the eluates from HLA-A*0301-transduced K562 cells. We attempted to induce BCR/ABL-specific CTL lines from 4 healthy donors using dendritic cells pulsed with KQSSKALQR and performed single cell sorting to isolate tetramer-positive T cells. None of 31 generated clones showed BCR/ABL-specific cytotoxicity. Isolation of tetramer-positive cells from peripheral blood of relapsed CML patients after allogeneic transplantation treated with donor lymphocyte infusion resulted in 38 T-cell clones which did not show peptide-specific cytotoxicity. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that BCR/ABL protein processing can lead to KQSSKALQR peptide binding to HLA-A*0301. However, KQSSKALQR could not be detected in HLA-A*0301-transduced K562 cells, and KQSSKALQR could not be demonstrated to induce high-avidity BCR/ABL-specific CTL.","['Posthuma, Eduardus F M', 'van Bergen, Cornelis A M', 'Kester, Michel G D', 'de Paus, Roelof A', 'van Veelen, Peter A', 'de Ru, Arnoud H', 'Drijfhout, Jan-Wouter', 'Lurvink, Ellie G A', 'Willemze, Roel', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik']","['Posthuma EF', 'van Bergen CA', 'Kester MG', 'de Paus RA', 'van Veelen PA', 'de Ru AH', 'Drijfhout JW', 'Lurvink EG', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Dept. of Hematology, Leiden, University Medical Center, PO Box 9600, 2300 RC, The Netherlands. posthuma@rdgg.nl']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology/metabolism', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*immunology/metabolism', 'HLA-A Antigens/*immunology', 'HLA-A3 Antigen', 'HLA-B Antigens/*immunology', 'HLA-B8 Antigen', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/chemical synthesis/immunology/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', '*T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity']",2004/09/21 05:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2004/09/21 05:00'],"['2004/09/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2004 Sep;89(9):1062-71.,,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A*03:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A3 Antigen)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B*08:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-B8 Antigen)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",,,,,,,['Haematologica. 2004 Sep;89(9):1035-6.

Here, we report the IFNalpha2a-dependent expression profiles of three malignant cell lines derived from liver, lymphocytes and muscle. DESIGN AND METHODS: The experiments were performed in the presence of cycloheximide, thus our results exclusively reflect direct transcriptional modulation. The short exposure time i.e. 5 hours evidences only the early events, excluding the effects of complex phenotypic changes on the expression. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that IFNalpha2a rapidly up-regulates the expression of STAT1, STAT2 and ISGF3G genes. This activity should result in the amplification of the cellular response to the cytokine. Moreover, IFNalpha2a directly modulates the expression of: (i) important transcriptional factors, e.g. IRF1 and IRF7 which control pivotal cellular events, and (ii) enzymes involved in the IFNalpha2a-dependent antiviral and apoptotic response. Interestingly, we showed that the cytokine induces transcriptional expression of Sjogren's syndrome antigen A1, a protein involved in several autoimmune diseases. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The observed changes induced by IFNalpha2a could be related to the development of autoimmune syndromes observed during IFNalpha2a treatment. A number of genes transcriptionally regulated by the cytokine have been identified for the first time; these might represent additional effectors of IFNalpha2a activity.","['Iolascon, Achille', 'Volinia, Stefano', 'Borriello, Adriana', 'Giordani, Lucia', 'Moretti, Arcangela', 'Servedio, Veronica', 'Maiorano, Nunzia', 'Cucciolla, Valeria', 'Criniti, Vittoria', 'Gasparini, Paolo', 'Indaco, Stefania', 'Della Ragione, Fulvio']","['Iolascon A', 'Volinia S', 'Borriello A', 'Giordani L', 'Moretti A', 'Servedio V', 'Maiorano N', 'Cucciolla V', 'Criniti V', 'Gasparini P', 'Indaco S', 'Della Ragione F']","['Medical Genetics University Federico II, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3, gamma Subunit/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms/pathology', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelin Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Myelin and Lymphocyte-Associated Proteolipid Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proteolipids/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/pathology', 'Ribonucleoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'STAT2 Transcription Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects']",2004/09/21 05:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2004/09/21 05:00'],"['2004/09/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2004 Sep;89(9):1046-53.,"['TGM03Z03/Telethon/Italy', 'TGM06S01/Telethon/Italy']",,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3, gamma Subunit)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (MAL protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Myelin Proteins)', '0 (Myelin and Lymphocyte-Associated Proteolipid Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteolipids)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (SS-A antigen)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT2 protein, human)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we designed this study to explore the possible effects of p27 on the proliferation and apoptosis of HL-60 and Raji cell lines. METHODS: HL-60 and Raji cells were transfected with p27 via an adenovirus-mediated approach. The efficiency of Adp27 infection and the expression of p27 mRNA and protein were evaluated by X-gal staining, RT-PCR, and flow cytometry. The proliferation and apoptosis of HL-60 and Raji cells were estimated by means of trypan blue staining, MTT assay, Annexin V/PI, and DNA ladder electrophoresis. RESULTS: The infection efficiencies in HL-60 and Raji cells were 40.3% and 32.0%, respectively. RT-PCR and flow cytometry showed that there was significant expression of p27 mRNA and protein in HL-60 and Raji cells infected with Adp27; on the other hand, uninfected HL-60 cells showed faint traces of p27 mRNA and protein and Raji cells showed nearly no signs of p27 mRNA and protein. As demonstrated by a cell growth curve and by an MTT assay, strong time-dependent proliferation inhibition was apparent in HL-60 and Raji cells infected by Adp27. After 72 hours of infection, the Annexin V+/PI- apoptotic cell rates in HL-60 and Raji cell lines were 46.9% and 35.7%, respectively, significantly higher than in the control groups (4.7% and 5.6%, respectively). Typical DNA ladder bands were detectable in HL-60 and Raji cells after 48 hours of Adp27 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Adenoviral vector-mediated p27 gene transfection of HL-60 and Raji cells leads to the inhibition of cellular proliferation and the promotion of cell apoptosis. This technique may provide an approach to gene therapy for leukemia or lymphoma.","['Wang, Qin-hong', 'Zhang, Min', 'Fang, Hua-hua', 'Nie, Xiao-xuan', 'Gao, Li', 'Liu, Yan', 'Xie, Yi']","['Wang QH', 'Zhang M', 'Fang HH', 'Nie XX', 'Gao L', 'Liu Y', 'Xie Y']","['Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Medical Center of Fudan University, Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, China. qinhong_wang@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],"['Duplicate Publication', 'Journal Article']",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'DNA/analysis', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel/methods', '*Gene Expression', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics']",2004/09/21 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/21 05:00'],"['2004/09/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2004 Sep;117(9):1353-8.,,,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(2003): Bioelectromagnetics 24:148-158] and 24 h later, to determine the post-exposure effect. The results were found to depend on the medium, pH value, conductivity, and temperature. From these experiments, suitable conditions were chosen to compare the vitality between K-562 cells and normal human lymphocytes after PEMF treatment and photodynamic action. Both agents enhance necrosis synergistically for diseased as well as for healthy cells, but the lymphocytes are more resistant. The efficacy of PEMF on the destruction of cancer cells is further increased by heating (hyperthermia) of the suspension up to 44 degrees C or by lowering the pH-value (hyperacidity) to pH 6.4. Similar apoptosis and necrosis can be obtained using moderate magnetic fields (B < or = 15 mT 50/60 Hz), but this requires longer treatment of at least over a week.

The voltage may result from ground return current that flows into the earth via the water line or from inductive effects from other sources of magnetic fields, such as transmission lines. This voltage can, in turn, serve as a source for Vbath, the voltage between the water fixtures and conductive drain pipes sunk into the earth beneath a residence. Vbath can be a source of contact current exposure to a child touching a water fixture while bathing. Previous research has suggested that exposure to these currents could be the basis for the association between power-frequency magnetic fields and childhood leukemia. In this study, we assessed the association between measured Vbath and VW-E with the average spot-measured magnetic field, Bavg, in a sample of 191 single-family residences in the Denver metropolitan area. This area was the source of cases and controls for previous studies of electric and magnetic field (EMF) and childhood cancer. The association of both Vbath and VW-E with Bavg had upward trends across magnetic field strata (<0.1 microT (reference); 0.1-<0.3 microT; and > or = 0.3 microT). In addition, VW-E was associated with Vbath. Without further study, these results cannot be applied to multi-dwelling residences or to electrical systems prevalent in other nations. Nonetheless, when combined with the finding that contact current is a far more plausible candidate than the residential magnetic field for mediating biological effects on the basis of comparative dose to bone marrow, these associations indicate that contact current exposure deserves further study.","['Kavet, Robert', 'Zaffanella, Luciano E', 'Pearson, Robert L', 'Dallapiazza, John']","['Kavet R', 'Zaffanella LE', 'Pearson RL', 'Dallapiazza J']","['Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, California 94303, USA. rkavet@epri.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Bioelectromagnetics,Bioelectromagnetics,8008281,IM,"['Baths', 'Bone Marrow/radiation effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/etiology', 'Child', 'Colorado', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Electric Impedance', 'Electric Wiring', '*Electricity/adverse effects', '*Electromagnetic Fields/adverse effects', '*Environmental Exposure', '*Housing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Magnetics/adverse effects', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Water Supply']",2004/09/18 05:00,2005/02/03 09:00,['2004/09/18 05:00'],"['2004/09/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bem.20033 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioelectromagnetics. 2004 Oct;25(7):530-6. doi: 10.1002/bem.20033.,,,,"['2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review is focused on a systematic assessment of BM features detectable at different stages of CML (stable, accelerated, blastic) following long-term (more than 10 months) treatment. By applying enzyme- and immunohistochemistry including monoclonal antibodies visualizing proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and apoptosis (anti-apostatin), a more elaborate insight into alterations affecting hematopoiesis and the stroma compartment was gained. In patients with stable-phase CML therapy resulted in a significant reduction in cellularity, neutrophil granulopoiesis and number of megakaryocytes, accompanied by a retrieval of erythroid precursors. In patients with Imatinib as the only treatment morphometric analysis of CD61+ megakaryopoiesis was in keeping with a significant decrease in maturation defects implying a lesser amount of atypical micromegakaryocytes almost consistent with normalization. Moreover, a reduction of the initially enhanced (CD34+) microvessel density was detectable associated with a decrease in luminal distension. Regression of marked to moderate myelofibrosis was recognizable in about 70% of patients especially in the accelerated and blastic phases. The amount of myeloblasts, CD34+ progenitor cells and lysozyme-expressing immature myelomonocytic cells declined with treatment, but recurred in about 19% of patients that developed a leukemic relapse after 21+/-6 months of therapy.

Amongst the various immunohistochemical markers for endothelial cells CD34 and CD105 have proven to be most reliable since they exhibit no relevant co-staining. Determination of vascularity has to include pathophysiological aspects of perfusion. Therefore, quantification of the microvascular density (MVD) by the so-called hot spot method has to be improved by parameters that characterize blood flow more properly like microvessel area (luminal distension), shape (form factor), tortuosity, and branching (maximal vessel length). In comparison to the normal BM chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) revealed a significant increase in MVD which was functionally associated with elevated levels of angiogenic cytokines. Structure of vessels was significantly altered by showing an enhanced irregularity of shape and tortuosity and increase in fibers was conspicuously accompanied by a higher degree of MVD. Contrasting the group of patients with Imatinib (STI571) therapy interferon failed to reduce the number of vessels. Following bone marrow transplantation a significant enhancement of the MVD was found in the early post-transplant period, but after about 6 months normalization occurred. Anomalies of microvascular architecture were easily demonstrable by three-dimensional reconstruction and consisted of a complex branching network of irregular shaped sinuses. Chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis displayed a significant increase in the MVD only in the advanced fibrosclerotic stages. This feature was accompanied by an enhanced luminal distension and tortuosity, thus contrasting the prefibrotic and early fibrotic phases of this disorder. Similar to CML a relationship between evolving myelofibrosis and change in vascular architecture was encountered. This feature may present a possible target for future anti-angiogenic therapy. In essential thrombocythemia there is only a mild increase in MVD detectable while in polycythemia vera besides an enlarged number, a luminal dilation due to the densely packed erythrocytes is recognizable. In conclusion, contrasting the usually applied quantification technique more elaborate morphometrical methods are warranted to obtain a better insight into the vascular architecture of the BM. In CMPDs angiogenesis is significantly associated with the evolution of myelofibrosis and may be altered by therapeutic regimens probably due to changes in cytokine release.","['Kvasnicka, H M', 'Thiele, J']","['Kvasnicka HM', 'Thiele J']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. hm.kvanicka@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Spain,Histol Histopathol,Histology and histopathology,8609357,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*blood supply', 'Chronic Disease', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/etiology/pathology', 'Microcirculation/pathology', 'Models, Anatomic', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/etiology/*pathology', '*Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/etiology/pathology']",2004/09/18 05:00,2005/03/12 09:00,['2004/09/18 05:00'],"['2004/09/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.14670/HH-19.1245 [doi]'],ppublish,Histol Histopathol. 2004 Oct;19(4):1245-60. doi: 10.14670/HH-19.1245.,,,,,126,,,,,,,,,10.14670/HH-19.1245 [doi],,,

Little information exists on growth modulation of malignant cells by KGF. We have tested the anchorage-independent clonal growth of 35 human tumor and 22 lymphoma and leukemia cell lines in semisolid media with or without rhKGF. Growth of the majority of cell lines was not significantly influenced by rhKGF. Growth of 5 cell lines (2 lung, 1 stomach, 1 colorectal, 1 breast) was significantly stimulated by rhKGF. The effect was dose-dependent with significant stimulation at concentrations >1-10 ng/ml. Growth modulation was amplified by serum reduction and abolished by anti-hKGF antibodies. Responding cell lines expressed KGF receptor RNA and showed specific KGF-binding. To determine whether KGF-induced higher colony numbers represented cell divisions with resulting differentiation and growth arrest or self-renewal we performed experiments on serial plating efficacy of colony-derived tumor cells with or without continued presence of rhKGF. Results revealed KGF stimulation of colony formation as representing increase of cellular self-renewal. To test possible interaction of rhKGF with activity of cytotoxic drugs in clinical protocols, we have used combination protocols with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Results showed that rhKGF incubation before, after (or both) addition of 5-FU did not diminish the sensitivity of tumor cells to 5-FU cytotoxicity under serum concentrations relevant for the clinical situation. In conclusion, some epithelial tumor cells have receptors for KGF signaling for clonal growth.

The present study was designed to explore a MDR1-targeted small interfering RNA (si-MDR1) approach for reversal of P-gp-mediated MDR in the MDR human leukemia cell line k562/A02. It was found that si-MDR1 significantly inhibited MDR1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Depletion of MDR1 by si-MDR1 correlated with the increased sensitivity of the cells to cytotoxic agents and with the enhanced intracellular retention of daunorubicin (DNR). One base-pair mutated control (si-MDR1-Mut) lost the effect of si-MDR1 on both the degradation of mdr1 mRNA and the reduction of P-gp expression.

The authors reviewed epidemiologic data on cancer risks from eight cohorts of over 270,000 radiologists and technologists in various countries. The most consistent finding was increased mortality due to leukemia among early workers employed before 1950, when radiation exposures were high. This, together with an increasing risk of leukemia with increasing duration of work in the early years, provided evidence of an excess risk of leukemia associated with occupational radiation exposure in that period. While findings on several types of solid cancers were less consistent, several studies provided evidence of a radiation effect for breast cancer and skin cancer. To date, there is no clear evidence of an increased cancer risk in medical radiation workers exposed to current levels of radiation doses. However, given a relatively short period of time for which the most recent workers have been followed up and in view of the increasing uses of radiation in modern medical practices, it is important to continue to monitor the health status of medical radiation workers.","['Yoshinaga, Shinji', 'Mabuchi, Kiyohiko', 'Sigurdson, Alice J', 'Doody, Michele Morin', 'Ron, Elaine']","['Yoshinaga S', 'Mabuchi K', 'Sigurdson AJ', 'Doody MM', 'Ron E']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. yosinaga@nirs.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Radiology,Radiology,0401260,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure', '*Radiology', '*Technology, Radiologic']",2004/09/18 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/18 05:00'],"['2004/09/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1148/radiol.2332031119 [doi]', '2332031119 [pii]']",ppublish,Radiology. 2004 Nov;233(2):313-21. doi: 10.1148/radiol.2332031119.

Here, we show that 5-LO expression and activity were induced by genotoxic agents in a p53-independent manner and antagonized p53- or genotoxic drug-induced apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells. 5-LO inhibited p53-governed transactivation of the pro-apoptotic genes bax and pig3 but not of p21(WAF1/CIP1) or mdm2. This may be explained by 5-LO capability to inhibit the binding of p53 to promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and p53 subnuclear relocalization into PML-nuclear bodies in response to genotoxic stress. Interestingly, 5-LO activity appears to be involved in nuclear retention and inactivation of wild-type p53 in malignant mesothelioma cells. In these cells, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of 5-LO enabled suppression of in vitro tumorigenicity by low doses of chemotherapeutic drugs. Together, these results uncover novel functions of 5-LO and contribute to the understanding of 5-LO involvement in tumor progression. Moreover, they provide a rationale to the therapeutic use of 5-LO inhibitors to enhance cancer chemosensitivity in selected tumors.","['Catalano, Alfonso', 'Caprari, Paola', 'Soddu, Silvia', 'Procopio, Antonio', 'Romano, Mario']","['Catalano A', 'Caprari P', 'Soddu S', 'Procopio A', 'Romano M']","['Department of Molecular Pathology and Innovative Therapies, Polytechnic University of Marche, Ancona, Italy. catgfp@yahoo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', '*Apoptosis', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/chemistry', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplasms/chemistry/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/analysis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2004/09/18 05:00,2005/05/18 09:00,['2004/09/18 05:00'],"['2004/09/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1096/fj.04-2258fje [doi]', '04-2258fje [pii]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2004 Nov;18(14):1740-2. doi: 10.1096/fj.04-2258fje.

It is structurally novel compared with other clinically used DNA cross-linking agents and has exhibited a unique multilog differential pattern of activity in the NCI 60-cell line screen (i.e., is COMPARE negative to other cross-linking agents). Given this profile, we undertook a preclinical evaluation of SJG-136 in primary tumor cells derived from 34 B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients. SJG-136 induced apoptosis in all of the B-CLL samples tested with a mean LD50 value (the concentration of drug required to kill 50% of the cells) of 9.06 nmol/L. Its cytotoxicity was undiminished in B-CLL cells derived from patients treated previously, those with unmutated VH genes, and those with p53 mutations (P=0.17; P=0.63; P=0.42, respectively). SJG-136-induced apoptosis was associated with the activation of caspase-3 that could be partially abrogated by the caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK. Furthermore, SJG-136 did not trigger the phosphorylation of p53 or the up-regulation of GADD45 expression in B-CLL cells whereas the cross-linking agent chlorambucil elicited both of these effects. This suggests that SJG-136 cross-linking adducts are not subject to p53-mediated DNA excision repair mechanisms in B-CLL cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate a novel mechanism of action for SJG-136 that appears to circumvent the effects of poor prognostic markers. This unique cytotoxicity profile warrants further investigation and supports the evaluation of this agent in Phase I clinical trials for patients with B-CLL.","['Pepper, Christopher J', 'Hambly, Rachel M', 'Fegan, Christopher D', 'Delavault, Patrick', 'Thurston, David E']","['Pepper CJ', 'Hambly RM', 'Fegan CD', 'Delavault P', 'Thurston DE']","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, United Kingdom. peppercj@cf.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/pathology', 'Benzodiazepines/pharmacology', 'Benzodiazepinones/*pharmacology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2004/09/18 05:00,2004/11/05 09:00,['2004/09/18 05:00'],"['2004/09/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1713 [doi]', '64/18/6750 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Sep 15;64(18):6750-5. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1713.,,,"['0', ""(1,1'-((propane-1,3-diyl)dioxy)bis(7-methoxy-2-methylidene-1,2,3,10,11,11a-hexahy"", 'dro-5H-pyrrolo(2,1-c)(1,4)benzodiazepin-5,11-dione))', '0 (Benzodiazepinones)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '12794-10-4 (Benzodiazepines)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the importance of understanding the mechanism of bystander action and the limits to this anticancer strategy, we also evaluated in vivo variables related to the expression of E. coli PNP (level of E. coli PNP activity in tumors, ectopic expression in liver, percentage of tumor cells transduced in situ, and accumulation of active metabolites in tumors). Our results indicate that F-araAMP confers excellent in vivo dose-dependent inhibition of bystander tumor cells, including strong responses in subcutaneous human glioma xenografts when 95 to 97.5% of the tumor mass is composed of bystander cells. These findings define levels of E. coli PNP expression necessary for antitumor activity with F-araAMP and demonstrate new potential for a clinically approved compound in solid tumor therapy.","['Hong, Jeong S', 'Waud, William R', 'Levasseur, Dana N', 'Townes, Tim M', 'Wen, Hui', 'McPherson, Sylvia A', 'Moore, Bryan A', 'Bebok, Zsuzsa', 'Allan, Paula W', 'Secrist, John A 3rd', 'Parker, William B', 'Sorscher, Eric J']","['Hong JS', 'Waud WR', 'Levasseur DN', 'Townes TM', 'Wen H', 'McPherson SA', 'Moore BA', 'Bebok Z', 'Allan PW', 'Secrist JA 3rd', 'Parker WB', 'Sorscher EJ']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama 35294-0005, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology/*genetics', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Glioma/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection/methods', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2004/09/18 05:00,2004/11/05 09:00,['2004/09/18 05:00'],"['2004/09/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0012 [doi]', '64/18/6610 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Sep 15;64(18):6610-5. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0012.,['CA 67763/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '1X9VK9O1SC (fludarabine phosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initial genetic mutations are often associated with dysfunctional growth regulation, as is demonstrated in several transgenic mouse models. These changes are often followed by alterations in tumor suppressor gene function, allowing unchecked cell cycle progression and, by genomic instability, additional genetic mutations responsible for tumor metastasis. Here we show that reduced transforming growth factor-beta signaling in T lymphocytes leads to a rapid expansion of a CD8+ memory T-cell population and a subsequent transformation to leukemia/lymphoma as shown by multiple criteria, including peripheral blood cell counts histology, T-cell receptor monoclonality, and host transferability. Furthermore, spectral karyotype analysis of the tumors shows that the tumors have various chromosomal aberrations. These results suggest that reduced transforming growth factor-beta signaling acts as a primary carcinogenic event, allowing uncontrolled proliferation with consequent accumulation of genetic defects and leukemic transformation.","['Lucas, Philip J', 'McNeil, Nicole', 'Hilgenfeld, Eva', 'Choudhury, Baishakhi', 'Kim, Seong-Jin', 'Eckhaus, Michael A', 'Ried, Thomas', 'Gress, Ronald E']","['Lucas PJ', 'McNeil N', 'Hilgenfeld E', 'Choudhury B', 'Kim SJ', 'Eckhaus MA', 'Ried T', 'Gress RE']","['Experimental Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/immunology/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*immunology']",2004/09/18 05:00,2004/11/05 09:00,['2004/09/18 05:00'],"['2004/09/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0896 [doi]', '64/18/6524 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Sep 15;64(18):6524-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0896.,,,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent evidence, from ourselves and others, shows that statins can also trigger tumor-specific apoptosis by blocking protein geranylgeranylation. We and others have proposed that statins disrupt localization and function of geranylgeranylated proteins responsible for activating signal transduction pathways essential for the growth and/or survival of transformed cells. To explore this further, we have investigated whether the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades play a role in regulating statin-induced apoptosis. Cells derived from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) are used as our model system. We show that p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated kinase MAPK pathways are not altered during lovastatin-induced apoptosis. By contrast, exposure of primary and established AML cells to statins results in significant disruption of basal extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation. Addition of geranylgeranyl PPi reverses statin-induced loss of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and apoptosis. By establishing and evaluating the inducible Raf-1:ER system in AML cells, we show that constitutive activation of the Raf/MAPK kinase (MEK)/ERK pathway significantly represses but does not completely block lovastatin-induced apoptosis. Our results strongly suggest statins trigger apoptosis by regulating several signaling pathways, including the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Indeed, down-regulation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway potentiates statin-induced apoptosis because exposure to the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 sensitizes AML cells to low, physiologically achievable concentrations of lovastatin. Our study suggests that lovastatin, alone or in combination with a MEK1 inhibitor, may represent a new and immediately available therapeutic approach to combat tumors with activated ERK1/2, such as AML.","['Wu, Jianghong', 'Wong, W Wei-Lynn', 'Khosravi, Fereshteh', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Penn, Linda Z']","['Wu J', 'Wong WW', 'Khosravi F', 'Minden MD', 'Penn LZ']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Lovastatin/*pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects/physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Polyisoprenyl Phosphates/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis']",2004/09/18 05:00,2004/11/05 09:00,['2004/09/18 05:00'],"['2004/09/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0866 [doi]', '64/18/6461 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Sep 15;64(18):6461-8. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0866.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Polyisoprenyl Phosphates)', '9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'N21T0D88LX (geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Small molecules that selectively inhibit FLT3 kinase activity induce apoptosis in blasts from AML patients with FLT3 mutations and prolong survival in animal models of FLT3-induced myeloproliferative disease. A spectrum of structurally different small molecules with activity against FLT3 have been described, and their efficacy for treatment of AML and ALL is now being investigated in clinical trials. Here, we describe the results of an in vitro screen designed to identify mutations in the ATP-binding pocket of FLT3 that confer resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Mutations at four different positions (Ala-627, Asn-676, Phe-691, and Gly-697) were identified that confer varying degrees of resistance to PKC412, SU5614, or K-252a. FLT3 proteins mutated at Ala-627, Asn-676, or Phe-691 remained sensitive to higher concentrations of the inhibitors, but the G697R mutation conferred high-level resistance to each of these inhibitors as well as to six additional experimental inhibitors. These data provide insights into potential mechanisms of acquired resistance of FLT3 to small molecule inhibitors and indicate that the G697R mutation may be a clinically problematic resistance mutation that warrants proactive screening for additional inhibitors.","['Cools, Jan', 'Mentens, Nicole', 'Furet, Pascal', 'Fabbro, Doriano', 'Clark, Jennifer J', 'Griffin, James D', 'Marynen, Peter', 'Gilliland, D Gary']","['Cools J', 'Mentens N', 'Furet P', 'Fabbro D', 'Clark JJ', 'Griffin JD', 'Marynen P', 'Gilliland DG']","[""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. jan.cools@med.kuleuven.ac.be""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Point Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2004/09/18 05:00,2004/11/05 09:00,['2004/09/18 05:00'],"['2004/09/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2148 [doi]', '64/18/6385 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Sep 15;64(18):6385-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2148.,"['CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK50654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that splenocytes from mice vaccinated with BCR-ABL+ leukemia-derived CRCL secreted interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) when restimulated with a BCR-ABL peptide, GFKQSSKAL, indicating that BCR-ABL peptides are chaperoned by leukemia-derived CRCL.

We also demonstrated that immunization with DCs loaded with leukemia-derived CRCL induced BCR-ABL-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in vivo. Moreover, mice immunized with DCs pulsed with 12B1-derived CRCL had superior survival (60%) when compared with those immunized with DCs pulsed with BCR-ABL peptide (20%), indicating that CRCL vaccines provide additional immune stimulus over and above individual peptide vaccination.","['Zeng, Yi', 'Graner, Michael W', 'Thompson, Sylvia', 'Marron, Marilyn', 'Katsanis, Emmanuel']","['Zeng Y', 'Graner MW', 'Thompson S', 'Marron M', 'Katsanis E']","[""University of Arizona, Department of Pediatrics, Steele Memorial Children's Center, 1501 N Campbell Ave, PO Box 245073, Tucson, AZ 85724-5073, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cancer Vaccines/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Cell Extracts/*administration & dosage/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/transplantation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*immunology/therapeutic use', '*Immunity', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Chaperones/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Peptide Fragments/administration & dosage/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",2004/09/18 05:00,2005/03/25 09:00,['2004/09/18 05:00'],"['2004/09/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-05-1915 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)45811-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Mar 1;105(5):2016-22. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-05-1915.

Sensitivity to FLT3 inhibition was particularly high in samples with MLL gene rearrangements (82%, n = 11; P = .0005), high hyperdiploidy (100%, n = 5; P = .0007), and/or FLT3 mutations (100%, n = 4; P = .0021). Seven of 7 sensitive samples examined by immunoblotting demonstrated constitutively phosphorylated FLT3 that was potently inhibited by CEP-701, whereas 0 of 6 resistant samples expressed constitutively phosphorylated FLT3. We conclude that the FLT3 inhibitor CEP-701 effectively suppresses FLT3-driven leukemic cell survival. Clinical testing of CEP-701 as a novel molecularly targeted agent for the treatment of childhood ALL is warranted.","['Brown, Patrick', 'Levis, Mark', 'Shurtleff, Sheila', 'Campana, Dario', 'Downing, James', 'Small, Donald']","['Brown P', 'Levis M', 'Shurtleff S', 'Campana D', 'Downing J', 'Small D']","['Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carbazoles/*pharmacology', 'Child', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Furans', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genotype', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Infant', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Phenotype', 'Ploidies', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2004/09/18 05:00,2005/02/16 09:00,['2004/09/18 05:00'],"['2004/09/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-06-2498 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)53022-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jan 15;105(2):812-20. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-06-2498.

In this paper, we propose a semiparametric two-sample test to identify both differentially expressed genes and select marker genes for sample classification.

Cross-validation shows that the sample classification based on genes selected using this semiparametric method has lower misclassification rates.

Inhibition of nitric oxide synthetase (NOS) activity with mercaptoethylguanidine increased the percentage of leukemia cells with depolarized mitochondria membranes after antioxidant treatment.

In F344 rats, large granular lymphocyte leukemia is the most frequent fatal disease which increases along their aging. The timely detection of rats at risk for leukemia is very important in order to exclude such animals and thus obtain precise results in many fields of investigation. In the process of assessing the main cause of death in F344/N rats of the aging farm of our institute, NILS, we found cases with no obvious contributory disease to death that showed anisocytosis in a peripheral blood smear. In such cases, histological examination of spleen revealed consistent features of leukemia and findings of the liver and kidney were considered due to this hematologic disorder. Anisocytosis was frequently seen in the advances stage of leukemia. Thus we concluded that anisocytosis is a prior condition of leukemia and its detection in a peripheral blood smear is predictive of the disease when using aged animals.","['Miyaishi, O', 'Tanaka, S', 'Kanawa, R', 'Matsuzawa, K', 'Isobe, K']","['Miyaishi O', 'Tanaka S', 'Kanawa R', 'Matsuzawa K', 'Isobe K']","['Department of Basic Gerontology, National Institute for Longevity Sciences, 36-3 Gengo, Morioka, Obu 474-8522, Japan. miyaishi@nils.go.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Arch Gerontol Geriatr,Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,8214379,,,2004/09/18 05:00,2004/09/18 05:01,['2004/09/18 05:00'],"['1999/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2000/01/11 00:00 [revised]', '2000/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/18 05:01 [medline]', '2004/09/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0167494300000431 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-4943(00)00043-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Gerontol Geriatr. 2000 Mar-Apr;30(2):161-72. doi: 10.1016/s0167-4943(00)00043-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P-gp, MRP, and LRP proteins decrease the intracellular drug concentration, Bcl-2 and Bax proteins influence the apoptosis process. The overexpression of some of these proteins is associated with poor prognosis of leukemia. The aim of this study was to find the relationship between some multidrug resistance markers and some clinical and laboratory parameters. We compare also P-gp expression between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) FAB subgroups M0-M6. METHODS AND RESULTS: With use of flow cytometry we measured the expression of P-gp, MRP, LRP, Bcl-2, and Bax proteins in acute myeloid leukemia patients cells. The study proved the association between blast percentage and P-gp protein expression (p=0.015) and the association between blast percentage and Bcl-2 protein expression (p=0.041). It was also shown the tendency of the LRP protein expression to associate with higher age of patients (p=0.062). Another correlation between MRP and Bax expression (p=0.006), as well as between LRP and Bax expression was found (p=0.034). In AML M0 FAB subgroup of patients the trend to higher P-gp protein expression was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The laboratory methodology to multidrug resistance markers detection was introduced.

If the general answer is no, however, a higher risk for cancer was reported in the parents of children with cleft lip/palate (Zhu et al. [2002: Br J Cancer 87:524-528]). In achondroplasia, the neo-mutations are from paternal origin raising the hypothesis of the existence of a ""mutator"" gene acting in male meiosis and in somatic, mitotic cells in both sexes which may favor also the occurrence of cancer. In order to test this hypothesis, a questionnaire was sent to people with non-familial achondroplasia, asking for cancer, lymphoma, and leukemia in their parents and grandparents. In the hypothesis tested, the maternal lineage was the control. One hundred forty eight answers were obtained from 76 males and 72 females with achondroplasia. Out of them 68 had parents and/or grandparents with cancer. Among the grandparents of people with achondroplasia there were 36 cancers including two lymphomas in the paternal grandparents, 20 cancers including two chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the paternal grandmothers, 22 cancers including two CML in the maternal grandfathers, and two cancers in the maternal grandmothers. Paternal grandfathers and grandmothers had significantly more cancers (56) than maternal grandfathers and grandmothers (24) (chi(2)-test = 14.80, P < 0.001). In conclusion, paternal grandfathers and grandmothers of people with achondroplasia had significantly more cancers than maternal grandfathers and grandmothers.

Predictors of infection during fludarabine-containing combination therapy are poorly defined and optimal strategies for infection prophylaxis are not known. The authors analyzed their experience with patients treated with the fludarabine-mitoxantrone (FM) or fludarabine-cyclophosphamide (FC) regimens to develop a predictive model for infections. METHODS: Ninety-two patients with indolent lymphoid malignancies were treated with FM (n = 29) or FC (n = 63). Baseline variables including age, gender, regimen, disease histology, previous therapy, time from diagnosis to current treatment, performance status, renal function, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), lymphocyte count, and immunoglobulin G levels were examined retrospectively for their association with risk of infectious complications during or within 4 weeks of therapy. RESULTS: Six risk factors were associated with infectious complications: age > 60 years, > or = 3 previous therapies, previous fludarabine exposure, time from diagnosis to current treatment of > 3 years, performance status > or = 2, and baseline ANC < 2.0 x 10(9)/L. Compared with patients with 0-2 risk factors, patients with > or = 3 risk factors had higher infection rates (26% vs. 7% per cycle, P < 0.0001), more Grade 4 neutropenia (41% vs. 8% per cycle, P < 0.0001), and more neutropenic sepsis (15% vs. 1% per cycle, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Infection risk during fludarabine-containing combination chemotherapy was predicted with a model comprising six baseline risk factors.

This second part addresses incentives as a method to increase response and evaluates the impact of non response or delayed response on the validity of the study results. Recruitment aims at minimising the proportion of refusal. To achieve this, incentives can be used and potential participants can be contacted in a sequence of increasing intensity. The effectiveness of different incentives was investigated within the pretest of the German survey on children and adolescents by the Robert Koch Institute. A low response is often interpreted in terms of non-response bias. This assumption, however, is as incorrect as would be opposite conclusion, that a high response guarantees valid results. Any study of the influence of nonresponse requires information on non-responders. The comparison between early and late responders as an indirect method to evaluate systematic differences between participants and non-participants by wave analysis is demonstrated within the Northern Germany Leukaemia and Lymphoma study (NLL). The German guidelines for Good Epidemiologic Practice recommend to solicit a minimum of information on the principal hypotheses of a study from non-participants. The example of a population-based health survey (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg, KORA) illustrates how information on non-responders within a quantitative non-responder analysis can be achieved and used for the estimation of prevalences.

Studies in genetically engineered animal models have demonstrated a critical role for the gp130-dependent cardiomyocyte survival pathway in the transition to heart failure. In the present study, we examined plasma levels of the IL-6 family of cytokines and the soluble form of their receptors in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Circulating levels of the IL-6 family of cytokines, soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), and soluble gp130 (sgp130) were examined in 48 patients with various degrees of CHF, including dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), and valvular cardiomyopathy (VCM). Circulating levels of IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and sgp130 significantly increased in association with the severity of CHF.

In order to elucidate the mechanism of its antiproliferative activity, we investigated its effects on the cell cycle and apoptosis in human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells. METHODS: Cell viability was assessed via an MTT assay. Apoptosis was investigated in terms of nuclear morphology, DNA fragmentation, and phosphatidylserine externalization. Cell cycle analysis was performed via PI staining and flow cytometry (FCM). Western blotting and immunofluorescence methods were used to determine the levels of p53, cell cycle-related proteins and Bcl-2 family members. FCM was also used to estimate the changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), intracellular Ca2+ concentration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. RESULTS: Cell cycle analysis showed that diosgenin caused G2/M arrest independently of p53. The levels of cyclin B1 and p21Cip1/Waf1 were decreased, whereas cdc2 levels were increased. Subsequent apoptosis was demonstrated with the dramatic activation of caspase-3. A dramatic decline in intracellular Ca2+ concentration was observed as an initiating event in the process of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, which was followed by the hyperpolarization and depolarization of MMP. Generation of ROS was observed in the progression of apoptosis. The antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins were downregulated, whereas the proapoptotic Bax was upregulated. CONCLUSIONS: Diosgenin inhibits K562 cell proliferation via cell cycle G2/M arrest and apoptosis, with disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction playing vital roles.","['Liu, Ming-Jie', 'Wang, Zhao', 'Ju, Yong', 'Wong, Ricky Ngok-Shun', 'Wu, Qing-Yu']","['Liu MJ', 'Wang Z', 'Ju Y', 'Wong RN', 'Wu QY']","[""Department of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Diosgenin/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis']",2004/09/17 05:00,2005/01/19 09:00,['2004/09/17 05:00'],"['2004/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/19 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-004-0849-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2005 Jan;55(1):79-90. doi: 10.1007/s00280-004-0849-3.

Epidemiologic, etiologic and cytogenetic aspects and new risk factors according to published data and own results].",506-17,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most frequent solid tumor in women. The incidence is increasing. In Germany, about 45,000 women are newly diagnosed each year. The general strategy aims for the best local control of the tumor by surgery and radiotherapy. This strategy is supplemented by systemic adjuvant chemotherapy and/or anti-hormonal therapy. The following substances have shown their efficacy in clinical trials: alkylating agents, antimetabolites, anthracyclines, topoisomerase inhibitors, platinum derivatives, and taxanes. Due to intensified treatment schedules remission rates and overall survival could be significantly improved. On the other hand, the long-term toxicity of this antineoplastic therapy is an increasing problem. SECONDARY LEUKEMIAS: Therapy-associated secondary leukemias frequently occur after treatment for malignant lymphomas and multiple myelomas. However, they can also be observed after antineoplastic therapy of solid tumors such as cancers of the breast, lung, testicles and ovaries and sarcomas. The highest risk for secondary leukemias has been attributed to concurrent radiochemotherapy. Therapy-associated hematologic neoplasias are a severe medical problem due to the high incidence of breast cancer and the dismal outcome of secondary leukemias, which occur in 0.3-5% of patients receiving antineoplastic therapy. RISK FACTORS: The delineation of new individual risk factors is urgently required to improve the safety of modern breast cancer treatment, which includes intensive combined radiochemotherapy. Candidate mechanisms could be polymorphisms in DNA repair and/or xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. Preliminary data suggest that the resulting deficiencies in xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases increase the risk for therapy-induced hematologic neoplasias in patients with breast cancer.","['Haase, Detlef', 'Hanf, Volker', 'Schulz, Thomas']","['Haase D', 'Hanf V', 'Schulz T']","['Abteilung Hamatologie und Onkologie, Georg-August-Universitat, Gottingen. haase.onkologie@med.uni-goettingen.de']",['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Med Klin (Munich),"Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)",8303501,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'DNA Repair', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione Transferase/deficiency/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/chemically induced/epidemiology/etiology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/epidemiology/etiology/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics', 'Odds Ratio', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Time Factors', 'Xenobiotics/metabolism']",2004/09/17 05:00,2004/11/16 09:00,['2004/09/17 05:00'],"['2004/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00063-004-1077-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Klin (Munich). 2004 Sep 15;99(9):506-17. doi: 10.1007/s00063-004-1077-7.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Xenobiotics)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",,91,,,"Therapieinduzierte hamatologische Neoplasien nach Mammakarzinomen.

METHODS: From 52 of 70 children who participated in a previous study on vincristine pharmacokinetics, patient material was available for investigation of the MDR1 genetic variants. The SNPs C3435T and G2677T were determined by use of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Vincristine side effects were scored retrospectively from patient records. RESULTS: No association was observed between C3435T or G2677T and vincristine pharmacokinetic variables. When haplotypes were assigned, haplotype 1/1 carriers (3435C/2677G) showed a longer elimination half-life than noncarriers (1156 versus 805 minutes, P =.038). In contrast, haplotype 1/2 carriers (3435T/2677G) had a shorter elimination half-life than noncarriers (805 versus 1180 minutes, P =.044). However, this significance was lost after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. The haplotypes did not affect the other pharmacokinetic parameters, such as clearance and area under the concentration-time curve, suggesting that the observed effect on elimination half-life is of very limited relevance. Moreover, SNPs in the MDR1 gene did not identify patients with an increased risk for vincristine-induced constipation. CONCLUSION: The genetic variants in the MDR1 gene alone cannot explain the large variability in vincristine pharmacokinetics.","['Plasschaert, Sabine L A', 'Groninger, Ellis', 'Boezen, Marike', 'Kema, Ido', 'de Vries, Elisabeth G E', 'Uges, Donald', 'Veerman, Anjo J P', 'Kamps, Willem A', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'de Graaf, Siebold S', 'de Bont, Eveline S J M']","['Plasschaert SL', 'Groninger E', 'Boezen M', 'Kema I', 'de Vries EG', 'Uges D', 'Veerman AJ', 'Kamps WA', 'Vellenga E', 'de Graaf SS', 'de Bont ES']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Groningen, Hanzeplein 1, 9713 GZ Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Pharmacol Ther,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,0372741,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/physiology', 'Female', '*Genes, MDR', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vincristine/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics']",2004/09/17 05:00,2004/10/01 05:00,['2004/09/17 05:00'],"['2004/09/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.clpt.2004.05.007 [doi]', 'S0009923604001924 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2004 Sep;76(3):220-9. doi: 10.1016/j.clpt.2004.05.007.,,,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New fluorescent compounds, among which Bodipy-FL-verapamil (BV), have been therefore proposed as more useful tools. The uptake of BV has been evaluated by cytofluorimetry and fluorescence microscopy using cell lines that overexpress P-glycoprotein (P388/ADR and LLC-PK(1)/ADR) or MRP (multidrug resistance-related protein) (PANC-1) and clinical specimens from patients. The effect of specific inhibitors for P-glycoprotein (verapamil and vinblastine) or MRP (MK571 and probenecid) has been also studied. BV intracellular concentrations were significantly lower in the two P-glycoprotein overexpressing cell lines in comparison with the parental lines. In addition, verapamil and vinblastine increased the intracellular concentrations of the dye; MK571 and probenecid, two MRP inhibitors, increased BV levels in PANC-1 cells, that express this protein. These findings were confirmed in clinical specimens from patients. Fluorescence microscopy revealed a faint fluorescence emission in P-glycoprotein or MRP expressing cell lines; however, treatment with specific inhibitors significantly increased the fluorescence. BV is a useful tool for studying multidrug resistance proteins with different techniques such as cytofluorimetry and fluorescence microscopy, but does not discriminate between P-glycoprotein and MRP. In comparison with other classic fluorescent probes, the assay with this dye is extremely rapid, simple, not toxic for cells, devoid of fluorescent background, and can be useful in the clinical settings.","['Rosati, Anna', 'Candussio, Luigi', 'Crivellato, Enrico', 'Klugmann, Fiora Bartoli', 'Giraldi, Tullio', 'Damiani, Daniela', 'Michelutti, Angela', 'Decorti, Giuliana']","['Rosati A', 'Candussio L', 'Crivellato E', 'Klugmann FB', 'Giraldi T', 'Damiani D', 'Michelutti A', 'Decorti G']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Trieste, I-34127 Triste, Italy. annarosati@iol.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Oncol,Cellular oncology : the official journal of the International Society for Cellular Oncology,101219418,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Assay/*methods', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Probenecid/pharmacokinetics', 'Propionates/pharmacokinetics', 'Quinolines/pharmacokinetics', 'Sus scrofa', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Verapamil/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Vinblastine/pharmacokinetics']",2004/09/17 05:00,2005/03/25 09:00,['2004/09/17 05:00'],"['2004/09/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1155/2004/576173 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Oncol. 2004;26(1-2):3-11. doi: 10.1155/2004/576173.,,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Propionates)', '0 (Quinolines)', '137759-83-2 (Bodipy-verapamil)', '5Q9O54P0H7 (verlukast)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'PO572Z7917 (Probenecid)']",,,PMC4611116,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the potencies of all folate-receptor targeted therapies depend on 1) the rate of folate-linked drug conjugate binding to the cancer cell surface, 2) the dose of folate conjugate that will saturate tumor cell surface FR in vivo, 3) the rate of FR internalization, unloading, and recycling back to the tumor cell surface for another round of conjugate uptake, and 4) the residence time of the folate conjugate before its metabolism or release from the cell.

We quantitate here the properties of FR saturation, internalization, recycling, and unloading in several cultured cancer cell lines and murine tumor models, and we describe the conditions that should maximize both the potencies and specificities of folate receptor-targeted therapies in vivo.","['Paulos, Chrystal M', 'Reddy, Joseph A', 'Leamon, Christopher P', 'Turk, Mary Jo', 'Low, Philip S']","['Paulos CM', 'Reddy JA', 'Leamon CP', 'Turk MJ', 'Low PS']","['Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Endocytosis', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Folic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'KB Cells', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Pentetic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/*metabolism']",2004/09/17 05:00,2005/03/25 09:00,['2004/09/17 05:00'],"['2004/09/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1124/mol.104.003723 [doi]', 'mol.104.003723 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2004 Dec;66(6):1406-14. doi: 10.1124/mol.104.003723.

Pathways regulating maintenance of adult HSCs are largely unknown. Here we report that the Ets-related transcription factor Tel/Etv6, the product of a locus frequently involved in translocations in leukemia, is a selective regulator of HSC survival. Following inactivation of Tel/Etv6, HSCs are lost in the adult bone marrow but their progeny are unaffected and transiently sustain blood formation. Accordingly, absence of Tel/Etv6 after lineage commitment is ostensibly without consequence except for unexpected impairment of maturation of megakaryocytes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: MOLT-4 (p53-wild type) and KG1a (p53-null) cells were irradiated with gamma-rays (3 Gy at 1.57 Gy min(-1)) and the effects of wortmannin and 3-AB were evaluated. Telomerase activity was measured by polymerase chain reaction and the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase, human telomerase RNA and telomerase-associated protein 1 was assessed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Apoptosis was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. RESULTS: A radiation-induced up-regulation of telomerase activity was observed from 4 h post-irradiation in both cell lines. This up-regulation was abrogated by wortmannin and 3-AB. Telomerase activity was maximal 24 h post-irradiation, coinciding with an accumulation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase mRNA. Apoptosis and G2/M arrest were evident from 4 h post-irradiation in MOLT-4 cells. KG1a cells exhibited a G2/M block at 24 h post-irradiation and apoptosis increased between 24 and 48 h post-irradiation. 3-AB abolished G2/M blockage and enhanced radiation-induced apoptosis in both cell lines, while wortmannin increased apoptosis only in MOLT-4 cells. CONCLUSIONS: 3-AB inhibits the radiation-associated telomerase activity increase and enhances apoptosis in MOLT-4 and KG1a cells. Wortmannin, which also inhibits the radiation-associated telomerase activity increase in both cell lines, does not modify radiation-induced apoptosis in KG1a cells. DNA repair enzymes might be selective targets for enhancing radiosensitivity in certain tumour cells.","['Dubner, D', 'del Rosario Perez, M', 'Michelin, S', 'Bourguignon, M', 'Moreau, P', 'Carosella, E D', 'Gisone, P']","['Dubner D', 'del Rosario Perez M', 'Michelin S', 'Bourguignon M', 'Moreau P', 'Carosella ED', 'Gisone P']","['Autoridad Regulatoria Nuclear, Gerencia de Apoyo Cientifico Laboratorio de Radiopatologia, Avenida del Libertador 8250 (C1429BNP) Buenos Aires, Argentina. ddubner@cae.arn.gov.ar']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,IM,"['Androstadienes/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Telomerase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Wortmannin']",2004/09/17 05:00,2004/10/22 09:00,['2004/09/17 05:00'],"['2004/09/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/09553000412331283506 [doi]', 'M5LF4HRPCT9EJDPG [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2004 Aug;80(8):593-605. doi: 10.1080/09553000412331283506.,,,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '8J365YF1YH (3-aminobenzamide)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A matched case-control design was used. The study population comprised all children (0-14 years old) born and reported to the Danish Cancer Registry between 1976 and 1991 for a diagnosis of leukaemia (n=377). Controls were selected from the Central Population Registry and matched by sex, age, and time of birth. Each child was assigned three categories of socioeconomic status, one corresponding to the annual average income in the municipality of residence at the time of birth, another corresponding to that at the time of diagnosis, and, finally, each family was assigned one of five social classes by use of the job titles of the parents. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of socioeconomic status on the risk of childhood leukaemia. RESULTS: Children born in low-income municipalities had a significantly increased risk of leukaemia (RR=2.71; 95% CI=1.41-5.21; p=0.003), which was higher among those who received their diagnosis before age five (RR=3.43; 95% CI=1.52-7.74; p=0.003). Neither individual social class nor the socioeconomic status of the residential area at the time of diagnosis was convincingly associated with the risk of childhood leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that socioeconomic factors associated with community characteristics rather than individual lifestyle are related to the risk of childhood leukaemia and that these factors act early in life.","['Raaschou-Nielsen, Ole', 'Obel, Josephine', 'Dalton, Susanne', 'TjOnneland, Anne', 'Hansen, Johnni']","['Raaschou-Nielsen O', 'Obel J', 'Dalton S', 'TjOnneland A', 'Hansen J']","['Institute of Cancer Epidemiology, Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen, Denmark. ole@cancer.dk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Sweden,Scand J Public Health,Scandinavian journal of public health,100883503,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', '*Social Class']",2004/09/17 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/17 05:00'],"['2004/09/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/14034940310022214 [doi]', 'V3Q4NJ6K2JA68AC4 [pii]']",ppublish,Scand J Public Health. 2004;32(4):279-86. doi: 10.1080/14034940310022214.,,,,['Copyright 2004 Taylor & Francis'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blast phenotype, p-glycoprotein expression, cytokine production, and lineage specificity were examined. The Vitamin D3 analogs had no effect on cell viability and proliferation. They induced incomplete differentiation, with increase in AP, NSE and NBT positivity of cells, but no cell sticking and spreading as observed with TPA. The analogs were more effective than the parent compound. They also inhibited the production of IL-6 and IL-8. Vitamin D3 and its analogs can induce differentiation of primary cells from AML patients in vitro, but may need to be combined with other agents for terminal differentiation of blasts and effective therapy in vivo.","['Srivastava, Maya D', 'Ambrus, Julian L']","['Srivastava MD', 'Ambrus JL']","['Department of Pediatrics, Metro Health Medical Center, 2500 Metro Health Drive, Cleveland, Ohio 44109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Interleukin-8/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2004/09/17 05:00,2005/04/20 09:00,['2004/09/17 05:00'],"['2004/09/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/1042819032000159924 [doi]', 'CAH5FN2GF3KDRP1U [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Oct;45(10):2119-26. doi: 10.1080/1042819032000159924.,,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report we investigated whether a soluble form of CD80 (sCD80) circulates in vivo and whether levels are altered in patients with hematological malignancies. Circulating sCD80 was detected by ELISA in all normal donor (0.024-0.318 ng/ml) and patient (0.02-3.75 ng/ml) blood analyzed. The majority of acute myeloid leukemia (13/17) and multiple myeloma (11/12) patients had normal sCD80 levels. Significantly elevated levels were detected in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, P = 0.0001) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL, P = 0.0002) patients. MCL patients had the highest levels with 8/9 having levels > 0.318 ng/ml. Increased sCD80 levels in CLL were significantly associated with poor prognosis markers such as low platelet (P = 0.01) and hemoglobin (P = 0.002) levels, elevated WBC counts (P = 0.03) and expression of CD38 (P = 0.048). The immunoreactivity of the sCD80 in both normal and patient plasma was inhibited by the presence of CTLA-4-Ig, suggesting sCD80 is functional. Comparison of sCD80 and soluble CD86 levels demonstrated that these molecules were independently elevated in 39% of patients. The finding that a proportion of CLL and the majority of MCL patients contain elevated levels of sCD80 and the demonstration that sCD80 can interact with CTLA-4-Ig suggests a potential role for sCD80 in modulating anti-tumor responses during the malignant process.","['Hock, B D', 'Starling, G C', 'Patton, W N', 'Salm, N', 'Bond, K', 'McArthur, L T', 'McKenzie, J L']","['Hock BD', 'Starling GC', 'Patton WN', 'Salm N', 'Bond K', 'McArthur LT', 'McKenzie JL']","['Haematology Research Group, Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand. barry.hock@chmeds.ac.nz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Abatacept', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antigens, Differentiation/metabolism', 'B7-1 Antigen/*blood/metabolism', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'CTLA-4 Antigen', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/blood/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/blood', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/immunology', 'Solubility']",2004/09/17 05:00,2005/04/20 09:00,['2004/09/17 05:00'],"['2004/09/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/10428190410001712199 [doi]', '12UMPAQ2FJ1LVHTQ [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Oct;45(10):2111-8. doi: 10.1080/10428190410001712199.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '7D0YB67S97 (Abatacept)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, a subset of genes with a characteristic expression profile correlating with the mutational status of B-CLLs has been identified. One of the overexpressed genes in the prognostically unfavorable group of CLL patients with unmutated Ig VH genes encodes for the protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-70, which is physiologically involved in T-cell signaling. Since ZAP-70 has been described to be prognostically relevant in CLL, we analyzed the possible relationship of its expression to the mutational status of Ig VH genes as well as to other prognostic factors in CLL and indolent lymphomas. The mutational status of Ig VH genes was analyzed by seminested PCR, direct sequencing and comparison with the sequences of the EMBL databases in 60 samples of patients with B-CLL and 18 samples of patients with indolent B-cell malignancies. ZAP-70 protein expression was assessed in all samples by immunoblotting and for semiquantitative analysis the ratio of ZAP-70 to tubulin expression was calculated. ZAP-70 protein was found to be expressed in all investigated B-cell malignancies. Expression levels varied within a wide range in each entity. The highest mean level of ZAP-70 expression was observed in unmutated B-CLLs, however, with broad expression variability. High levels of ZAP-70 expression correlated with higher stage Binet B or C and with unmutated Ig VH genes. Overall survival rates estimated by Kaplan-Meier curves did not differ among patients with high or low ZAP-70 expression. We conclude that ZAP-70 is associated with the mutational status of Ig VH genes, but this expression pattern is not present in all individual cases. Furthermore, high levels of ZAP-70 correlated with Binet stages B or C indicating an involvement of ZAP-70 in mechanisms promoting growth of B-CLL cells.","['Kim, Soo-Zin', 'Chow, Kai Uwe', 'Kukoc-Zivojnov, Natasa', 'Boehrer, Simone', 'Brieger, Angela', 'Steimle-Grauer, Susanne Annette', 'Harder, Lana', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Mitrou, Paris Sophokles', 'Weidmann, Eckhart']","['Kim SZ', 'Chow KU', 'Kukoc-Zivojnov N', 'Boehrer S', 'Brieger A', 'Steimle-Grauer SA', 'Harder L', 'Hoelzer D', 'Mitrou PS', 'Weidmann E']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/genetics/physiology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis/*genetics/physiology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Survival Analysis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase']",2004/09/17 05:00,2005/04/20 09:00,['2004/09/17 05:00'],"['2004/09/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/10428190410001714016 [doi]', '88T0GYJFETC54NQ8 [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Oct;45(10):2037-45. doi: 10.1080/10428190410001714016.,,,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chlorambucil, an aromatic derivative of nitrogen mustards, is the most common treatment for chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL). The response rate with its use is 40 to 60%, with 3 to 10% only of patients achieving a complete response (CR). To improve response rates, chlorambucil has been combined with steroids or other agents. Theophylline, a methylxanthine commonly used as a treatment for asthma, has been shown to induce apoptosis in CLL cells both in vitro and in vivo. Chlorambucil induces apoptosis in CLL cells as well and synergy has been shown between the two drugs without affecting the normal B lymphocytes. The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential utility of this combination as a therapeutic modality for B-CLL. A total of 210 B-CLL patients were recruited and randomized to receive either chlorambucil in an oral dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day indefinitely (109 patients) or chlorambucil 0.1 mg/kg/day plus theophylline 200 mg bid, orally (101 patients). The main endpoints were overall survival from the time of randomization, disease status after 9 months and time to disease progression. After 9 months of treatment, clinical and hematological remission was achieved in 14 patients (12.8%) in the chlorambucil group, compared to 26 (25.7%) in the chlorambucil plus theophylline group (P value 0.01). Partial remission was observed for 38 patients (34.9%) in the chlorambucil group and 36 patients (35.7%) in the chlorambucil plus theophylline group. In patients treated with chlorambucil alone, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 30 months and in patients treated with chlorambucil plus theophylline it was 44 months. Probabilities of PFS at 24 months for the chlorambucil-treated patients were 59% and 85% for the chlorambucil plus theophylline-treated patients. The difference was statistically significant (P = 0.006). The 3-year and 5-year overall survival rates were, respectively 75% and 38% in the chlorambucil group as opposed to 76% and 46% in the chlorambucil plus theophylline group. The median survival time was 55 months in the chlorambucil group and 56 months in the chlorambucil plus theophylline group. Forty-nine patients died in the chlorambucil group compared to 44 patients in the chlorambucil plus theophylline group (P = 0.371). The trial has demonstrated that adding theophylline to the standard treatment of B-CLL significantly increases effectiveness of treatment in terms of tumor response and time to disease progression. It could not improve the overall survival. Treatment with theophylline does not compromise quality of life or add significant toxicity. As newer drugs have recently become available for treating patients with CLL like fludarabine, further trials are needed to evaluate the effect of combining theophylline with these drugs.","['Mabed, Mohamed', 'Aref, Salah', 'Fouda, Manal', 'El-Sharawy, Solafa']","['Mabed M', 'Aref S', 'Fouda M', 'El-Sharawy S']","['Hematology and Medical Oncology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Egypt. mohmabed@mans.edu.eg']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Cause of Death', 'Chlorambucil/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality of Life', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Theophylline/*administration & dosage/toxicity']",2004/09/17 05:00,2005/04/20 09:00,['2004/09/17 05:00'],"['2004/09/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/10428190410001714061 [doi]', '9EN6U821R2N61EK7 [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Oct;45(10):2029-35. doi: 10.1080/10428190410001714061.,,,"['18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'C137DTR5RG (Theophylline)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In transgenic mice over expressing the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, myeloid cell factor-1 (Mcl-1), B cell lymphomas occur. Moreover, mice conditional for the loss of Mcl-1 display a profound reduction in B and T lymphocytes. This suggests that Mcl-1 is an essential survival factor in lymphocytes. In the present study, we have evaluated the role of Mcl-1 in CLL. Mcl-1 protein expression was measured by Western blot analysis in the CLL cells of 45 patients and correlated with clinical variables and survival. Mcl-1 levels were similar in 29 patients to normal B and T lymphocytes, were decreased in 8 patients and increased in 12 patients. An inverse correlation was found between Mcl-1 expression and Rai stage (P = 0.001). When assessed by flow cytometry, Mcl-1 expressions were normally distributed among CLL cells in individual patients and the mean levels correlated with those obtained by Western blotting. To evaluate the role of Mcl-1 in drug resistance, Mcl-1 levels were sequentially measured in the leukemic cells of 4 CLL patients during therapy with fludarabine (Flu). The Mcl-1 levels were found to increase in 2 patients while the peripheral blood lymphocyte counts dropped, suggesting that the residual drug-resistant cells had the highest Mcl-1 levels. Primary CLL cells were also treated with chlorambucil (CLB) or Flu in vitro and the Mcl-1 levels decreased correlating with the sensitivity of these cells to undergo apoptosis. Drug sensitivities of the CLL cells to CLB and Flu were also measured by MTT assay and the concentrations of drug required to decrease cell viability by 50% (IC50) varied from 1.9 to 9.27 microM for Flu (median, 9.4 microM) and 10 to 32.5 microM (median, 5.5 microM) for CLB. The sensitivities of the leukemic cells to CLB correlated inversely with Mcl-1 levels (P < 0.05). These results suggest that Mcl-1 may contribute to cell survival in CLL.","['Johnston, James B', 'Paul, James T', 'Neufeld, Nathan J', 'Haney, Neil', 'Kropp, Dianne M', 'Hu, Xiaojie', 'Cheang, Mary', 'Gibson, Spencer B']","['Johnston JB', 'Paul JT', 'Neufeld NJ', 'Haney N', 'Kropp DM', 'Hu X', 'Cheang M', 'Gibson SB']","['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg R3E 0V9, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorambucil/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*etiology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/chemistry/drug effects/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/*physiology', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2004/09/17 05:00,2005/04/20 09:00,['2004/09/17 05:00'],"['2004/09/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/10428190410001723317 [doi]', 'YDYJDH1F7E90E5ND [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Oct;45(10):2017-27. doi: 10.1080/10428190410001723317.,,,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood involvement has been reported with variable frequency, but information on the natural history of cases presenting with leukemia is lacking. This study aimed to determine the clinical and prognostic features of such cases. We studied clinical features, tumor characteristics, prognostic factors and outcome in 58 patients with leukemic presentation of MCL. Diagnosis was based on morphology, immunophenotype, presence of t(11;14), histology and cyclin D1 expression. The median age was 62 years and male:female 2.4:1. Presenting features included splenomegaly (74%), lymphadenopathy (45%), hepatomegaly (17%) and, in a minority, gastro-intestinal involvement or involvement of Waldeyer's ring; 10% had lymphocytosis alone. Six patients developed central nervous system disease. Median lymphocyte count was 58 x 10(9)/l, 55% had anemia and 17% had thrombocytopenia. Morphology of peripheral blood showed small-cell MCL in 15% of cases, typical MCL in 46% and blastoid MCL in 39%. Immunological markers showed a typical phenotype (CD5+ CD23 -) in 68%, and atypical phenotypes, CD5- CD23- in 17% or CD5+ CD23+ in 15%. CLL scores were 0, 1 or 2 in 96%. Median overall survival was 36 months.

The intensity of conditioning regimens is less in mini-transplant, thus the anti-tumor effect is mainly carried by an immunological reaction, called graft-versus-leukemia (GVL)/graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect. Thus, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in mini-transplant has drawn much attention as a surrogate marker for GVL/GVT effect. However, as the regimen-related toxicity is less in mini-transplant, it is also true that GVHD is the single most worrisome adverse event after mini-transplant. As opposed to early predictions, the incidence and severity of GVHD after mini-transplant does not seem to be much different from the one after conventional stem cell transplant (CST). In addition, researchers find that host antigen presenting cells (APC) may play an important role in the development of GVHD, and thus the existence of donor-host chimerism may be critical. As a result, the theory regarding GVHD after mini-transplant is getting more confusing. A comprehensive understanding of GVHD after mini-transplant is necessary.","['Mineishi, Shin', 'Schuening, Friedrich G']","['Mineishi S', 'Schuening FG']","['Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232-5505, USA. shin.mineishi@vanderbilt.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2004/09/17 05:00,2005/04/20 09:00,['2004/09/17 05:00'],"['2004/09/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/1042819042000219511 [doi]', '35TCTBDKFRLPFGTB [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Oct;45(10):1969-80. doi: 10.1080/1042819042000219511.,,,,,80,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides reduction of cellularity and fibrosis, small megakaryocytes characteristic for this disorder were replaced by large, normally appearing cells of this lineage. However, it is not known whether and to which extent these changes are accompanied by a loss of the bcr/abl translocation. Therefore an immunohistochemical (CD61) and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) study was performed on sequential BM biopsies in 5 patients with CML receiving STI571 without any pretreatment. Morphometric analysis revealed that the prevalent population of 47% micromegakaryocytes (size < or = 150 microm2) was significantly reduced (15%) during therapy and that a conspicuous shift to medium-sized and large megakaryocytes occurred. According to FISH analysis in the initial BM biopsy sections 71% of all myeloid cells exhibited the bcr/abl gene and concerning megakaryopoiesis about 65% of the prominent micromegakaryocytes displayed positive signals. After treatment this peculiar cell population decreased significantly while the emerging large megakaryocytes (52%) totally lacked a bcr/abl labeling.

Recent studies utilizing interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) suggest that prognostically significant chromosomal abnormalities occur more frequently in B-CLL/SLL than has been previously recognized. The purpose of this study was to compare the chromosomal abnormalities detected by karyotyping and FISH in cases of B-CLL/SLL, and to correlate these with clinical features and survival. Seventy-two cases were studied for chromosome 3, 12 or 18 aneuploidy, and for rearrangements involving 11q13, 11q23, 13q14, 14q32 and 17p13. The median age of the patients was 54 years (range, 30-87 years). Clinical staging of B-CLL patients showed that 70% of the patients were Rai stage 0, 1, or 2, and 30% stage 3 or 4. Karyotyping identified chromosomal abnormalities in 31% of the cases, whereas FISH studies were abnormal in 72% of cases including 64% of the cases with normal karyotypes. The most common abnormalities were deletion 13q14 (46%), trisomy 12 (21%), and 14q32 rearrangements (21%). At diagnosis, patients with trisomy 12 were more likely to have a high LDH (P = 0.04), but no other significant differences in the clinical or laboratory features, Rai stage, or survival were found among patients with normal cytogenetics vs. those with chromosomal abnormalities. Univariate analysis showed that B-symptoms (P = 0.044), anemia (P = 0.0006), absolute lymphocytosis > or = 30,000/mm3 (P = 0.029), and Rai stage 3 or 4 (P = 0.0038) at initial presentation were associated with an increased risk of death, but only Rai stage 3 or 4 (P = 0.0038) was significant in multivariate analysis.

Pathological diagnosis included non malignant conditions (n = 43), B-cell Non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (n = 30), T-cell NHL (1 case), carcinoma (n = 18), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) (n = 15), melanoma (n = 2), chronic myelocytic leukemia (n = 12), miscellaneous non-lymphoid tissues (n = 6) and undetermined conditions (n = 2). Among the 116 assessable samples, FC was in agreement with histology in 102 cases (87.9%; 95%CI = 81-93) which included 38 benign conditions (90%; 95% CI = 77-97%), 29 NHL (96.7%; 95% CI = 83-100), 18 carcinomas (100%; 95% CI = 81-100), and 12 HL (80.0%; 95% CI = 52-96). Discrepancies (14 cases) included 3 HL undiagnosed by FC and 2 granulomatous adenitis with an erroneous FC diagnosis of HL. Finally, a malignant condition was suspected only by FC in 5 cases (1 carcinoma, 2 B-cell and 2 T-cell NHL) and subsequently demonstrated by additional diagnostic procedures. In conclusion, this study confirms that FC performed on fresh lymph node samples is a powerful diagnostic tool in patients with malignant lymphoma. A few cases left undiagnosed by classical pathological analysis can be recognized by FC. Carcinoma is readily identified by FC analysis, while some benign conditions and Hodgkin lymphoma can be misdiagnosed with the use of FC, although the potential of FC to properly recognize HL is improving compared to previously reported studies. FC is a useful adjunct to pathological analysis of lymph node specimens.","['Ravoet, Christophe', 'Demartin, Sonia', 'Gerard, Raymonde', 'Dehon, Michel', 'Peny, Marie-Odile', 'Petit, Benedicte', 'Delannoy, Andre', 'Husson, Bernard']","['Ravoet C', 'Demartin S', 'Gerard R', 'Dehon M', 'Peny MO', 'Petit B', 'Delannoy A', 'Husson B']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital of Jolimont, Haine-Saint-Paul, Belgium. christophe.ravoet@skynet.be']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/diagnosis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Melanoma/diagnosis', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis']",2004/09/17 05:00,2004/12/22 09:00,['2004/09/17 05:00'],"['2004/09/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/10428190310001609906 [doi]', 'NJ5V6LKMU8J8VPC8 [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Aug;45(8):1587-93. doi: 10.1080/10428190310001609906.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the study aims to identify differences in the distribution of NHL subtypes at this LR (likely to be representative of India) as compared to the rest of the world. A panel of 5 expert hematopathologists from the NHL Classification Project reviewed 200 consecutive NHL cases at the LR in January of 2001. These cases were accrued during August and September, 2000. On all cases, hematoxylin and eosin stains and appropriate immunostains were available for review. The diagnosis made by the host pathologist at the LR (KNN) and the initial diagnosis made by each of the expert hematopathologists was compared with the consensus diagnosis. A consensus diagnosis was made by the 5 experts in 197 cases. The agreement of the host pathologist with the consensus diagnosis was 82% and the agreement of the individual experts with the consensus diagnosis varied from 76-88% (mean 82%). According to the consensus diagnosis, 80% of NHLs were of B-cell type, 18% were of T-cell type, and the immunophenotype could not be determined in the remaining 2% of cases. In conclusion, the WHO classification of NHL was properly utilized at the Lymphoma Registry, Mumbai, India, and geographic differences were noted in the distribution of NHL subtypes at the LR as compared to the rest of the world. Precursor T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma was more common in India (7%) than the rest of the world (1-4%), and indolent B-cell NHLs (29%) were less common than in the West. As compared to China and Japan, peripheral T-cell lymphoma (4.6%), extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal type (0.5%) and extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT-lymphoma) (2.6%) were less common, but follicular lymphoma (15%) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (5%) were more common.

Two distinct partners of double IGH translocation identified by FISH were as follows: c-MYC + BCL2 in 3 patients, c-MYC + BCL1 in 2, c-MYC + BCL6 in one, BCL2 + 9q22 in one, and 1q21 + 6q27 in one. Colocalization of BCL1 and c-MYC probes was demonstrated in a patient with mantle cell lymphoma. LD-PCR detected c-MYC/Cmu, c-MYC/Calpha and BCL6/Cmu, and c-MYC/Calpha fusion in each one patient. Seven of 8 patients showed high serum LDH. Central nervous system and leukemic involvement was observed in 5 and 6 patients, respectively. Median survival time of patients with c-MYC/IGH translocation was 9 months. The results defined a clinical subset of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia showing extremely poor prognosis. C-MYC/IGH translocation is possibly an evolutionary alteration following the primary IGH translocation with BCL1, BCL2, or BCL6. Furthermore, FISH identified one novel (9q22) and one cryptic chromosomal breakpoints (6q27) involved in IGH translocation.","['Kanda-Akano, Yumiko', 'Nomura, Kenichi', 'Fujita, Yasuko', 'Horiike, Shigeo', 'Nishida, Kazuhiro', 'Nagai, Masami', 'Miura, Ikuo', 'Nakamura, Shigeo', 'Seto, Masao', 'Iida, Shinsuke', 'Ueda, Ryuzo', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi']","['Kanda-Akano Y', 'Nomura K', 'Fujita Y', 'Horiike S', 'Nishida K', 'Nagai M', 'Miura I', 'Nakamura S', 'Seto M', 'Iida S', 'Ueda R', 'Taniwaki M']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Cyclin D1/genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2004/09/17 05:00,2004/12/22 09:00,['2004/09/17 05:00'],"['2004/09/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/10428190310001625674 [doi]', 'YLJW3FXC53N56P00 [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Aug;45(8):1559-67. doi: 10.1080/10428190310001625674.,,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MDS typically occur in elderly people, with a median age at diagnosis ranging between 60 and 75 years. The patients' prognosis, estimated according to the International Prognostic Scoring System, age and performance status should be considered before choosing among the various treatment options. A therapeutic dilemma exists in MDS, due to the multifactorial pathogenetic features of the disease, the heterogeneous stage and the elderly age of patients at diagnosis. This is underlined by the absence of a Food and Drug Administration-approved agent with an indication for this disease. The therapeutic end-points vary from symptom management (using low-intensity treatment with biological targeted agents, or only supportive therapy), to attempts to change the natural history of the disease (generally using high intensity treatment, including intensive chemotherapy and hemopoietic stem cell transplantation). The main goal of low-intensity therapies is generally to induce hematological improvements and is mainly used for low-risk disease. On the other hand, high-intensity therapies generally aims to alter the disease's natural history (improving survival, and decrease progression to acute myeloid leukemia), and are mainly used for high-risk disease. This review will focus on the current role of low-dose Ara-C therapy in the management of MDS. In fact, there is evidence that low-dose chemotherapy with Ara-C can induce responses in patients with MDS. In particular, the use in combinations with growth factors, such as G-CSF or M-CSF, looks promising, suggesting further investigations about this old new therapeutic tool.","['Visani, Giuseppe', 'Malagola, Michele', 'Piccaluga, Pier Paolo', 'Isidori, Alessandro']","['Visani G', 'Malagola M', 'Piccaluga PP', 'Isidori A']","['Department of Hematology, H.

Immunoblots revealed translation of several genes including caspases, cyclin D1, and the PI3-kinase dependent, survival kinase, Akt. Akt was found to be activated. Inhibition of PI3-kinase with specific inhibitor, LY294002, led to the induction of apoptosis that was caspase 8 dependent, but independent of Akt as LY294002 did not depress a high basal level of Akt activity found in CLL cells. Phosphorylation of Akt was maintained, enzymatic activity undiminished, and phosphorylation of substrates sustained. Caspases, however were activated, PARP cleaved and DNA fragmented. Caspase inhibitors revealed that initiator caspase 8 was required for classic apoptosis when PI3-kinase was inhibited, and specific activity assays demonstrated its early activation. GSK-3beta a kinase regulated via PI3-kinase dependent, down-stream kinases, was responsible for regulating cyclin D1 levels in CLL cells, but neither GSK-3beta nor calpain was responsible for induction of apoptosis, or activation of executioner caspase 3, following LY294002 treatment. PI3-kinase mediated protection against caspase activation in CLL B-cells therefore is not mediated through classic Akt survival pathways. The data further support the hypothesis that signal transducing, membrane associated receptors triggered by extrinsic factors, maintain CLL leukemic B-cell survival in vivo by preventing caspase activation.","['Plate, Janet M D']",['Plate JM'],"['Department of Medicine, Section of Medical Oncology, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612, USA. jplate@rush.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calpain/metabolism', 'Caspase 8', '*Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*physiology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2004/09/17 05:00,2004/12/22 09:00,['2004/09/17 05:00'],"['2004/09/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/10428190410001683642 [doi]', '031A05E937522HJ1 [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Aug;45(8):1519-29. doi: 10.1080/10428190410001683642.,,,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we have investigated the immunophenotypic features of 125 AML patients subdivided into three groups (IL-3R(high), IL-3R(middle) and IL-3R(low)) according to the level of IL-3Ralpha expression. AMLs over expressing the IL-3Ralpha represent a subgroup of AMLs with a peculiar immunophenotype mainly consisting in the elevated expression of CD34 and several receptor membrane tyrosine kinases, such as c-kit and flt3, and in a usually low expression of myeloid-associated antigens such as CD11b, CD14 and CD15.

The stage of the blockage defines distinct AML subtypes (AML1 to AML5 are the most frequent ones). There is increasing evidence that the malignant clone is maintained by rare AML stem cells endowed with self-renewal capacity, which through extensive proliferation coupled to partial differentiation, generate leukemic progenitors and blasts, of which the vast majority have limited proliferative capacity. Contrarily to chemotherapy alone, which is still unable to cure most AML patients, the differentiation therapy, which consists in releasing the differentiation blockage of leukemic blasts, has succeeded, when it is combined with chemotherapy, to greatly improve the survival of AML3 patients, using retinoic acid as differentiating agent. However, this molecule is ineffective in other AML subtypes, which are the most frequent. We have shown that specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs, H90 and A3D8) directed to the CD44 cell surface antigen, that is strongly expressed on human AML blasts, are capable of triggering terminal differentiation of leukemic blasts in AML1 to AML5 subtypes. These results have raised the perspective of developing a CD44-targeted differentiation therapy in most AML cases. Interestingly, these anti-CD44 mAbs can also induce the differentiation of AML cell lines, inhibit their proliferation and, in some cases, induce their apoptotic death. These results suggest that H90 and/or A3D8 mAbs may be capable to inhibit the proliferation of leukemic progenitors, to promote the differentiation of the leukemic stem cells at the expense of their self-renewal, and, perhaps, to induce their apoptotic death, thereby contributing to decrease the size of the leukemic clone. The challenges of an anti-CD44 based differentiation therapy in AML, and its importance in relation to the new other therapies developed in this malignancy, are discussed in this review.","['Gadhoum, Zeineb', 'Delaunay, Jacques', 'Maquarre, Eliane', 'Durand, Laetitia', 'Lancereaux, Valerie', 'Qi, Junyuang', 'Robert-Lezenes, Jacqueline', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Smadja-Joffe, Florence']","['Gadhoum Z', 'Delaunay J', 'Maquarre E', 'Durand L', 'Lancereaux V', 'Qi J', 'Robert-Lezenes J', 'Chomienne C', 'Smadja-Joffe F']","[""Inserm EMI 00-03, LBCH, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Centre Hayem, Hopital Saint-Louis, 1, avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75010 Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*pathology']",2004/09/17 05:00,2004/12/22 09:00,['2004/09/17 05:00'],"['2004/09/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/1042819042000206687 [doi]', 'W32E4MU59KNVL4TR [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Aug;45(8):1501-10. doi: 10.1080/1042819042000206687.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)']",,104,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Testing confirmed that the designated control gene criteria were fulfilled. Of 50 patient samples tested, four RT-PCR results were discordant with the cytogenetic result. In three cytogenetically negative cases, RT-PCR detected cryptic CBF rearrangements (one AML1-ETO and two CBFB-MYH11). The fourth case was inv(16) positive but negative by RT-PCR; however, the control gene result revealed suboptimal RNA quality. CONCLUSIONS: We have described a robust multiplex RT-PCR assay that incorporates experimentally validated control genes that are important for accurate interpretation.

However, the mechanisms by which conventional anticancer drugs affect these targets are currently unclear. The novel topoisomerase II inhibitor, salvicine, suppresses telomerase activity in leukemia HL-60 cells. To further determine whether this activity of salvicine is specific to the hematological tumor and distinct from those of other conventional anticancer agents, we studied its effects on telomere and telomerase in a solid lung carcinoma cell line, A549. Differences in telomerase inhibition and telomere erosion were observed between salvcine and other anticancer agents. All anticancer agents (except adriamycin) induced shortening of the telomere, which was identified independent of replication, but only salvicine inhibited telomerase activity in A549 cells under conditions of high concentration and short-term exposure. At the low concentration and long-term exposure mode, all the tested anticancer agents shortened the telomere and inhibited telomerase activity in the same cell line. Notably, salvicine inhibited telomerase activity more severely than the other agents examined. Moreover, the compound inhibited telomerase activity in A549 cells indirectly in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Salvicine did not affect the expression of hTERT, hTP1, and hTR mRNA in A549 cells following 4 h of exposure. Okadaic acid protected telomerase from inhibition by salvicine. These results indicate specificity of salvicine and diversity of anticancer agents in the mechanism of interference with telomerase and the telomere system. Our data should be helpful for designing the study in the development of agents acting on telomere and/or telomerase.","['Liu, Wei-Jun', 'Zhang, Yong-Wei', 'Shen, Ying', 'Jiang, Jian-Fei', 'Miao, Ze-Hong', 'Ding, Jian']","['Liu WJ', 'Zhang YW', 'Shen Y', 'Jiang JF', 'Miao ZH', 'Ding J']","['Division of Anti-tumor Pharmacology, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Naphthoquinones/*administration & dosage', 'Telomerase/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Telomere/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/09/17 05:00,2004/11/17 09:00,['2004/09/17 05:00'],"['2004/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.08.135 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(04)01902-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2004 Oct 15;323(2):660-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.08.135.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (salvicine)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",['Copyright 2004 Elsevier Inc.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its antitumor mechanism still remains unclear. METHODS: With methylene chloride fraction of Herba Scutellariae barbatae (MCSB), apoptosis-related experiments were carried out on human U937 leukemia cells by (a) 2,3-bis[2-4-nitro-5-sulphophenyl]2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) assay for cytotoxicity; (b) terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay for morphological changes; (c) cell cycle analysis; (d) Western blot analysis of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3 and Bax, Bcl-2 and cytochrome c expressions for apoptosis signaling pathway. RESULTS: MCSB inhibited the proliferation of human U937 leukemia cells in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = approximately 10 microg/ml). MCSB dose-dependently increased the sub-G1 DNA contents by cell cycle analysis. DNA fragments indicating induction of apoptosis were observed in MCSB-treated U937 cells by TUNEL assay. Caspase-9 and caspase-3 were activated while caspase-8 was intact by MCSB. Similarly, MCSB effectively cleaved PARP, increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and released the cytochrome c from mitochondria during apoptosis in U937 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that MCSB can induce apoptosis via the mitochondria-mediated signaling pathway.","['Cha, Yun-Yi', 'Lee, Eun-Ok', 'Lee, Hyo-Jeong', 'Park, Young-Doo', 'Ko, Seong-Gyu', 'Kim, Dong-Hee', 'Kim, Hyung-Min', 'Kang, In-Cheol', 'Kim, Sung-Hoon']","['Cha YY', 'Lee EO', 'Lee HJ', 'Park YD', 'Ko SG', 'Kim DH', 'Kim HM', 'Kang IC', 'Kim SH']","['Graduate School of East-West Medical Science, KyungHee University, Yoingin 449-701, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Methylene Chloride', 'Mitochondria/*physiology', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', '*Scutellaria', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solvents', 'U937 Cells']",2004/09/17 05:00,2005/06/17 09:00,['2004/09/17 05:00'],"['2004/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/27 00:00 [revised]', '2004/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.cccn.2004.04.013 [doi]', 'S0009898104002141 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 2004 Oct;348(1-2):41-8. doi: 10.1016/j.cccn.2004.04.013.,,,"['0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Solvents)', '588X2YUY0A (Methylene Chloride)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we demonstrate that human FLVCR exports cytoplasmic heme and hypothesize that human FLVCR is required on developing erythroid cells to protect them from heme toxicity. Inhibition of FLVCR in K562 cells decreases heme export, impairs their erythroid maturation and leads to apoptosis. FLVCR is upregulated on CFU-E, indicating that heme export is important in primary cells at this stage.

In the current study, the authors examined the survival experience of these children for all childhood leukemias, and for acute lymphatic leukemia (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 9th revision [ICD-9] rubric 204.0) in particular. Of 123 cases of acute lymphatic leukemia, 29 cases (16 of whom died) were in the inner ring of municipalities nearest the towers, and 94 cases (34 of whom died) occurred in the outer, more-distant ring. There was a significant difference in survival rates between the 2 groups (log-rank test, p = 0.03; Wilcoxon, p = 0.05). The 5-yr survival in the inner ring of municipalities was 55%, and in the outer ring was 71% (i.e., subjects in the inner ring were 23% less likely to survive than those in the outer ring); at 10 yr, survival in the inner and outer rings was 33% and 62%, respectively. Following adjustment, the mortality rate ratio that the authors used to compare the inner ring with the outer ring was 2.1 (95% confidence interval = 1.1, 4.0).

These cells were maintained in an undifferentiated stage in growth media supplemented with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and were capable of differentiating into triploblastic tissues under various growth factors. It has been known that normal sized embryoid bodies (EBs) are formed by removing LIF. In this study, large EBs gradually formed along the side wall of a culture dish, particularly at the boundary between the air and the growth medium when cells were cultured for a considerable period of time and without subculturing. We call this method the ""wall adhesion culture"" procedure. The method itself is simple and do not need any instruments except plastic dishes because only the side walls of the dishes were utilized. The mean thickness of the large EBs was about 1.5 mm 3 months after establishing the static culture. Their surface was covered with a monolayer of cells and they contained an eosinophilic cell matrix. By electron microscopy, some characteristic structures was observed, such as intracisternal A particles which were present inside the swelling of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Since many tissues derived from ES cells are obtained through EBs, it is expected that efficient acquisition of sufficient quantities of these structures using the wall adhesion culture procedure will be a shortcut for using ES cells in regenerative medicine.","['Yamamoto, Motoyoshi', 'Hashimoto, Hisashi', 'Tachibana, Toshiaki', 'Ohi, Satoshi', 'Akahori, Masakazu', 'Yokose, Takashi', 'Ishiwata, Isamu', 'Ishikawa, Hiroshi']","['Yamamoto M', 'Hashimoto H', 'Tachibana T', 'Ohi S', 'Akahori M', 'Yokose T', 'Ishiwata I', 'Ishikawa H']","['Dept of Anatomy, The Jikei University School of Medicine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Hum Cell,Human cell,8912329,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'Cytological Techniques/*methods', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology', 'Genes, Intracisternal A-Particle', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/ultrastructure']",2004/09/17 05:00,2004/10/28 09:00,['2004/09/17 05:00'],"['2004/09/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-0774.2004.tb00020.x [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Cell. 2004 Mar;17(1):49-57. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-0774.2004.tb00020.x.,,,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, co-treatment of an inhibitor of the NF-kappa B pathway with antitumor agents is a useful strategy for chemotherapy. Here we report that ent-11 alpha-hydroxy-16-kauren-15-one (KD) selectively inhibits NF-kappa B-dependent gene expression due to treatment with TNF-alpha. KD in combination with TNF-alpha caused a dramatic increase in apoptosis in human leukemia cells accompanied by activation of caspases. A broad-spectrum inhibitor of caspases decreased the apoptosis induced by treatment with KD and TNF-alpha. KD in combination with CPT also caused an increase in apoptosis. These results suggest that the apoptotic potency of co-treatment of KD with TNF-alpha or CPT is elicited through selective inhibition of NF-kappa B-dependent anti-apoptotic proteins and thus may provide a basis for the development of useful approaches to the treatment of leukemia.","['Suzuki, Ikue', 'Kondoh, Masuo', 'Harada, Motoki', 'Koizumi, Naoya', 'Fujii, Makiko', 'Nagashima, Fumihiro', 'Asakawa, Yoshinori', 'Watanabe, Yoshiteru']","['Suzuki I', 'Kondoh M', 'Harada M', 'Koizumi N', 'Fujii M', 'Nagashima F', 'Asakawa Y', 'Watanabe Y']","['Department of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics, Showa Pharmaceutical University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Planta Med,Planta medica,0066751,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Diterpenes, Kaurane/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', '*Hepatophyta', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",2004/09/17 05:00,2004/10/16 09:00,['2004/09/17 05:00'],"['2004/09/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/17 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2004-827202 [doi]'],ppublish,Planta Med. 2004 Aug;70(8):723-7. doi: 10.1055/s-2004-827202.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diterpenes, Kaurane)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was previously shown that glioma cells are efficiently killed when they express a gene coding for a hyperfusogenic mutant of the gibbon ape leukemia virus envelope glycoprotein (GALV.fus). However, production of viral vectors expressing GALV.fus has proven problematic because the transgene is toxic to vector-producing cells of human origin. We reasoned that Sindbis-virus-based vectors might be ideal for GALV.fus gene transfer because high-titer stocks can easily be generated in hamster cells and Sindbis virus efficiently infects human tumor cells through the high-affinity 67 kDa laminin receptor. In addition, Sindbis virus nonstructural proteins are potent inducers of apoptosis, and Sindbis vector RNAs expressing fusogenic viral proteins have been shown to spread from cell-to-cell in membrane-formed infectious particles. METHODS: Sindbis virus replicon-containing particles were generated by co-transfecting vector and helper RNAs into baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells. Packaged beta-galactosidase and GALV.fus expressing Sindbis vectors were used to infect glioma cell lines, which were then compared for syncytial cytopathic effect, cell killing, and release of infectious virus-like particles containing the vector genome. Finally, the efficacy of GALV.fus and beta-galactosidase Sindbis vectors was compared in an orthotopic intracerebral U87 glioma xenograft model in nude mice. RESULTS: High-titer stocks (>10(9) infectious units (iu)/ml) of the GALV.fus and beta-galactosidase vectors were obtained. Glioma cells infected with the GALV.fus vector formed large syncytia which died rapidly by apoptosis and released infectious membrane-formed particles that could transfer vector genomes to uninfected cells. The GALV.fus vector had significantly greater antitumor therapeutic potency than the beta-galactosidase vector in the U87 glioma xenograft model. CONCLUSIONS: Sindbis vectors expressing GALV.fus can be packaged into infectious viral particles to high titer, they exhibit potent bystander cytopathic potential and are active against U87 glioma xenografts. Sindbis-virus-based replicons appear to be efficient vector systems for delivery and expression of fusogenic membrane glycoproteins.","['Zhang, Jie', 'Frolov, Ilya', 'Russell, Stephen J']","['Zhang J', 'Frolov I', 'Russell SJ']","['Mayo Clinic, Molecular Medicine Program, 200 First Street, SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Brain Neoplasms/therapy', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Fragmentation', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Glioma/*therapy', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Lac Operon', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Sindbis Virus/*genetics', 'Time Factors', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",2004/09/16 05:00,2005/03/03 09:00,['2004/09/16 05:00'],"['2004/09/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.605 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2004 Oct;6(10):1082-91. doi: 10.1002/jgm.605.,['R01 CA83181/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a small subset of patients does not respond to front-line therapy or suffers from an early relapse. PROCEDURE: A retrospective analysis was performed to assess the incidence, treatment, and outcome of all children with relapsed or progressed NHL and B-ALL diagnosed in Austria between 1986 and 2003 (n = 22/234). RESULTS: Nine of 140 (6.5%) patients with B-cell NHL/B-ALL (relapse, n = 6; progress, n = 3) failed initial treatment. Four of them underwent a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as second-line therapy, two patients received intensive chemotherapy alone and in three patients treatment was palliative. Eight of the nine patients died of their disease. Four of 65 (6%) patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) (relapse, n = 2; progress, n = 2) had a treatment failure.

OBJECTIVE: We compare the CCC and pediatric WHO systems against each other and against the French, American, British (FAB) and adult WHO classifications in order to determine which more accurately classifies these diseases and predicts outcome. METHODS: An 18-year retrospective review identified patients less than 18 years of age meeting CCC and/or pediatric WHO criteria for the diagnosis of MDS or MPD. Resolution, stability, progression, and death in the subcategories of each system were compared. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were included in the study. Pediatric WHO: 17 patients met criteria, 10 died. Eight developed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (seven died), one juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) (died), one chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (currently in relapse), two died of complications, two responded to BMT, three have stable disease, one resolved. Eleven patients were not classifiable by the pediatric WHO system, one of which progressed to AML and died. CCC: 26 patients met criteria, 9 died. Nine developed AML (8 died), 1 died of complications, 10 responded to treatment (BMT and/or chemotherapy). Four are stable without treatment, two resolved. Two patients with MPD were not classifiable by the CCC system. CONCLUSIONS: Both the pediatric WHO and CCC systems are better able to classify MDS in children than the adult WHO and FAB classifications. The pediatric WHO system is more exclusive. Children meeting these criteria are more likely to progress to AML or death. The restrictive nature of the pediatric WHO system was unable to classify one case of fatal MDS. The CCC system is more inclusive and can stratify patients into a neutral or poor prognosis based upon outcome. However, the CCC system ignores those diseases with a myeloprolifferative component. This resulted in two cases of MPD that were unclassifiable by the CCC system. One of these patients died, the other is currently in relapse.","['Occhipinti, Elise', 'Correa, Hernan', 'Yu, Lolie', 'Craver, Randall']","['Occhipinti E', 'Correa H', 'Yu L', 'Craver R']","['Department of Pathology, Louisiana State University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/mortality', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification/diagnosis/mortality', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*classification/diagnosis/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",2004/09/16 05:00,2005/03/18 09:00,['2004/09/16 05:00'],"['2004/09/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20174 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Mar;44(3):240-4. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20174.,,,,"['(c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We reviewed the records of patients with de novo AML, excluding M3 and Down syndrome, treated at our institution between 1991 and 2002 to determine the prevalence of severe SIRS with grade 3/4 pulmonary complications and to identify AML subtypes associated with severe SIRS. To examine the role of cell lysis, we compared leukocyte reduction in AML subtypes affected by severe SIRS with that in unaffected subtypes. RESULTS: Of 155 patients, 5 (3 with M4eo and 2 with M5) experienced severe pulmonary complications attributed to tumor lysis, met the criteria for severe SIRS, and showed no clear evidence of infection. Four required pressor support for severe hypotension. Severe SIRS was significantly more common in myelomonocytic or monocytic AML (M4/M4eo/M5) than in other subtypes (P = 0.010) and significantly more common in M4eo than in M4/M5 (P = 0.008). Among 112 cases for which information was available, leukocyte reduction was significantly greater in patients with M4/M4eo/M5 than among others during the first 4 days of chemotherapy (P = 0.015).

PROCEDURE: We compared the prevalence of favorable and unfavorable clinical and biologic features, toxicity and outcome within the ALL-DS and ALL-NDS cohorts of 2,174 eligible patients with SR-ALL enrolled on CCG-1952. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients (3%) had ALL-DS. DS patients were less likely to have either favorable (hyperdiploidy, triple trisomy of chromosomes 4, 10, and 17, TEL-AML1 rearrangement) or unfavorable (T-cell ALL, hypodiploidy, adverse translocations) biologic features. Toxicity occurred significantly more often and number of days hospitalized was significantly greater in ALL-DS than in ALL-NDS. ALL-DS patients had an inferior 4-year EFS compared to the NDS cohort. However, EFS was equivalent when the comparison excluded ALL-NDS with favorable biologic features. OS was significantly inferior for ALL-DS. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of favorable biologic features within ALL-DS contributes to the difference in EFS previously observed between DS and NDS SR-ALL cohorts.","['Bassal, Mylene', 'La, Mei K', 'Whitlock, James A', 'Sather, Harland N', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Gaynon, Paul S', 'Stork, Linda C']","['Bassal M', 'La MK', 'Whitlock JA', 'Sather HN', 'Heerema NA', 'Gaynon PS', 'Stork LC']","['Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/BMT, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, Colorado, USA. bassal.mylene@tchden.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Ploidies', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/09/16 05:00,2005/01/05 09:00,['2004/09/16 05:00'],"['2004/09/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20193 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Jan;44(1):21-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20193.,,,,"['(c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is evidence that HTLV-1 and its protein Tax also induce apoptosis. To resolve this apparent paradox, apoptosis was monitored in primary cultures of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from healthy donors, following HTLV-1 infection in vitro. High levels of apoptosis in HTLV-1 infected cultures during the first weeks after infection were detected. Apoptosis was not related to the presence of uninfected cells, as revealed by a fluorescence in situ hybridization assay. Successively, a progressive decrease in apoptosis in infected cultures going towards immortalization, was observed. When IL-2 in the medium was replaced by IL-4, allowing the cells to be efficiently infected by HTLV-1 but not immortalized, apoptosis levels tended to increase, instead of decreasing, with the ongoing time. The caspase cascade was remarkably activated in PBLs recently infected in vitro by HTLV-1, but apoptosis was only partly reduced by caspase inhibitors. Even if spontaneous apoptosis was relatively low in long-term cultures of PBLs immortalized by HTLV-1 in vitro, Fas death-receptor expression and function were well conserved. These observations provide a new rationale for explaining the dual effect of HTLV-1 in controlling apoptosis.","['Matteucci, Claudia', 'Balestrieri, Emanuela', 'Macchi, Beatrice', 'Mastino, Antonio']","['Matteucci C', 'Balestrieri E', 'Macchi B', 'Mastino A']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Science, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/pathology/virology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Genome, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lymphocytes/pathology/virology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",2004/09/16 05:00,2004/11/05 09:00,['2004/09/16 05:00'],"['2004/09/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jmv.20201 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Virol. 2004 Nov;74(3):473-83. doi: 10.1002/jmv.20201.,,,"['0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A similar rate of viability upon the exposure to these two drugs up to 24 h has been evidenced, followed by the occurrence of a rescue process against TRAIL, not performed against Etoposide, along with an higher number of dead cells upon Etoposide exposure, in comparison with TRAIL treatment. These preliminary results let us to speculate on the possible involvement of PI-3-kinase in TRAIL resistance disclosed by surviving cells (20%), may be phosphorylating Akt-1 and, in parallel, IkappaB alpha on both serine and tyrosine residues. On the other hand, in Etoposide Jurkat exposed cells Ser 32-36 phosphorylation of IkappaB alpha is not sufficient to overbalance the apoptotic fate of the cells, since Bax increase, IAP decrease, and caspase-3 activation determine the persistence of the apoptotic state along with the occurrence of cell death by necrosis. Thus, the existence of a balance between apoptotic and rescue response in 20% of cells surviving to TRAIL suggests the possibility of pushing it in favor of cell death in order to improve the yield of pharmacological strategies.","['Sabatini, N', 'Di Pietro, R', 'Rapino, M', 'Sancilio, S', 'Comani, S', 'Cataldi, A']","['Sabatini N', 'Di Pietro R', 'Rapino M', 'Sancilio S', 'Comani S', 'Cataldi A']","[""Dipartimento di Biomorfologia, Universita G.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which LAA initiates cellular signaling leading to cell death are still unclear. In an effort to gain insight into these mechanisms, the effects of LAA on eukaryotic transcription nuclear factor NF-kappaB and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression were investigated. In the present study, LAA suppressed DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB, composed of a p65/p50 heterodimer, through inhibition of degradation of inhibitory kappaB-alpha (IkappaB-alpha) and prevention of nuclear translocation of p65. The inhibitory effect of LAA on NF-kappaB activity was dependent upon glutathione levels in HL-60 cells, as well as generation of H2O2 but not superoxide anion. LAA also downregulated the expression of COX-2, which has a NF-kappaB binding site on its promoter, through repressing NF-kappaB DNA binding activity. Moreover, cotreatment of 1 microM arsenic trioxide (As2O3) with various concentrations of LAA enhanced an LAA-induced repression of NF-kappaB activity and COX-2 expression. In conclusion, our data suggest that LAA exerts its anti-tumor activity through downregulation of NF-kappaB activity and COX-2 expression, and these inhibitory effects can be enhanced by co-treatment with As2O3.","['Han, Seong-Su', 'Kim, Kihyun', 'Hahm, Eun-Ryeong', 'Lee, Sook J', 'Surh, Young-Joon', 'Park, Hye K', 'Kim, Won S', 'Jung, Chul W', 'Lee, Mark H', 'Park, Keunchil', 'Yang, Jung-Hyun', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo', 'Riordan, Neil H', 'Riordan, Hugh D', 'Kimler, Bruce F', 'Park, Chan H', 'Lee, Je-Ho', 'Park, Seyeon']","['Han SS', 'Kim K', 'Hahm ER', 'Lee SJ', 'Surh YJ', 'Park HK', 'Kim WS', 'Jung CW', 'Lee MH', 'Park K', 'Yang JH', 'Yoon SS', 'Riordan NH', 'Riordan HD', 'Kimler BF', 'Park CH', 'Lee JH', 'Park S']","['Samsung Medical Center, and Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul 135-710, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Ascorbic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/*metabolism', 'Protein Subunits/genetics/metabolism', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tosylphenylalanyl Chloromethyl Ketone/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor RelA']",2004/09/16 05:00,2005/01/07 09:00,['2004/09/16 05:00'],"['2004/09/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.20116 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2004 Oct 1;93(2):257-70. doi: 10.1002/jcb.20116.,,,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '402-71-1 (Tosylphenylalanyl Chloromethyl Ketone)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']","['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is biphasic by microscopy, containing myoblastic and primitive neuroectodermal components. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of the radiographic and pathologic characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of six children with MMB who were treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (Memphis, TN) between 1984 and 2003. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) data were available for four children. A literature review also was conducted and focused on imaging and pathologic findings. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 4.5 years (range, 0.83-7.5 years). Radiographically, all tumors were cerebellar and exhibited variable enhancement, and 50% of tumors had necrotic foci. Three tumors contained discrete, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2-weighted-hypointense/computed tomography (CT)-hyperdense enhancing regions and separate hyperintense/hypodense nonenhancing regions, which correlated microscopically with geographic islands of primitive neuroectodermal and rhabdomyoblastic cells. Large cell/anaplastic (five tumors), nodular/desmoplastic (two tumors), and classic (two tumors) medulloblastoma histologies were encountered either alone (five tumors) or in combination with each other (two tumors). All 4 tumors that were tested exhibited alterations in chromosome 17 or c-myc amplification. All patients underwent macroscopic total resection and subsequently received chemotherapy and craniospinal (five patients) or local conformal (one patient) radiotherapy. At a median follow-up of 92 months (range, 23-187 months), 3 patients remain alive with no evidence of disease, 2 patients have died of disease, and 1 patient has died of secondary acute lymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrated the frequent correlation of biphasic nodularity (as determined by MRI or CT) with discrete rhabdomyoblastic and primitive neuroectodermal islands (as revealed by microscopy) in MMB. These results also support the view that MMB and medulloblastoma may have common tumorigenic origins, given their similar histologic and molecular features.","['Helton, Kathleen J', 'Fouladi, Maryam', 'Boop, Frederick A', 'Perry, Arie', 'Dalton, James', 'Kun, Larry', 'Fuller, Christine']","['Helton KJ', 'Fouladi M', 'Boop FA', 'Perry A', 'Dalton J', 'Kun L', 'Fuller C']","[""Department of Radiological Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA. kathleen.helton@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Cerebellar Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/genetics/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Female', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Infant', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Medulloblastoma/*diagnostic imaging/genetics/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2004/09/16 05:00,2004/09/29 05:00,['2004/09/16 05:00'],"['2004/09/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [medline]', '2004/09/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.20450 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2004 Sep 15;101(6):1445-54. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20450.,,,,['Copyright 2004 American Cancer Society.'],45,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: To characterize the features of t(6;11) AML, the authors searched the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) cytogenetic database comprising 2667 adults with newly diagnosed, de novo AML and identified 16 patients (0.6%) with t(6;11). A review of the literature identified 33 adults with de novo t(6;11) AML for whom survival data were available. RESULTS: CALGB patients had a median age of 45 years (range, 22-65 years) and commonly presented with French-American-British (FAB) subtype M4 or M5 (81%). Gingival involvement at presentation was common (31%). All patients with gingival involvement had FAB M4. Compared with other patients with M4 AML in the CALGB database (n = 429), patients with M4 and t(6;11) (n = 7) had a higher frequency of gingival hypertrophy at presentation (71% vs. 17%, P = 0.003). Patients with t(6;11) were more likely to be African American (P = 0.02) and to die during induction (P = 0.03) than those without t(6;11). The complete response (CR) rate was 69% (11 of 16 patients), and CR duration was short (median, 9 months). The estimated probability of 2-year survival was 13%. Both long-term survivors received allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The estimated probability of 2-year survival of patients reported in the literature was 15%. CONCLUSIONS: Although the patient sample was small, the authors suggested that investigational approaches, including allogeneic transplantation, be considered for adults with t(6;11) AML.","['Blum, William', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Rao, Kathleen W', 'Pettenati, Mark J', 'Anastasi, John', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Blum W', 'Mrozek K', 'Ruppert AS', 'Carroll AJ', 'Rao KW', 'Pettenati MJ', 'Anastasi J', 'Larson RA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus 43210, USA. blum-1@medctr.osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/09/16 05:00,2004/09/29 05:00,['2004/09/16 05:00'],"['2004/09/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [medline]', '2004/09/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.20489 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2004 Sep 15;101(6):1420-7. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20489.,"['CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47555/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['Copyright 2004 American Cancer Society.'],38,,,,,['Cancer. 2005 Mar 15;103(6):1316; author reply 1316-7.

New chemotherapeutic agents and drug combinations were employed in refractory patients to overcome drug resistance. METHODS: The current study evaluated the efficacy of a regimen comprising intravenous bolus injections of idarubicin, 12 mg/m2 daily x 3, and a continuous 7-day infusion of cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), 100 mg/m2 daily, in adults with refractory or recurrent ALL. Twenty patients aged 14-75 years were treated. RESULTS: Six patients (30%) achieved complete remission (CR), 5 (25%) had a partial response (PR), and 9 (45%) did not respond. Recovery of blood counts occurred at a median of 20 days. One patient who achieved CR and one who achieved PR survived 1.5 and 2 years, respectively, after receiving this treatment. The median response and overall survival periods were 2.75 and 6.3 months, respectively. There was no relation between remission duration and previous chemotherapy. Neither leukocyte count at study entry nor patient karyotype was associated with attainment of CR. All patients experienced profound myelosuppression. Gastrointestinal toxicity was mild to moderate, with the exception of one case of World Health Organization Grade 3 mucositis.

METHODS: ds/siRNAs were transfected into bcr-abl-positive K-562 cells (derived from blast-crisis) or bcr-abl-negative/c-abl-positive Jurkat cells (derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemia) using lipofectamine. ds/siRNAs intracellular uptake was detected by fluorescent confocal microscopy using fluorescein-labeled ds/siRNAs. The treatment was performed over 6 days with repetitive siRNA transfections. Efficiency of the siRNAs was determined 24 hours after single siRNA transfection and 6 days after repetitive siRNA transfections. RESULTS: Two of the designed ds/siRNAs decreased the target mRNA levels markedly (determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis) and bcr-abl/c-abl oncoproteins (determined by flow cytometry using Fluor-488-labeled, anti-c-abl antibody as well as by Western blot analysis). These sequences also inhibited protein tyrosine kinase activity significantly and suppressed cell proliferation. One of the three selected ds/siRNAs expressed only slight effects on the bcr-abl/c-abl mRNA in K-562 cells (but not on the oncoprotein level), on protein tyrosine kinase activity, and on cell proliferation. The combination of the three ds/siRNA constructs provoked stronger decreases in bcr-abl/c-abl mRNAs and their respective oncoproteins and produced the strongest suppression of cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: The cross-talk between siRNA interference of bcr-abl oncogene and the expression of several apoptotic/antiapoptotic factors, cell proliferation factors, and other oncogenes exists and it was determined by microarray analysis in K-562 cells that were treated over 6 days.","['Ohba, Hideki', 'Zhelev, Zhivko', 'Bakalova, Rumiana', 'Ewis, Ashraf', 'Omori, Toshiro', 'Ishikawa, Mitsuru', 'Shinohara, Yasuo', 'Baba, Yoshinobu']","['Ohba H', 'Zhelev Z', 'Bakalova R', 'Ewis A', 'Omori T', 'Ishikawa M', 'Shinohara Y', 'Baba Y']","['Single-Molecule Bioanalysis Laboratory, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', '*Oncogenes', 'Protein Array Analysis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection']",2004/09/16 05:00,2004/09/29 05:00,['2004/09/16 05:00'],"['2004/09/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/29 05:00 [medline]', '2004/09/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.20468 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2004 Sep 15;101(6):1390-403. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20468.,,,"['0 (RNA, Double-Stranded)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",['Copyright 2004 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hepatocytes respond to IL-6 with the synthesis and secretion of acute-phase proteins. In addition, IL-6 plays a role as a migration factor in vivo. In the present paper, we studied the potential of IL-6 to mediate migration of human primary T cells and T cell-derived cell lines. IL-6 was found to induce migration only in the presence of extracellular matrix, suggesting a cross-talk between the IL-6- and integrin signal transduction pathways. Furthermore, an IL-6 gradient is required for chemotactic migration. This activity is not due to the release of secondary chemotactic activities, but is a direct response to IL-6. T cell migration could also be observed in response to IL-11, but no migration was found after stimulation with leukemia inhibitory factor or oncostatin M, although these cytokines signal through gp130-containing receptor complexes. Finally, we present evidence that activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase as well as the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway is crucial for IL-6-induced migration. Selective activation of the JAK/STAT or the MAPK cascade by mutated receptor proteins shows a crucial role of IL-6-initiated SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2/MAPK activity for migration.","['Weissenbach, Manuela', 'Clahsen, Thomas', 'Weber, Christian', 'Spitzer, Dirk', 'Wirth, Dagmar', 'Vestweber, Dietmar', 'Heinrich, Peter C', 'Schaper, Fred']","['Weissenbach M', 'Clahsen T', 'Weber C', 'Spitzer D', 'Wirth D', 'Vestweber D', 'Heinrich PC', 'Schaper F']","['Department of Biochemistry, RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/*immunology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Extracellular Matrix/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Integrins/immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-11/immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/*immunology/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism']",2004/09/16 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/16 05:00'],"['2004/09/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.200425237 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2004 Oct;34(10):2895-906. doi: 10.1002/eji.200425237.,,,"['0 (Integrins)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the role of IL-5 in antibody-mediated autoimmune disease, we generated systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-prone (NZB x NZW)F1 mice congenic for IL-5 transgene (TG-F1). The transgene unexpectedly reduced the incidence of lupus nephritis. Anti-DNA antibodies in sera and those produced by splenic B cells in vitro were markedly decreased in TG-F1 mice, while total polyclonal Ig levels were comparable to those in IL-5 transgene-negative (NZB x NZW)F1 (non-TG-F1) littermates. Flow cytometry-sorted splenic B1 cells showed a significant reduction of anti-DNA antibody synthesis in response to IL-5, while proliferative responses to IL-5 did not significantly differ between TG-F1 and non-TG-F1 mice. As TG-F1 mice aged, frequencies of peripheral B1 cells progressively increased, and the mice frequently developed B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Our results suggest that dysregulated, continuous high expression of IL-5 in SLE-prone mice may directly or indirectly mediate a skewed signaling of proliferation/differentiation of self-antigen-activated B1 cells, leading to suppression of autoimmune disease, but instead to aberrant expansion of B1 cells, giving rise to B-CLL.

CASE SUMMARY: An 18-year-old woman diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia was admitted for a bone marrow transplant. She had already attained remission with daunorubicin, thioguanine, and high-dose cytarabine. A routine lumbar puncture performed on admission revealed an abnormally elevated leukocyte count, and meningitis was suspected. The patient had been taking TMP/SMX (trimethoprim 120 mg) twice daily on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday for the past 3 months; no other medication was being used. Upon examination, the patient mentioned having had headaches for the past few weeks. Since viral, bacterial, and fungal cultures were negative, a diagnosis of aseptic meningitis was made. According to the Naranjo probability scale, TMP/SMX was a possible cause of the aseptic meningitis. Eleven days after discontinuation of TMP/SMX, lumbar puncture results had returned to normal. DISCUSSION: Many drugs have been associated with aseptic meningitis. Antibiotics are often linked with aseptic meningitis, with TMP/SMX being the most frequently associated antibiotic. Many cases of TMP/SMX-induced aseptic meningitis have been reported, while few cases have been reported with trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole given separately. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the widespread use of TMP/SMX and the years of experience we have had with the drug, it is important to remain vigilant regarding possible adverse effects, particularly aseptic meningitis.","['Therrien, Roxane']",['Therrien R'],"['Pharmacy Department, Centre Universitaire Mere-Enfant Ste-Justine, 3175 Cote Ste-Catherine, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1C5, Canada. therrien.hsj@ssss.gouv.qc.ca']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Infective Agents/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Meningitis, Aseptic/*chemically induced', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination/*adverse effects']",2004/09/16 05:00,2005/02/03 09:00,['2004/09/16 05:00'],"['2004/09/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1345/aph.1D581 [doi]', 'aph.1D581 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2004 Nov;38(11):1863-7. doi: 10.1345/aph.1D581.

In this study, we evaluated the possible interaction of gefitinib, a selective epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with BCRP. BCRP-transduced human epidermoid carcinoma A431 (A431/BCRP) cells acquired cellular resistance to gefitinib, suggesting that BCRP could be one of the determinants of gefitinib sensitivity in a certain sort of cells. Next, the effect of gefitinib on BCRP-mediated drug resistance was examined. Gefitinib reversed SN-38 resistance in BCRP-transduced human myelogenous leukemia K562 (K562/BCRP) or BCRP-transduced murine lymphocytic leukemia P388 (P388/BCRP) cells but not in these parental cells. In addition, gefitinib sensitized human colon cancer HT-29 cells, which endogenously express BCRP, to SN-38. Gefitinib increased intracellular accumulation of topotecan in K562/BCRP cells and suppressed ATP-dependent transport of estrone 3-sulfate, a substrate of BCRP, in membrane vesicles from K562/BCRP cells. These results suggest that gefitinib may overcome BCRP-mediated drug resistance by inhibiting the pump function of BCRP. Furthermore, P388/BCRP-transplanted mice treated with combination of irinotecan and gefitinib survived significantly longer than those treated with irinotecan alone or gefitinib alone. In conclusion, gefitinib is shown to interact with BCRP. BCRP expression in a certain sort of cells is supposed to be one of the determinants of gefitinib sensitivity. Gefitinib inhibits the transporter function of BCRP and reverses BCRP-mediated drug resistance both in vitro and in vivo.","['Yanase, Kae', 'Tsukahara, Satomi', 'Asada, Sakiyo', 'Ishikawa, Etsuko', 'Imai, Yasuo', 'Sugimoto, Yoshikazu']","['Yanase K', 'Tsukahara S', 'Asada S', 'Ishikawa E', 'Imai Y', 'Sugimoto Y']","['Division of Molecular Biotherapy, Cancer Chemotherapy Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, 1-37-1 Kami-Ikebukuro, Toshima-ku, Tokyo 170-8455, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Estrone/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Gefitinib', 'Humans', 'Irinotecan', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'Topotecan/metabolism']",2004/09/16 05:00,2005/02/11 09:00,['2004/09/16 05:00'],"['2004/09/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['3/9/1119 [pii]'],ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2004 Sep;3(9):1119-25.,,,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '2DI9HA706A (Estrone)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'QTL48N278K (estrone sulfate)', 'S65743JHBS (Gefitinib)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The synthetic analogues were designed to help improve the efficacy and aqueous solubility of the parent compound; therefore, many in this series contained ionizable functional groups such as an amino group, a hydroxy group, or a carboxylic acid. Although several of these analogues showed improvements in potency over cryptophycin 52 in drug-sensitive tumor xenograft models, many lost their activity against Adriamycin-resistant tumor lines.

Eight genes have been cloned, with the accompanying protein products participating in at least two complexes, which appear to be functionally dependent upon one another. Previous studies have described chromatin localization of the FA core complex, except at mitosis, which is associated with phosphorylation of the FANCG protein (F. Qiao, A. Moss, and G. M. Kupfer, J. Biol. Chem. 276:23391-23396, 2001). The phosphorylation of FANCG at serine 7 by using mass spectrometry was previously mapped. The purpose of this study was to map the phosphorylation sites of FANCG at mitosis and to assess their functional importance. Reasoning that a potential kinase might be cdc2, which was previously reported to bind to FANCC, we showed that cdc2 chiefly phosphorylated a 14-kDa fragment of the C-terminal half of FANCG. Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that this fragment contains amino acids 374 to 504. Kinase motif analysis demonstrated that three amino acids in this fragment were leading candidates for phosphorylation. By using PCR-directed in vitro mutagenesis we mutated S383, S387, and T487 to alanine. Mutation of S383 and S387 abolished the phosphorylation of FANCG at mitosis. These results were confirmed by use of phosphospecific antibodies directed against phosphoserine 383 and phosphoserine 387.

The coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infects cells expressing the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Here we show that codon optimization of the SARS-CoV S-protein gene substantially enhanced S-protein expression. We also found that two retroviruses, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and murine leukemia virus, both expressing green fluorescent protein and pseudotyped with SARS-CoV S protein or S-protein variants, efficiently infected HEK293T cells stably expressing ACE2. Infection mediated by an S-protein variant whose cytoplasmic domain had been truncated and altered to include a fragment of the cytoplasmic tail of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope glycoprotein was, in both cases, substantially more efficient than that mediated by wild-type S protein. Using S-protein-pseudotyped SIV, we found that the enzymatic activity of ACE2 made no contribution to S-protein-mediated infection. Finally, we show that a soluble and catalytically inactive form of ACE2 potently blocked infection by S-protein-pseudotyped retrovirus and by SARS-CoV.

The L domain of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) has been shown to interact with a ubiquitin (Ub) ligase, and budding of this virus is dependent on Ub. RSV is similar to other retroviruses in that it contains approximately 100 molecules of Ub, but it is unique in that none of these molecules has been found to be conjugated to Gag. If transient ubiquitination of RSV Gag is required for budding, then replacement of the target lysine(s) with arginine should prevent the addition of Ub and reduce budding. Based on known sites of ubiquitination in other viruses, the important lysines would likely reside near the L domain. In RSV, there are five lysines located just upstream of the L domain in a region of the matrix (MA) protein that is dispensable for membrane binding, and replacement of these with arginine (mutant 1-5KR) reduced budding 80 to 90%. The block to budding was found to be on the plasma membrane; however, the few virions that were released had normal size, morphology, and infectivity. Budding was restored when any one of the residues was changed back to lysine or when lysines were inserted in novel positions, either within this region of MA or within the downstream p10 sequence. Moreover, the 1-5KR mutant could be rescued into particles by coexpression of budding-competent Gag molecules. These data argue that the phenotype of mutant 1-5KR is not due to a conformational defect. Consistent with the idea that efficient budding requires a specific role for lysines, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, which does not bud well compared to RSV and lacks lysines close to its L domain, was found to be released at a higher level upon introduction of lysines near its L domain. This report strongly supports the hypothesis that ubiquitination of the RSV Gag protein (and perhaps those of other retroviruses) is needed for efficient budding.","['Spidel, Jared L', 'Craven, Rebecca C', 'Wilson, Carol B', 'Patnaik, Akash', 'Wang, Huating', 'Mansky, Louis M', 'Wills, John W']","['Spidel JL', 'Craven RC', 'Wilson CB', 'Patnaik A', 'Wang H', 'Mansky LM', 'Wills JW']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, 500 University Dr., P.O.

All EAV-HP elements identified to date in the chicken genome show large deletions, including that of the entire pol gene. Here we report the identification of four segregating chicken EAV-HP proviruses with complete pol genes, one of which shows exceptionally high sequence identity and a close phylogenetic relationship with ALV-J with respect to the env gene. Embryonic expression of EAV-HP env has been suggested as a factor associated with immunological tolerance induction in a proportion of ALV-J-infected meat-type chickens. In support of this, env gene transcripts expressed from two of the four newly identified EAV-HP proviruses were demonstrated in chicken embryos. However, when ALV-J-infected outbred meat-type chickens were assessed, the presence of intact EAV-HP proviruses failed to directly correlate with ALV-J tolerance. This association was further examined using F(2) progeny of two inbred lines of layer chicken that differed in EAV-HP status and immunological responses to ALV-J. Immunological tolerance developed in a small proportion of F(2) progeny birds, reflecting the expected phenotypic ratio for inheritance of a double-recessive genotype; however, the status of tolerance did not show any direct correlation with the presence of the intact EAV-HP sequence. Nevertheless, identification of an intact chicken EAV-HP locus showing a uniquely close relationship to the ALV-J prototype clone HPRS-103 in the env region provides the strongest evidence of its contribution to the emergence of ALV-J by recombination.","['Sacco, Melanie A', 'Howes, Ken', 'Smith, Lorraine P', 'Nair, Venugopal K']","['Sacco MA', 'Howes K', 'Smith LP', 'Nair VK']","['Institute for Animal Health, Compton, Newbury, Berkshire, United Kingdom. mas289@cornell.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/immunology/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/classification/*genetics/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens/*virology', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*genetics/immunology', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, env', 'Genes, pol', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Viral/analysis/isolation & purification', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",2004/09/16 05:00,2004/10/22 09:00,['2004/09/16 05:00'],"['2004/09/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1128/JVI.78.19.10525-10535.2004 [doi]', '78/19/10525 [pii]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Oct;78(19):10525-35. doi: 10.1128/JVI.78.19.10525-10535.2004.,,,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,PMC516401,,,,,"['GENBANK/AJ623289', 'GENBANK/AJ623290', 'GENBANK/AJ623291', 'GENBANK/AJ623292']",,,,,,

HTLV-2, although highly related to HTLV-1 at the molecular level, has not been conclusively linked to development of lymphoproliferative disorders. Differences between the biological activities of the respective tax gene products (Tax1 and Tax2) may be one factor which accounts for the differential pathogenicities associated with infection. To develop an in vitro model to investigate and compare the effects of constitutive expression of Tax1 and Tax2, Jurkat T-cell lines were infected with lentivirus vectors encoding Tax1 and Tax2 in conjunction with green fluorescent protein, and stably transduced clonal cell lines were generated by serial dilution in the absence of drug selection. Jurkat cells that constitutively express Tax1 and Tax2 (Tax1/Jurkat and Tax2/Jurkat, respectively) showed notably reduced kinetics of cellular replication, and Tax1 inhibited cellular replication to a higher degree in comparison to Tax2. Tax1 markedly activated transcription from the cdk inhibitor p21(cip1/waf1) promoter in comparison to Tax2, suggesting that upregulation of p21(cip1/waf1) may account for the differential inhibition of cellular replication kinetics displayed by Tax1/Jurkat and Tax2/Jurkat cells. The presence of binucleated and multinucleated cells, reminiscent of large lymphocytes with cleaved or cerebriform nuclei often seen in HTLV-1- and -2-seropositive patients, was noted in cultures expressing Tax1 and Tax2. Although Tax1 and Tax2 expression mediated elevated resistance to apoptosis in Jurkat cells after serum deprivation, Tax1 was unique in protection from apoptosis after exposure to camptothecin and etoposide, inhibitors of topoisomerase I and II, respectively. Characterization of the unique phenotypes displayed by Tax1 and Tax2 in vitro will provide information as to the relative roles of these oncoproteins and their contribution to HTLV-1 and -2 pathogenesis in vivo.","['Sieburg, Michelle', 'Tripp, Adam', 'Ma, Jung-Woo', 'Feuer, Gerold']","['Sieburg M', 'Tripp A', 'Ma JW', 'Feuer G']","['SUNY Upstate Medical University, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, 750 East Adams St., Syracuse, NY 13210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Annexins/analysis', '*Apoptosis', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Cell Count', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Giant Cells/cytology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Propidium/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Up-Regulation']",2004/09/16 05:00,2004/10/22 09:00,['2004/09/16 05:00'],"['2004/09/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1128/JVI.78.19.10399-10409.2004 [doi]', '78/19/10399 [pii]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Oct;78(19):10399-409. doi: 10.1128/JVI.78.19.10399-10409.2004.,"['R01 RR014324/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '1R29 CA77567/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 RR14324/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,"['0 (Annexins)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,PMC516438,,,,,,,,,,,

However, although HTLV-1-infected T cells were found in inflamed lesions, the antigenic specificity of coinfiltrated CD8(+) T cells remains to be determined. In this study, we performed both ex vivo and in situ analyses using muscle biopsies obtained from an HTLV-1-infected patient with HAM/TSP and sporadic inclusion body myositis. We found that both HTLV-1-infected CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells directed to the dominant Tax antigen can be amplified from muscle cell cultures. Moreover, we were able to detect in two successive muscle biopsies both tax mRNA-positive mononuclear cells and T cells recognized by the Tax11-19/HLA-A*02 tetramer and positive for perforin.

Consequently, the Bcl-2 protein is an attractive target for drug design, and Bcl-2-specific antisense oligonucleotides or small-molecule Bcl-2 inhibitors have shown broad anticancer activities in preclinical models and are currently in several clinical trials. The clinical application of immunotherapy against cancer is rapidly moving forward in multiple areas, including the adoptive transfer of anti-tumor-reactive T cells and the use of ""therapeutic"" vaccines. The overexpression of Bcl-2 in cancer and the fact that immune escape by down-regulation or loss of expression of this protein would impair sustained tumor growth makes Bcl-2 a very attractive target for anticancer immunotherapy. Herein, we describe spontaneous T-cell reactivity against Bcl-2 in peripheral blood from patients suffering from unrelated tumor types (ie, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, acute myeloid leukemia [AML], and chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL]). Additionally, we show that these Bcl-2-reactive T cells are indeed peptide-specific, cytotoxic effector cells.

The level of expression of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene has been associated with disease aggressiveness in human cancers. The purpose of the present study was to examine the prognostic significance of hTERT expression in B-CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used real-time reverse transcription-PCR to quantitate the amount of hTERT transcripts in mononuclear blood cells from 90 B-CLL patients. In addition, samples were analyzed for somatic mutations in the immunoglobulin V (IgV) genes. RESULTS: The expression of hTERT gene was detected in 59% of patients. The level of expression increased with advancing B-CLL stage (P=0.0064). Patients expressing hTERT showed significantly shorter survival than hTERT-negative patients (P=0.000034), irrespective of the disease stage. On average, the level hTERT mRNA expression was seven-fold higher in the poor-prognosis B-CLL group with unmutated IgV than in the Ig-mutated group (P<10(-7)). The level of hTERT expression discriminated the Ig-unmutated from Ig-mutated B-CLL in 89% of cases. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that hTERT expression in B-CLL may serve as a molecular prognostic marker.","['Tchirkov, A', 'Chaleteix, C', 'Magnac, C', 'Vasconcelos, Y', 'Davi, F', 'Michel, A', 'Kwiatkowski, F', 'Tournilhac, O', 'Dighiero, G', 'Travade, P']","['Tchirkov A', 'Chaleteix C', 'Magnac C', 'Vasconcelos Y', 'Davi F', 'Michel A', 'Kwiatkowski F', 'Tournilhac O', 'Dighiero G', 'Travade P']","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, CHU, Clermont-Ferrand. andrei.tchirkov@cjp.fr""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Catalytic Domain', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Telomerase/*biosynthesis']",2004/09/16 05:00,2005/01/15 09:00,['2004/09/16 05:00'],"['2004/09/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/15 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/annonc/mdh389 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)51044-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2004 Oct;15(10):1476-80. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdh389.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the end of follow up 54% of the patients were alive, 27% had died due to relapse while 19% had died of other causes. Survival was similar in recipients of related (55%) and unrelated grafts (48%). Risk factors identified in univariate analysis were brought into a multivariable analysis. However, an unrelated donor was not identified as a risk factor for any of the five end-points analysed. A donor positive for three to four herpes viruses increased the risk of acute GVHD, TRM and death. A female to male transplant increased the risk of TRM, particularly if combined with a mismatch. Early stage of disease as well as human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matching independently predicted survival. The risk of relapse increased after 1992. Chronic GVHD independently decreased the risk of relapse (relative risk RR, 0.39) and death (RR 0.42).

Whole-body MR and conventional staging procedures, including CT (n=10), gallium-67 scintigraphy (n=9), bone scintigraphy (n=3) and bone marrow biopsy (n=7) were retrospectively compared for detection of sites involved by lymphoma and for the assigned stage.

MR was more sensitive than conventional imaging in detecting bone marrow involvement at initial staging. Following treatment, however, residual and therapy-induced bone marrow signal abnormalities could not be differentiated from lymphomatous involvement. Detection of nodal and visceral involvement correlated well.

IgH-R can be identified by DNA melting curve analysis within 40 minutes after DNA preparation and amplification. To test the clinical utility of this new IgH-R assay for rapidly diagnosing cutaneous B-cell lymphomas, we prospectively analyzed 44 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues suspected of B-cell malignant lymphoma: skin (n = 31), lymph node (n = 7), stomach (n = 3), spleen (n = 1), colon (n = 1), and soft tissue (n = 1). We detected IgH-R in 12 DNA samples, including 8 skin biopsies, with the following diagnoses: B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 4), extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (n = 4), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 2), Burkitt lymphoma (n = 1), and precursor B-lymphoblastic lymphoma (n = 1). DNA melting curve analysis, compared with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, achieved a sensitivity equal to 92.3% and a specificity equal to 100%. There was a single false negative result because DNA melting curve analysis could not detect less than 10.0% clonal B-cells. We conclude that this new, rapid PCR assay for detecting IgH-R based on DNA melting curve analysis can be clinically useful for confirming the initial diagnosis of B-cell malignant lymphoma.","['Xu, Dongsheng', 'Du, Juan', 'Kamino, Hideko', 'Ratech, Howard']","['Xu D', 'Du J', 'Kamino H', 'Ratech H']","['Department of Pathology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York 10467, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Dermatopathol,The American Journal of dermatopathology,7911005,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA/analysis', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'False Negative Reactions', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics', '*Transition Temperature']",2004/09/15 05:00,2005/01/14 09:00,['2004/09/15 05:00'],"['2004/09/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/14 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['00000372-200410000-00007 [pii]', '10.1097/00000372-200410000-00007 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Dermatopathol. 2004 Oct;26(5):385-9. doi: 10.1097/00000372-200410000-00007.,,,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report the outcome of a phase I clinical study of WT1 peptide-based immunotherapy for patients with breast or lung cancer, myelodysplastic syndrome, or acute myeloid leukemia. Patients were intradermally injected with an HLA-A*2402-restricted, natural, or modified 9-mer WT1 peptide emulsified with Montanide ISA51 adjuvant at 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg per body at 2-week intervals, with toxicity and clinical and immunological responses as the principal endpoints. Twenty-six patients received one or more WT1 vaccinations, and 18 of the 26 patients completed WT1 vaccination protocol with three or more injections of WT1 peptides. Toxicity consisted only of local erythema at the WT1 vaccine injection sites in patients with breast or lung cancer or acute myeloid leukemia with adequate normal hematopoiesis, whereas severe leukocytopenia occurred in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome with abnormal hematopoiesis derived from WT1-expressing, transformed hematopoietic stem cells. Twelve of the 20 patients for whom the efficacy of WT1 vaccination could be assessed showed clinical responses such as reduction in leukemic blast cells or tumor sizes and/or tumor markers. A clear correlation was observed between an increase in the frequencies of WT1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes after WT1 vaccination and clinical responses. It was therefore demonstrated that WT1 vaccination could induce WT1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and result in cancer regression without damage to normal tissues.","['Oka, Yoshihiro', 'Tsuboi, Akihiro', 'Taguchi, Tetsuya', 'Osaki, Tadashi', 'Kyo, Taiichi', 'Nakajima, Hiroko', 'Elisseeva, Olga A', 'Oji, Yusuke', 'Kawakami, Manabu', 'Ikegame, Kazuhiro', 'Hosen, Naoki', 'Yoshihara, Satoshi', 'Wu, Fei', 'Fujiki, Fumihiro', 'Murakami, Masaki', 'Masuda, Tomoki', 'Nishida, Sumiyuki', 'Shirakata, Toshiaki', 'Nakatsuka, Shin-Ichi', 'Sasaki, Ayako', 'Udaka, Keiko', 'Dohy, Hiroo', 'Aozasa, Katsuyuki', 'Noguchi, Shinzaburo', 'Kawase, Ichiro', 'Sugiyama, Haruo']","['Oka Y', 'Tsuboi A', 'Taguchi T', 'Osaki T', 'Kyo T', 'Nakajima H', 'Elisseeva OA', 'Oji Y', 'Kawakami M', 'Ikegame K', 'Hosen N', 'Yoshihara S', 'Wu F', 'Fujiki F', 'Murakami M', 'Masuda T', 'Nishida S', 'Shirakata T', 'Nakatsuka S', 'Sasaki A', 'Udaka K', 'Dohy H', 'Aozasa K', 'Noguchi S', 'Kawase I', 'Sugiyama H']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita City, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/immunology/pathology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/immunology', 'Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Kidney Neoplasms/immunology', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/immunology', 'Radiography', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'WT1 Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Wilms Tumor/immunology']",2004/09/15 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/15 05:00'],"['2004/09/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0405884101 [doi]', '0405884101 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Sep 21;101(38):13885-90. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0405884101.

We expressed perforin in rat basophil leukemia cells to define the basis of perforin dysfunction associated with two mutations, R225W and G429E, inherited by a compound heterozygote patient. Whereas RBL cells expressing wild-type perforin (67 kD) efficiently killed Jurkat target cells to which they were conjugated, the substitution to tryptophan at position 225 resulted in expression of a truncated ( approximately 45 kD) form of the protein, complete loss of cytotoxicity, and failure to traffic to rat basophil leukemia secretory granules. By contrast, G429E perforin was correctly processed, stored, and released, but the rat basophil leukemia cells possessed reduced cytotoxicity. The defective function of G429E perforin mapped downstream of exocytosis and was due to its reduced ability to bind lipid membranes in a calcium-dependent manner. This study elucidates the cellular basis for perforin dysfunctions in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and provides the means for studying structure-function relationships for lymphocyte perforin.","['Voskoboinik, Ilia', 'Thia, Marie-Claude', 'De Bono, Annette', 'Browne, Kylie', 'Cretney, Erika', 'Jackson, Jacob T', 'Darcy, Phillip K', 'Jane, Stephen M', 'Smyth, Mark J', 'Trapani, Joseph A']","['Voskoboinik I', 'Thia MC', 'De Bono A', 'Browne K', 'Cretney E', 'Jackson JT', 'Darcy PK', 'Jane SM', 'Smyth MJ', 'Trapani JA']","[""Cancer Immunology Program, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Locked Bag 1, A'Beckett St., 8006, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'Histiocytosis, Non-Langerhans-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/chemistry/*genetics/physiology', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Rats', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",2004/09/15 05:00,2004/10/22 09:00,['2004/09/15 05:00'],"['2004/09/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1084/jem.20040776 [doi]', 'jem.20040776 [pii]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2004 Sep 20;200(6):811-6. doi: 10.1084/jem.20040776.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 219 children who received autologous HSCT for AML in first complete remission (CR) and 73 children in second CR and who were reported to the Autologous Blood and Marrow Transplant Registry. Among 29 of 73 patients who underwent transplantation in second CR, duration of first CR was > or = 12 months. RESULTS: Three-year cumulative incidences of relapse were 37% (95% CI, 31% to 44%), 60% (95% CI, 41% to 74%), and 36% (95% CI, 20% to 53%) for children in first CR, second CR after a short (< 12 months) first CR, and second CR after a long (> or = 12 months) first CR, respectively. Corresponding 3-year probabilities of leukemia-free survival were 54% (95% CI, 47% to 60%), 23% (95% CI, 10% to 39%), and 60% (95% CI, 42% to 75%). In multivariate analyses, risks of relapse, mortality, and treatment failure (relapse or death, inverse of leukemia-free survival) were higher for patients in second CR after a short first CR than for the other two groups. Transplant-related mortality, treatment failure, and overall mortality rates were higher in older (> 10 years) children. CONCLUSION: Duration of first CR seems to be the most important determinant of outcome. Results in children who experience treatment failure with conventional chemotherapy support the use of autologous transplantation as salvage therapy if such patients achieve a subsequent CR.","['Godder, Kamar', 'Eapen, Mary', 'Laver, Joseph H', 'Zhang, Mei-Jie', 'Camitta, Bruce M', 'Wayne, Alan S', 'Gale, Robert Peter', 'Doyle, John J', 'Yu, Lolie C', 'Chen, Allen R', 'Garvin, James H Jr', 'Sandler, Eric S', 'Yeager, Andrew M', 'Edwards, John R', 'Horowitz, Mary M']","['Godder K', 'Eapen M', 'Laver JH', 'Zhang MJ', 'Camitta BM', 'Wayne AS', 'Gale RP', 'Doyle JJ', 'Yu LC', 'Chen AR', 'Garvin JH Jr', 'Sandler ES', 'Yeager AM', 'Edwards JR', 'Horowitz MM']","['Autologous Blood and Marrow Transplant Registry, Health Policy Institute, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/09/15 05:00,2004/10/08 09:00,['2004/09/15 05:00'],"['2004/09/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2004.12.142 [doi]', '22/18/3798 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2004 Sep 15;22(18):3798-804. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2004.12.142.,['U24-CA76518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For patients with proven infection the sensitivity values of PCR in lung and blood samples were 100 and 40%, respectively. The negative predictive value of blood monitoring under conditions of antifungal treatment was 44%. Clearance of fungal DNA from blood was associated with resolution of clinical symptoms in six of nine patients with proven infection. Repeated positive PCR results for Aspergillus were associated with fatal outcome, as three of six patients died. For patients with probable infection the sensitivity values of PCR in lung fluid and blood were 66 and 44%, respectively. The benefit of PCR diagnosis using whole-blood samples is limited when sampling takes place after treatment has been started. Performance of Aspergillus PCR using tissue samples is recommended in addition to microscopic examination and culture technique for sensitive detection of fungal infection.","['Lass-Florl, Cornelia', 'Gunsilius, Eberhard', 'Gastl, Gunther', 'Bonatti, Hugo', 'Freund, Martin C', 'Gschwendtner, Andreas', 'Kropshofer, Gabriele', 'Dierich, Manfred P', 'Petzer, Andreas']","['Lass-Florl C', 'Gunsilius E', 'Gastl G', 'Bonatti H', 'Freund MC', 'Gschwendtner A', 'Kropshofer G', 'Dierich MP', 'Petzer A']","['Department of Hygiene and Social Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.

We found that RA-, but not DMSO- or untreated-HL60 cells, can phagocytose OpaI-expressing gonococci as well as Escherichia coli. The interaction of OpaI E. coli with RA-treated HL60 cells was inhibited by antibodies against CEACAM1. Phagocytosis of OpaI E. coli was found to be a result of the expression of CEACAM1 in RA-treated HL60 cells. Our results indicate that the level of expression of CEACAM1 in HL60 cells can be regulated by treatment with RA in a differentiation-dependent manner, and that this is important for phagocytosis of OpaI-expressing gonococci or E. coli.","['Pantelic, Milica', 'Chen, Ines', 'Parker, James', 'Zhang, Pei', 'Grunert, Fritz', 'Chen, Tie']","['Pantelic M', 'Chen I', 'Parker J', 'Zhang P', 'Grunert F', 'Chen T']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Division of Infectious Diseases, Walther Oncology Center, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol,FEMS immunology and medical microbiology,9315554,IM,"['Antigens, Bacterial/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Escherichia coli/immunology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Neisseria gonorrhoeae/*immunology', 'Neutrophils/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', '*Phagocytosis', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2004/09/15 05:00,2004/12/24 09:00,['2004/09/15 05:00'],"['2004/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2004/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.femsim.2004.05.010 [doi]', 'S0928824404001142 [pii]']",ppublish,FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol. 2004 Oct 1;42(2):261-6. doi: 10.1016/j.femsim.2004.05.010.,['AI 47736/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,"['0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CD66 antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (opacity proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXEGESIS: We report four cases of acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency in association with lymphoproliferative disorders. Three of them were asymptomatic; one was associated with abdominal pain. Four women (median age, 66 years) presented either two non-Hodgkin lymphoma or two chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. C1 inhibitor deficiency was detected fortuitous (n = 1) or during investigation of arthralgia (n = 2), or Gougerot-Sjogren syndrome (n = 1). The deficit was acquired in all cases type I. Auto-immune disorders were associated with: Gougerot-Sjogren syndrome (n = 1), cryoglobulinemia (n = 2), IgM lambda monoclonal gammopathy (n = 1), Coombs positive test (n = 2), IgG anti-cardiolipine antibodies (n = 1). C1 inhibitor deficiency was not modified after lymphoproliferative disorders treatment (radiotherapy, splenic ablation) in two cases but patients were not in complete remission. C1 inhibitor raised normal level in one case, after five chemotherapy regimens, but decreased complement level and C4 split persist. CONCLUSION: Acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency associated with lymphoproliferative disorders is sometimes asymptomatic. Diagnosis could be delay in spite of clinical manifestations. Deficit correction is not constant after lymphoproliferative disorders treatment.","['Bibi-Triki, T', 'Eclache, V', 'Frilay, Y', 'Stirnemann, J', 'Fremeaux-Bacchi, V', 'Fain, O']","['Bibi-Triki T', 'Eclache V', 'Frilay Y', 'Stirnemann J', 'Fremeaux-Bacchi V', 'Fain O']","[""Laboratoire d'hematologie, hopital Jean-Verdier (AP-HP), avenue du 14-juillet, 93143, universite Paris-Nord UPRES 3409, Bondy cedex, France.""]",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Rev Med Interne,La Revue de medecine interne,8101383,IM,"['Aged', 'Angioedema/immunology', 'Antibodies, Anticardiolipin/immunology', 'Complement C1 Inactivator Proteins/*deficiency', 'Cryoglobulinemia/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*immunology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', ""Sjogren's Syndrome/immunology""]",2004/09/15 05:00,2004/11/16 09:00,['2004/09/15 05:00'],"['2004/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.revmed.2004.06.003 [doi]', 'S0248-8663(04)00224-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Rev Med Interne. 2004 Sep;25(9):667-72. doi: 10.1016/j.revmed.2004.06.003.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Anticardiolipin)', '0 (Complement C1 Inactivator Proteins)']",,,,,Deficit acquis en C1 inhibiteur associe a un syndrome lymphoproliferatif: quatre observations.,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis involves events mediated by cysteine proteases (caspases) that are classified as initiators (-8, -9 and -12) or executors (-2, -3, -6 and -7). In this study, we examined the mechanisms of apoptosis induced by dehydrocrotonin (DHC), a diterpene lactone isolated from the Amazonian plant Croton cajucara, and its synthetic derivative, dimethylamide-crotonin (DCR), in human HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. Flow cytometric analysis of HL60 cells after treatment for 72 h showed that DCR- and DHC-induced apoptosis, with maximum cell death at a concentration of 250 microM for both compounds. DCR and DHC were effective in triggering the activation of caspases-2, -6 and -9. The level of reduced glutathione (GSH) decreased, whereas there was an increase in thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) production and in mitochondrial swelling. These effects on mitochondrial swelling, GSH content and lipid peroxidation were abolished by cyclosporine A, an inhibitor of the membrane permeability transition. The cytotoxicity of DHC and DCR was prevented by a high concentration of GSH (15 mM) in the culture medium. These results indicate that DCR and DHC produced apoptosis partly by oxidative stress-induced lipid peroxidation, which triggered the caspase cascade, that lead to apoptotic cell death in HL60 cells. Based on the pattern of caspase activation, on the increase in mitochondrial swelling and on the inhibitory action of cyclosporine A, we conclude that DCR and DHC triggered apoptosis in HL60 cells probably through cytochrome c release and apoptosome formation.","['Anazetti, Maristella C', 'Melo, Patricia S', 'Duran, Nelson', 'Haun, Marcela']","['Anazetti MC', 'Melo PS', 'Duran N', 'Haun M']","['Departamento de Bioquimica, Instituto de Biologia, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, CP 6109, SP, 13083-970, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Toxicology,Toxicology,0361055,IM,"['Annexin A5', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 2', 'Caspase 6', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Diterpenes, Clerodane/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Lipid Peroxidation/*drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Permeability/drug effects', 'Plant Bark/chemistry', 'Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances/metabolism']",2004/09/15 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/09/15 05:00'],"['2003/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2004/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2004/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.tox.2004.06.003 [doi]', 'S0300483X04003282 [pii]']",ppublish,Toxicology. 2004 Oct 15;203(1-3):123-37. doi: 10.1016/j.tox.2004.06.003.,,,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Diterpenes, Clerodane)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances)', '0 (dehydrocrotonin)', '0 (dimethylamide-crotonin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 6)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it still remains unclear whether the same approach might be suitable for the treatment of other B-cell malignancies.

The feasibility of employing idiotype vaccines was evaluated for five different B-cell malignancies in their first relapse, both in terms of induction and fusion, as well as overall treatment. Our data suggest that, unlike follicular lymphoma (87%), this approach is not feasible to treat other B-cell malignancies (0-20%) such as mantle cell, small lymphocytic, diffuse large cell and Burkitt's lymphoma (P < 0.01). The main difficulties encountered were technical problems related to the survival of idiotype-producing hybridomas (83%) and the early loss of idiotype production by growing hybridomas (17%).

Each mutation tends to weaken the forces that maintain the activation-loop folded inwards. None of the mutations are found to particularly stabilize the active state directly.

This study was to investigate the variations and intra-localization of active Caspase-3, determine cell morphology changes in apoptotic MOLT-4 cells induced by X-ray, and evaluate their relationship. METHODS: MOLT-4 cells were irradiated by 10 Gy X-ray. Sub G(1)peak method, and DNA fragmentation assay were used to detect variations of DNA in apoptotic cells. Annexin V/PI method was used to determine the cell membrane reversion, and fluorescence labeled inhibitor of Caspases (FLICA) was used to detect the active Caspase-3 in apoptotic cells. Cell morphology and Caspase-3 intra-localization were determined by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: MOLT-4 cells irradiated by 10 Gy X-ray presented classical apoptotic morphology changes such as membrane reversion, and apoptotic body. Caspase-3 was activated after irradiation, and increased remarkably after irradiated for 4 hours. Activated Caspase-3 moved from sub-membrane toward cytoplasm and nucleus.

DC was confirmed by morphology, immune phenotype and capacity of stimulating MLR (mixed lymphocyte reaction). CTL were generated through the co-culture of autologous T lymphocytes and DC. (51)Cr-release assays were performed for the measurement of cytotoxicity of CTL. The results showed that distribution of the subgroups of T lymphocytes in CBMNC was similar to that in adult peripheral blood. The percentage of CD1a-expressing cells in CBMNC was very low, merely (0.41 +/- 0.09)%. During culture, DC became larger and more irregular in shape. Spiny dendrites or multiple cell processes in morphology emerged on the surface of DC. Among the cell populations at 15 days of culture, there were (28.4 +/- 3.55)% of CD1a-expressing cells, (63.67 +/- 23.33)% of CD86-positive, (8.7 +/- 1.49)% of CD83-positive and (32.5 +/- 1.53)% of HLA-DR-positive cells. DC derived from CBMNC is capable of stimulating the proliferation of allogeneic lymphocytes in MLR. CTL derived from autologous T lymphocytes induced by dendritic cells pulsed with lysates of HL-60 cells, possessed specific cytolytic effects against HL-60 cells. In conclusions, relatively high percentage of CD1a-expressing cells can be generated in culture system of this study.

The results showed that persistent full donor chimerism (DC >/= 95%) was associated with an absence of MRD. All patients with stable MC (90% </= DC < 95%) and bcr/abl negative had a probability of long-term survival with molecular remission, however the result of bcr/abl positivity was not always associated with leukemia relapse, only the patient with decreasing values of donor chimerism as well as bcr/abl positive proved to be in a higher risk of relapse or graft failure. Decrease of donor chimerism in correlation with MRD positive was detected in 5 patients. Three out of five patients had been proved to have a molecular relapse, one out of five patients had developed to cytogenetic relapse and another patient experienced graft failure.

CXCR4 expressions were not significantly different between the premature stages of CD10(-)/CD34(+) and CD10(+)/CD34(+) subtypes, but both were lower than the CXCR4 expression in CD10(+)/CD34(-) and CD10(-)/CD34(-) subtypes. The highest incidence of CXCR4 expression was found in CD10(-)/CD34(-) B-ALL. The average level of CXCR4 expression on B-ALL cell with positive myeloid antigen CD13 or/and CD33 (my(+)B-ALL) was (12.56 +/- 3.88)% of positive rate and 39.82 +/- 11.58 of MFI, both of which were less than the positive rate (37.57 +/- 11.59)% and the MFI (50.72 +/- 13.34) on B-ALL cells with negative myeloid antigen expression (mye(-)B-ALL). In conclusion, the CXCR4 expression is associated with differentiation level of B-ALL cells and down-regulated when co-expressed with myeloid antigens.","['Liu, Zheng-Rong', 'Sun, Hui', 'Zhang, Qiu-Tang']","['Liu ZR', 'Sun H', 'Zhang QT']","['Department of Hemotology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China. aylzr@TOM.COM']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*analysis']",2004/09/15 05:00,2005/01/27 09:00,['2004/09/15 05:00'],"['2004/09/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2004)04-0441-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2004 Aug;12(4):441-4.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SHIP is predominately expressed in hematopoietic cells, and is a crucial negative regulator in the development of hematopoietic cells. To evaluate the role of the SHIP gene in human leukemogenesis, expression and mutation of SHIP gene in bone marrow and/or peripheral blood from 32 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 9 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), as well as human hematopoietic cell lines were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and sequencing. The RT-PCR showed that all samples expressed SHIP gene. Mutations of SHIP gene were detected in 7 out of 32 AML patients (22%) and one out of 9 ALL patients (12%). Interestingly, two missense mutations that had been observed in one AML patient at diagnosis disappeared after complete remission (CR). In addition, Akt phosphorylation was prolonged and increased following IL-3 stimulation in this patient sample. In conclusion, data of this study demonstrate the mutation of the SHIP gene in acute leukemia for the first time and suggest a possible role of the mutation of this gene in the development of acute leukemia. SHIP serves as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in hematopoietic cells.","['Luo, Jian-Min', 'Liu, Ze-Lin', 'Hao, Hong-Ling', 'Wang, Fu-Xu', 'Dong, Zuo-Ren', 'Ohno, Ryuzo']","['Luo JM', 'Liu ZL', 'Hao HL', 'Wang FX', 'Dong ZR', 'Ohno R']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050000, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*genetics/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/physiology']",2004/09/15 05:00,2005/01/27 09:00,['2004/09/15 05:00'],"['2004/09/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2004)04-0420-07 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2004 Aug;12(4):420-6.,,,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (INPPL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODOLOGY: Retrospective analysis of the stored serum, sputum, and necropsy lung tissue samples from this patient, enabled subspecies identification by means of panfungal polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct DNA sequencing of the PCR products, and homology search with nucleotide basic local alignment search tool. RESULTS: The development of a reliable diagnostic blood test for angio-invasive fungal infections such as mucormycosis is desirable, because the sensitivity of culture for these fungi is extremely low. CONCLUSION: Panfungal PCR on serial serum samples might be useful for the diagnosis of pulmonary mucormycosis.","['Kobayashi, Makoto', 'Togitani, Kazuto', 'Machida, Hisanori', 'Uemura, Yoshiki', 'Ohtsuki, Yuji', 'Taguchi, Hirokuni']","['Kobayashi M', 'Togitani K', 'Machida H', 'Uemura Y', 'Ohtsuki Y', 'Taguchi H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Nankoku, Kochi, Japan. kmakoto@kochi-ms.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Australia,Respirology,"Respirology (Carlton, Vic.)",9616368,IM,"['*Cunninghamella', 'DNA, Fungal/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/complications/*diagnosis', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mucormycosis/complications/*diagnosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sequence Alignment']",2004/09/15 05:00,2005/02/03 09:00,['2004/09/15 05:00'],"['2004/09/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1440-1843.2004.00582.x [doi]', 'RES582 [pii]']",ppublish,Respirology. 2004 Aug;9(3):397-401. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1843.2004.00582.x.,,,"['0 (DNA, Fungal)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In patients with multiple myeloma (MM), DLIs can induce response rates of 40-52%. DLIs were employed as treatment for MM relapse or as prophylaxis for relapse in MM patients undergoing allo-HSCT. The clinically most relevant treatment-related morbidity with DLIs is the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Secondly, graft failure and the immune escape of extramedullary plasmocytoma have been reported. The fact that previous clinical reports have documented graft-versus-myeloma (GVM) activity without GVHD suggests that at least two distinct immunocompetent cell populations mediating GVHD and/or GVM may exist. Further characterization of the effector cells such as T cells and/or NK cells and their targets may help to clarify the immune response that mediates the GVM effect. This review considers the results of clinical approaches with DLI for MM, with emphasis on strategies to prevent GVHD while preserving the GVM effect. Furthermore, currently investigated molecular antigenic targets for the GVM effect such as MM-specific idiotypic determinant of immunoglobulin variable regions, several PRAME epitopes and antigenic structures encoded by cancer germline-specific genes as candidates for immunotherapy trials are discussed.","['Zeiser, R', 'Bertz, H', 'Spyridonidis, A', 'Houet, L', 'Finke, J']","['Zeiser R', 'Bertz H', 'Spyridonidis A', 'Houet L', 'Finke J']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Albert Ludwigs University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality/trends', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion/trends', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*therapy']",2004/09/14 05:00,2005/04/07 09:00,['2004/09/14 05:00'],"['2004/09/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/07 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bmt.1704670 [doi]', '1704670 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2004 Dec;34(11):923-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1704670.,,,,,49,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe the extrachromosomal (episomal) amplification of ABL1 in 5 of 90 (5.6%) individuals with T-ALL, an aberration that is not detectable by conventional cytogenetics. Molecular analyses delineated the amplicon as a 500-kb region from chromosome band 9q34, containing the oncogenes ABL1 and NUP214 (refs. 5,6). We identified a previously undescribed mechanism for activation of tyrosine kinases in cancer: the formation of episomes resulting in a fusion between NUP214 and ABL1. We detected the NUP214-ABL1 transcript in five individuals with the ABL1 amplification, in 5 of 85 (5.8%) additional individuals with T-ALL and in 3 of 22 T-ALL cell lines. The constitutively phosphorylated tyrosine kinase NUP214-ABL1 is sensitive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. The recurrent cryptic NUP214-ABL1 rearrangement is associated with increased HOX expression and deletion of CDKN2A, consistent with a multistep pathogenesis of T-ALL. NUP214-ABL1 expression defines a new subgroup of individuals with T-ALL who could benefit from treatment with imatinib.","['Graux, C', 'Cools, J', 'Melotte, C', 'Quentmeier, H', 'Ferrando, A', 'Levine, R', 'Vermeesch, J R', 'Stul, M', 'Dutta, B', 'Boeckx, N', 'Bosly, A', 'Heimann, P', 'Uyttebroeck, A', 'Mentens, N', 'Somers, R', 'MacLeod, R A F', 'Drexler, H G', 'Look, A T', 'Gilliland, D G', 'Michaux, L', 'Vandenberghe, P', 'Wlodarska, I', 'Marynen, Peter', 'Hagemeijer, Anne']","['Graux C', 'Cools J', 'Melotte C', 'Quentmeier H', 'Ferrando A', 'Levine R', 'Vermeesch JR', 'Stul M', 'Dutta B', 'Boeckx N', 'Bosly A', 'Heimann P', 'Uyttebroeck A', 'Mentens N', 'Somers R', 'MacLeod RA', 'Drexler HG', 'Look AT', 'Gilliland DG', 'Michaux L', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Wlodarska I', 'Marynen P', 'Hagemeijer A']","['Department of Human Genetics, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Gene Amplification', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Plasmids/*genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use']",2004/09/14 05:00,2004/11/04 09:00,['2004/09/14 05:00'],"['2004/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/09/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/04 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/ng1425 [doi]', 'ng1425 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Genet. 2004 Oct;36(10):1084-9. doi: 10.1038/ng1425.

We used a tetracycline-inducible system in Jurkat T leukemia cells to study the biological role of KLF2 in cellular growth and differentiation. Our results show that expression of KLF2 inhibits cell growth in autonomously proliferating Jurkat cells. Further, 3H-thymidine uptake assays indicate that KLF2 inhibits DNA synthesis in these cells. Moreover, both activation and inhibitory domains are required for KLF2 to suppress Jurkat cell proliferation. In addition, KLF2 upregulates p21WAF1/CIP1 expression. Additionally, we found that KLF2 upregulates p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity in Jurkat, HepG2 and SW480 cells. Our analysis shows that the potential KLF2 responsive elements are located between -124 and -60 of the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter. The sole CACCC site, a sequence recognized by KLF2, in this region is not the element responsive to KLF2. Finally, we determined that the Sp1-3-binding site is the functional responsive element of KLF2 in the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter, and we conclude that KLF2 directly regulates p21WAF1/CIP1 expression.","['Wu, Jinghai', 'Lingrel, Jerry B']","['Wu J', 'Lingrel JB']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Cincinnati, College of Medicine, 231 Albert Sabin Way, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Sp3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2004/09/14 05:00,2004/11/17 09:00,['2004/09/14 05:00'],"['2004/09/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1207996 [doi]', '1207996 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Oct 21;23(49):8088-96. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207996.,['R01 HL 57281/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KLF2 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '148710-94-5 (Sp3 Transcription Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients with surgically staged, locally advanced, nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were treated with intravenous gemcitabine administered twice weekly (40 mg/m2/d) for 5 wk concurrent with upper abdominal radiation (50.4 Gy in 180 cGy daily fractions over 5.5 wk). At the completion of the chemoradiation, patients without disease progression were given gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) weekly for five cycles. Each cycle consisted of 3 wk of treatment followed by 1 wk without treatment. Disease progression and response were assessed at 6- to 8-wk intervals. RESULTS: From February through December 1999, 43 patients were entered into this phase II trial, 39 of whom were evaluable for treatment response. The median age was 59 yr (range: 39-84 yr); there were 18 males (47%) in the study. Grade III and IV hematologic toxicity occurred in 48 and 21% of patients, respectively, and was primarily leukocytopenia and neutropenia. Grade III and IV gastrointestinal toxicities occurred in 31 and 10% of patients, respectively. There was one death attributed to sepsis. The concurrent gemcitabine and radiation portion of the study was completed without treatment interruptions in 56% of patients. The overall median survival was 8.2 mo and the median survival in the 44% of patients demonstrating a sustained CA-19-9 response was 13.5 mo. Only six patients experienced local regional progression as their first site of failure. Two patients (5%) were still alive at 35 and 41 mo posttreatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the feasibility of twice weekly gemcitabine and radiation for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Although this treatment strategy produced good local regional control, this did not result in a survival advantage. Stratifying patients by performance status and CA-19-9 response in future trials may be of value.","['Blackstock, A William', 'Tepper, Joel E', 'Niedwiecki, Donna', 'Hollis, Donna R', 'Mayer, Robert J', 'Tempero, Margaret A']","['Blackstock AW', 'Tepper JE', 'Niedwiecki D', 'Hollis DR', 'Mayer RJ', 'Tempero MA']","['Radiation Oncology, Wake Forest University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Winston-Salem, NC 277516, USA. ablackst@wfubmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Gastrointest Cancer,International journal of gastrointestinal cancer,101135379,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Survival Analysis']",2004/09/14 05:00,2005/01/08 09:00,['2004/09/14 05:00'],"['2004/09/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['IJGC:34:2-3:107 [pii]', '10.1385/ijgc:34:2-3:107 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Gastrointest Cancer. 2003;34(2-3):107-16. doi: 10.1385/ijgc:34:2-3:107.,['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the 1985-1995 period, 87 incident cases of childhood cancer were recorded among inhabitants born in FP or of an unknown place of birth (n = 2). Childhood cancer incidence had attained 125 cases/million child years and was very similar among girls (126 x 10(-6)) and boys (123 x 10(-6)), this incidence being slightly lower than among other populations of similar ethnic origin: Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR) = 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7-1.0) when compared with New Zealand Maoris and SIR = 0.8 (95% CI: 0.6-1.0) when compared with natives from Hawaii. For both sexes considered together, the most frequent cancer type was leukaemia, followed by central nervous system (CNS) malignancies, neuroblastoma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Only one case of gonadal and germ cell tumours and one case of carcinoma were reported. Childhood cancer incidence was predominant among children living in the Windward, Leeward and Marquesas Islands and the Tuamotu-Gambier archipelago, but lower in the Austral Islands.

Microsatellite analysis was performed to investigate the p73 gene locus in B-CLL. Moreover, we investigated the expression of the TAp73 and deltaNp73 variant by measuring the mRNA transcripts in 51 B-CLL patients by real-time RT-PCR. And in addition, protein expression was analyzed by Western blotting technique in 20 B-CLL patients. There was no evidence of clonal loss of heterozygosity at 1p36, the p73 gene locus in B-CLL patients. The real time RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of both p73 gene variants was much higher in leukemic cells compared to controls. In 17/20 (85%) patients deltaNp73 and TAp73 protein were present.

Comparison of MVD values of 36 AML patients with 18 non-malignant controls showed a significantly higher MVD in AML (CD31: P = 0.004, CD34: P < 0.001), which is independent of other variables such as cellularity or blast percentage.

Although Bcr-Abl induced NF-kappaB/Rel activation has previously been shown, the role of NF-kappaB/Rel in Ph+ leukemia is unclear. Using DNA binding assays, we demonstrate constitutive NF-kappaB/Rel activity in nuclear extracts from Ph+ ALL blasts, whereas Ph- primary blast cells and B-precursor cell lines lack NF-kappaB/Rel activity. NF-kappaB/Rel activity was shown in the ela2 and the b2a2 subtypes. Constitutive NF-kappaB/Rel activity in Ph+ blasts is not due to elevated endogenous IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity as shown by immune complex kinase assays. Since NF-kappaB/Rel is a transcriptional regulator of inhibitors of apoptosis we examined the expression of anti-apoptotic genes known to be induced by NF-kappaB/Rel by real time PCR analysis. We found no induction of TRAFI, TRAF2, cIAPI, cIAP2, XIAP, A20 or Bfl/Al in Ph+ ALL samples as compared to Ph-negative ALL controls. In summary, constitutive NF-kappaB/Rel activation independent of endogenous IKK activation may be a common finding in Ph+ ALL.

In our Institution, between 1984 and 2002, 40 patients received an allogeneic HSCT and 39 underwent autografting. The conditioning regimen included HD-Ara-C, HD-CTX and 10 Gy fractionated TBI. After allogeneic SCT in first CR, four patients relapsed, leading to a 10-year EFS chance of 78.3%; of the other patients, 5 are still in CR. After autografting in first CR, there was an early death, one secondary AML, one death in CR and six relapses, leading to a 10-year EFS chance of 44.4%; of the other patients, 6 are still in CR. Even considering the limited number of patients and the slow accrual rate, selection bias cannot be considered a sufficient explanation for the favorable outcome of allografting in first CR as the majority of the patients had adverse prognostic factors. It cannot be claimed that allogeneic SCT was performed in patients already cured, as the autografted patients had a notably worse outcome, and a 10-year EFS chance of about 80% is an uncommon finding even in standard-risk ALL patients. It might be inferred that the timing of SCT as late intensification, in addition to a rather aggressive conditioning regimen, helped to minimize the leukemic burden, thus favoring the expression of a GVL effect. Conversely, the results in more advanced disease phases are discouraging, due to poor quality CRs and inefficacy of GVL in managing large residual disease.","['Annaloro, Claudio', 'Curioni, Anna Chiara E', 'Molteni, Mauro', 'Della Volpe, Aldo', 'Soligo, Davide', 'Cortelezzi, Agostino', 'Lambertenghi Deliliers, Giorgio']","['Annaloro C', 'Curioni AC', 'Molteni M', 'Della Volpe A', 'Soligo D', 'Cortelezzi A', 'Lambertenghi Deliliers G']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Centre, Department of Hematology, Ospedale Maggiore and University of Milano, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2004/09/14 05:00,2004/10/09 09:00,['2004/09/14 05:00'],"['2004/09/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190310001639498 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Jun;45(6):1175-80. doi: 10.1080/10428190310001639498.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantification of CD38 expression using beads is expensive, time consuming and could be difficult to implement in a routine clinical laboratory. The calculation of relative median fluorescence (RMF) using the median fluorescence intensities of the test and control samples, is even more simply and cheaply obtained by flow cytometry and could be used as an alternative way of quantifying antigen expression. The present study demonstrates that RMF is an effective prognostic indicator in B-CLL that correlates closely with ABC in predicting disease-specific survival and time to progression for all patients. RMF predicted overall survival and time to progression in all patients (P < 0.0001 for both), in Binet Stage A patients (P < 0.0001 for both) and in Stage A patients under 60 years (P = 0.0299 and P = 0.0143, respectively). ABC predicted overall survival and time to progression in all patients (P < 0.0001 for both) in Stage A patients (P = 0.0024 and P < 0.0001, respectively) and in Stage A patients under 60 (P = 0.0379 and P = 0.0032, respectively). RMF is more effective than percentage CD38 positivity > 30% or > 20% in predicting disease-specific survival in Stage A patients of all ages (CD38 < > 30%: P = 0.0853, CD38 < > 20%: P = 0.0894) and in those under 60 years old (CD38 < > 30%: P = 0.5438, CD38 < > 20%: P = 0.2872). Also, RMF is more effective in predicting time to progression of Binet Stage A patients less than 60 years (P = 0.0143), while percentage CD38 positivity of 30%, 20% or 7% did not achieve statistical significance (P = 0.1103, = 0.0547, = 0.3399, respectively).

These regimens induce complete response (CR) rates in 65-80% of newly diagnosed AML patients. However, clinical outcome is unsatisfactory, as most of the patients who achieve a CR will relapse within 2 years from diagnosis, often with resistant disease and poor response to subsequent therapy. Thus, understanding the factors which contribute to the emergence of chemoresistant leukemic cells is essential to improve outcome in patients suffering from this disease. In this review, we highlight the current knowledge concerning the cellular mechanisms of resistance to ara-C. We also discuss possible strategies that may be used to overcome such resistance. Efforts to increase intracellular levels and DNA incorporation of phosphorylated ara-C using pronucleotides of ara-C are very promising. Ara-C combined with agents modulating apototic responses are expected to provide additional benefit. In the same way that combination chemotherapy has provided curative treatment of AML, a multifactorial approach of ara-C resistance should allow significant progress in the treatment of currently chemoresistant disease.","['Cros, Emeline', 'Jordheim, Lars', 'Dumontet, Charles', 'Galmarini, Carlos M']","['Cros E', 'Jordheim L', 'Dumontet C', 'Galmarini CM']","['INSERM 590. 8, Avenue Rockefeller, 69373 Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2004/09/14 05:00,2004/10/09 09:00,['2004/09/14 05:00'],"['2004/09/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819032000159861 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Jun;45(6):1123-32. doi: 10.1080/1042819032000159861.,,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)']",,125,,,,,,,,,,,,

This approach is appropriate for a research laboratory, but is not suitable for a routine laboratory setting. We show that the calibration curve based on the common 5 dilution standards (between 10 and 10(6) copies) is strongly influenced by the large variability of the measurements below 100 copies of the gene. In other words, including a standard with 10 copies is a source of error, which cannot be reduced through the construction of a standard curve with each run. Adding additional dilutions between 10 and 100 copies to the standard curve, the variance of the obtained curve is much reduced. As a conclusion, it is unnecessary to construct a calibration curve with each run since only negligible inaccuracy of calibration is added to the inaccuracy of measurement. Running of the samples in duplicate seems unnecessary since the inaccuracy of the method can be correctly estimated. Finally, we propose a standardized collection and isolation of total RNA from only 2.5 ml blood using an integrated system, which allows RNA stabilization for up to 5 days and provides snapshots of BCR-ABL fusion transcripts with higher accuracy than with non-stabilized blood samples.","['Rothlisberger, Benno', 'Herklotz, Roberto', 'Hergersberg, Martin', 'Stricker, Christian', 'Bargetzi, Mario', 'Huber, Andreas R']","['Rothlisberger B', 'Herklotz R', 'Hergersberg M', 'Stricker C', 'Bargetzi M', 'Huber AR']","['Center of Laboratory Medicine, Cantonal Hospital Aarau, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Calibration', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Reference Standards', '*Research Design', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods/standards', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2004/09/14 05:00,2004/10/09 09:00,['2004/09/14 05:00'],"['2004/09/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190310001625845 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Jun;45(6):1119-21. doi: 10.1080/10428190310001625845.,,,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about molecular responses to STI571 and the duration of leukemia-free survival in these patients. We report on a 43 year old female patient who presented with a relapse from Ph+ CML in December 2000. Five years earlier she had received an SCT from an unrelated male donor in accelerated phase. At the time of relapse, she presented with marked leukocytosis (89,000 microl) and 10% blasts. In December 2000, therapy with Imatinib was started. After 3 months, the karyotype showed an XY, with trisomy 8 in about 50% of all metaphases, but without evidence of residual Ph+ cells. Moreover, in response to Imatinib, BCR/ABL transcripts decreased and were no longer detectable after 6 months. After a total observation period of 36 months, the patient is still in complete cytogenetic and molecular remission without signs of occurrence of a donor-type hematopoietic neoplasm or CML relapse.

Considering the crucial role of Bcl-2 in the development of chemoresistance of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, we here assessed the potential of Par-4 to down-regulate Bcl-2 and to induce apoptosis in the erythroleukemic cell line HEL. Testing a potential pro-apoptotic role of Par-4 upon incubation with various conventional chemotherapeutic drugs, novel agents such as the signal transduction inhibitor STI 571 and the histone deacetylase (HDAC)- inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), as well as with the experimental substances Fas and TRAIL, we provide evidence that in the erythroleukemic cell line HEL expression of Par-4 is not sufficient to sensitize to any of these pro-apoptotic stimuli. We further demonstrate that--in contrast to previous reports in non-AML cells--Par-4 expression in HEL cells leads to an upregulation of Bcl-2. Moreover, Par-4-positive HEL cells exhibit a decreased level of the proapoptotic protein Bax as compared to Par-4- negative cells. In addition, Par-4 increases the expression of Daxx--whose downregulation is associated with augmented chemosensitivity--as well as expression of the procaspases-8, -9 and -10, whereas the levels of the procaspases-3 and -7 remain unaltered. In conclusion we here demonstrate that in the erythroleukemic cell line HEL--in contrast to other cell types Par-4 fails to promote apoptosis and outline the underlying molecular mechanisms.","['Boehrer, Simone', 'Brieger, Angela', 'Schaaf, Simone', 'Kukoc-Zivojnov, Natasa', 'Nowak, Daniel', 'Ruthardt, Martin', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Mitrou, Paris S', 'Weidmann, Eckhart', 'Chow, Kai Uwe']","['Boehrer S', 'Brieger A', 'Schaaf S', 'Kukoc-Zivojnov N', 'Nowak D', 'Ruthardt M', 'Hoelzer D', 'Mitrou PS', 'Weidmann E', 'Chow KU']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University Hospital, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Benzamides', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Caspase 10', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Enzyme Precursors/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', '*Genes, bcl-2', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/agonists', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/agonists', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'fas Receptor/drug effects']",2004/09/14 05:00,2004/11/02 09:00,['2004/09/14 05:00'],"['2004/09/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190410001663617 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Jul;45(7):1445-51. doi: 10.1080/10428190410001663617.,,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '0 (prostate apoptosis response-4 protein)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 10)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.63 (CASP10 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B-cell lymphomas accounted for 57.1% of cases, T-cell lymphomas 38.9%, and Hodgkin's lymphoma 4%. Extranodal lymphomas predominated (55.4%). The most common subtype of B-cell lymphoma was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (33.1%). All tumor types believed to be derived from germinal center (GC) B-cells including follicular lymphoma (4.6%), Burkitt lymphoma (1.7%), Hodgkin lymphoma (4.0%), and GC-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (as defined by combined expression of bc1-6 and CD10) were rather uncommon as compared to frequencies seen in series from Western countries. The common T-cell lymphomas included nasal and extranasal NK/T cell lymphoma (7.4%), mycosis fungoides (7.4%), and unspecified peripheral T-cell lymphoma (6.9%). Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma was very uncommon and accounts for only 0.6%. The proportional increase in T-cell lymphomas that were unrelated to type I human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) may be linked to differential Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) oncogenesis. The survival data revealed that mantle cell lymphoma, NK/T-cell lymphoma, unspecified peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma had an aggressive course. Our results confirm the utility of the WHO classification scheme for prognostic stratification and further highlight the distinctive distribution pattern of malignant lymphoma in Taiwan including the higher relative incidence of T cell lymphomas and the rarity of germinal center-derived B-cell tumors.","['Chang, Kong-Chao', 'Huang, Guan-Cheng', 'Jones, Dan', 'Tsao, Chao-Jung', 'Lee, J Yu-yun', 'Su, Ih-Jen']","['Chang KC', 'Huang GC', 'Jones D', 'Tsao CJ', 'Lee JY', 'Su IJ']","['Department of Pathology, and Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Follow-Up Studies', 'Germinal Center/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Life Tables', 'Lymphoma/classification/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/epidemiology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Taiwan/epidemiology', 'Terminology as Topic', 'World Health Organization']",2004/09/14 05:00,2004/11/02 09:00,['2004/09/14 05:00'],"['2004/09/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194042000198849 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Jul;45(7):1375-84. doi: 10.1080/10428194042000198849.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common outcome of these rearrangements is the formation of a fusion gene, comprising portions of 2 genes normally present in the cell. These fusion proteins are presumed to be oncogenic; in many cases, animal models have proven them to be oncogenic. One of the most promiscuous fusion partner genes is the newly identified NUP98 gene, located on chromosome 11p15.5, which to date has been observed fused to 15 different fusion partners. NUP98 encodes a 98 kD protein that is an important component of the nuclear pore complex, which mediates nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of protein and RNA. The fusion partners of NUP98 form 2 distinct groups: homeobox genes and non-homeobox genes. All NUP98 fusions join the N-terminal GLFG repeats of NUP98 to the C-terminal portion of the partner gene, which, in the case of the homeobox gene partners, includes the homeodomain. Clinical findings are reviewed here, along with the findings of several in vivo and in vitro models have been employed to investigate the mechanisms by which NUP98 fusion genes contribute to the pathogenesis of leukemia.","['Slape, Christopher', 'Aplan, Peter D']","['Slape C', 'Aplan PD']","['Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Navy 8, Room 5101, Bethesda, Maryland, MD 20889-5105, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Nuclear Pore/physiology', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2004/09/14 05:00,2004/11/02 09:00,['2004/09/14 05:00'],"['2004/09/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2004/09/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190310001659325 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Jul;45(7):1341-50. doi: 10.1080/10428190310001659325.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nup98 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",,96,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median survival is about 20 months. About 20% of patients develop acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Multivariate analyses performed by several groups showed that elevated medullary blast count, low haemoglobin, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and perhaps an increased lymphocyte count, are the most important independent prognostic parameters, whereas karyotype analysis was not consistently shown to yield additional prognostic information. Applying different scoring systems to 288 CMML patients included in the Dusseldorf MDS Registry, we found that the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) was not useful for defining risk groups in CMML, while the Spanish Score, the modified Bournemouth Score, the Dusseldorf Score, and probably the MDAP Score, identified patient groups differing significantly in survival. These scores should therefore be employed for clinical decision making and for risk stratification in the context of clinical trials.","['Germing, U', 'Kundgen, A', 'Gattermann, N']","['Germing U', 'Kundgen A', 'Gattermann N']","['Department of Haematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine- University, Dusseldorf, Germany.
