Eighty-seven patients aged 60 years or older were studied. To our knowledge, this is one of the largest group of elderly patients with ALL evaluated. We have not observed differences in immunological subtypes and Ph chromosome incidence as compared with younger adult ALL presented in the literature. Induction chemotherapy was administered in 75 patients. We observed complete remission (CR) in 34 (45%, 95% CI: 33-56%) patients. Induction death occurred in 11 (15%) patients. Thirty patients (40%) showed primary resistance to chemotherapy. Median overall survival (OS) of all patients was 150 days. Median disease-free survival (DFS) of responding patients was 180 days. We observed four long-term survivors (DFS longer than 3 years) in our group of patients. Factors influencing OS were CR achievement, female gender, and WBC below 30 x 10(9)/l. Male gender was the only prognostic factor negatively affecting probability to achieve CR. We have not observed any differences in either biology or outcome between patients aged 60-69 years and those aged more than 70 years. ALL of the elderly is a rare disease with poor prognosis. Further clinical trials evaluating the disease features, outcome, and new therapeutic approaches are warranted.","['Robak, T', 'Szmigielska-Kaplon, A', 'Wrzesien-Kus, A', 'Wierzbowska, A', 'Skotnicki, A B', 'Piatkowska-Jakubas, B', 'Kuliczkowski, K', 'Mazur, G', 'Zdunczyk, A', 'Stella-Holowiecka, B', 'Holowiecki, J', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek, J', 'Madry, K', 'Dmoszynska, A', 'Cioch, M']","['Robak T', 'Szmigielska-Kaplon A', 'Wrzesien-Kus A', 'Wierzbowska A', 'Skotnicki AB', 'Piatkowska-Jakubas B', 'Kuliczkowski K', 'Mazur G', 'Zdunczyk A', 'Stella-Holowiecka B', 'Holowiecki J', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek J', 'Madry K', 'Dmoszynska A', 'Cioch M']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Copernicus Memorial Hospital, Pabianicka 62 str, 93-513 Lodz, Poland. robaktad@csk.am.lodz.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20031126,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Poland', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/12/03 05:00,2004/04/28 05:00,['2003/12/03 05:00'],"['2003/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2003/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-003-0808-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2004 Apr;83(4):225-31. doi: 10.1007/s00277-003-0808-9.

A great majority of antigenic peptides is generated by fragmentation of proteins in the course of proteasomal processing. An algorithm was recently developed to predict cleavage sites during proteasomal processing. We tested the accuracy of the algorithm to predict mHps using 18 amino acid (AA) sequences of minor histocompatibility antigens (mHags) encoded by autosomal genes representing single nucleotide polymorphisms or by Y-chromosomal genes. The algorithm correctly predicted the C-termini of 11 of 13 experimentally confirmed mHps: 1) Correct prediction of C- and N-termini, e.g., for HA-1(H); 2) Correct prediction of C- and N-termini while anticipating intra-epitope cleavage sites, e.g., for SMCY-A*0201; 3) Correct prediction of C-termini and N-terminal extensions, e.g., for HA-8(R/V); and 4) Correct prediction of C-termini and N-terminal extensions while anticipating intra-epitope cleavage sites, e.g., for UTY-B8. Analysis of experimentally unconfirmed allelic counterparts of four autosomal mHags showed that AA substitutions either led to the insertion of an epitope-destroying cleavage site (e.g., in HA-1(R)) or abolished the correct C-terminus (e.g., in HA-2(M)). The proteasomal processing algorithm provides reliable data on the generation of mHps and forecasts their presence or absence. Combined with MHC class I ligand prediction, it can be a useful tool for the prediction of generation and presentation of new CTL epitopes derived from minor histocompatibility antigens.","['Khattab, B', 'Eiz-Vesper, B', 'Ganser, A', 'Hertenstein, B', 'Blasczyk, R']","['Khattab B', 'Eiz-Vesper B', 'Ganser A', 'Hertenstein B', 'Blasczyk R']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20031126,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigen Presentation/*immunology', 'Binding Sites', 'Chromosomes/immunology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Epitopes/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunogenetics', 'Mice', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex']",2003/12/03 05:00,2004/03/19 05:00,['2003/12/03 05:00'],"['2003/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2003/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-003-0791-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2004 Feb;83(2):107-13. doi: 10.1007/s00277-003-0791-1.

In addition, a borderline for further intensification of chemotherapy appears to be reached in adult ALL patients. New, preferably non-chemotherapy, approaches are therefore urgently required. One of those is targeted therapy with monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). ALL blast cells express a variety of specific antigens which may serve as targets, such as CD19, CD20, CD22, CD33, and CD52. Published results of MoAbs in ALL are reviewed. Most experience is available for anti-CD20 (rituximab) which led to a significant improvement of the outcome in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). In ALL, rituximab is combined with chemotherapy mainly in mature B-ALL and Burkitt's lymphoma and preliminary results are promising. In the future, studies will also be done in B-precursor ALL. Another promising B-cell antibody is anti-CD22. Several CD19 MoAbs were also tested in phase I studies. However, results are not conclusive and these MoAbs are not generally available. Far less experience with MoAb therapy is available for T-ALL, but clinical studies are on the way with anti-CD52 and anti-CD25 in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Overall, it can be stated that MoAb therapy in ALL is a promising treatment approach. Monotherapy with MoAbs in relapsed ALL occasionally led to responses, but higher effectivity can be expected from a combination with chemotherapy and treatment in the state of minimal residual disease. Well-designed studies and joint efforts are required to explore optimal combinations, timing and dosage of MoAb therapy in ALL.","['Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Hoelzer, Dieter']","['Gokbuget N', 'Hoelzer D']","['Medical Clinic III, University Hospital, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt, Germany. goekbuget@em.uni-frankfurt.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20031126,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy']",2003/12/03 05:00,2004/04/28 05:00,['2003/12/03 05:00'],"['2003/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2003/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-003-0752-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2004 Apr;83(4):201-5. doi: 10.1007/s00277-003-0752-8.

The data on musculoskeletal complaints were obtained from a questionnaire. The medical records were revised in order to get data on the clinical examination and laboratory tests at the beginning of the illness. RESULTS: Sixty-one children were included in this trial, 93% with acute lymphoid leukemia, and 7% with acute myeloid leukemia. Thirty-eight patients (62%) had musculoskeletal pain at the onset. Arthritis was observed in eight patients. The mean number of involved joints was 2.5 (1-6). The most frequently involved joints were the knees, ankles and elbows. Three patients (4.9%) had normal blood count. Low hemoglobin was reported in 54 patients (88%) (in six patients it was the only hematological abnormality), leukopenia in 14 (22%), leukocytosis in 26 (42%) and low platelet count in 46 (75%).

To identify a novel protein(s) binding to PU.1, we carried out affinity purification using a column of Glutathione-Sepharose beads bound to GST-PU.1 fusion protein and isolated several individual proteins using murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell extracts. Sequence analysis of these proteins revealed that one was MeCP2 a methyl CpG binding protein. GST-pull-down assay and immunoprecipitation assay showed that PU.1 bound directly to MeCP2 via its Ets domain and MeCP2 bound to PU.1 via either its amino terminal domain or trans-repression domain. MeCP2 repressed transcriptional activity of PU.1 on a reporter construct with trimerized PU.1 binding sites. This downregulation was recovered in the presence of histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA). MeCP2 was integrated in PU.1-mSin3A-HDAC complex but not in PU.1-CBP complex. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that PU.1 and MeCP2 were collocated at the PU.1 binding site on the reporter construct and the PU.1 binding site of the intervening sequence 2 (IVS2) region in the intron of the beta-globin gene, which has been proposed to regulate expression of the gene, in undifferentiated MEL cells. The complex disappeared from the region during the course of erythroid differentiation of MEL cells.

Here, we investigated the MLL-AF9 function by means of an antisense phosphorothioate-oligodeoxyribonucleotide (MLL-AF9-PS-ODNas) using the THP-1 AML-M5 cell line carrying t(9;11). Having confirmed that MLL-AF9-PS-ODNas induces strong inhibition of THP-1 cell growth, but only a moderate increase in apoptosis, we found that MLL-AF9-PS-ODNas did not induce morpho-functional terminal differentiation or restore M-CSF-, G-CSF- or GM-CSF-induced differentiation. Moreover, THP-1 cells showed the same phenotype with/without MLL-AF9-PS-ODNas. In THP-1 cells differentiated to mature macrophage-like cells by PMA/TPA or ATRA, MLL-AF9 expression was downregulated. Thus, in the monocytic lineage, MLL-AF9 may be expressed only in early phases and can induce deregulated amplification in both nonmalignant and malignant cells, maintaining the monocytic phenotype without blocking final maturation. Our findings suggest that: (1) as well as directly promoting cell growth, MLL-AF9 may also indirectly determine phenotype; (2) other leukaemogenic mutations associated with MLL-AF9-related leukaemias should be searched for mainly in processes of resistance to apoptosis (where MLL-AF9 may play only a limited role) and differentiation blockage (where MLL-AF9 may play no role).","['Pession, Andrea', 'Martino, Vincenzo', 'Tonelli, Roberto', 'Beltramini, Claudia', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Biserni, Giulia', 'Franzoni, Monica', 'Freccero, Francesea', 'Montemurro, Luca', 'Pattacini, Laura', 'Paolucci, Guido']","['Pession A', 'Martino V', 'Tonelli R', 'Beltramini C', 'Locatelli F', 'Biserni G', 'Franzoni M', 'Freccero F', 'Montemurro L', 'Pattacini L', 'Paolucci G']","['Department of Paediatrics, University of Bologna, Policlinico S.

Knowing that dysregulated expression of spi-1/pu.1 and fli-1 oncogenes is involved in MEL cell differentiation arrest, we looked at their effect on exon 16 erythroid splicing.

By contrast, endogenous overexpression or enforced expression of Fli-1 has no effect on exon selection. We further showed that Spi-1/PU.1 acts similarly on the endogenous and on a transfected exon 16, suggesting a promoter-independent effect of Spi-1/PU.1 on splicing regulation.

We therefore examined the role of LIF in HGF expression and examined the human HGF promoter. The expression of both LIF and HGF mRNA is very low in HEK293 cells. Treatment of these cells with LIF stimulated the expression of HGF mRNA. The cis-acting regulatory element of the HGF promoter in SEKI and 293 cells was analysed by means of a transient expression assay. By deletion analysis, we showed that the region comprising the -181 to -73 bp was required for full activity of the HGF promoter in SEKI cells and for LIF responsiveness of 293 cells. This region contains putative consensus sequences for the Stat and NF-IL6 (C/EBP beta) transcription factors. The activity of the HGF promoter was abolished by mutation of the Stat site at -99/-91, while the activity only slightly decreased on mutation of the NF-IL6 site. Treatment with anti-LIF antibodies or interruption of Stat3 signaling by dominant-negative Stat3 also reduced the HGF promoter activity. Stat3 activation was constitutive in SEKI cells and induced on treatment of 293 cells with LIF.

Exposure of cells to adaphostin concentrations > or =0.75 microM for intervals > or =6 h resulted in a pronounced release of cytochrome c and AIF, activation of caspase-9, -8, and -3, and apoptosis. These events were accompanied by the caspase-independent downregulation of Raf-1, inactivation of MEK1/2, ERK, Akt, p70S6K, dephosphorylation of GSK-3, and activation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK. Adaphostin also induced cleavage and dephosphorylation of pRb on CDK2- and CDK4-specific sites, as well as the caspase-dependent downregulation of cyclin D1. Inducible expression of a constitutively active MEK1 construct markedly diminished adaphostin-induced cytochrome c and AIF release, JNK activation, and apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Ectopic expression of Raf-1 or constitutively activated (myristolated) Akt also significantly attenuated adaphostin-induced apoptosis, but protection was less than that conferred by enforced activation of MEK. Lastly, antioxidants (e.g., L-N-acetylcysteine; L-NAC) opposed adaphostin-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, Raf-1/MEK/ERK downregulation, JNK activation, and apoptosis. However, in contrast to L-NAC, enforced activation of MEK failed to block adaphostin-mediated ROS generation. Together, these findings demonstrate that the tyrphostin adaphostin induces multiple perturbations in signal transduction pathways in human leukemia cells, particularly inactivation of the cytoprotective Raf-1/MEK/ERK and Akt cascades, that culminate in mitochondrial injury, caspase activation, and apoptosis. They also suggest that adaphostin-related oxidative stress acts upstream of perturbations in these signaling pathways to trigger the cell death process.","['Yu, Chunrong', 'Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Almenara, Jorge', 'Sausville, Edward A', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Yu C', 'Rahmani M', 'Almenara J', 'Sausville EA', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Adamantane/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor', 'Cytochromes c/drug effects', 'Flavoproteins/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf']",2003/12/03 05:00,2004/03/11 05:00,['2003/12/03 05:00'],"['2003/12/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1207248 [doi]', '1207248 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Feb 19;23(7):1364-76. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207248.,"['0 (AIFM1 protein, human)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Flavoproteins)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NSC 680410)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'PJY633525U (Adamantane)']",,,,"['CA 93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

We show that overexpression of wild-type mouse and human c-rel genes suffices to malignantly transform primary spleen cells in stringent soft agar assays and produce fatal tumors in vivo. In contrast relA and a constitutively active form of IKKbeta did not. Importantly, a hybrid RelA protein with its C-terminal transactivation domain substituted by that of v-Rel was potently oncogenic in vitro and in vivo. The transactivation domain of v-Rel selectively conferred an oncogenic phenotype upon the Rel homology domain (RHD) of RelA, but not to the more divergent RHDs of p50/NF-kappaB1, p52/NF-kappaB2, or RelB. Collectively, our results highlight important differences in the intrinsic oncogenic activity of mammalian c-Rel and RelA proteins, and indicate that critical determinants of their differential oncogenicity reside in their divergent transactivation domains. These findings provide experimental evidence for a role of mammalian Rel/NF-kappaB factors in leukemia/lymphomagenesis in an in vivo animal model, and are consistent with the implication of c-rel in many human lymphomas.","['Fan, Yongjun', 'Rayet, Beatrice', 'Gelinas, Celine']","['Fan Y', 'Rayet B', 'Gelinas C']","['Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine, Piscataway, NJ 08854-5638, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chickens', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Teratocarcinoma', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/12/03 05:00,2004/03/11 05:00,['2003/12/03 05:00'],"['2003/12/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1207221 [doi]', '1207221 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Feb 5;23(5):1030-42. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207221.,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",,,,['CA54999/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The analysis of 201 children treated with methotrexate for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) showed that patients with either the MTHFR T677A1298 haplotype or MTHFD1 A1958 variant had a lower probability of event-free survival (EFS) in univariate analysis (hazard ratio (HR)=2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.0-4.7 and 2.8, 95% CI, 1.1-7.3, respectively). Multivariate analysis supported only the role of the MTHFR variant (HR=2.2, 95% CI, 0.9-5.6). However, the association of both genes with ALL outcome appears to be more obvious in the presence of another event-predisposing variant belonging to the same path of drug action. The combined effect of a thymidylate synthase (TS) triple repeat associated with increased TS levels, with either the MTHFR T677A1298 haplotype or MTHFD1 A1958 allele, resulted in a highly significant reduction of EFS (multivariate HR=9.0, 95% CI, 1.9-42.8 and 8.9, 95% CI, 1.8-44.6, respectively). These results reveal the role of gene-gene interactions within a folate pathway, and how they can correlate with relapse probabilities in ALL patients.","['Krajinovic, M', 'Lemieux-Blanchard, E', 'Chiasson, S', 'Primeau, M', 'Costea, I', 'Moghrabi, A']","['Krajinovic M', 'Lemieux-Blanchard E', 'Chiasson S', 'Primeau M', 'Costea I', 'Moghrabi A']","['Centre de Recherche, Hopital Sainte-Justine; Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Mere-Enfant, Cote Ste-Catherine, Montreal, Canada. maja.krajinovic@umontreal.ca']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pharmacogenomics J,The pharmacogenomics journal,101083949,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase (NADP)/*genetics', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",2003/12/03 05:00,2004/09/21 05:00,['2003/12/03 05:00'],"['2003/12/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.tpj.6500224 [doi]', '6500224 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacogenomics J. 2004;4(1):66-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.tpj.6500224.,"['EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))', 'EC 1.5.1.5 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase (NADP))']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When neutrophil recovery in patients receiving <3 or <5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg was compared to those receiving > or =3 or > or =5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg, respectively, separately by IBW and ABW, the magnitude and significance of the differences were greater for IBW-based comparisons. These data suggest the CD34+ cell dose based on IBW is a better predictor of neutrophil recovery after allografting. Further work in a larger, more homogeneous group of patients is required to confirm this observation.","['Cilley, J', 'Rihn, C', 'Monreal, J', 'Gordon, L I', 'Singhal, S', 'Tallman, M', 'Williams, S', 'Winter, J', 'Mehta, J']","['Cilley J', 'Rihn C', 'Monreal J', 'Gordon LI', 'Singhal S', 'Tallman M', 'Williams S', 'Winter J', 'Mehta J']","['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, 676 N.

Normal parenchymal liver cells express the receptors for these cytokines, and these receptors activate, to a comparable level, the intracellular signaling through signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins and extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK). In contrast, hepatoma cell lines show attenuated responsiveness to some of these cytokines that is correlated with lower expression of the corresponding ligand-binding receptor subunits. This study tests the hypothesis that the reduced expression of LIF receptor (LIFR) observed in hepatoma cells is mediated by altered DNA methylation. H-35 rat hepatoma cells that have a greatly reduced LIF responsiveness were treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase. Surviving and proliferating cells showed reestablished expression of LIFR protein and function. Restriction landmark genomic scanning (RLGS) demonstrated genome-wide drug-induced alterations in DNA methylation status, with striking similarities in the demethylation pattern among independently derived clonal lines. Upon extended growth in the absence of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, the cells exhibit partial reversion to pretreatment patterns. Demethylation and remethylation of the CpG island within the LIFR promoter that is active in normal liver cells correlate with increased and decreased usage of this promoter in H-35 cells. In conclusion, these results indicate that transformed liver cells frequently undergo epigenetic alterations that suppress LIFR gene expression and modify the responsiveness to this IL-6 type cytokine.","['Blanchard, Frederic', 'Tracy, Erin', 'Smith, Joseph', 'Chattopadhyay, Souvik', 'Wang, Yanping', 'Held, William A', 'Baumann, Heinz']","['Blanchard F', 'Tracy E', 'Smith J', 'Chattopadhyay S', 'Wang Y', 'Held WA', 'Baumann H']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,IM,"['Animals', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Decitabine', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Liver Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytokine/analysis/*genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",2003/12/04 05:00,2003/12/19 05:00,['2003/12/04 05:00'],"['2003/12/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.hep.2003.09.029 [doi]', 'S0270913903009996 [pii]']",ppublish,Hepatology. 2003 Dec;38(6):1516-28. doi: 10.1016/j.hep.2003.09.029.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,"['CA 16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 68612/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 85580/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 38866/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

L1210 monocytic leukaemia cells were known to have a limited ability to uptake cystine, and they require cysteine for cell growth. L1210 cells underwent apoptosis when cultured without thiol-bearing and dithiol-cleaving compounds, adding thiols suppressed the apoptosis and promoted cell growth. A specific inhibitor of interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme (ICE)-like and CPP32-like proteases could suppress L1210 cell apoptosis induced by thiol deprivation. The cell lysates of apoptotic L1210 cells exhibited protease activity that could cleave DEVD-AMC, but not YVAD-AMC, and so CPP32-like proteases, but not ICE-like proteases, were activated and participated in apoptosis. The addition of thiols could suppress CPP32-like protease activation. Although the cell death-suppressor bcl-2-family proteins (bcl-2 and bcl-XL) were recently found to suppress the activation of CPP32-like proteases, the expression levels of death-suppressor bcl-2-family proteins did not change when thiols were added.

Multiparameter flow cytometric methods allowed us to identify apoptotic cells and position them with respect to their cell cycle phase. Several antitumor agents of different classes have been characterized in terms of the cell cycle phase specificity of induction of apoptosis. Three types of apoptosis could be distinguished in relation to the initial damage to the cell vis-a-vis cell cycle position: (1) homo-phase apoptosis where the cells underwent apoptosis during the same phase in which they were initially affected; (2) homo-cycle apoptosis, where the cells underwent apoptosis during the same cell cycle in which they were initially affected, i.e., prior to or during the first mitosis, and (3) post-mitotic apoptosis, where cells underwent apoptosis during the cell cycle(s) subsequent to that in which the cell was initially affected, most likely at the G1 or G2 checkpoints of these cycle(s). Four ranges of drug concentration can be distinguished in vitro for most drugs, where either: (1) no immediate effects; (2) cytostasis or post-mitotic apoptosis; (3) homo-cycle or homo-phase apoptosis; or (4) necrosis are observed. Analysis of cell death of blast cells from peripheral blood or bone marrow of over 250 leukaemia patients (AML, ALL, CML in blast crisis) treated with various drugs during routine chemotherapy reveals that in the case of DNA topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g., mitoxantrone, VP-16) apoptosis is often rapid (peaks at 1-2 days after drug administration) and has features of homo-phase apoptosis. In contrast, cell death observed after administration of paclitaxel (taxol) or cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside) occurs later and has features of post-mitotic apoptosis: the cells divide but die in G1 of the subsequent cycle(s).","['Halicka, H D', 'Seiter, K', 'Feldman, E J', 'Traganos, F', 'Mittelman, A', 'Ahmed, T', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Halicka HD', 'Seiter K', 'Feldman EJ', 'Traganos F', 'Mittelman A', 'Ahmed T', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['The Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Elmsford 10523, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,,,1997/01/01 00:00,2003/12/04 05:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/04 05:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['172907 [pii]', '10.1023/a:1026431524236 [doi]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 1997;2(1):25-39. doi: 10.1023/a:1026431524236.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The direct mechanism by which immunotoxins kill cancer cells is inhibition of protein synthesis, but cytotoxicity due to induction of apoptosis has also been observed with these agents. Some cancers that express high levels of BCL-2 are relatively resistant to apoptosis inducing agents. It is therefore important to determine to what degree the toxicity of ricin, diphtheria toxin, Pseudomonas exotoxin and Pseudomonas exotoxin derived immunotoxins towards cancer cells can be attributed to inhibition of protein synthesis, and to what degree to subsequent induction of apoptosis. We compared the sensitivity of MCF-7 breast cancer cells that were stably transfected with a BCL-2 expression plasmid and thus protected against apoptosis and of MCF-7 cells transfected with a control plasmid towards ricin, diphtheria and Pseudomonas toxin, a Pseudomonas toxin-derived immunotoxin (LMB-7) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF). We found that BCL-2 mediated inhibition of apoptosis renders the cells almost completely resistant (1000-fold) to tumour necrosis factor, but the same cells were only 3-10 fold more resistant to cytotoxicity induced by immunotoxin LMB-7 as well as Pseudomonas exotoxin, diphtheria toxin and ricin. We next studied several leukaemia cell lines with variable levels of BCL-2 expression and found them quite sensitive to a Pseudomonas exotoxin containing immunotoxin independent of the level of BCL-2. Our data indicate that although BCL-2 overexpression can have a modest effect on sensitivity to an immunotoxin, cell lines derived from patients are still very sensitive to immunotoxins.","['Brinkmann, U', 'Mansfield, E', 'Pastan, I']","['Brinkmann U', 'Mansfield E', 'Pastan I']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,,,1997/01/01 00:00,2003/12/04 05:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/04 05:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['172925 [pii]', '10.1023/a:1026468532413 [doi]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 1997;2(2):192-8. doi: 10.1023/a:1026468532413.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No morphological or functional differentiation induced by ATRA was observed in any of the cases studied. In cell cultures, inhibition of leukaemia cell growth by ATRA was obvious, especially in the case of clonogenic cells, and it was both time- and concentration-dependent. Induction of apoptosis was more difficult to achieve. The cells retained over 90% viability in suspension when the ATRA exposure at any of the concentrations studied was 48 h or less. When the time of exposure to ATRA was longer than 48 h, the viability of the cells decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. Apoptosis was observed morphologically in each of the AML cases with 10(-5) to 10(-8) M ATRA, if the incubation time of cells in ATRA was 72 h. The percentage of apoptotic cells increased with increasing ATRA concentrations from 12+/- 9% of 10(-8) M ATRA to 78+/-12% of 10(-5) M ATRA. The DNA electrophoretic method was able to detect apoptosis in all the AML samples exposed to 10(-7) and 10(-6) ATRA for 48 h and occasionally in cases where lower concentrations and longer exposure time were used.

To estimate the GFAP levels of astrocytes in intracranial tumour tissues, we established primary cultures from six astrocytic tumour specimens and used a double-staining flow cytometric method to detect the different levels of GFAP among these primary cultures. Although these primary cultures exhibited the same Matrigel invasiveness, their GFAP expression is inversely related to the rate of cell growth and the histologic grade of the original tumour. Phenylacetate, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and sodium butyrate, which are potent inducers of differentiation in various cancer cells, have been examined for their effects on these primary cultures. Cytostasis was more or less caused by these compounds in all six primary cultures, but induction of GFAP was observed only in the primary culture derived from a less malignant astrocytoma specimen having the highest intrinsic GFAP level. Interestingly, this primary culture, but not others, also exhibited increased HRG-alpha expression after phenylacetate or sodium butyrate treatment. Loss of the inducibility of differentiation-related gene expression could be one of the events involved in the malignant progression of astrocytomas. In addition, the chemotherapeutic agent BiCNU has a killing effect on all six primary culture cells, with LD50 less than 60 nM. The underlying mechanism was through the induction of apoptosis in these primary culture cells regardless of their varying malignancies of original tumours. However, unlike colon cancer and leukaemia cells, sodium butyrate could not induce apoptosis within 4 days in these astrocytic tumour cells, indicating that the cell context of different cell types indeed determined the ability of sodium butyrate to induce apoptosis.","['Chen, M H', 'Yang, W K', 'Whang-Peng, J', 'Lee, L S', 'Huang, T S']","['Chen MH', 'Yang WK', 'Whang-Peng J', 'Lee LS', 'Huang TS']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei and Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,,,2003/12/04 05:00,2003/12/04 05:01,['2003/12/04 05:00'],"['2003/12/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/04 05:01 [medline]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['176437 [pii]', '10.1023/a:1009698822305 [doi]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 1998;3(3):171-82. doi: 10.1023/a:1009698822305.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The II-5 cells resist apoptosis by TNF alpha and anti-Fas antibody but not by anticancer drugs, such as VP-16 and Ara-C. Somatic cell hybridization between U937 and II-5 showed that the apoptosis resistance to TNF alpha in II-5 was genetically dominant. This dominant mutation in II-5 cells blocks TNF alpha-induced disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase-3 activation. Expression of TNFR, Fas and Bcl-2 family proteins were not changed in II-5 cells.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the primary mediator of Gram-negative sepsis by inducing the production of macrophage-derived proinflammatory cytokines, in which activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) plays an important role. PC-SPES is an eight-herb mixture active against a variety of malignancies, including prostate cancer and leukemia. In this study, we demonstrated that PC-SPES inhibited the LPS-induced NF-kappaB reporter activity in RAW264.7 macrophages. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that PC-SPES inhibited the binding of NF-kappaB to specific DNA sequences; however, it did not affect either degradation of inhibitory kappaBalpha or nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Also, we explored the effect of PCSPES on LPS-induced mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling; PC-SPES did not affect LPS-induced phosphorylation of MAP kinases, including c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. Moreover, PC-SPES decreased the production of proinflammatory cytokines and inducible enzymes, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, cyclooxygenase-2, as well as inducible nitric-oxide synthase in RAW264.7 macrophages and peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice after the cells were stimulated by either LPS or LPS and interferon-gamma. Furthermore, PC-SPES rescued C57BL/6 mice from death caused by LPS-induced septic shock in conjunction with decreased serum levels of TNFalpha and IL-1beta. Together, PC-SPES is a potent inhibitor of NF-kappaB and might be useful for the treatment of sepsis and inflammatory diseases.","['Ikezoe, Takayuki', 'Yang, Yang', 'Heber, David', 'Taguchi, Hirokuni', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Ikezoe T', 'Yang Y', 'Heber D', 'Taguchi H', 'Koeffler HP']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Nankoku, Kochi 783-8505, Japan. ikezoet@med.kochi-ms.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['Animals', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Lipopolysaccharides/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Shock, Septic/chemically induced/*metabolism']",2003/12/03 05:00,2004/01/17 05:00,['2003/12/03 05:00'],"['2003/12/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1124/mol.64.6.1521 [doi]', '64/6/1521 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2003 Dec;64(6):1521-9. doi: 10.1124/mol.64.6.1521.,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (herbal preparation PC-SPES)']",,,,['AT00151/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the roles of Bcl-2 family members and the relative contribution of the intrinsic mitochondrial versus the extrinsic receptor-related apoptotic pathways to MEK inhibitors/UCN-01-induced leukemic cell death. Cotreatment of U937 cells with PD184352 and UCN-01 resulted in the activation of procaspase-3, -9, and -8 as well as Bid cleavage. PD184352/UCN-01-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis were both substantially attenuated in cells ectopically expressing Bcl-2, an N-terminal phosphorylation loop-deleted mutant Bcl-2, or Bcl-xL, but not in cells expressing dominant-negative (DN) caspase-8, cytokine response modifier A (cowpox virus-encoded antiapoptotic protein), or DN Fas-associated death domain. Coadministration of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) or TNF-alpha substantially increased MEK inhibitors (e.g., PD184352 or U0126)/UCN-01-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, activation of procaspase-8 and Bid, and apoptosis in Bcl-2- and Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells but not in those in which the extrinsic pathway was interrupted. Together, these findings suggest that the MEK inhibitors/UCN-01 regimen primarily induces leukemic cell apoptosis by engaging the intrinsic, mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and that resistance to these events conferred by increased expression of certain antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members can be overcome, at least in part, by coadministration of TRAIL and other agents that activate the extrinsic apoptotic cascade.","['Dai, Yun', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Dai Y', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Medical College of Virginia/Virginia Commonwealth University, MCV Station Box 230, Richmond, VA 23298, USA. stgrant@hsc.vcu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Diseases/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'bcl-X Protein']",2003/12/04 05:00,2004/01/17 05:00,['2003/12/04 05:00'],"['2003/12/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1124/mol.64.6.1402 [doi]', '64/6/1402 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2003 Dec;64(6):1402-9. doi: 10.1124/mol.64.6.1402.,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",,,,"['CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA83705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that the env gene of these viruses harbors the determinant of neurovirulence. It appears that neuronal loss occurs by an indirect mechanism, since the target motor neurons have not been found to be infected. However, the pathogenesis of the disease remains unclear. Several lymphokines, cytokines, and other cellular effectors have been found to be aberrantly expressed in the brains of infected mice, but whether these are required for the development of the neurodegenerative lesions is not known. In an effort to identify the specific effectors which are indeed required for the initiation and/or development of spongiform myeloencephalopathy, we inoculated gene-deficient (knockout [KO]) mice with ts-1 MuLV. We show here that interleukin-6 (IL-6), inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), ICE, Fas, Fas ligand (FasL), and TNF-R1 KO mice still develop signs of disease. However, transgenic mice overexpressing Bcl-2 in neurons (NSE/Bcl-2) were largely protected from hind limb paralysis and had less-severe spongiform lesions.

Previous investigators showed that BAF binds double-stranded DNA nonspecifically and is a host component of preintegration complexes (PICs) isolated from cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) or Moloney murine leukemia virus. BAF protects PIC structure and stimulates the integration of salt-stripped PICs into target DNA in vitro. PICs are thought to acquire BAF from the cytoplasm during infection. However, we identified two human tissues (of 16 tested) in which BAF mRNA was not detected: thymus and peripheral blood leukocytes, which are enriched in CD4(+) T lymphocytes and macrophage precursors, respectively. BAF protein was detected in activated but not resting CD4(+) T lymphocytes; thus, if BAF were essential for PIC function, we hypothesized that virions might ""bring their own BAF."" Supporting this model, BAF copurified with HIV-1 virions that were digested with subtilisin to remove microvesicle contaminants, and BAF was present in approximately zero to three copies per virion. In three independent assays, BAF bound directly to both p55 Gag (the structural precursor of HIV-1 virions) and its cleaved product, matrix. Using lysates from cells overexpressing Gag, endogenous BAF and Gag were coimmunoprecipitated by antibodies against Gag. Purified recombinant BAF had low micromolar affinities (1.1 to 1.4 micro M) for recombinant Gag and matrix. We conclude that BAF is present at low levels in incoming virions, in addition to being acquired from the cytoplasm of newly infected cells. We further conclude that BAF might contribute to the assembly or activity of HIV-1 PICs through direct binding to matrix, as well as DNA.","['Mansharamani, Malini', 'Graham, David R M', 'Monie, Daphne', 'Lee, Kenneth K', 'Hildreth, James E K', 'Siliciano, Robert F', 'Wilson, Katherine L']","['Mansharamani M', 'Graham DR', 'Monie D', 'Lee KK', 'Hildreth JE', 'Siliciano RF', 'Wilson KL']","['Department of Cell Biology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV Antigens/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Precursors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Viral Proteins', 'Virion/*metabolism', '*Virus Integration', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",2003/12/04 05:00,2004/01/14 05:00,['2003/12/04 05:00'],"['2003/12/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.24.13084-13092.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Dec;77(24):13084-92. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.24.13084-13092.2003.,"['0 (BANF1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (HIV Antigens)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (p17 protein, Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1)', '0 (p55 gag precursor protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)']",,,,"['R01 GM048646/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-GM48646/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC296067,,,,,

Besides recent developments on T cell dynamics, the turnover rates of B lymphocytes are largely unknown particularly in the context of a virally induced pathological disorder. Here, we aim to resolve this issue by determining the rates of cell proliferation and death during the chronic stage of the bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection, called bovine persistent lymphocytosis (PL). Our methodology is based on direct intravenous injection of bromodeoxyuridine in association with subsequent flow cytometry. By this in vivo approach, we show that the death rate of PL B lymphocytes is significantly reduced (average death rate, 0.057 day(-1) versus 0.156 day(-1) in the asymptomatic controls). Concomitantly, proliferation of the PL cells is also significantly restricted compared to the controls (average proliferation rate, 0.0046 day(-1) versus 0.0085 day(-1)). We conclude that bovine PL is characterized by a decreased cell turnover resulting both from a reduction of cell death and an overall impairment of proliferation.

Tax dimerization contributes to optimal Tax activity involved in transactivation of the HTLV-1 promoter. The mechanisms used to form specific Tax dimers are poorly understood because the domains that mediate such interactions have not been clearly characterized. Here we have used different approaches (the two-hybrid assay in yeast, the glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay, and the Spot method) to study Tax-Tax interactions. Our results indicate that the integrity of the sequence of Tax, except for the last 16 amino acids (residues 338 to 353), is critical, suggesting that Tax dimerization is dictated more by secondary structure than by primary structure. We were, however, able to delimit a central region involved in Tax self-association that encompasses the residues 127 to 228. This region can be divided into three subdomains of dimerization: DD1 (residues 127 to 146), DD2 (residues 181 to 194), and DD3 (residues 213 to 228). Moreover, the Tax mutants M22 (T130A and L131S) and M29 (K189A and R190S), with amino acid substitutions located in DD1 and DD2, respectively, were found to be impaired in Tax self-association.","['Basbous, Jihane', 'Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Granier, Claude', 'Devaux, Christian', 'Mesnard, Jean-Michel']","['Basbous J', 'Bazarbachi A', 'Granier C', 'Devaux C', 'Mesnard JM']","['Laboratoire Infections Retrovirales et Signalisation Cellulaire, CNRS/UM I UMR 5121/IFR 122, Institut de Biologie, 34960 Cedex 2, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Gene Products, tax/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2003/12/03 05:00,2004/01/14 05:00,['2003/12/03 05:00'],"['2003/12/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.24.13028-13035.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Dec;77(24):13028-35. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.24.13028-13035.2003.,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Peptides)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",,,,,,,,,PMC296077,,,,,

Ectopic expression of PLZF leads to cell cycle arrest and growth suppression, while disruption of normal PLZF function is implicated in the development of APL. To clarify the function of PLZF in cell growth and survival, we used an inducible PLZF cell line in a microarray analysis to identify the target genes repressed by PLZF. One prominent gene identified was c-myc. The array analysis demonstrated that repression of c-myc by PLZF led to a reduction in c-myc-activated transcripts and an increase in c-myc-repressed transcripts. Regulation of c-myc by PLZF was shown to be both direct and reversible. An interaction between PLZF and the c-myc promoter could be detected both in vitro and in vivo. PLZF repressed the wild-type c-myc promoter in a reporter assay, dependent on the integrity of the binding site identified in vitro. PLZF binding in vivo was coincident with a decrease in RNA polymerase occupation of the c-myc promoter, indicating that repression occurred via a reduction in the initiation of transcription. Finally, expression of c-myc reversed the cell cycle arrest induced by PLZF. These data suggest that PLZF expression maintains a cell in a quiescent state by repressing c-myc expression and preventing cell cycle progression. Loss of this repression through the translocation that occurs in t(11;17) would have serious consequences for cell growth control.","['McConnell, Melanie J', 'Chevallier, Nathalie', 'Berkofsky-Fessler, Windy', 'Giltnane, Jena M', 'Malani, Rupal B', 'Staudt, Louis M', 'Licht, Jonathan D']","['McConnell MJ', 'Chevallier N', 'Berkofsky-Fessler W', 'Giltnane JM', 'Malani RB', 'Staudt LM', 'Licht JD']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, One Gustave L.

Recently, two X-SCID patients treated by gene therapy to rescue T-cell lymphopoiesis developed T-cell leukemias with retroviral insertion into the LMO2 gene causing clonal T-cell proliferation. In view of the specificity of LMO2 in T-cell tumorigenesis, we investigated a possible role for Lmo2 in T-lymphopoiesis, using conditional knockout of mouse Lmo2 with loxP-flanked Lmo2 and Cre recombinase alleles driven by the promoters of the lymphoid-specific genes Rag1, CD19, and Lck. While efficient deletion of Lmo2 was observed, even in the earliest detectable lymphoid cell progenitors of the bone marrow, there was no disturbance of lymphopoiesis in either T- or B-cell lineages, and in contrast to Lmo2 transgenic mice, there were normal distributions of CD4- CD- thymocytes. We conclude that there is no mandatory role for LMO2 in lymphoid development, implying that its specific role in T-cell tumorigenesis results from a reprogramming of gene expression after enforced expression in T-cell precursors.","['McCormack, Matthew P', 'Forster, Alan', 'Drynan, Lesley', 'Pannell, Richard', 'Rabbitts, Terence H']","['McCormack MP', 'Forster A', 'Drynan L', 'Pannell R', 'Rabbitts TH']","['MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 2QH, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphopoiesis/*genetics', 'Metalloproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', '*Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2003/12/04 05:00,2004/01/17 05:00,['2003/12/04 05:00'],"['2003/12/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.23.24.9003-9013.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2003 Dec;23(24):9003-13. doi: 10.1128/MCB.23.24.9003-9013.2003.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,PMC309712,,,,,

Traditionally, its transformation capacity in vivo is attributed to its role in translation initiation in the cytoplasm. Here, we demonstrate that elevated eIF4E impedes granulocytic and monocytic differentiation. Our subsequent mutagenesis studies indicate that this block is a result of dysregulated eIF4E-dependent mRNA transport. These studies indicate that the RNA transport function of eIF4E could contribute to leukemogenesis. We extended our studies to provide the first evidence that the nuclear transport function of eIF4E contributes to human malignancy, specifically in a subset of acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia patients. We observe an increase in eIF4E-dependent cyclin D1 mRNA transport and a concomitant increase in cyclin D1 protein levels. The aberrant nuclear function of eIF4E is due to abnormally large eIF4E bodies and the loss of regulation by the proline-rich homeodomain PRH. We developed a novel tool to modulate this transport activity. The introduction of IkappaB, the repressor of NF-kappaB, leads to suppression of eIF4E, elevation of PRH, reorganization of eIF4E nuclear bodies, and subsequent downregulation of eIF4E-dependent mRNA transport. Thus, our findings indicate that this nuclear function of eIF4E can contribute to leukemogenesis by promoting growth and by impeding differentiation.","['Topisirovic, Ivan', 'Guzman, Monica L', 'McConnell, Melanie J', 'Licht, Jonathan D', 'Culjkovic, Biljana', 'Neering, Sarah J', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'Borden, Katherine L B']","['Topisirovic I', 'Guzman ML', 'McConnell MJ', 'Licht JD', 'Culjkovic B', 'Neering SJ', 'Jordan CT', 'Borden KL']","['Structural Biology Program, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York University, One Gustave Levy Place, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, myc', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors']",2003/12/03 05:00,2004/01/17 05:00,['2003/12/03 05:00'],"['2003/12/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.23.24.8992-9002.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2003 Dec;23(24):8992-9002. doi: 10.1128/MCB.23.24.8992-9002.2003.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (HHEX protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",,,,"['CA 80728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 90446/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 88991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA088991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA080728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1S10 RR 09145-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090446/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC309660,,,,,

However, the prognostic impact of qualitative MRD detection is still under debate. In this study, the prognostic value of MRD quantification in patients with CBF leukemias was assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We quantified MRD at various time points during and after therapy by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for AML1/MTG8 and CBFB/MYH11 in 37 patients with CBF leukemias treated within a multicenter trial. RESULTS: At initial diagnosis, the patients showed a heterogenous fusion gene expression relative to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase with a variation of more than two log steps. According to MRD status during/after therapy, two groups of patients were separated. Of the 26 patients who had MRD levels of less than 1% in relation to initial diagnosis at all time points tested after induction chemotherapy, only two experienced relapse after a median follow-up of 19 months. Of the 11 patients who had a sample with an MRD level >/= 1% at least at one time point after induction therapy, 10 experienced relapse, with a median remission duration of 10 months (P <.001). The median interval between the informative MRD sample and clinical relapse in these patients was 3 months.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Survivors of childhood ALL (ages 18 to 33 years at study entry) participated in a structured telephone interview eliciting demographic, health, and behavioral data and the POMS. Treatment data included total dose of CNS irradiation (CRT) and intrathecal methotrexate (MTX) obtained from medical records. RESULTS: Mood disturbance was reported by 24% of survivors. High-dose CRT and MTX predicted disturbance rates modestly and primarily in combination with education variables. Interactions between educational achievement, a history of attendance in special education classes, and sex were better predictors than treatment type or dose. Nonwhite males, those younger than 12.5 years of age at diagnosis, and those with negative perceptions of current health and cancer's impact on employment were also at greater risk for mood disturbance (P <.01 to.001). CONCLUSION: Although most survivors are doing well psychologically, a subset of long-term survivors show potentially serious mood disturbance. Mood disturbance seems to be a function of interactions between preexisting individual difference variables (eg, sex, race/ethnicity), treatment factors, and posttreatment educational experiences. Prevention strategies aimed at childhood cancer survivors at greatest risk for mood disturbance may be improved by focus on posttreatment psychosocial and educational supports.","['Glover, Dorie A', 'Byrne, Julianne', 'Mills, James L', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Nicholson, H Stacy', 'Meadows, Anna', 'Zeltzer, Lonnie K']","['Glover DA', 'Byrne J', 'Mills JL', 'Robison LL', 'Nicholson HS', 'Meadows A', 'Zeltzer LK']","['Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, Neuropsychiatric Institute, University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90024-175919, USA. nglover@ahs.llumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Behavior', 'Brain Diseases/*therapy', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*therapeutic use', 'Mood Disorders/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Stress, Psychological/etiology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/psychology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/12/03 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/12/03 05:00'],"['2003/12/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2003.04.089 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.04.089 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Dec 1;21(23):4395-401. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.04.089.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,"[""Children's Cancer Group""]",,"['P41 RR013642/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P41 RR013642-097342/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC1459335,,['NIHMS5601'],,,

The goals of this retrospective study were to determine whether these children could be treated successfully with a salvage regimen and to establish the optimal therapeutic strategy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the multicentric, prospective, Leucemie Aique Myeloide Enfant 89/91 protocol, 106 of the 308 children enrolled between 1988 and 1998 relapsed. Initial treatment after the first complete remission (CR1) had been allogenic HLA-identical bone marrow transplantation (BMT; n = 21) or chemotherapy (n = 85). Treatment procedures were scheduled according to the choice of each participating institution. RESULTS: When reinduction therapy was attempted, second complete remission (CR2) was obtained in 71% of patients (68 of 96 patients). BMT was performed in 53 (78%) of these 68 patients (autograft, mainly harvested in CR1, n = 25; matched sibling-donor BMT, n = 12; or alternative-donor BMT, n = 16). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate for all 106 patients was 33%, and the disease-free survival (DFS) rate for children in CR2 was 45%. Multivariate analysis of re-treated children showed that the 5-year OS was higher if the CR1 had been longer than 12 months compared with less than 12 months (54% v 24%, respectively; P =.001) and lower if maintenance therapy had been given after CR1 compared with chemotherapy without maintenance therapy or HLA-identical BMT (12% v 40% v 52%, respectively; P =.002). For patients attaining CR2, the 5-year DFS rate was not significantly different for matched sibling-donor BMT (60%), autograft (47%), or alternative-donor BMT (44%). CONCLUSION: After aggressive first-line therapy, one third of unselected, relapsing AML children could be cured. Further prospective trials are warranted to define the optimal reinduction regimen and megadose chemotherapy and to evaluate the late effects of these therapies.","['Aladjidi, Nathalie', 'Auvrignon, Anne', 'Leblanc, Thierry', 'Perel, Yves', 'Benard, Antoine', 'Bordigoni, Pierre', 'Gandemer, Virginie', 'Thuret, Isabelle', 'Dalle, Jean Hugues', 'Piguet, Christophe', 'Pautard, Brigitte', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Leverger, Guy']","['Aladjidi N', 'Auvrignon A', 'Leblanc T', 'Perel Y', 'Benard A', 'Bordigoni P', 'Gandemer V', 'Thuret I', 'Dalle JH', 'Piguet C', 'Pautard B', 'Baruchel A', 'Leverger G']","[""Unite d'Onco-Hematologie, Departement de Pediatrie, Hopital des Enfants, Groupe Hospitalier Pellegrin, Place Amelie-Raba Leon, 33076 Bordeaux, France. n_aladjidi@hotmail.com""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/12/04 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/12/04 05:00'],"['2003/12/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2003.11.066 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.11.066 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Dec 1;21(23):4377-85. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.11.066.,,,['French Society of Pediatric Hematology and Immunology'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Surgical resection has been the mainstay of therapy for localized transformed disease because these tumors are thought to be resistant to standard treatment. We report that chemotherapy has a role in selected patients with MT, determined by cell type. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Chemotherapy was administered to 12 patients with MT of GCT limited to a single cell type (two patients with primitive neuroectodermal tumors, five with undifferentiated RMS, one with anaplastic small-cell tumor, two with adenocarcinoma, and two with leukemia); 10 patients had measurable disease. GCT origin was confirmed by molecular cytogenetics in five patients. Each patient received chemotherapy regimens based on the specific malignant cell observed in the transformed histology. RESULTS: Seven patients with measurable disease achieved a partial response, with the duration of response ranging between 1 month and 7 years. Three of those patients are alive. Three patients did not respond to treatment, and all of those patients died as a result of their disease. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy for MT limited to a single cell type may result in major responses and long-term survival in selected patients. Local therapy after chemotherapy is an important component of treatment to achieve maximum response.","['Donadio, Alessia C', 'Motzer, Robert J', 'Bajorin, Dean F', 'Kantoff, Philip W', 'Sheinfeld, Joel', 'Houldsworth, Jane', 'Chaganti, Raju S K', 'Bosl, George J']","['Donadio AC', 'Motzer RJ', 'Bajorin DF', 'Kantoff PW', 'Sheinfeld J', 'Houldsworth J', 'Chaganti RS', 'Bosl GJ']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021, USA. boslg@mskcc.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Adult', 'Carcinoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/pathology', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cytogenetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive/drug therapy/pathology', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Teratoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/12/04 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/12/04 05:00'],"['2003/12/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2003.01.019 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.01.019 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Dec 1;21(23):4285-91. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.01.019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reliability of the MGB probes was compared with non-MGB probes in all 24 cases of ALL. RESULTS: Ten MGB probes (16 to 18 mers) were designed that enabled all the germline sequences on the database to be analysed, whereas the conventional non-MGB probes (21 to 27 mers) did not allow the analysis of four of the VH1 and five of the VH3 germline sequences. The sequencing results in five of the 24 cases of ALL were not matched to the non-MGB probes. CONCLUSIONS: MGB technology allows shorter probes to be designed, enabling MRD to be detected in childhood ALL.

Here we show that SIAH-1/2 binds and targets for proteasome-mediated degradation the putative tumor suppressor and tripartite motif (TRIM) family member PML, leading to the loss of its transcriptional co-activating properties and a reduction in the number of endogenous PML nuclear bodies. Association with PML requires the substrate-binding domain (SBD) of SIAH-1/2 through an interacting surface apparently distinct from those predicted by the structural studies, or shown experimentally to mediate binding to SIAH-associated factors. Within PML, the coiled-coil domain is required for Siah- and proteasome-mediated degradation, and deletions of regions critical for the integrity of this region impair the ability of Siah to trigger PML-RAR degradation. Fusion of the coiled-coil domain to heterologous proteins resulted in the capacity of mSiah-2 to target their degradation. All of the TRIM proteins tested were degraded upon mSiah-2 overexpression. Finally, we show that the fusion protein PML-RAR (that retains the coiled-coil domain), which causes acute promyelocytic leukemias, is also a potential substrate of mSiah-2. As a result of mSiah-2 overexpression and subsequent degradation of the fusion protein, the arrest in hematopoietic differentiation because of expression of PML-RAR is partially rescued. These results identify PML and other TRIMs as new factors post-translationally regulated by SIAH and involve the coiled-coil region of PML and of other SIAH substrates as a novel structural determinant for targeted degradation.","['Fanelli, Mirco', 'Fantozzi, Anna', 'De Luca, Pasquale', 'Caprodossi, Sara', 'Matsuzawa, Shu-ichi', 'Lazar, Mitchell A', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Minucci, Saverio']","['Fanelli M', 'Fantozzi A', 'De Luca P', 'Caprodossi S', 'Matsuzawa S', 'Lazar MA', 'Pelicci PG', 'Minucci S']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, 20141 Milan, Italy. mirco.fanelli@uniurb.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20031125,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Drosophila', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/metabolism/*physiology', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'U937 Cells', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2003/12/03 05:00,2004/03/31 05:00,['2003/12/03 05:00'],"['2003/12/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M306407200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)74866-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Feb 13;279(7):5374-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M306407200.

The ABL kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate, has been reported to induce apoptosis of BCR-ABL-positive cells in a caspase-dependent fashion. We investigated whether caspases alone were the mediators of imatinib mesylate-induced cell death. In contrast to previous reports, we found that a broad caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk, failed to prevent the death of imatinib mesylate-treated BCR-ABL-positive human leukemic cells. Moreover, zVAD-fmk-preincubated, imatinib mesylate-treated cells exhibited a necrosis-like morphology characterized by cellular pyknosis, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and the absence of nuclear signs of apoptosis. These cells manifested a loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, indicating the mitochondrial involvement in this caspase-independent necrosis. We excluded the participation of several mitochondrial factors possibly involved in caspase-independent cell death such as apoptosis-inducing factor, endonuclease G, and reactive oxygen species. However, we observed the mitochondrial release of the serine protease Omi/HtrA2 into the cytosol of the cells treated with imatinib mesylate or zVAD-fmk plus imatinib mesylate. Furthermore, serine protease inhibitors prevented the caspase-independent necrosis. Taken together, our results suggest that imatinib mesylate induces a caspase-independent, necrosis-like programmed cell death mediated by the serine protease activity of Omi/HtrA2.","['Okada, Masayuki', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Imai, Tsuyoshi', 'Watanabe, Ken-ichiro', 'Toyokuni, Shin-ya', 'Ueno, Masaki', 'Zervos, Antonis S', 'Kroemer, Guido', 'Nakahata, Tatsutoshi']","['Okada M', 'Adachi S', 'Imai T', 'Watanabe K', 'Toyokuni SY', 'Ueno M', 'Zervos AS', 'Kroemer G', 'Nakahata T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20031126,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor', 'Benzamides', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavoproteins/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'High-Temperature Requirement A Serine Peptidase 2', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Membrane Potentials/physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/physiology', 'Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Necrosis', 'Nucleosomes/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism']",2003/12/03 05:00,2004/04/16 05:00,['2003/12/03 05:00'],"['2003/12/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-05-1605 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50026-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Mar 15;103(6):2299-307. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-05-1605.

We conclude that in CCgRs the degree of MR may vary from 2 to more than 4 logs, and that there is a progressive decrease of transcript level by time.

Mutations in PTPN11 cause Noonan syndrome (NS), a developmental disorder characterized by cardiac and skeletal defects. NS is also associated with a spectrum of hematologic disorders, including juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). To test the hypothesis that PTPN11 mutations might contribute to myeloid leukemogenesis, we screened the entire coding region for mutations in 51 JMML specimens and in selected exons from 60 patients with other myeloid malignancies. Missense mutations in PTPN11 were detected in 16 of 49 JMML specimens from patients without NS, but they were less common in other myeloid malignancies. RAS, NF1, and PTPN11 mutations are largely mutually exclusive in JMML, which suggests that mutant SHP-2 proteins deregulate myeloid growth through Ras. However, although Ba/F3 cells engineered to express leukemia-associated SHP-2 proteins cells showed enhanced growth factor-independent survival, biochemical analysis failed to demonstrate hyperactivation of the Ras effectors extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) or Akt. We conclude that SHP-2 is an important cellular PTPase that is mutated in myeloid malignancies. Further investigation is required to clarify how these mutant proteins interact with Ras and other effectors to deregulate myeloid growth.","['Loh, Mignon L', 'Vattikuti, Shashaank', 'Schubbert, Suzanne', 'Reynolds, Melissa G', 'Carlson, Elaine', 'Lieuw, Kenneth H', 'Cheng, Jennifer W', 'Lee, Connie M', 'Stokoe, David', 'Bonifas, Jeannette M', 'Curtiss, Nicole P', 'Gotlib, Jason', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Emanuel, Peter D', 'Shannon, Kevin M']","['Loh ML', 'Vattikuti S', 'Schubbert S', 'Reynolds MG', 'Carlson E', 'Lieuw KH', 'Cheng JW', 'Lee CM', 'Stokoe D', 'Bonifas JM', 'Curtiss NP', 'Gotlib J', 'Meshinchi S', 'Le Beau MM', 'Emanuel PD', 'Shannon KM']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California, Rm HSE-302 Box 0519, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA. lohm@itsa.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20031126,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Neurofibromin 1/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",2003/12/03 05:00,2004/04/16 05:00,['2003/12/03 05:00'],"['2003/12/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-09-3287 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50029-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Mar 15;103(6):2325-31. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-09-3287.

We report that 2,3-dichloro-5,8-dihydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (DDN), a naphthoquinone analog, induces mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. DDN induced cytochrome c release, Bax translocation, cleavage of Bid and Bad, and activation of caspase-3, -8, -9 upon the induction of apoptosis. Cleavage of Bid, the caspase-8 substrate, was inhibited by the broad caspase inhibitor z-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk), whereas cytochrome c release was not affected, suggesting that activation of caspase-8 and subsequent Bid cleavage occur downstream of cytochrome c release. DDN inhibited the activation of Akt detected by decreasing level of phosphorylation. Overexpression of constitutively active Akt protected cells from DDN-induced apoptosis, while dominant negative Akt moderately enhanced cell death. Furthermore, Akt prevented release of cytochrome c and cleavage of Bad in DDN-treated HL-60 cells. Taken together, DDN-induced apoptosis is associated with mitochondrial signaling which involves cytochrome c release via a mechanism inhibited by Akt.","['Kim, Hae Jong', 'Kang, Seung Koo', 'Mun, Jung Yee', 'Chun, Young Jin', 'Choi, Kyung Hee', 'Kim, Mie Young']","['Kim HJ', 'Kang SK', 'Mun JY', 'Chun YJ', 'Choi KH', 'Kim MY']","['Division of Biochemistry, College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 156-756, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Naphthoquinones/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein', 'cdc25 Phosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2003/12/04 05:00,2004/01/14 05:00,['2003/12/04 05:00'],"['2003/12/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0014579303012389 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(03)01238-9 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2003 Dec 4;555(2):217-22. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(03)01238-9.,"['0 (2,3-dichloro-5,8-dihydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone)', '0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (cdc25 Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro induction of heat shock proteins after exposure of cell culture to carcinogenic compounds and their real mixtures.,105-16,"Heat shock proteins (hsp) are a highly conserved group of proteins that are synthesized as a response to different forms of stress (heat, toxic chemicals, diseases, non-physiological pH changes). Because of their high sensitivity to changes in the environment, these proteins were suggested as possible early biomarkers of exposure in ecotoxicological studies. The purpose of the present study was to check the suitability of hsp 32 and hsp70 as biomarkers of in vitro exposure to environmentally relevant carcinogens: polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), their nitro-derivates, aromatic amines, acrylonitrile (ACN) and the mixture of organic compounds adsorbed onto ambient airborne particles (extractable organic matter, EOM). The expression of hsp 32 and hsp70 was studied in human diploid lung fibroblasts (HEL cells) and human monocytic leukaemia cells (THP-1 cells) incubated in vitro with different concentrations of dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DB[a,l]P), 1-nitropyrene, (NP), 4-aminobiphenyl (ABP), ACN and EOM for different periods of time. The incubation of cells with DB[a,l]P, NP, ABP and EOM did not result in increased levels of hsp 32 or hsp70, either in dose- or time-dependent manner. ACN induced the expression of hsp 32 as well as hsp70 in HEL and THP-1 cells, which probably reflects its ability to induce oxidative stress.

However, tumor incidences were 100-fold higher than those of ordinary mouse mutations and there were apparent strain differences in the types of induced tumors. In human, higher risk of leukemia is reported in the children of fathers who had been exposed to radionuclides at the nuclear reprocessing plants or to diagnostic doses of radiation. However, these findings in mice and men have not been confirmed in the children of atomic bomb survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Another important finding was that germ-line exposure was very weakly tumorigenic by itself. However, the transmissible alterations caused persistent hypersensitivity to tumor induction in the offspring, e.g. enhanced by postnatal treatment with tumor promoting/carcinogenic agents. The above results suggest that transmissible alterations might be imprinted in germ cells for the future development of cancer by the postnatal environment. Many gene loci concerning immunological, biochemical and physiological function might be involved, and the cumulative changes in such genes may slightly elevate or enhance tumor incidences, although mutations of tumor suppressor genes such as p53 were also detected in some offspring and genomic instability may modify tumor occurrence in transgenerational manner.

The major diseases confronting children are now chronic and disabling conditions termed the ""new pediatric morbidity""-asthma, leukemia and brain cancer, neurodevelopmental dysfunction and neurobehavioral abnormality, reproductive and systemic developmental problems. Chemical toxicants in the environment, poverty, and little or no access to health care are all factors contributing to life-threatening pediatric diseases; children are uniquely vulnerable to chemical toxicants because of their disproportionately heavy exposures and their inherent biological growth and development. Genetic susceptibility and environmental exposures during vulnerable periods of development are also important contributors to the etiologies of many diseases of childhood. It is vital that we develop a better understanding of the mechanisms and interactions between nutrition, infectious disease, environmental exposures, and genetic predisposition in order to develop better prevention methods.

Differential expression of Bcl-2 proteins, which participate in apoptosis regulation, may be responsible for the dysbalanced apoptosis seen in neutrophils from septic patients. In this study, expression of Mcl-1, Bid, Bcl-2, and Bax were investigated in septic neutrophils. STUDY DESIGN: PMN (1 x 10(6)/mL) from septic patients (n = 16) or healthy volunteers (n = 10) were incubated with either lipopolysaccharide (1 microg/mL), agonistic CD95 antibody (100 ng/mL), or medium for 16 hours. Apoptosis was quantified in FACS after propidium iodine staining. Mcl-1, Bid, Bcl-2, and Bax mRNA expression was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and protein determined by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Spontaneous apoptosis was significantly reduced in PMN from septic patients (28.8% versus 64.0% in controls). Mcl-1 protein levels decreased in patients after 16 hours but remained stable in controls. Mcl-1 mRNA was found in freshly isolated PMN from controls and patients but remained elevated only in patients. Bid protein level decreased significantly in control PMN undergoing apoptosis but differences were less prominent in septic patients. Bid mRNA was detected only in freshly isolated PMN. No Bcl-2 mRNA or protein was detected in neutrophils from patients or controls, and detectable Bax protein and mRNA levels remained unchanged in all samples. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations of Bid and Mcl-1 protein in neutrophils may reflect the level of apoptosis. The upregulation of Mcl-1 mRNA in patients with sepsis suggests an active role for Mcl-1 in regulation of apoptosis during sepsis; Bax remains unchanged.","['Harter, Luc', 'Mica, Ladislav', 'Stocker, Reto', 'Trentz, Otmar', 'Keel, Marius']","['Harter L', 'Mica L', 'Stocker R', 'Trentz O', 'Keel M']","['Division of Trauma Surgery, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Am Coll Surg,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,9431305,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression/*genetics', 'Genes, bcl-2/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neutrophils/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2003/12/04 05:00,2004/01/07 05:00,['2003/12/04 05:00'],"['2003/12/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1072-7515(03)00904-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2003.07.008 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Coll Surg. 2003 Dec;197(6):964-73. doi: 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2003.07.008.,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute promyelocytic leukemia is caused by chromosomal translocations, which in the large majority of cases generate the prototypic promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic-acid receptor alpha (PML-RARalpha) an oncogenic fusion protein formed from the retinoic-acid receptor alpha and the so-called PML protein. The fusion protein leads to the deregulation of wild type PML and RARalpha function, thus inducing the differentiation block and an altered survival capacity of promyelocytes of affected patients. A plethora of studies have revealed molecular details that account for the oncogenic properties of acute promyelocytic leukemia fusion proteins and the events that contribute to the therapy-induced differentiation and apoptosis of patients' blasts. Illustrating the beneficial mechanisms of action of retinoids for acute promyelocytic leukemia patients this review goes on to discuss a plethora of recently recognized molecular paradigms by which retinoids and rexinoids, alone or in combination with other compounds, regulate growth, differentiation and apoptosis also in non-acute promyelocytic leukemia cells, highlighting their potential as drugs for cancer therapy and prevention.","['Altucci, Lucia', 'Wilhelm, Emmanuelle', 'Gronemeyer, Hinrich']","['Altucci L', 'Wilhelm E', 'Gronemeyer H']","['Seconda Universita degli studi di Napoli, Dipartimento di Patologia Generale, vico L.

Such problems have been solved in the past by means of unsupervised learning methods (hierarchical clustering, self-organizing maps, k-mean clustering, etc.) and supervised learning methods (weighted voting approach, k-nearest neighbor method, support vector machine method, etc.). Such problems can also be posed as optimization problems of minimizing gene subset size to achieve reliable and accurate classification. The main difficulties in solving the resulting optimization problem are the availability of only a few samples compared to the number of genes in the samples and the exorbitantly large search space of solutions. Although there exist a few applications of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for this task, here we treat the problem as a multiobjective optimization problem of minimizing the gene subset size and minimizing the number of misclassified samples. Moreover, for a more reliable classification, we consider multiple training sets in evaluating a classifier. Contrary to the past studies, the use of a multiobjective EA (NSGA-II) has enabled us to discover a smaller gene subset size (such as four or five) to correctly classify 100% or near 100% samples for three cancer samples (Leukemia, Lymphoma, and Colon). We have also extended the NSGA-II to obtain multiple non-dominated solutions discovering as much as 352 different three-gene combinations providing a 100% correct classification to the Leukemia data. In order to have further confidence in the identification task, we have also introduced a prediction strength threshold for determining a sample's belonging to one class or the other. All simulation results show consistent gene subset identifications on three disease samples and exhibit the flexibilities and efficacies in using a multiobjective EA for the gene subset identification task.","['Deb, Kalyanmoy', 'Raji Reddy, A']","['Deb K', 'Raji Reddy A']","['Kanpur Genetic Algorithms Laboratory (KanGAL), Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur 208 016, India. deb@iitk.ac.in']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",,Ireland,Biosystems,Bio Systems,0430773,IM,"['*Algorithms', '*Cluster Analysis', 'Colonic Neoplasms/classification/diagnosis/genetics', 'Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genetic Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymphoma/classification/diagnosis/genetics', 'Neoplasms/classification/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Alignment/methods', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods']",2003/12/04 05:00,2004/07/28 05:00,['2003/12/04 05:00'],"['2003/12/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0303264703001382 [pii]', '10.1016/s0303-2647(03)00138-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biosystems. 2003 Nov;72(1-2):111-29. doi: 10.1016/s0303-2647(03)00138-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coincubation of the stimulated cells with genistein or daidzein had no effect on the respiratory burst. Medium from stimulated cells in the presence of the isoflavones and NO(2)(-) increased the inhibition of copper-induced LDL oxidation. Mass spectrometry analysis of this medium revealed that monochlorinated, dichlorinated, and nitrated isoflavones, formed through a myeloperoxidase-dependent mechanism, were present. The consumption of genistein in the presence of cells was both extensive and rapid with > 95% of the genistein converted to either the chlorinated or nitrated metabolites within 30 min. Chemically synthesized 3'-chlorogenistein and 3'-chlorodaidzein increased the inhibition of LDL oxidation by approximately 4-fold and 2-fold over genistein and daidzein, respectively.

In fludarabine group, engraftment was observed in 87.5% (14/16) patients with complete donor chimerism, graft failure was 12.5% (2/16) and in no fludarabine group, 80% (16/20) and 20% (4/20), respectively. The incidence of acute GVHD (grade I - IV) was 27.8% (10/36) and chronic GVHD 22.2% (8/36). In fludarabine group, grade I - II aGVHD was 37.5%, in no fludarabine group, 20%. cGVHD was 12.5% in fludarabine group and in no fludarabine group 30%, respectively. Interstitial pneumonia (IP) was observed in 16.7% (6/36) of the patients, being 18.7% (3/16) and 15% (3/20) in fludarabine and no fludarabine group, respectively. Overall survival rate was 80.5% (29/36) with a median follow-up of 13 months. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference between fludarabine based (n = 16) and non-fludarabine based conditioning regimen (n = 20) in NAST for the treatment of hematological diseases, regarding for incidence of GVHD, IP, engraftment and survival.","['Guo, Mei', 'Yu, Chang-lin', 'Wang, Dan-hong', 'Qiao, Jian-hui', 'Sun, Wan-jun', 'Shi, Bao-fu', 'Zhang, Shi', 'Sun, Qi-yun', 'Yao, Bo', 'Ai, Hui-sheng']","['Guo M', 'Yu CL', 'Wang DH', 'Qiao JH', 'Sun WJ', 'Shi BF', 'Zhang S', 'Sun QY', 'Yao B', 'Ai HS']","['Affiliated Hospital, Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing 100039, China.']",['chi'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Diseases/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/administration & dosage', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",2003/12/04 05:00,2007/05/23 09:00,['2003/12/04 05:00'],"['2003/12/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2003 Aug;24(8):413-5.,"['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The murine leukemia/lymphoma models were established by inoculating female C57BL/6 mice (H-2b) with 10(5) EL4 cells/mouse through caudal vein. Donors of BM grafts were C57BL/6 male mice. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) were transfected with sFas or EGFP by adenovirus (adsFas or adEGFP) 24 hours before BMT (group D or E). The following three groups were set simultaneously: group A, no BMMCs transplanted; group B, BMMCs transplanted with no adenoviruses transfection; group C, EL4 cells transfusion only. Hematopoietic reconstitution, generation of leukemia/lymphoma and the survival rate were observed in all the groups after BMT. RESULTS: The spleen indices examined 11 days after BMT were not obviously different among group B, D and E (P > 0.05), but in group A were significantly lower than those in the groups B, D, E (P < 0.01). The leukocyte and platelet counts on day 30 after BMT were recovered in group B and D, but were very low in group C and E. The Y-chromosomes appeared 2 months after BMT. Bone marrow pictures in group B and D were almost normal, but in group C and E had plenty of lymphoblast-like tumor cells. Tumors were obviously revealed in the mice of group C and E by histopathology examination, but did not in group B and D. The survival rate was 0 in group A, 100% in group B and D, 12.5% in group C and 6.25% in group E. Compared with that in group E, the survival was significantly increased in the sFas group (P < 0.01).

METHODS: Blood serum arsenic concentrations of thirty APL patients were determined at 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, and 24 hours after As(2)O(3) injection using atomic fluorophotometry. Cardiac functions were measured simultaneously using a 12-lead body-surface electrocardiogram (ECG). Q-T intervals were manually measured, and then corrected using Bazett's formula (QTc). QT dispersion (QTd) was also calculated. In order to assess the effects of arsenic on the symptoms of anemia, twenty-four anemia patients were divided into two groups on the basis hemoglobin concentration: Group 1 (Hb > or = 90 g/L), and Group 2 (60 g/L < or = Hb < 90 g/L). QTc and QTd of these patients were also manually measured. RESULTS: All QT intervals of APL patients treated with As(2)O(3) injection were prolonged [32.2 ms (27, 41 ms); P < 0.05], but the changes of QTd were not prominent [3 ms (-8, 7 ms), P > 0.05]. There was a delay of 2 hours in maximum QTc following peaks in serum arsenic concentration. Changes in QTc and QTd of the two anemic groups were not prominent. CONCLUSIONS: As(2)O(3) can prolong QTc intervals in APL patients, but the effects are delayed compared to peak serum arsenic concentrations. As(2)O(3) has no prolongation effect on QTd.

METHODS: DCs generated from bone marrow culture in vitro in the presence of combined cytokines were pulsed with cellular total RNA isolated from cultured L615 cells by cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyloxy-3-(trimethylammonium) propane (DOTAP). T-cell responses were evaluated by in vitro proliferation, and cytotoxicity assay. And in vivo immune protection and prognosis of mice with leukemia were studied. RESULTS: DCs pulsed with total RNA isolated from cultured L615 cells (DCs/RNA) were remarkably effective in stimulating L615-specific T-cell response in vitro, but did not cross-react with other leukemia cells from syngeneic mice. Vaccination of naive mice with viable DCs/RNA vaccine was able to partly protect from challenge with a lethal dose of live L615 cells, leading to low leukemia incidence and overall survival prolongation. Statistically significant survival was also observed in a low lethal dose of L615-bearing mice that received treatment using viable DCs/RNA vaccine alone, suggesting that systemic administration of IL-2 could enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of leukemia RNA/DCs vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the use of DCs/RNA vaccine as a feasible and effective route to elicit leukemia immunity against unidentified leukemia-associated antigens for treatment of leukemia-bearing animals.","['Li, Mu', 'You, Shengguo', 'Ge, Wei', 'Ma, Shuang', 'Ma, Nan', 'Zhao, Chunhua']","['Li M', 'You S', 'Ge W', 'Ma S', 'Ma N', 'Zhao C']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,"['Animals', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/12/04 05:00,2004/02/28 05:00,['2003/12/04 05:00'],"['2003/12/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2003 Nov;116(11):1655-61.,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: ES cells of BALB/c mice were cultured and maintained undifferentiated in gelatin-coated dishes in Dubecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 1 000 U/L leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Then, the ES cells were cultured in DMEM without LIF so as to develop into embryonic bodies (EBs). For directional differentiating, EBs were put into 24-well tissue culture dish and differentiate into cells with different forms. On day 7 to day 11 acid fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) with terminal concentration of 100 ng/ml was added, and on day 11 to day 15 hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) terminal concentration of 20 ng/ml was added. EBs in culture without growth factor was used as controls. The development and differentiation status was observed by inversion microscope dynamically. The concentrations of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and albumin (ALB) in the supernatants were determined by radioimmunoassay on the 1st to 15th day since the ES cells were inoculated. Immunocytochemistry (ICC) was used to detect the expression of hepatic proteins such as AFP, ALB, cytokeratin 8 (CK8) and cytokeratin 18 (CK18) in the cells on the days 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. The number of ALB positive cells was counted. The ALB positive rate was calculated as the differentiation ratio of hepatic cells. RESULTS: ES cells remained undifferentiated and grew to ES clones in the DMEM containing LIF and developed to EBs in the medium without LIF. AFP was detected firstly in the medium on day 8 with a concentration of 3.4 ng/ml and the concentration increased to be 22.8 ng/ml at day 15; ALB was detected firstly in the medium on day 11 with a concentration of 0.2 microg/ml and the concentration increased to be 2.2 microg/ml on day15. ICC showed that AFP, ALB, CK8, and CK18 began to be expressed on day 8, day 10, day 10, and day 11 respectively. The ICC-positive cells have the ultrastructures consistent with those of the normal mouse hepatocytes. The ratio of hepatic differentiation was 30%.

METHODS: 31 patients with APL, 27 in first complete remission (CR1), 3 in CR2, and 1 in partial remission (PR) after the second relapse, were treated with autologous transplantation of ABM. The conditioning regimens included MACC protocol (Melphalan, Ara-C, CTX, and CCNU) in 26 patients and TBI + CY protocol in 5 patients. The PML/RARa fusion gene was measured by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis model was used to estimate the disease-free survival (DFS) rate at 5 years post-transplantation and COX regression model was used to analyze the DFS-influencing factors, including sex, PML/RARa positive state, pre-transplantation state (CR1, CR2, or PR), white blood cell (WBC) count, and platelet (PBC) count. RESULTS: The 27 patients in CR1 had a DFS time of 3 to 113 months (with a mean DFS time of 46 months), and a 5-year DFS rate of 100%; none of them suffered a relapse after transplantation. One of the 3 patients in CR2 relapsed in 19 months after the transplantation and the other two patients had been in DFS state for 7 and 33 months respectively. The patient in PR obtained CR and relapsed 8 months after the transplantation. All the patients showed reconstitution of hematopoiesis. None of the patients died of transplantation-related complication. Multivariate analysis showed that long-term survival was correlated with the pre-transplantation statues and not with sex, positivity of PML/RARa, and WBC and PBC counts. CONCLUSION: Autologous transplantation of ABM reduces the relapse and increases the long-term survival in the patients with APL in CR, especially in CR1.","['Liu, Qi-fa', 'Sun, Jing', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Liu, Xiao-li', 'Xu, Bing', 'Xu, Dan', 'Feng, Ru', 'Meng, Fan-yi', 'Song, Lan-lin', 'Zhou, Shu-yun']","['Liu QF', 'Sun J', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu XL', 'Xu B', 'Xu D', 'Feng R', 'Meng FY', 'Song LL', 'Zhou SY']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, First Military Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2003/12/03 05:00,2004/02/18 05:00,['2003/12/03 05:00'],"['2003/12/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2003 Sep 25;83(18):1561-4.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Direct DNA sequencing was applied to detect the genotype polymorphism in 85 healthy children as the control group and 120 children with acute leukemia. The distribution difference of the genotypes between them was analyzed. RESULTS: Gene mutation rate of GST-Pi exon5 was 47.5% in children with acute leukemia, significantly higher than that of 31.8% in the control group (OR = 1.944, 95% CI 1.088-3.473), and this polymorphism distribution pattern was similar to that reported abroad. The mutation rate was much higher in ALL group than in others groups and was not significantly between the AML children and the control group. The overall mutation rate of B-lineage ALL (60.3%) was markedly higher than that of T-ALL (47.1%), but the homozygous mutation rate of the latter group (17.6%) was much higher than that of the former group (3.4%) (P < 0.05). The average survival time of the children with wild type exon5 was 24 months, longer than that of the mutation group (17.6 months), however with no statistical difference (P > 0.05). The genotype of exon5 had no effect on the survival time of AML children. No Ala(114)Val variant genotype of GST-Pi exon6 reported in literatures was found in this study, but two new mutant genotypes were discovered. A/G hybridity at 99 loci of exon6 was found in one healthy child and such hybrid genotype did not result in amino acid alteration. G-->T/G bases hybridity at 103 loci of exon6 occurred in two children with leukemia, leading to GAC of Asp (aspartic acid) replaced by TAC of Try (tyrosine) at 147 loci of the protein peptide chain, producing Asp(147) Try hybrid mutation with a genotypic frequency of 1.7%. CONCLUSION: The gene mutation of GST-Pi exon5 is one of the potential vulnerable factors in leukemogenesis of the Chinese children and the genetic polymorphism of exon6 in Chinese is greatly different from that in other races. The role of the newly discovered variant genotype Asp(147) Try in leukemogenesis remains to be further studied.","['Yuan, Xiao-jun', 'Gu, Long-jun', 'Xue, Hui-liang', 'Tang, Jing-yan', 'Zhao, Jin-cai', 'Chen, Jing', 'Wang, Yao-ping', 'Chen, Jing', 'Pan, Ci', 'Song, De-lian']","['Yuan XJ', 'Gu LJ', 'Xue HL', 'Tang JY', 'Zhao JC', 'Chen J', 'Wang YP', 'Chen J', 'Pan C', 'Song DL']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, Shanghai 200127, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",2003/12/03 05:00,2004/04/09 05:00,['2003/12/03 05:00'],"['2003/12/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2003 Nov 10;83(21):1863-6.,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She developed severe TRALI after the second transfusion. RESULTS: The recipient's serum was reactive with immobilized HLA class I antigens from donor cells in a glycoprotein-specific assay. With an absorption-elution technique, at least anti-HLA-A2 could be identified as one of the donor-reactive antibodies in the recipient's serum. CONCLUSION: Granulocyte-reactive antibodies are associated with TRALI in an alloimmunized patient receiving granulocyte transfusions. Performing a cross-match procedure may be helpful in preventing severe pulmonary reactions.

Its role as a risk factor for TA-GVHD in patients without underlying leukemia or lymphoma is uncertain. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A 42-year-old female with refractory lupus nephritis received three monthly cycles of fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day on Days 1-3) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 on Day 1). Three months after the last dose of fludarabine, she received 2 units of packed RBCs and 6 units of pooled random platelets, none of which were irradiated. Two weeks later, fever, rash, aminotransferase elevations, hyperbilirubinemia, and pancytopenia developed. RESULTS: Marrow biopsy showed severe aplasia and skin biopsy was consistent with GVHD. Allele-level HLA typing on circulating lymphocytes revealed extra HLA alleles not present in her pretreatment sample, but identical to the HLA haplotypes of an unrelated platelet donor. Treatment with antithymocyte globulin, cyclosporine, and prednisone was followed by preparatory conditioning for a PBPC transplant from an HLA-identical sibling, but the patient died of disseminated candidiasis before transplant. CONCLUSIONS: Fludarabine and other purine analogs are increasingly used in the treatment of disorders other than hematologic malignancy, such as autoimmune disease. The occurence of TA-GVHD after fludarabine therapy in a patient with lupus strongly suggests that this drug is sufficiently immunoablative to be an independent risk factor for TA-GVHD. Irradiation of blood components should be considered in all patients who receive fludarabine therapy.","['Leitman, Susan F', 'Tisdale, John F', 'Bolan, Charles D', 'Popovsky, Mark A', 'Klippel, John H', 'Balow, James E', 'Boumpas, Dimitrios T', 'Illei, Gabor G']","['Leitman SF', 'Tisdale JF', 'Bolan CD', 'Popovsky MA', 'Klippel JH', 'Balow JE', 'Boumpas DT', 'Illei GG']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine, National Institute of Muscuoloskeletal and Skin Disease, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. sleitman@mail.cc.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['Adult', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion/*adverse effects', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*adverse effects', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*drug therapy', 'Platelet Transfusion/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Vidarabine/*adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives']",2003/12/03 05:00,2004/01/08 05:00,['2003/12/03 05:00'],"['2003/12/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['579 [pii]', '10.1046/j.0041-1132.2003.00579.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2003 Dec;43(12):1667-71. doi: 10.1046/j.0041-1132.2003.00579.x.,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,"['Transfusion. 2003 Dec;43(12):1652-4.

Leukemia K562/R7 cells and sarcoma MES-SA/Dx5 cells expressing high levels of the MDR1 (ABCB1) gene were resistant to IDA (42-fold and 150-fold, respectively). In both of these cell lines, resistance to IDA was equivalent to that for doxorubicin, the drug used to select for the MDR variants. The P-gp inhibitor PSC 833 (valspodar) at 2 microM completely restored sensitivity to IDA. IDA accumulation was decreased 12-fold in MES-SA/Dx5 cells vs parental cell line, and drug uptake was restored to control levels by PSC 833. Reduced intracellular IDA was correlated with P-gp content by flow cytometry.

METHOD: Retrospectively from 1968 to 1981 and prospectively from 1982 to 2002, the present authors collected data on every child with DS in Finland who had been diagnosed with leukaemia between 1968 and 1994. RESULTS: Forty-one children with DS had acute leukaemia: 28 had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL); and 13 had acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL). The median age of the subjects at diagnosis was 3.8 years (range = 0-15.9 years). Patients with ANLL were significantly younger (P = 0.001) and all patients under 2 years of age had ANLL. Out of the 28 patients with ALL, 23 (82%) entered primary remission, and of these 23 individuals, 10 remained alive and in continuous remission (CR) after a median of 11.6 years (range = 8.9-20.0 years). Out of the 13 patients with ANLL, five (38%) entered remission and four remained in CR after a median of 16.0 years (range = 9.1-19.2 years). Treatment -related toxicities were common: eight patients with ALL and two with ANLL died of septicaemia. Actuarial, event-free survival rates at 5 years were 53% and 43% for adequately treated subjects with ALL and ANLL, respectively.

The German ALL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster (BFM) study group is one of the largest cooperation for the treatment of childhood ALL. Between 1995 and 2000, 2021 children with ALL received chemotherapy according to the German BFM 95 protocols (ALL-BFM 95). This population was retrospectively screened, whether a lethal fungal infection occurred: totally, in this group, 43 of 2021 (2.1%) children died because of infections. Nine of 43 (21%) patients died in the context of an IFI: six fatal Aspergillus infections and three fatal yeast infections were reported. The following report will focus on the nine children with ALL who died from IFI. The underlying risk factors (RF) included neutropenia (seven of nine patients) and steroid medication (nine of nine patients). Seven of nine children had additional medical complications (e.g. liver failure, haemolytic uraemic syndrome and acute renal failure). In six of nine children the fungal infection was progressive despite intravenous antimycotic therapy, three patients received no antifungal therapy, as IFI was not considered.

Suppression of nucleotide glycation by glyoxalase I and aldehyde reductases and dehydrogenases, and base excision repair, protects and recovers DNA from damaging glycation. The effects of DNA glycation may be most marked in diabetes and uraemia. Mutations arising from DNA glycation may explain the link of non-dietary carbohydrate intake to incidence of colorectal cancer. Overexpression of glyoxalase I was found in drug-resistant tumour cells and may be an example of an undesirable effect of the enzymatic protection against DNA glycation. Experimental overexpression of glyoxalase I conferred resistance to drug-induced apoptosis. Glyoxalase I-mediated drug resistance was found in human leukaemia and lung carcinoma cells. Methylglyoxal-mediated glycation of DNA may contribute to the cytotoxicity of some antitumour agents as a consequence of depletion of NAD(+) by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, marked increases in triosephosphate concentration and increased formation of methylglyoxal. S - p -Bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester is a cell-permeable glyoxalase I inhibitor. It countered drug resistance and was a potent antitumour agent against lung and prostate carcinoma.

DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that can play an important role in the control of gene expression. DNA methylation at cytosine residues in gene promoter CpG sequences is known to inhibit gene transcription. Inappropriate inhibition of the transcription of tumour suppressor genes, genes that inhibit angiogenesis and metastasis and genes involved in DNA repair by uncontrolled methylation, can lead to unregulated growth and proliferation of a cell and carcinogenesis. Promoter hypermethylation affecting the p16 gene, resulting in gene silencing, has been shown to occur in many human solid tumours and a 'hypermethylation profile' in some leukaemias has been defined. The molecular mechanisms by which aberrant DNA methylation takes place during carcinogenesis are still not clear. However, the large number of target genes (involved in tumorigenesis) that are silenced by aberrant methylation suggests that inhibition of this process may have potential as cancer therapy. Decitabine (NSC-127716, Dacogen; SuperGen) is a potent and specific hypomethylating agent and an inhibitor of the DNA methyltransferase activity that mediates DNA methylation. Decitabine has been shown to have a broad range of antineoplastic activity in preclinical studies. This agent has exhibited significant activity in the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myeloid leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia, although clinical Phase I and II studies with solid tumours have not been very promising.

Patients injected with Thorotrast (thorium-232) during radiographic procedures, beginning in the 1930s, provide one such valuable opportunity. We evaluated site-specific cancer incidence and mortality among an international cohort of 3,042 patients injected during cerebral angiography with either Thorotrast (n = 1,650) or a nonradioactive agent (n = 1,392) and who survived 2 or more years. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for Thorotrast and comparison patients (Denmark and Sweden) were estimated and relative risks (RR), adjusted for population, age and sex, were generated with multivariate statistical modeling. For U.S. patients, comparable procedures were used to estimate standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and RR, representing the first evaluation of long-term, site-specific cancer mortality in this group. Compared with nonexposed patients, significantly increased risks in Thorotrast patients were observed for all incident cancers combined (RR = 3.4, 95% CI 2.9-4.1, n = 480, Denmark and Sweden) and for cancer mortality (RR = 4.0, 95% CI 2.5-6.7, n = 114, U.S.). Approximately 335 incident cancers were above expectation, with large excesses seen for cancers of the liver, bile ducts and gallbladder (55% or 185 excess cancers) and leukemias other than CLL (8% or 26 excess cancers). The RR of all incident cancers increased with time since angiography (P < 0.001) and was threefold at 40 or more years; significant excesses (SIR = 4.0) persisted for 50 years. Increasing cumulative dose of radiation was associated with an increasing risk of all incident cancers taken together and with cancers of the liver, gallbladder, and peritoneum and other digestive sites; similar findings were observed for U.S. cancer mortality. A marginally significant dose response was observed for the incidence of pancreas cancer (P = 0.05) but not for lung cancer. Our study confirms the relationship between Thorotrast and increased cancer incidence at sites of Thorotrast deposition and suggests a possible association with pancreas cancer. After injection with >20 ml Thorotrast, the cumulative excess risk of cancer incidence remained elevated for up to 50 years and approached 97%. Caution is needed in interpreting the excess risks observed for site-specific cancers, however, because of the potential bias associated with the selection of cohort participants, noncomparability with respect to the internal or external comparison groups, and confounding by indication. Nonetheless, the substantial risks associated with liver cancer and leukemia indicate that unique and prolonged exposure to alpha-particle-emitting Thorotrast increased carcinogenic risks.","['Travis, Lois B', 'Hauptmann, Michael', 'Gaul, Linda Knudson', 'Storm, Hans H', 'Goldman, Marlene B', 'Nyberg, Ullakarin', 'Berger, Eric', 'Janower, Murray L', 'Hall, Per', 'Monson, Richard R', 'Holm, Lars-Erik', 'Land, Charles E', 'Schottenfeld, David', 'Boice, John D Jr', 'Andersson, Michael']","['Travis LB', 'Hauptmann M', 'Gaul LK', 'Storm HH', 'Goldman MB', 'Nyberg U', 'Berger E', 'Janower ML', 'Hall P', 'Monson RR', 'Holm LE', 'Land CE', 'Schottenfeld D', 'Boice JD Jr', 'Andersson M']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cerebral Angiography/*adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Liver Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Thorium Dioxide/*adverse effects', 'Time Factors']",2003/12/04 05:00,2004/01/07 05:00,['2003/12/04 05:00'],"['2003/12/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['RR3095 [pii]', '10.1667/rr3095 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 2003 Dec;160(6):691-706. doi: 10.1667/rr3095.,['9XA7X17UQC (Thorium Dioxide)'],,,,"['N01-CP-21151/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP-21152/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP-33059/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N02-CP-81005/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

The major difficulties to developing this method into a widely applicable protocol derived from the need for a massive enrichment and the inadvertent, extensive binding of nonspecific proteins to the bait.

We also present rules for determining the precise number and order of selections. The approach and protocol allowed isolation of four, low-abundance transcription factors and repressors from 2 x 10(9) cultured leukemia cells. Captured proteins were 10-20,000-fold enriched from the nuclear extract, in a form and amounts that permitted facile MALDI-TOF and TOF/TOF MS-based protein identification. This is 1-2 orders of magnitude better than many previous efforts and in a fraction of the time (approximately 1 factor/week).

The K(i) of the conjugate is 3.7 microM vs spermidine for the polyamine transporter. The conjugate is also at least 230 times more active in suppressing the growth of L1210 murine leukemia cells than is the parent ligand, decreases the activities of the polyamine biosynthetic enzymes ornithine decarboxylase and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, and upregulates spermidine-spermine N (1)-acetyltransferase. However, the effect on native polyamine pools is a moderate one. These findings are in keeping with the idea that polyamines can also serve as efficient vectors for the intracellular delivery of other iron chelators.","['Bergeron, Raymond J', 'McManis, James S', 'Franklin, April M', 'Yao, Hua', 'Weimar, William R']","['Bergeron RJ', 'McManis JS', 'Franklin AM', 'Yao H', 'Weimar WR']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32610-0485, USA. bergeron@mc.cop.ufl.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Acetyltransferases/biosynthesis', 'Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Ferric Compounds/*chemistry', 'Iron Chelating Agents/*chemistry', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/metabolism', 'Polyamines/*metabolism', 'Pyridones/*chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Spermine/analogs & derivatives/*chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2003/12/04 05:00,2004/01/17 05:00,['2003/12/04 05:00'],"['2003/12/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm0302694 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2003 Dec 4;46(25):5478-83. doi: 10.1021/jm0302694.,"['0 (1-(12-amino-4,9-diazadodecyl)-2-methyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridinone)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Ferric Compounds)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Pyridones)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.57 (diamine N-acetyltransferase)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'EC 4.1.1.50 (Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase)']",,,,['R01-DK49108/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective descriptive analysis of clinical and haematological data. SETTING: Departments of Haematology of tertiary referral centres and teaching hospitals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective clinical and haematological data were collected on 150 central Africans (90 Zimbabweans and 60 Malawians) using modern Coulter counters and standard up-to-date haematological procedures and the results analysed using predetermined criteria and the top-desk Scientific Calculator Model HP 48GX, Texas Instruments, USA. RESULTS: There were 150 CML patients studied. Males predominated in a ratio of 1:5:1. The youngest patient was 10 years and the oldest 77 years with a mean +/- s.d. of 38.9 +/- 14.7 years. The peak age incidence of 47.3% occurred between 21 to 40 years. The Ph chromosome was found in 19 of the 20 patients studied. Although complaints attributed to splenic enlargement were the most common symptoms, several unusual clinical features were encountered viz: hepatomegaly (26%), bleeding (12%), significant lymphadenopathy (11.3%), purpura (3.3%), skin infiltration (2.7%), cardiac failure (2.7%) and 14.7% were diagnosed incidentally. Symptoms such as fatigue, headaches and weight loss were associated with greater degrees of leucocytosis, severe to gross splenomegaly and lower haemoglobin levels. The severe to gross splenomegaly which occurred in 68(45.3%) suggests that patients in this part of the world seek medical advice rather late in the disease. The median survival times of 65,47 and 39 months respectively for alpha interferon, hydroxyurea and busulphan are in agreement with those of previous larger series from other parts of the world. CONCLUSIONS: The study has revealed that the presenting pattern of clinical and haematological features of CML is changing probably due to the advent of modern clinical practice coupled with increased physician density, greater awareness of disease among clinicians besides other reasons. However, optimal treatment is not possible for the majority of patients due to lack of chemotherapeutic agents and supportive care. RECOMMENDATION: Referral centres in African health systems should be equipped for better management of CML patients.","['Mukiibi, J M', 'Nyirenda, C M', 'Paul, B', 'Adewuyi, J O', 'Mzula, E L B', 'Malata, H N']","['Mukiibi JM', 'Nyirenda CM', 'Paul B', 'Adewuyi JO', 'Mzula EL', 'Malata HN']","['Department of Haematology, University of Malawi, College of Medicine, Private Bag 360, Chichiri, Blantyre 3, Malawi.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Kenya,East Afr Med J,East African medical journal,0372766,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/classification/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Malawi/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sex Distribution', 'Survival Analysis', 'Zimbabwe/epidemiology']",2003/12/03 05:00,2004/01/16 05:00,['2003/12/03 05:00'],"['2003/12/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.4314/eamj.v80i9.8744 [doi]'],ppublish,East Afr Med J. 2003 Sep;80(9):470-5. doi: 10.4314/eamj.v80i9.8744.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS/RESULTS: We report the case of a 20-year-old male suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia in complete remission after induction and maintenance treatment, who suffered a leukemic relapse in both testicles. Diagnosis was made by ultrasound and confirmed after bilateral testicular biopsies. The patient died due to fungal infection after new treatment with systemic chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to suspect the existence of leukemic cells within the testicles in patients with this disease, mainly acute lymphoblastic leukemia, who present with acute testicular symptoms. Testicular biopsy confirms the diagnosis. Treatment is systemic, with testicular radiation to eradicate the leukemic reservoir. Despite the achievement of local disease control, this situation worsens the prognosis.","['Llarena Ibarguren, Roberto', 'Lecumberri Castanos, David', 'Padilla Nieva, Jesus', 'Crespo Atin, Victor', 'Martin Bazaco, Jesus', 'Azurmendi Sastre, Victor', 'Eizaguirre Zarza, Beatriz', 'Pertusa Pena, Carlos']","['Llarena Ibarguren R', 'Lecumberri Castanos D', 'Padilla Nieva J', 'Crespo Atin V', 'Martin Bazaco J', 'Azurmendi Sastre V', 'Eizaguirre Zarza B', 'Pertusa Pena C']","['Servicio de Urologia Hospital de Cruces Pz. de Cruces s/n 48903 Baracaldo, Vizcaya, Espana.']",['spa'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Spain,Arch Esp Urol,Archivos espanoles de urologia,0064757,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', '*Leukemic Infiltration/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Mycoses/complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology/therapy', 'Testis/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Ultrasonography']",2003/12/03 05:00,2004/01/10 05:00,['2003/12/03 05:00'],"['2003/12/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Esp Urol. 2003 Oct;56(8):954-7.,,,,Infiltracion leucemica testicular.,,,,,,,,,,,

There is limited information, however, on the molecular pharmacological mechanisms of cantharidin on human cancer cells. We have used cDNA microarrays to identify gene expression changes in HL-60 promyeloid leukemia cells exposed to cantharidin. Cantharidin-treated cells not only decreased expression of genes coding for proteins involved in DNA replication (e.g., DNA polymerase delta), DNA repair (e.g., FANCG, ERCC), energy metabolism (e.g., isocitrate dehydrogenase alpha, ADP/ATP translocase), but also decreased expression of genes coding for proteins that have oncogenic activity (e.g., c-myc, GTPase) or show tumor-specific expression (e.g., phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase). In contrast, these treated cells overexpressed several genes that encode intracellular and secreted growth-inhibitory proteins (e.g., BTG2, MCP-3) as well as proapoptotic genes (e.g., ATL-derived PMA-responsive peptide). Our findings suggest that alterations in specific genes functionally related to cell proliferation or apoptosis may be responsible for cantharidin-mediated cytotoxicity. We also found that exposure of HL-60 cells to cantharidin resulted in the decreased expression of multidrug resistance-associated protein genes (e.g., ABCA3, MOAT-B), suggesting that cantharidin may be used as an oncotherapy sensitizer, and the increased expression of genes in modulating cytokine production and inflammatory response (e.g., NFIL-3, N-formylpeptide receptor), which may partly explain the stimulating effects on leukocytosis. Our data provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of cantharidin.","['Zhang, Jun-Ping', 'Ying, Kang', 'Xiao, Zhen-Yu', 'Zhou, Bin', 'Huang, Qing-Shan', 'Wu, Hong-Mei', 'Yin, Ming', 'Xie, Yi', 'Mao, Yu-Min', 'Rui, Yao-Cheng']","['Zhang JP', 'Ying K', 'Xiao ZY', 'Zhou B', 'Huang QS', 'Wu HM', 'Yin M', 'Xie Y', 'Mao YM', 'Rui YC']","[""Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Cantharidin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",2003/11/26 05:00,2004/01/09 05:00,['2003/11/26 05:00'],"['2003/11/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.11405 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2004 Jan 10;108(2):212-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.11405.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'IGL471WQ8P (Cantharidin)']",,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

Tropical habitats also have been subject to major ecologic changes in the last few decades, exposing humans to direct contact with these viruses and allowing hemorrhagic fevers due to new emergent viruses such as flaviviruses, filoviruses, arenaviruses, and hantaviruses to become major threats to public health. The collapse of eradication programs in many countries, as well as population increases and ecologic modifications, have led to the spread of dengue and yellow fever to large portions of the world owing to the dissemination of vectors, especially mosquitoes, with broad ecologic ranges. Viruses previously restricted to some geographic areas, such as Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, West Nile fever, and monkeypox are now affecting new countries and populations.

Bcr-Abl kinase attracted oncology researchers as a molecular target for CML therapy, and a variety of small Abl kinase inhibitors were synthesized. STI571 (imatinib mesylate) was produced by modification of 2-phenylaminopyrimidine, a core structure of protein kinase C inhibitor, to improve selectivity, stability, solubility, and bioavailability. STI571 competitively binds to the ATP binding site of Bcr-Abl kinase and inhibits Abl tyrosine kinase activity. STI571 showed significant efficacy in the clinical study with CML patients at all stages: chronic phase, accelerated phase, and blast crisis. More than 90% of the patients showed good hematologic response to STI571. STI571 is also a potent inhibitor of a receptor-type c-Kit tyrosine kinase. Therefore, STI571 was examined for therapeutic efficacy against malignant Gastro-Intestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST), which are mainly caused by aberrant expression of a mutated c-Kit that is constitutively active without binding of a ligand, stem cell factor (SCF). More than a half of the metastatic GIST patients enrolled in the clinical study responded to STI571. Thus, STI571 is now used as a therapeutic drug for both CML and GIST in more than 80 countries worldwide. Certain point mutations in the ATP binding site were found to be a cause of resistance to STI571 in both Bcr-Abl and c-Kit kinases. Therefore, it would be better to make a precise therapeutic strategy with STI571 based on the gene analysis data. It is also expected that it will be possible to design an inhibitor to overcome such resistance by using the structural information on the mutants.","['Nakajima, Motowo', 'Toga, Wakako']","['Nakajima M', 'Toga W']","['Novartis Pharma KK, Tsukuba Research Institute, Ibaraki, Japan. motowo.nakajima@pharma.novartis.com']",['jpn'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Nihon Yakurigaku Zasshi,Nihon yakurigaku zasshi.

This study was carried out to test the hypothesis that LIF and LIF receptor (LIFR) are involved in the renal epithelial regeneration after acute renal failure. First, the authors investigated the spatiotemporal expression of LIF and LIFR in fetal and adult rat kidney. In developing kidney, LIF was expressed in the ureteric buds and LIFR was located in nephrogenic mesenchyme and the ureteric buds; in adult kidney, LIF and LIFR expression was confined to the collecting ducts. Next, the authors examined the expression of LIF and LIFR during the recovery phase after ischemia-reperfusion injury. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that LIF mRNA expression was significantly increased from day 1 to day 7 after reperfusion and that LIFR mRNA was upregulated from day 4 to day 14. Histologic analysis demonstrated that the increased expression of LIF mRNA and protein was most marked in the outer medulla, especially in the S3 segment of the proximal tubules. To elucidate the mitogenic role of LIF in the regeneration process, cultured rat renal epithelial (NRK 52E) cells were subjected to ATP depletion (an in vitro model of acute renal failure), and LIF expression was found to be enhanced during recovery after ATP depletion. Blockade of endogenous LIF with a neutralizing antibody significantly reduced the cell number and DNA synthesis during the recovery period. These results suggest that LIF participates in the regeneration process after tubular injury.","['Yoshino, Jun', 'Monkawa, Toshiaki', 'Tsuji, Mihoko', 'Hayashi, Matsuhiko', 'Saruta, Takao']","['Yoshino J', 'Monkawa T', 'Tsuji M', 'Hayashi M', 'Saruta T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Am Soc Nephrol,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,9013836,IM,"['*Acute Kidney Injury', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/physiology', 'Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Interleukin-6/analysis/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Kidney/blood supply/chemistry', 'Kidney Tubules/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Cytokine/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', '*Regeneration', 'Reperfusion Injury/metabolism']",2003/11/26 05:00,2004/08/03 05:00,['2003/11/26 05:00'],"['2003/11/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.asn.0000101180.96787.02 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Soc Nephrol. 2003 Dec;14(12):3090-101. doi: 10.1097/01.asn.0000101180.96787.02.,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib mesylate (STI571, Gleevec), a therapeutically used inhibitor of Bcr-Abl, causes apoptosis of Bcr-Abl-positive cells. In the leukemia cell line K562, we observed spontaneous resistance to imatinib at very low frequencies when cells were exposed to the drug (1 micro M) for more than 4 weeks. Surprisingly, in the presence of erythropoietin (Epo), K562 cells were temporarily able to sustain proliferation in the presence of imatinib, and imatinib-resistant clones could be isolated with high frequencies. From such imatinib-resistant, Epo-dependent clones, sublines could be established that were resistant to imatinib in the absence of Epo. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity was inhibited by imatinib treatment but could be partially restored by Epo. Inhibition of MAP kinase or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase blocked the protective effect of Epo. The data suggest that K562 cells acquire factor dependency under imatinib/Epo treatment, allowing them to escape from imatinib-induced, immediate cell death. This pool of cells provides the basis for the outgrowth of imatinib-resistant clones of unlimited proliferative capacity. Thus, Epo, an endogenous regulator of hematopoiesis, promotes the development of resistance to imatinib.","['Kirschner, Karin M', 'Baltensperger, Kurt']","['Kirschner KM', 'Baltensperger K']","['Institute of Pharmacology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",2003/11/26 05:00,2004/08/13 05:00,['2003/11/26 05:00'],"['2003/11/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/26 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2003 Nov;1(13):970-80.,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the fragile histidine triad (FHIT) gene, a tumor suppressor gene encompassing the most active, common fragile site FRA3B, is frequently deleted in various cancers, we evaluated the expression of WWOX and FHIT in 74 cases of primary hematopoietic neoplasias and 20 leukemia cell lines. Aberration or absence of WWOX transcripts was detected in 51% of the primary cases and 55% of cell lines, and three WWOX nucleotide variants were detected among the leukemia cell lines. FHIT expression was absent or altered in 36% of the primary cases and 15% of cell lines. The occurrence of aberrant FHIT reverse transcription-PCR products correlated significantly with the occurrence of WWOX alterations. Wild-type transcripts of both genes were expressed in normal hematopoiesis along with a small fraction of short transcripts. A DNA blot study showed that WWOX and FHIT genes were deleted in 2 of 18 cases with primary acute leukemias; both genes were not expressed in the 2 cases. Furthermore, treatment of cells with a demethylating or histone acetylating agent in culture resulted in increased expression of WWOX and FHIT mRNA in leukemia cells. Conclusions are that WWOX expression is frequently altered or absent in hematopoietic disorders, often in association with FHIT alterations, and that alterations of these fragile genes may result not only from genomic deletions but also from epigenetic modifications associated with expression of fragility.","['Ishii, Hideshi', 'Vecchione, Andrea', 'Furukawa, Yutaka', 'Sutheesophon, Krittaya', 'Han, Shuang-Yin', 'Druck, Teresa', 'Kuroki, Tamotsu', 'Trapasso, Francesco', 'Nishimura, Miki', 'Saito, Yasushi', 'Ozawa, Keiya', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Huebner, Kay', 'Furukawa, Yusuke']","['Ishii H', 'Vecchione A', 'Furukawa Y', 'Sutheesophon K', 'Han SY', 'Druck T', 'Kuroki T', 'Trapasso F', 'Nishimura M', 'Saito Y', 'Ozawa K', 'Croce CM', 'Huebner K', 'Furukawa Y']","['Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan. hishii@ms.jichi.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Acid Anhydride Hydrolases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Complementary/chemistry/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oxidoreductases/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'U937 Cells', 'WW Domain-Containing Oxidoreductase']",2003/11/26 05:00,2004/08/13 05:00,['2003/11/26 05:00'],"['2003/11/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/26 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2003 Nov;1(13):940-7.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (fragile histidine triad protein)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (WW Domain-Containing Oxidoreductase)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (WWOX protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)']",,,,['P01 CA77738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The major causes are not known nor is there a detailed understanding about how the elusive origin(s) may relate to clinical expression, basic biological mechanisms, or pathogenesis. METHODS: Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione reductase (GRD), Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu-Zn SOD) activities, glutathione (GSH), nitric oxide (NO(*), and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations were measured in serum of patients with CLL and a healthy control group. RESULTS: Serum GSH-Px, Cu-Zn SOD activities, GSH concentration were lower in patients with CLL while serum NO(*) and MDA concentrations were higher in these patients compared with the control group. Serum GRD activity was not statistically significant in patients with CLL compared with the control. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the parameters on the basis of stages in these patients. Serum GSH concentration negatively correlated with serum MDA (r=30.63, p<0.05) and NO(*) concentrations (r=0.72, p<0.05) in patients with advanced stage (III+IV). However, no other correlation could be found among the parameters in healthy controls and patients with CLL CONCLUSIONS: There is significant changes in antioxidant defense system in CLL cases, which may lead to enhanced action of oxygen radical, resulting in lipid peroxidation.","['Bakan, Nuri', 'Taysi, Seyithan', 'Yilmaz, Omer', 'Bakan, Ebubekir', 'Kuskay, Sevinc', 'Uzun, Naim', 'Gundogdu, Mehmet']","['Bakan N', 'Taysi S', 'Yilmaz O', 'Bakan E', 'Kuskay S', 'Uzun N', 'Gundogdu M']","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical School, Ataturk University, 25240 Erzurum, Turkey. nuribakan@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Glutathione/*blood', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/*blood', 'Glutathione Reductase/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood', 'Male', 'Malondialdehyde/*blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitric Oxide/*blood', 'Superoxide Dismutase/*blood']",2003/11/26 05:00,2004/07/15 05:00,['2003/11/26 05:00'],"['2003/11/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0009898103004078 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cccn.2003.08.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 2003 Dec;338(1-2):143-9. doi: 10.1016/j.cccn.2003.08.013.,"['31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.8.1.7 (Glutathione Reductase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When Jurkat T cells were treated with thialysine (0.32-2.5 mM), apoptotic cell death along with several biochemical events such as mitochondrial cytochrome c release, caspase-9 activation, caspase-3 activation, degradation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, and DNA fragmentation was induced in a dose- and time-dependent manner. However, these thialysine-induced apoptotic events were significantly abrogated by an ectopic expression of Bcl-xL, which is known to block mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Decylubiquinone, a mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor, also suppressed thialysine-induced apoptotic events. Comparison of the thialysine-induced alterations in the cell cycle distribution between Jurkat T cells transfected with Bcl-xL gene (J/Bcl-xL) and Jurkat T cells transfected with vector (J/Neo) revealed that the apoptotic cells were mainly derived from the cells accumulated in S and G2/M phases following thialysine treatment. The interruption of cell cycle progression in the presence of thialysine was accompanied by a significant decline in the protein level of cdk4, cdk6, cdc2, cyclin A, cyclin B1, and cyclin E. These results demonstrate that the cytotoxic activity of thialysine toward Jurkat T cells is attributable to not only apoptotic cell death mediated by a mitochondria-dependent death signaling pathway, but also interruption of cell cycle progression by a massive down-regulation in the level of cdks and cyclins.","['Jun, Do Youn', 'Rue, Seok Woo', 'Han, Kyu Hyun', 'Taub, Dennis', 'Lee, Young Sup', 'Bae, Young Seuk', 'Kim, Young Ho']","['Jun DY', 'Rue SW', 'Han KH', 'Taub D', 'Lee YS', 'Bae YS', 'Kim YH']","['Laboratory of Immunobiology, Department of Microbiology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, 702-701 Taegu, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cysteine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia', 'Lysine/*chemistry', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/enzymology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein']",2003/11/26 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/11/26 05:00'],"['2003/11/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295203006749 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2003.08.030 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2003 Dec 15;66(12):2291-300. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2003.08.030.,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '2936-69-8 (S-2-aminoethyl cysteine)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In resistant cells cultivated in the absence or presence of vincristine, the RR layer is either reduced or absent. Consistently, resistant cells were found to be less sensitive to Concanavalin A (ConA). Moreover, differences in the amount and spectrum of glycoproteins interacting with ConA-Sepharose were demonstrated between sensitive and resistant cells. Finally, the content of glycogen in resistant cells is lower than in sensitive cells.

The induction of egr-1 correlated with a rapid ERK1/2 phosphorylation and was prevented with MEK1/2 inhibitors PD 98059 and UO126. The p38 inhibitor SB 203580 enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and egr-1 mRNA levels.

We have expressed conditional mutant of the Bcr-Abl PTK in the FDCP-Mix A4 multipotent haematopoietic cell line in order to examine the molecular mechanisms whereby Bcr-Abl PTK leads to enhanced cell survival under conditions in which normal cells die. Activation of Bcr-Abl PTK does not phosphorylate or activate either ERK-1/2 or JAK-2/STAT-5b, suggesting that these signal transduction pathways are not involved in Abl PTK-mediated suppression of apoptosis in FDCP-Mix cells. However, protein kinase C (PKC) does have a role to play. Inhibition of PKC results in a reversal of Bcr-Abl PTK-mediated survival in the absence of growth factor and Bcr-Abl stimulates translocation of the PKCbetaII isoform to the nucleus. Furthermore, expression of a constitutively activated PKCbetaII in haemopoietic progenitor FDCP-Mix cells stimulates enhanced cell survival when IL-3 is withdrawn. However, expression of this constitutively activated PKC isoform does not suppress cytotoxic drug-induced apoptosis. Thus Bcr-Abl PTK has pleiotropic effects which can suppress cell death induced by a number of stimuli.","['Xenaki, Dia', 'Pierce, Andrew', 'Underhill-Day, Nick', 'Whetton, Anthony D', 'Owen-Lynch, P Jane']","['Xenaki D', 'Pierce A', 'Underhill-Day N', 'Whetton AD', 'Owen-Lynch PJ']","['Biological Sciences, IENS, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Survival/*physiology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/deficiency/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C beta', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",2003/11/26 05:00,2004/08/03 05:00,['2003/11/26 05:00'],"['2003/11/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0898656803001013 [pii]', '10.1016/s0898-6568(03)00101-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2004 Feb;16(2):145-56. doi: 10.1016/s0898-6568(03)00101-3.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematologic disorders like chronic myelogeneous leukemia, promyelocytic leukemia, polycythemia vera and also the hypereosinophilic syndrome can result in elevated levels of cobalamin. Not surprisingly, a rise of the cobalamin concentration in serum is one of the diagnostic criteria for the latter two diseases. The increase in circulating cobalamin levels is predominantly caused by enhanced production of haptocorrin. Several liver diseases like acute hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic liver disease can also be accompanied by an increase in circulating cobalamin. This phenomenon is predominantly caused by cobalamin release during hepatic cytolysis and/or decreased cobalamin clearance by the affected liver. Altogether it can be concluded that an observed elevation of cobalamin in blood merits the a full diagnostic work up to assess the presence of disease.","['Ermens, A A M', 'Vlasveld, L T', 'Lindemans, J']","['Ermens AA', 'Vlasveld LT', 'Lindemans J']","['Clinical Laboratory, Amphia Hospital, lokatie Langendijk, Breda, Netherlands. aermens@amphia.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Biochem,Clinical biochemistry,0133660,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/physiology', 'Hematologic Diseases/blood', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Absorption/physiology', 'Vitamin B 12/*blood/chemistry']",2003/11/26 05:00,2004/09/21 05:00,['2003/11/26 05:00'],"['2003/11/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0009912003001383 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2003.08.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Biochem. 2003 Nov;36(8):585-90. doi: 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2003.08.004.,['P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)'],42,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there have been few reports on the invasion of multiple ocular lesions. We treated 1 unusual ATL patient with uveitis in whom multiple ocular invasions were suspected. CASE: A woman in whom ATL was diagnosed 10 years previously complained of blurred vision and decreased visual acuity in the right eye. Anterior uveitis of the right eye was suspected. One week later the cells increased in the anterior chamber, and fibrin exudates and hyphema appeared. She was admitted to our hospital. OBSERVATIONS: The visual acuity was 0.04 in the right eye and finger-counting from 30 cm in the left. She was treated with systemic steroid therapy. Inflammation disappeared, but both eyelids became swollen and multiple ocular lesions appeared. She was given carcinostatic therapy once more and the mass lesions decreased. Mass lesions appeared in the iris and in the bulbar conjunctiva. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) showed that the mass lesions extended to the right orbit and both nasal cavities. MRI also demonstrated choroidal thickening in the left eye.

Interferon (IFN) is one of the effective therapeutic agents with anti-viral and anti-tumor specific effects. The appearance of IFN antibodies in patients may limit the natural and the therapeutic effect by IFNs. In contrast to conventional ELISA techniques, we here report a simple biochip methodology that enables identification of antibodies against cytokines and peptides. The method takes advantage of a functionalized self-assembled monolayer modified by N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). To validate this surface, four human proteins: IFNalpha2b, leptin, growth hormone and human IgG, with molecular sizes ranging between 14 and 150 kDa, were used. A number of other parameters for protein assay conditions by array technology were evaluated concomitantly. Finally, 56 serum samples from patients treated with recombinant human IFNalpha2b were simultaneously tested on single chip. In these patients, 16.1% (9 of 56 cases) were positive for IFNalpha2b antibodies. All results were confirmed in an ELISA, specific for the identification of IFNalpha specific antibodies in human samples. The potential application of this protein biochip can be amplified rapidly and reliably to test not only IFNalpha2b, but also other cytokine specific antibodies.

To determine whether mutations in the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA1 are associated with leukemia, we assayed for alterations in the GATA1 gene in bone marrow samples from patients with various subtypes of acute leukemia. Here we summarize our findings that GATA1 is mutated in the leukemic blasts of patients with Down syndrome acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (DS-AMKL). We did not find mutations in GATA1 in leukemic cells of DS patients with other types of acute leukemia, or in other patients with AMKL who did not have DS. Furthermore, we did not detect GATA1 mutations in DNAs from over 75 other patients with acute leukemia or from 21 healthy individuals. Since the GATA1 mutations were restricted to DS-AMKL, we also investigated whether GATA1 was altered in the ""preleukemia"" of DS, transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD). TMD is a common myeloid disorder that affects 10% of DS newborns and evolves to AMKL in nearly 30% patients. We detected GATA1 mutations in TMD blasts from every infant examined.

The clinical features include the presence of isolated erythrocytosis, low erythropoietin (Epo) levels, normal hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve, hypersensitivity of erythroid progenitors to exogenous Epo in vitro and no progression to leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Less than 15% of PFCP families have an identifiable EPOR mutation. Abnormalities of other genes are therefore likely responsible for the phenotype of the majority PFCP patients. In this study we report a family segregating PFCP with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, where 7 of 14 members of the family were affected in four generations. This family was studied previously and an EPOR mutation was ruled out by sequencing and by genetic means. Here, we confirmed by linkage analysis that the disease phenotype was not linked to the Epo and EPOR genes. We then performed a genomewide screen with 410 polymorphic markers at average spacing 7.67 cM to locate the chromosomal region responsible for PFCP. We identified a region in 7q22.1-7q22.2 with a suggestive LOD score of 1.84, from our data this is the most likely location of a candidate region responsible for PFCP in this family.","['Jedlickova, Katerina', 'Stockton, David W', 'Prchal, Josef T']","['Jedlickova K', 'Stockton DW', 'Prchal JT']","['MS 525D Texas Medical Center, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,IM,"['Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'Erythropoietin/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lod Score', 'Male', 'Pedigree', 'Polycythemia/*congenital/*genetics', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/genetics']",2003/11/26 05:00,2004/07/17 05:00,['2003/11/26 05:00'],"['2003/11/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1079979603001670 [pii]', '10.1016/s1079-9796(03)00167-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2003 Nov-Dec;31(3):327-31. doi: 10.1016/s1079-9796(03)00167-0.,"['0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The functional importance of NE for APL development was assessed in NE deficient mice. Greater than 90% of bone marrow PML-RARalpha cleaving activity was lost in the absence of NE, and NE (but not Cathepsin G) deficient animals were protected from APL development.

In serum-free cultures, however, LIF is insufficient to block neural differentiation and maintain pluripotency. Here, we report that bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) act in combination with LIF to sustain self-renewal and preserve multilineage differentiation, chimera colonization, and germline transmission properties. ES cells can be propagated from single cells and derived de novo without serum or feeders using LIF plus BMP. The critical contribution of BMP is to induce expression of Id genes via the Smad pathway. Forced expression of Id liberates ES cells from BMP or serum dependence and allows self-renewal in LIF alone. Upon LIF withdrawal, Id-expressing ES cells differentiate but do not give rise to neural lineages. We conclude that blockade of lineage-specific transcription factors by Id proteins enables the self-renewal response to LIF/STAT3.","['Ying, Qi Long', 'Nichols, Jennifer', 'Chambers, Ian', 'Smith, Austin']","['Ying QL', 'Nichols J', 'Chambers I', 'Smith A']","[""Institute for Stem Cell Research, University of Edinburgh, King's Buildings, West Mains Road, EH9 3JQ, Edinburgh, Scotland. qilong.ying@ed.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', '*Repressor Proteins', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2003/11/26 05:00,2004/01/31 05:00,['2003/11/26 05:00'],"['2003/11/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['S009286740300847X [pii]', '10.1016/s0092-8674(03)00847-x [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 2003 Oct 31;115(3):281-92. doi: 10.1016/s0092-8674(03)00847-x.,"['0 (Bmp4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Idb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,['Cell. 2003 Oct 31;115(3):247-8.

METHODS: To investigate and analyze the probable mechanisms of cardiac toxicity of As(2)O(3) by dynamic monitoring of clinical manifestations, basal cardiac rate and electrocardiographic data of acute promyelocyte leukemia (APL) patients during As(2)O(3) therapy. The instant change of the action potential, the I(Ca-L) and I(k) of single cardiac myocyte of guinea pig was also observed with patch clamp dynamically. RESULTS: Approximately 71.4% of the 28 cases of APL showed cardiac toxic reaction in different degree in the first week after As(2)O(3) intravenous infusion in general dose, mainly expressing rapid heart rate or prolonged QT interval. As(2)O(3) could prolong the action potential duration from (563.0 +/- 55.8) ms to (737.7 +/- 131.7) ms (P < 0.05) and increased the I(Ca-L) and I(k) of single cardiac myocyte of guinea pig in vitro. CONCLUSION: As(2)O(3) intravenous infusion in general therapeutic dose can cause tachycardia and prolong QT interval in some of the APL patients. The probable mechanism of these side-effects may be due to instant involvement of ionic channel of cardiac myocyte.","['Zhou, Jin', 'Meng, Ran', 'Wang, Wei', 'Lu, Cheng-fang', 'Yang, Bao-fen']","['Zhou J', 'Meng R', 'Wang W', 'Lu CF', 'Yang BF']","['The Third of Internal Medicine, The First Hospital of Haerbin Medical University, Haerbin 150001, China.

CLL is characterized by progressive expansion of malignant CD5+ME+ B-cell clone accompanied by a myriad of cellular and humoral immune defects. Each of them might be linked to different clinically manifested complications such as increasing rate of infections, autoimmune disorders and disturbed immune surveillance against tumour cells. We assume that CLL occurs as a consequence of age-dependent, genetically related functional restrictions of the thymic microenvironment in supporting common lymphoid progenitor cells (CD5+ME+CD4-CD8-) to differentiate into mature T-cell and B-cell descendants. In conjunction with genetic abnormalities developing in B-cell progenitors, presumably expressing P glycoprotein (Pgp+), we postulate that developmentally altered T-cell descendants, along with quantitative imbalance among CD4+, their subsets and CD8+ lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, play an important additional role in facilitating the malignant B-cell clone emergence and in modulating the CLL clinical evolution. Namely, imbalance of any of T-cell-mediated cell interactive homeostatic mechanisms accompanied by imbalance in the production of various cytokines might in CLL influence leukaemic B-cell growth by deregulating inducer (c-myc and p53) and/or suppressor (bcl-2 and mutant p53) oncogenes responsible for the promotion or suppression of B-cell mitogenesis that may in turn further contribute to their impaired differentiation and/or differentiation arrest. In conclusion, CLL might be interpreted as a primary immunodeficiency syndrome developing in elderly population due to gradually evolving restriction of genetically controlled programs in the thymic microenvironment responsible for irregular maturation of common lymphoid progenitor cells that constitutively express CD5 antigen and ME receptor into T-cell and B-cell descendants.","['Vitale, B', 'Martinis, M', 'Antica, M', 'Kusic, B', 'Rabatic, S', 'Gagro, A', 'Kusec, R', 'Jaksic, B']","['Vitale B', 'Martinis M', 'Antica M', 'Kusic B', 'Rabatic S', 'Gagro A', 'Kusec R', 'Jaksic B']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Merkur University Hospital, Zagreb, Croatia. vitale@rudjer.irb.hr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Communication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology/genetics/immunology', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/physiology']",2003/11/26 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/11/26 05:00'],"['2003/11/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['1331 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-3083.2003.01331.x [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 2003 Dec;58(6):588-600. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.2003.01331.x.,,90,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fusion part of this protein contains a novel aminoacid sequence. If peptides derived from this leukemia-specific part of p210 are expressed in the context of HLA molecules on malignant cells this may elicit immunologically specific responses. Recent studies using synthetic peptides identical to the bcr-abl fusion region revealed that breakpoint specific peptides are capable of binding to the class I molecules HLA-A3, -A11 and -B8. It has been shown that individuals expressing HLA-A3 or HLA-B8 have a diminished risk for development of CML in Caucasoid populations. Other authors have reported a statistically significant increase in the frequency of Cw3 and Cw4 antigens in Causcasoids and European CML patients. These data suggested that Cw3 and Cw4 may be markers for CML susceptibility on these populations. OBJECTIVE: To asses a possible susceptibility effect of these HLA molecules we studied 63 CML Mexican Mestizo patients and 746 healthy subjects for the distribution of HLA class I and class II molecules. RESULTS: The gene products that showed statistically significant differences between CML patients and controls were DR14, DR3, Cw3 and Cw4. DR14 and DR3 were significantly increased in the patients group with respect to the controls group (DR14 antigen frequency: 3.17% vs. 0.29%; p = 0.03; DR3 20.63% vs. 8.33%; p = 0.0001). Cw3 and Cw4 were significantly decreased in the patient group (Cw3 26.9% vs. 49.11%; p = 0.03; Cw4 antigen frequency 23.8% vs. 86.28%; p = 0.0000001). The relative risk for DR14 was 10.48 (95% CI 1.52-79.29) and for DR3 was 3.96 (95% CI 2.05-7.71). The relative risk for Cw3 was 0.38 (95% CI 0.08-1.79) and for Cw4 was 0.11 (95% CI 0.048-0.81). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the development of CML is apparently associated with HLA phenotypes specific to each population, and indicate that Cw3 and Cw4 expression may result in a protective effect on the CML acquisition on Mexican Mestizo population probably by bcr-abl breakpoint peptides presentation through these HLA molecules.","['Rosas-Cabral, Alejandro', 'Irigoyen, Lourdes', 'Alvarado, Lilia', 'Vela-Ojeda, Jorge', 'Ayala-Sanchez, Manuel', 'Tripp-Villanueva, Francisco', 'Sanchez, Evelia', 'Gonzalez-Llaven, Jose', 'Gariglio, Patricio']","['Rosas-Cabral A', 'Irigoyen L', 'Alvarado L', 'Vela-Ojeda J', 'Ayala-Sanchez M', 'Tripp-Villanueva F', 'Sanchez E', 'Gonzalez-Llaven J', 'Gariglio P']",['roal3micasa@aol.com'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Mexico,Rev Invest Clin,Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,9421552,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'HLA-C Antigens/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mexico', 'Middle Aged']",2003/11/26 05:00,2004/02/27 05:00,['2003/11/26 05:00'],"['2003/11/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/26 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Invest Clin. 2003 Jul-Aug;55(4):423-8.,"['0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (HLA-C*03 antigen)', '0 (HLA-C*04 antigen)']",,,,,"['Rev Invest Clin. 2004 May-Jun;56(3):406-7; author reply 408; discussion 409.', 'PMID: 15612525']",,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical records of 110 patients aged 14 years or older, were identified and reviewed. Age, sex, ALL subtypes, follow-up time, OST and mortality rates were the analyzed variables. Inferential statistics, including parametric and nonparametric tests and its 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), were used when appropriate. Six months periods, the median survival time (MST), and the five-years OST using Kaplan-Meier methods (K-M) for ALL as a group and for its subtypes, were calculated. RESULTS: The median age of ALL patients was 19 years. Male gender was more affected (68%) than female gender. One to 55 months was the followed-up time, being the followed-up mean time 16.9 +/- 12.1 months, although 12 months, 55 months and sixty months OST was 70%, 11% and zero percent, respectively, being during all the followed-up time always unfavourable to male gender. Mortality rate was 53%, and male was again the most affected one. L2-ALL was the most frequent subtype, having the least mortality rate (38%) between subtypes (p = 0.012) because its OST was better than for L1 and L3 subtypes.

AIM: To assess the results of a standardized protocol for the treatment of febrile neutropenia and compare it with a period in which treatment was not standardized. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and eight episodes of febrile neutropenia in 69 patients, treated with a standardized antimicrobial protocol between 1996 and 2001, were analyzed. The protocol consisted in the use of a combination of antimicrobial whose spectrum was broadened progressively according to the isolated microorganisms and the involved foci. These were compared with 83 episodes in 54 patients, treated without standardized protocols between 1990 and 1995. RESULTS: Both groups of patients were comparable. Their ages ranged from 15 to 65 years old. The male/female ratio was 1.3 and the lymphoblastic/myeloid leukemia ratio was 1.4. Sixty one percent of episodes occurred during induction chemotherapy and mean duration of neutropenia was 17 days. A clinically significant focus was identified in 72% of episodes and a microorganism was isolated blood culture in 35% of them. There was a predominance of gram negative organisms. The mortality decreased from 18 to 9% in the period 1996-2000 (p = 0.094).

The rarity of these associations, and in many reports the lack of temporal relationships, has led to skepticism about vasculitis being a paraneoplastic syndrome. The objective of the present study was to review cases of concurrent vasculitis and cancer at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation over an 18.5-year period and explore evidence that would support the notion of vasculitis being a type of paraneoplastic disease. METHODS: Retrospective review of the records of all patients diagnosed with vasculitis and cancer within 12 months of each other was performed using an ICD-9 diagnostic data base at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Patients with known chronic autoimmune disease or serologic evidence of hepatitis B or C infection were excluded. A standardized data collection instrument was used to document information about presentation, treatment, and course of illness. RESULTS: During the 18.5 years of our study, more than 15 million inpatients and outpatients were seen at the Cleveland Clinic. Of these, 2,800 patients had vasculitis independent of cancer, more than 69,000 patients had cancer, and 69 patients had been identified who had both malignancies and systemic vasculitis. Only 12 patients were identified in whom both vasculitis and cancer occurred within the same 12 months. Mean age was 65 years (range 45-79). There was no gender preference (M = F). In 8 of the 12 cases, diagnoses were made within 3 months of each other. In 6 of the patients, the diagnoses of both processes were made within 1 month. Ten of the 12 patients had vasculitis 1 to 3 months prior to or concurrent with the diagnosis of cancer. Six of the 12 patients had solid organ tumors, 4 had lymphoma, 1 had leukemia, and 1 had multiple myeloma. The most common vasculitis was cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV), which occurred in 7 cases. Four cases of LCV were associated with solid organ tumors. Other vasculitides included giant cell arteritis (n = 2), polyarteritis nodosa (n = 2), and Wegener's granulomatosis (n = 1). The response of the vasculitis to glucocorticoid and cytotoxic therapy varied. Complete remission of vasculitis occurred in 4 of the patients, partial improvement occurred in 4 patients, and no improvement was noted in 4 patients. Complete remission occurred in 3 of the 4 patients in whom vasculitis and cancer were treated concurrently. Eight of 10 patients in whom followup was greater than 2 months demonstrated concordance of disease activity and treatment response for both cancer and vasculitis. CONCLUSION: The close temporal relationship of cancer and vasculitis in our patients adds to circumstantial evidence of vasculitis at times being a paraneoplastic condition. Failure of a vasculitis to respond to conventional therapy should raise questions about underlying malignancy. Effective treatment of the cancer enhances the likelihood of improvement in vasculitis.","['Hutson, T E', 'Hoffman, G S']","['Hutson TE', 'Hoffman GS']","['Cleveland Clinic Foundation, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Arthritis Care Res,Arthritis care and research : the official journal of the Arthritis Health Professions Association,8809082,,"['Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Comorbidity', 'Data Collection', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'Ohio/epidemiology', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'Population Surveillance', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vasculitis/*complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy']",2003/11/26 05:00,2003/12/18 05:00,['2003/11/26 05:00'],"['2003/11/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1529-0131(200012)13:6<417::aid-art13>3.0.co;2-t [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Care Res. 2000 Dec;13(6):417-23. doi: 10.1002/1529-0131(200012)13:6<417::aid-art13>3.0.co;2-t.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF) PDGF is considered to be one of the growth factors responsible for the development of bone marrow fibrosis. Recently, it has been shown that imatinib has antifibrogenic effect on bone marrow fibrosis in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Treatment with imatinib alone in IMF has been associated with significant side effects. In this study, the safety and efficacy of imatinib therapy in IMF, either administered as a single agent or in combination with hydroxyurea (HU) and/or alpha-interferon (IFN-alpha) are evaluated. Eleven patients (median age, 63 years; range, 33-82 years) with IMF (n = 8) or postpolycythemic myelofibrosis (PPMF) (n = 3) were studied All patients had been treated with HU (n = 9) and/or IFN (n = 7) before study entry. In all but one patient, treatment with these agents was discontinued when imatinib therapy was instituted. One patient continued IFN when treatment with imatinib was started. Imatinib was given at a dose of 400 mg/day. Nine patients were in an advanced disease phase. The patients have been followed for a median period of 2 months (range, 0.5-12 months). Treatment with imatinib has been stopped in six patients (55%), because of overt side effects (n = 4), recurrence of transitory dizziness and visual defects owing to a rising platelet count (n = 1), or the occurrence of an acute subdural hemorrhage that was evacuated without neurological deficits (n = 1). In nine patients imatinib treatment was followed by a rise in leukocyte and platelet counts that required combination with HU or IFN. The combined treatment modalities were followed by a rapid decrease in cell counts and were well tolerated apart from IFN side effects. A beneficial effect of imatinib was documented in three patients. It is concluded that leukocytosis and thrombocytosis are seen in most patients with myelofibrosis during treatment with imatinib. Combination therapy with HU or IFN seems safe and well tolerated and followed by a decrease in disease activity.

A role for protein kinase C (PKC) in the process leading to MAPK activation in EMF exposed cells is also suggested by the results. MAPK activation is negated by an inhibitor to PKCalpha, but not PKCdelta inhibitors, in cells subjected to EMF exposure or TPA treatment. Thus, similarities between the effects of EMF exposure and TPA treatment are supported by this investigation.

In clinical trials with imatinib mesylate, common side effects of nausea, emesis, diarrhea, periorbital edema, fluid retention, and myelosuppression have been documented. METHODS: In this case series, the authors describe unique clinical findings of skin hypopigmentation in six patients with CML who were treated with imatinib mesylate. RESULTS: Most patients developed onset of skin hypopigmentation within the first month of treatment and all of the patients experienced additional drug toxicity. Despite patient susceptibility to toxicity, the presence of hypopigmentation did not appear to predict leukemic cell response or clinical outcome. All six patients established a hematologic response but only two patients had a complete cytogenetic response. Imatinib mesylate induced hypopigmentation also appeared to be reversible and potentially dose related. CONCLUSION: Skin hypopigmentation is a benign side effect from imatinib mesylate treatment that appears to be reversible upon discontinuation or dose reduction. Several lines of evidence have previously reported that KIT and its ligand stem cell factor (SCF) have a regulatory role in melanocyte development and survival, suggesting a rational mechanism of action for imatinib mesylate in the pathogenesis of hypopigmentation. The signal transduction mechanism currently is believed to involve SCF ligand binding of KIT and downstream activation of MAP kinase (Erk-2). Microphthalmia (Mi), a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLHZip) transcription factor, is phosphorylated by MAP kinase at a serine residue (S73). Once phosphorylated, Mi transactivates the tyrosine pigmentation gene promoter and affects pigment production.","['Tsao, Anne S', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Cortes, Jorge', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Talpaz, Moshe']","['Tsao AS', 'Kantarjian H', 'Cortes J', ""O'Brien S"", 'Talpaz M']","['Medical Oncology Fellowship Program, University of Texas M.

It most commonly occurs in association with hematologic malignancies and manifests a few hours to a few days after initiation of specific chemotherapy. Acute spontaneous TLS has been described in leukemia and lymphoma and in some patients with solid tumors prior to institution of therapy. The findings that may be seen in acute TLS include hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, and acute oliguric or anuric renal failure due to uric acid precipitation within the tubules (acute uric acid nephropathy) and to calcium phosphate deposition in the renal parenchyma and vessels. We report here a case of acute spontaneous TLS (high grade B-cell lymphoma of the right colon) in which serum uric acid concentration attained exceptionally high levels (36.7 mg/dL). The patient underwent acute oliguric renal failure soon after right colectomy. He was treated by means of a large infusion of saline. The renal function recovered in such a rapid way that no dialysis treatment was required. In conclusion the present case report has two peculiarities: that of being one of the rare examples of spontaneous TLS, and that of showing an exceptionally severe hyperuricemia, probably the highest ever reported in the literature. The administration of a large volume of saline was able to ensure a complete recovery of renal function. Therefore, hydration with saline remains the keystone in the prevention and treatment of acute TLS.","['Basile, C', 'Montanaro, A']","['Basile C', 'Montanaro A']","['Divisione di Nefrologia, Ospedale di Martina Franca (TA), Italy. nefromartina@topvideo.net']",['ita'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Italy,G Ital Nefrol,Giornale italiano di nefrologia : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di nefrologia,9426434,IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Hyperuricemia/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/*complications']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/02/27 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,G Ital Nefrol. 2003 Sep-Oct;20(5):525-8.,,,,Iperuricemia eccezionalmente severa in insufficienza renale acuta da sindrome da lisi tumorale spontanea.,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We measured ASNase activity using an enzyme coupling method with a limit of detection of 2 U/l and examined the relationship between ASNase activity and Asn levels in blood samples from 14 children with ALL. RESULTS: In all but one patient showing high ASNase antibody titers, minimum ASNase activity to maintain Asn depletion levels below the limit of detection (40 ng/ml) ranged from 6 to 180 U/l with a median value of 16 U/l. In 11 patients, the enzyme activity corresponding to minimum detectable Asn levels ranged from 2 to 32 U/l with a median value of 6.5 U/l. Patients with an ASNase activity of 2 U/l or an undetectable activity (<2 U/l) had nearly normal Asn levels: 4140+/-1161 ng/ml at 2 U/l and 7235+/-3107 ng/ml at <2 U/l (mean+/-SD). Statistical analysis showed that ASNase activity in the range of 2-32 U/l was inversely correlated with Asn levels ( r=-0.803, P=0.001). CONCLUSION: These results show that Asn levels are strongly correlated with plasma ASNase activity even at low enzyme activities (<50 U/l) and that this sensitive ASNase assay can be used to estimate plasma Asn depletion levels.","['Tsurusawa, Masahito', 'Chin, Motoaki', 'Iwai, Asayuki', 'Nomura, Keiko', 'Maeba, Hideaki', 'Taga, Takashi', 'Higa, Takeshi', 'Kuno, Tomoko', 'Hori, Toshinori', 'Muto, Akiko', 'Yamagata, Miyo']","['Tsurusawa M', 'Chin M', 'Iwai A', 'Nomura K', 'Maeba H', 'Taga T', 'Higa T', 'Kuno T', 'Hori T', 'Muto A', 'Yamagata M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Aichi Medical University, 480-1195 Aichi, Japan. tsuru@aichi-med-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20031122,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/blood/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Asparagine/*blood', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/03/17 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2003/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-003-0734-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2004 Mar;53(3):204-8. doi: 10.1007/s00280-003-0734-5.

STUDY DESIGN: Prenatal visits of healthy women to University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium were considered. Cytokine levels in vaginal washings from 30 unselected healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies were monitored during pregnancy and compared with those from 62 nonpregnant healthy control subjects. Exclusion criteria included bacterial vaginosis, moderate or severe aerobic vaginitis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida vaginitis (wet mount or culture), gonorrhea, and Chlamydia. Interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-1-receptor antagonist, leukemia inhibitory factor, and tumor necrosis factor were measured. Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis and Welch tests were used for univariate analysis, and the Spearman rank test was used for multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Compared with concentrations in nonpregnant women, interleukin-1beta concentrations were similar, but interleukin-1-receptor antagonist production was depressed throughout pregnancy. Vaginal interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 were less often discovered during pregnancy than outside pregnancy and dipped significantly in the middle trimester, to rise again to prepregnancy levels in the third trimester. Leukemia inhibitory factor was lower during the beginning of pregnancy (P=.038) but otherwise did not differ from nonpregnant values throughout pregnancy nor did tumor necrosis factor. Sexual activity could not explain these findings. CONCLUSION: Vaginal cytokine levels, especially interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, from pregnant women may differ from nonpregnant values; some levels, such as interleukin-6 and interleukin-8, may fluctuate during normal pregnancy. These spontaneous variations during pregnancy must be taken into account when mucosal immunologic responses to infection of the lower genital tract are being studied.","['Donders, Gilbert G G', 'Vereecken, Annie', 'Bosmans, Eugene', 'Spitz, Bernard']","['Donders GG', 'Vereecken A', 'Bosmans E', 'Spitz B']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Herestraat 45, Leuven 3000, Belgium. gilbert.donders@femicare.net']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Obstet Gynecol,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,0370476,IM,"['Coitus/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/*metabolism', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Pregnancy/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy Trimester, Second', 'Pregnancy Trimester, Third', 'Reference Values', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Vagina/*metabolism']",2003/11/25 05:00,2003/12/25 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0002937803006537 [pii]', '10.1067/s0002-9378(03)00653-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2003 Nov;189(5):1433-8. doi: 10.1067/s0002-9378(03)00653-7.,"['0 (IL1RN protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to clarify the role of XBP-1 in breast cancer, here we investigated the expression of XBP-1 in 11 primary breast cancers and 5 breast cancer cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of eleven patients who were underwent surgery for breast cancer from 2000 to 2002. Five breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-453, CRL1500, YMB-1-E, MCF7 and HBL100) were analyzed for XBP-1 expression. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed on 6 primary breast cancers. Then we investigated XBP-1 expression by immunohistochemically on archived paraffin-embedded sections. RESULTS: hXBP-1 mRNA expression was increased in all 11 primary breast cancers we examined, as well as 5 breast cancer cell lines, but hardly detectable in non-cancerous breast tissue. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that hXBP-1 protein stained strongly in the cytoplasm of cancer cells but was unreactive in the normal breast ductal epithelial and myoepithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that increased expression of the hXBP-1 gene may play some role in human breast carcinogenesis through impairment of cell differentiation regulation.","['Fujimoto, Takashi', 'Onda, Masamitsu', 'Nagai, Hisaki', 'Nagahata, Takemitsu', 'Ogawa, Kenji', 'Emi, Mitsuru']","['Fujimoto T', 'Onda M', 'Nagai H', 'Nagahata T', 'Ogawa K', 'Emi M']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Institute of Gerontology, Nippon Medical School, 1-396, Kosugi-cho, Nakahara-ku, Kawasaki 211-8533, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer (Tokyo, Japan)",100888201,IM,"['Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Carcinoma, Ductal/*genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation', 'X-Box Binding Protein 1']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/02/13 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02967649 [doi]'],ppublish,Breast Cancer. 2003;10(4):301-6. doi: 10.1007/BF02967649.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (X-Box Binding Protein 1)', '0 (XBP1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The c-myc oncogene is one of the many relevant amplified genes contained within the extrachromosomal DNA compartment. Spontaneous loss of amplified copies of c-myc induces terminal differentiation and apoptosis in the human HL-60 leukemia cell lines. In the present study, we evaluate HU's ability to induce apoptosis by eliminating extrachromosomally located c-myc oncogene in human tumor cell lines. The consequences of eliminating extrachromosomal DNA by HU were explored in two different cell lines using the TdT assay and acridine orange/ethidium bromide labeling. COLO 320 clone 3 and COLO 320 clone 21 cell lines contain the same number of amplified copies of c-myc oncogene, but located respectively on extrachromosomal DNA, and intrachromosomally in homogeneously staining regions. HU induced apoptosis in the COLO 320 clone 3 cell line by a time and concentration dependent mechanism but could not induce apoptosis in the COLO 320 clone 21 cell line. These results suggested that HU-induced apoptosis in COLO 320 cell lines depends on elimination of extrachromosomal amplified copies of the c-myc oncogene. The ability of HU to eliminate extrachromosomally amplified copies of the c-myc oncogene and to induce apoptosis should be considered when targeting malignancies with amplification of the c-myc oncogene in an extrachromosomal site.","['Petit, T', 'Davidson, K', 'Izbicka, E', 'Von Hoff, D D']","['Petit T', 'Davidson K', 'Izbicka E', 'Von Hoff DD']","['Translational Research Laboratory, Institute for Drug Development, 14960 Omicron Drive, San Antonio, TX 78245 USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,,,2003/11/25 05:00,2003/11/25 05:01,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/25 05:01 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['206945 [pii]', '10.1023/a:1009606421419 [doi]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 1999 Jun;4(3):163-7. doi: 10.1023/a:1009606421419.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Self reported occupational data from mothers and fathers of 3838 children with cancer and 7629 control children were analysed. Odds ratios were calculated for 31 ""occupational groups"" by parent, diagnostic group (leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), central nervous system tumours, and other cancers) and time of exposure (periconception, birth, and diagnosis). RESULTS: Findings did not support the hypothesis that occupational exposure of fathers to ionising radiation increases the risk of childhood cancer in their offspring. Specific examination of periconceptual chemical exposures showed small but statistically significant increased risks for leukaemia and ALL among children whose fathers were exposed to exhaust fumes, driving, and/or inhaled particulate hydrocarbons. In the remaining analyses, a fourfold increase in the risk of other cancers was observed among the children of fathers working with leather but based on small numbers. Both maternal and paternal exposure to textile dust was related to an increased risk of other cancers. CONCLUSION: Results failed to produce any strong evidence to link parental occupational exposures with an increased risk of childhood cancer. No relation was found for paternal periconceptual exposure to ionising radiation. The consistency of the associations observed between childhood leukaemia and paternal occupational exposure to exhaust fumes, driving, and/or inhaled particulate hydrocarbons at periconception suggest a small risk for vehicle related exhaust.

We demonstrate here that in uninfected cells, BAK is complexed with the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family member Myeloid Cell Leukemia 1 (MCL-1). E1A expression during infection resulted in the specific down-regulation of MCL-1 through destabilization of the protein and loss of the mRNA. Upon loss of the MCL-1-BAK complex, BAK complexed with either BAX in proapoptotic E1B mutant adenovirus-infected cells, or with the adenovirus BCL-2 homolog E1B 19K in cells infected with the wild-type virus in which apoptosis is inhibited. Loss of MCL-1 was required to initiate the apoptotic pathway in infected cells as restoration of MCL-1 expression rescued infected cells from E1A-induced apoptosis. Analogous to E1A expression, DNA damage down-regulates MCL-1, and adenovirus infection resulted in the accumulation of phosphorylated H2AX and ataxia-telangiectasia mutant protein (ATM), hallmarks of DNA double-strand breaks. Thus, MCL-1 may function by maintaining BAK in an inactive state, and the loss of MCL-1 upon activation of the DNA damage response, perhaps through replication stress induced in virus infected cells, may be required to initiate the apoptotic response.","['Cuconati, Andrea', 'Mukherjee, Chandreyee', 'Perez, Denise', 'White, Eileen']","['Cuconati A', 'Mukherjee C', 'Perez D', 'White E']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20031121,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics/*physiology', '*Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/01/17 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1101/gad.1156903 [doi]', '1156903 [pii]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2003 Dec 1;17(23):2922-32. doi: 10.1101/gad.1156903.

In the last decade, a molecular-level description of alloimmune interactions and the process of immune recovery leading to tolerance has emerged. Here, new developments in understanding alloresponses, genetic factors that modify them, and strategies to control immune reconstitution are described. In Section I, Dr. John Barrett and colleagues describe the cellular and molecular basis of the alloresponse and the mechanisms underlying the three major outcomes of engraftment, GVHD and the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Increasing knowledge of leukemia-restricted antigens suggests ways to separate GVHD and GVL. Recent findings highlight a central role of hematopoietic-derived antigen-presenting cells in the initiation of GVHD and distinct properties of natural killer (NK) cell alloreactivity in engraftment and GVL that are of therapeutic importance. Finally, a detailed map of cellular immune recovery post-transplant is emerging which highlights the importance of post-thymic lymphocytes in determining outcome in the critical first few months following stem cell transplantation. Factors that modify immune reconstitution include immunosuppression, GVHD, the cytokine milieu and poorly-defined homeostatic mechanisms which encourage irregular T cell expansions driven by immunodominant T cell-antigen interactions. In Section II, Prof. Anne Dickinson and colleagues describe genetic polymorphisms outside the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system that determine the nature of immune reconstitution after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and thereby affect transplant outcomethrough GVHD, GVL, and transplant-related mortality. Polymorphisms in cytokine gene promotors and other less characterized genes affect the cytokine milieu of the recipient and the immune reactivity of the donor. Some cytokine gene polymorphisms are significantly associated with transplant outcome. Other non-HLA genes strongly affecting alloresponses code for minor histocompatibility antigens (mHA). Differences between donor and recipient mHA cause GVHD or GVL reactions or graft rejection. Both cytokine gene polymorphisms (CGP) and mHA differences resulting on donor-recipient incompatibilities can be jointly assessed in the skin explant assay as a functional way to select the most suitable donor or the best transplant approach for the recipient. In Section III, Dr. Nelson Chao describes non-pharmaceutical techniques to control immune reconstitution post-transplant. T cells stimulated by host alloantigens can be distinguished from resting T cells by the expression of a variety of activation markers (IL-2 receptor, FAS, CD69, CD71) and by an increased photosensitivity to rhodamine dyes. These differences form the basis for eliminating GVHD-reactive T cells in vitro while conserving GVL and anti-viral immunity. Other attempts to control immune reactions post-transplant include the insertion of suicide genes into the transplanted T cells for effective termination of GVHD reactions, the removal of CD62 ligand expressing cells, and the modulation of T cell reactivity by favoring Th2, Tc2 lymphocyte subset expansion.

Phenotypic mimicry amongst these disorders and between them and nonclonal hematopoietic disorders, lack of clonal diagnostic markers, lack of understanding of their molecular basis and paucity of controlled, prospective therapeutic trials have made the diagnosis and management of PV, ET and IMF difficult. In Section I, Dr. Jerry Spivak introduces current clinical controversies involving the CMPD, in particular the diagnostic challenges. Two new molecular assays may prove useful in the diagnosis and classification of CMPD. In 2000, the overexpression in PV granulocytes of the mRNA for the neutrophil antigen NBI/CD177, a member of the uPAR/Ly6/CD59 family of plasma membrane proteins, was documented. Overexpression of PRV-1 mRNA appeared to be specific for PV since it was not observed in secondary erythrocytosis. At this time, it appears that overexpression of granulocyte PRV-1 in the presence of an elevated red cell mass supports a diagnosis of PV; absence of PRV-1 expression, however, should not be grounds for excluding PV as a diagnostic possibility. Impaired expression of Mpl, the receptor for thrombopoietin, in platelets and megakaryocytes has been first described in PV, but it has also been observed in some patients with ET and IMF. The biologic basis appears to be either alternative splicing of Mpl mRNA or a single nucleotide polymorphism, both of which involve Mpl exon 2 and both of which lead to impaired posttranslational glycosylation and a dominant negative effect on normal Mpl expression. To date, no Mpl DNA structural abnormality or mutation has been identified in PV, ET or IMF. In Section II, Dr. Tiziano Barbui reviews the best clinical evidence for treatment strategy design in PV and ET. Current recommendations for cytoreductive therapy in PV are still largely similar to those at the end of the PVSG era. Phlebotomy to reduce the red cell mass and keep it at a safe level (hematocrit < 45%) remains the cornerstone of treatment. Venesection is an effective and safe therapy and previous concerns about potential side effects, including severe iron deficiency and an increased tendency to thrombosis or myelofibrosis, were erroneous. Many patients require no other therapy for many years. For others, however, poor compliance to phlebotomy or progressive myeloproliferation, as indicated by increasing splenomegaly or very high leukocyte or platelet counts, may call for the introduction of cytoreductive drugs. In ET, the therapeutic trade-off between reducing thrombotic events and increasing the risk of leukemia with the use of cytoreductive drugs should be approached by patient risk stratification. Thrombotic deaths seem very rare in low-risk ET subjects and there are no data indicating that fatalities can be prevented by starting cytoreductive drugs early. Therefore, withholding chemotherapy might be justifiable in young, asymptomatic ET patients with a platelet count below 1500000/mm(3) and with no additional risk factors for thrombosis. If cardiovascular risk factors together with ET are identified (smoking, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) it is wise to consider platelet-lowering agents on an individual basis. In Section III, Dr. Gianni Tognoni discusses the role of aspirin therapy in PV based on the recently completed European Collaboration on Low-dose Aspirin in Polycythemia Vera (ECLAP) Study, a multi-country, multicenter project aimed at describing the natural history of PV as well as the efficacy of low-dose aspirin. Aspirin treatment lowered the risk of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke (relative risk 0.41 [95% CI 0.15-1.15], P =.0912). Total and cardiovascular mortality were also reduced by 46% and 59%, respectively. Major bleedings were slightly increased nonsignificnsignificantly by aspirin (relative risk 1.62, 95% CI 0.27-9.71). In Section IV, Dr. Giovanni Barosi reviews our current understanding of the pathophysiology of IMF and, in particular, the contributions of anomalous megakaryocyte proliferation, neoangiogenesis and abnormal CD34(+) stem cell trafficking to disease pathogenesis. The role of newer therapies, such as low-conditioning stem cell transplantation and thalidomide, is discussed in the context of a general treatment strategy for IMF. The results of a Phase II trial of low-dose thalidomide as a single agent in 63 patients with myelofibrosis with meloid metaplasia (MMM) using a dose-escalation design and an overall low dose of the drug (The European Collaboration on MMM) will be presented. Considering only patients who completed 4 weeks of treatment, 31% had a response: this was mostly due to a beneficial effect of thalidomide on patients with transfusion dependent anemia, 39% of whom abolished transfusions, patients with moderate to severe thrombocytopenia, 28% of whom increased their platelet count by more than 50 x 10(9)/L, and patients with the largest splenomegalies, 42% of whom reduced spleen size of more than 2 cm.","['Spivak, Jerry L', 'Barosi, Giovanni', 'Tognoni, Gianni', 'Barbui, Tiziano', 'Finazzi, Guido', 'Marchioli, Roberto', 'Marchetti, Monia']","['Spivak JL', 'Barosi G', 'Tognoni G', 'Barbui T', 'Finazzi G', 'Marchioli R', 'Marchetti M']","['Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205-2109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

The international prognostic scoring system, FAB, and WHO classifications have helped define specific subgroups with their characteristic cytogenetic, molecular and immunological abnormalities. Until recently the mainstay of the treatment has been entirely supportive with blood and platelet transfusions. What is increasingly manifest now is the considerable excitement generated by the emergence of novel therapeutic strategies based on painstaking research findings from the laboratories. In Section I, Dr. Alan List reviews the therapeutic strategies with the specific emphasis on the relevance of molecular mechanism of apoptosis and targeted therapies using small molecules. Of particular interest is the excitement surrounding the clinical benefit obtained from potent immunomodulatory derivative (IMiD) of thalidomide CC5013. The review provides an update of the role of small molecule inhibitors of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase, arsenic trioxide, oral matrix metalloprotease inhibitors, farnesyl transferase inhibitors, and imatinib mesylate in the treatment of MDS subgroups.

Surface antigen analysis has helped us define classical CLL and differentiate it from variants such as marginal zone leukemia, mantle cell leukemia, and prolymphocytic leukemia. An important observation has been that the B-cells in indolent types of CLL, which do not require therapy, have undergone somatic hypermutation and function as memory B-lymphocytes whereas those more likely to progress have not undergone this process. Section I by Dr. Nicholas Chiorazzi encompasses emerging elements of the new biology of CLL and will address the types of somatic hypermutation that occur in CLL cells and their correlation with other parameters such as telomere length and ZAP70 status. In addition he addresses the concept of which cells are proliferating in CLL and how we can quantitate the proliferative thrust using novel methods. The interaction between these parameters is also explored. Section II by Dr. Thomas Kipps focuses on immune biology and immunotherapy of CLL and discusses new animal models in CLL, which can be exploited to increase understanding of the disease and create new opportunities for testing the interaction of the CLL cells with a variety of elements of the immune system. It is obvious that immunotherapy is emerging as a major therapeutic modality in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Dr. Kipps addresses the present understanding of the immune status of CLL and the role of passive immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, alemtuzumab, and emerging new antibodies. In addition the interaction between the CLL cells and the immune system, which has been exploited in gene therapy with transfection of CLL cells by CD40 ligand, is discussed. In Section III, Dr. Michael Keating examines the question ""Do we have the tools to cure CLL?"" and focuses on the fact that we now have three distinct modalities, which are able to achieve high quality remissions with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negativity for the immunoglobulin heavy chain in CLL. These modalities include initial chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab, the use of alemtuzumab for marrow cytoreduction in minimal residual disease and allogeneic bone marrow transplants. The emergence of non-ablative marrow transplants in CLL has led to the broadening of the range of opportunities to treat older patients. The addition of rituximab to the chemotherapy preparative regimens appears to be a significant advance. The combination of our increased understanding of the biology, immune status, and therapy of CLL provides for the first time the opportunity for curative strategies.","['Keating, Michael J', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Messmer, Bradley', 'Damle, Rajendra N', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Ferrarini, Manlio', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Keating MJ', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Messmer B', 'Damle RN', 'Allen SL', 'Rai KR', 'Ferrarini M', 'Kipps TJ']","['University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Leukemia, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

The past 5 years or so have been particularly fruitful in the dissection of the signal transduction pathways abnormally activated in CML and in the translation of this knowledge to clinical practice. In this report, we discuss the biological basis for such translation and highlight the current and potential tools for the effective treatment of CML patients. The first part presents a review of the basic concepts on the biology of CML and their application to the design of targeted therapy. The mechanisms of action of the molecular-specific drugs currently used in clinical trials are discussed, with emphasis on the description of the most promising new compounds that are enhancing the potential for effective alternative or combination chemotherapy in CML. In the following section, we explain how molecular monitoring of response to imatinib mesylate in patients with CML can be used as a guide to clinical management. In particular, we discuss the relative value of regular quantitative RT/PCR and cytogenetic analyses, how responding patients should be monitored and managed, and how to investigate patients who are refractory or become resistant to imatinib treatment. In the last part of this report, a discussion on the possibility of managing CML with patient-specific strategies is presented. We review the current treatment options, highlight the factors impacting on decision making, discuss the range of possibilities for future therapeutic strategies and propose a systematic approach for individualizing treatment for patients in different disease categories.","['Melo, Junia V', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Apperley, Jane F']","['Melo JV', 'Hughes TP', 'Apperley JF']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

However significant challenges remain including developing better methods to predict which patients can be cured with less toxic treatment and which ones will benefit from augmented therapy. In addition, 25% of patients fail therapy and novel treatments that are focused on undermining specifically the leukemic process are needed urgently. In Section I, Dr. Carroll reviews current approaches to risk classification and proposes a system that incorporates well-established clinical parameters, genetic lesions of the blast as well as early response parameters. He then provides an overview of emerging technologies in genomics and proteomics and how they might lead to more rational, biologically based classification systems. In Section II, Drs. Mary Relling and Stella Davies describe emerging findings that relate to host features that influence outcome, the role of inherited germline variation. They highlight technical breakthroughs in assessing germline differences among patients. Polymorphisms of drug metabolizing genes have been shown to influence toxicity and the best example is the gene thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) a key enzyme in the metabolism of 6-mercaptopurine. Polymorphisms are associated with decreased activity that is also associated with increased toxicity. The role of polymorphisms in other genes whose products play an important role in drug metabolism as well as cytokine genes are discussed. In Sections III and IV, Drs. James Downing and Cheryl Willman review their findings using gene expression profiling to classify ALL. Both authors outline challenges in applying this methodology to analysis of clinical samples. Dr. Willman describes her laboratory's examination of infant leukemia and precursor B-ALL where unsupervised approaches have led to the identification of inherent biologic groups not predicted by conventional morphologic, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic variables. Dr. Downing describes his results from a pediatric ALL expression database using over 327 diagnostic samples, with 80% of the dataset consisting of samples from patients treated on a single institutional protocol. Seven distinct leukemia subtypes were identified representing known leukemia subtypes including: BCR-ABL, E2A-PBX1, TEL-AML1, rearrangements in the MLL gene, hyperdiploid karyotype (i.e., > 50 chromosomes), and T-ALL as well as a new leukemia subtype. A subset of genes have been identified whose expression appears to be predictive of outcome but independent verification is needed before this type of analysis can be integrated into treatment assignment. Chemotherapeutic agents kill cancer cells by activating apoptosis, or programmed cell death. In Section V, Dr. John Reed describes major apoptotic pathways and the specific role of key proteins in this response. The expression level of some of these proteins, such as BCL2, BAX, and caspase 3, has been shown to be predictive of ultimate outcome in hematopoietic tumors. New therapeutic approaches that modulate the apoptotic pathway are now available and Dr. Reed highlights those that may be applicable to the treatment of childhood ALL.","['Carroll, William L', 'Bhojwani, Deepa', 'Min, Dong-Joon', 'Raetz, Elizabeth', 'Relling, Mary', 'Davies, Stella', 'Downing, James R', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Reed, John C']","['Carroll WL', 'Bhojwani D', 'Min DJ', 'Raetz E', 'Relling M', 'Davies S', 'Downing JR', 'Willman CL', 'Reed JC']","['Mount Sinai and New York University Schools of Medicine, New York, NY 10029-6574, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

The goal of this study was to determine whether single MHC class I locus-mismatched lymphocytes could generate an antilymphoma activity in the absence of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and to understand the underlying mechanisms. Immunoincompetent Scid or lethally irradiated mice were challenged i.v. with a lethal dose of A20 lymphoma cells together with an infusion of single MHC class I locus mismatched splenocytes. Mice that were challenged with A20 cells alone succumbed to lymphoma between 34 and 50 days after infusion. In contrast, >75% of mice that were coinfused with single class I MHC locus mismatched splenocytes survived indefinitely (n = 20) in the absence of GVHD. Interestingly, the number of CD3(+)CD4(-)CD8(-) double-negative (DN) T cells increased 15-fold in mice that did not develop lymphoma. Both DN T cells isolated from the spleens of lymphoma-free mice and DN T cells cloned from naive mice were cytotoxic to A20 lymphoma cells in vitro. When DN T cell clones were infused into naive mice i.v. together with A20 lymphoma cells, 86% of recipient mice were protected from lymphoma onset and did not develop GVHD (n = 22). To assess whether the systemic injection of DN T cells can also suppress local tumor development, A20 cells were infused i.m., and at the same time DN T cell clones were infused either i.v. or i.m. Results indicated that DN T cells infused systemically (i.v.) could not prevent local tumor outgrowth, but DN T cells coinfused locally (i.m.) prevented local tumor development in 91% of animals (n = 11). Furthermore, we demonstrate that primary DN T cells were also able to prevent tumor growth in 75% of mice when infused together with A20 cells i.m. (n = 12). Together, these results demonstrate that an antilymphoma activity can be generated in mice without causing GVHD. Furthermore, DN T cells can suppress lymphoma cells in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that DN T cells could be used as a novel strategy for the treatment of lymphoma.","['Young, Kevin J', 'Kay, Lyndsey S', 'Phillips, M James', 'Zhang, Li']","['Young KJ', 'Kay LS', 'Phillips MJ', 'Zhang L']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, Multi Organ Transplantation Program, Toronto General Research Institute, University Health Network, 621 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario M5G 2C4, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Immunocompromised Host/immunology', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/prevention & control/therapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'fas Receptor/immunology']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/02/11 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Nov 15;63(22):8014-21.,"['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We showed recently that measurement of the weak near infrared luminescence of (1)O(2) is possible in cells in vitro and tissues in vivo. Here, we investigated the relationship between the integrated luminescence signal and the in vitro PDT response of AML5 leukemia cells sensitized with aminolevulinic acid-induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). Sensitized cell suspensions were irradiated with pulsed 523 nm laser light at average fluence rates of 10, 25, or 50 mWcm(-2) and, (1)O(2) luminescence measurements were made throughout the treatment. Cell survival was measured with either propidium iodide-labeled flow cytometry or colony-forming assay. The PpIX concentration in the cells, the photobleaching, and the pO(2) in the cell suspensions were also monitored. There were large variations in cell survival and (1)O(2) generation in different experiments due to different controlled treatment parameters (fluence and fluence rate) and other uncontrolled factors (PpIX synthesis and oxygenation). However, in all of the cases, cell kill correlated strongly with the cumulative (1)O(2) luminescence and allowed direct estimation of the (1)O(2) per cell required to achieve a specific level of cell kill. This study supports the validity and potential utility of (1)O(2) luminescence measurement as a dosimetric tool for PDT, as well as confirming the likely role of (1)O(2) in porphyrin-based PDT.","['Niedre, Mark J', 'Secord, Andrea J', 'Patterson, Michael S', 'Wilson, Brian C']","['Niedre MJ', 'Secord AJ', 'Patterson MS', 'Wilson BC']","['Department of Medical Biophysics, Ontario Cancer Institute/University Health Network, 610 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario M5G 2M9, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Aminolevulinic Acid/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Photochemotherapy/*methods', 'Protoporphyrins/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Singlet Oxygen/*analysis/metabolism', 'Spectrum Analysis/methods']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/02/11 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Nov 15;63(22):7986-94.,"['0 (Protoporphyrins)', '17778-80-2 (Singlet Oxygen)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', 'C2K325S808 (protoporphyrin IX)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with AT rapidly inhibited the activity of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, as well as of p70 S6 kinase-1. p70 S6 kinase-1 is known to be a positive regulator of the translation of a group of mRNAs that possesses a long and highly structured 5'-untranslated region (UTR) containing a tract of oligopyrimidines (TOP). Because bcr-abl mRNA was discovered to possess a long and highly structured 5'-UTR containing a 12-pyrimidine TOP sequence in its 5'-UTR, we determined the effect of AT in Jurkat cells with ectopic expression of a 5'-UTR-deleted mutant of the bcr-abl gene, i.e., Jurkat/Bcr-Abl (5'UTR-) cells. Treatment with AT neither lowered the levels of the 5'-UTR-deleted mutant of Bcr-Abl nor induced apoptosis of Jurkat/Bcr-Abl (5'UTR-) cells.

Desmoplastic small round-cell tumor (DSRCT) is an aggressive malignancy associated with the chromosomal translocation t(11;22)(p13;q12). This translocation generates a chimeric transcription factor, EWS-WT1, which consists of the transcriptional activation domain of the Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) protein and the DNA binding domain of the Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) protein. One of the splice variants, EWS-WT1(-KTS) lacks three amino acid residues (Lys-Thr-Ser) in the DNA binding domain and transforms NIH3T3 cells. Therefore, it is likely that aberrant gene expression caused by EWS-WT1(-KTS) is involved in the malignant phenotype of DSRCT. Microarray analysis of 9600 human genes revealed that a gene encoding a tetraspanin-family protein, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia-associated antigen 1 (TALLA-1), was induced in EWS-WT1(-KTS)-expressing cell clones. This induction was EWS-WT1(-KTS)-specific, and more importantly, TALLA-1 protein was expressed in the three independent cases of DSRCT. Tetraspanin-family genes encode transmembrane proteins that regulate various cell processes such as cell adhesion, migration and metastasis. Our findings provide a novel insight into the malignant phenotype of DSRCT, suggesting that TALLA-1 is a useful marker for diagnosis and a potential target for the therapy of DSRCT.","['Ito, Emi', 'Honma, Reiko', 'Imai, Jun-ichi', 'Azuma, Sakura', 'Kanno, Takayuki', 'Mori, Shigeo', 'Yoshie, Osamu', 'Nishio, Jun', 'Iwasaki, Hiroshi', 'Yoshida, Koichi', 'Gohda, Jin', 'Inoue, Jun-Ichiro', 'Watanabe, Shinya', 'Semba, Kentaro']","['Ito E', 'Honma R', 'Imai J', 'Azuma S', 'Kanno T', 'Mori S', 'Yoshie O', 'Nishio J', 'Iwasaki H', 'Yoshida K', 'Gohda J', 'Inoue J', 'Watanabe S', 'Semba K']","['Division of Cancer Genomics, Department of Cancer Biology, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,"['Carcinoma, Small Cell/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peritoneal Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/01/16 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)63573-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9440(10)63573-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2003 Dec;163(6):2165-72. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9440(10)63573-0.,"['0 (EWS1-WT1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",,,,,,,,,PMC1892365,,,,,

METHODS: Semi-quantitative RT-PCR method was used to detect the mRNA expression level of DNMT1, 3A and 3B in bone marrow cells from 75 patients with AL or MDS. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in mRNA expression level of DNMTs between a low-risk MDS group (n = 21) and a normal group.

Current cross-platform comparison of microarray gene expression data are usually based on cross-referencing the annotation of each gene transcript represented on the arrays, extracting a list of genes common to all arrays and comparing expression data of this gene subset. Unfortunately, filtering of genes to a subset represented across all arrays often excludes many thousands of genes, because different subsets of genes from the genome are represented on different arrays. We wish to describe the application of a powerful yet simple method for cross-platform comparison of gene expression data. Co-inertia analysis (CIA) is a multivariate method that identifies trends or co-relationships in multiple datasets which contain the same samples. CIA simultaneously finds ordinations (dimension reduction diagrams) from the datasets that are most similar. It does this by finding successive axes from the two datasets with maximum covariance. CIA can be applied to datasets where the number of variables (genes) far exceeds the number of samples (arrays) such is the case with microarray analyses. RESULTS: We illustrate the power of CIA for cross-platform analysis of gene expression data by using it to identify the main common relationships in expression profiles on a panel of 60 tumour cell lines from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) which have been subjected to microarray studies using both Affymetrix and spotted cDNA array technology. The co-ordinates of the CIA projections of the cell lines from each dataset are graphed in a bi-plot and are connected by a line, the length of which indicates the divergence between the two datasets. Thus, CIA provides graphical representation of consensus and divergence between the gene expression profiles from different microarray platforms. Secondly, the genes that define the main trends in the analysis can be easily identified. CONCLUSIONS: CIA is a robust, efficient approach to coupling of gene expression datasets. CIA provides simple graphical representations of the results making it a particularly attractive method for the identification of relationships between large datasets.","['Culhane, Aedin C', 'Perriere, Guy', 'Higgins, Desmond G']","['Culhane AC', 'Perriere G', 'Higgins DG']","['Department of Biochemistry, Biosciences Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.

We investigated TRAIL sensitivity and the TRAIL-induced apoptosis signalling pathway in a panel of B-lymphocytic leukaemia cell lines. Depending upon TRAIL sensitivity, leukaemia cells could be divided into three groups: highly sensitive, moderately sensitive and resistant. TRAIL receptor-2 (DR5) plays an important role in transducing apoptosis signals. DR5 was internalized into the cytoplasm where it recruited FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD) under TRAIL stimulation in both sensitive and resistant cells. However, the active form of caspase-8 was recruited to FADD and only sensitive cells showed increased caspase-8 activity upon TRAIL stimulation. The caspase-8 specific inhibitor, Z-IETD, impaired caspase-8 activation and completely abrogated TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that TRAIL resistance in B-lymphocytic leukaemia cells is due to negative regulation at the level of caspase-8 activation and that caspase-8 activation is an indispensable process in TRAIL-induced apoptosis. However, FADD-like interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme inhibitory protein (c-FLIPL) was similarly expressed and down-regulated after TRAIL stimulation in both sensitive and resistant cells. Interestingly, in some cell lines, TRAIL sensitivity and caspase-8 activity was enhanced or restored with the treatment of cycloheximide (CHX). In addition, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) levels decreased significantly and rapidly following treatment with CHX. Down-regulation of XIAP may be responsible for enhancement or restoration of TRAIL sensitivity after CHX treatment in B-lymphocytic leukaemia cells.","['Kang, Jian', 'Kisenge, Rodrick R', 'Toyoda, Hidemi', 'Tanaka, Shigeki', 'Bu, Jun', 'Azuma, Eiichi', 'Komada, Yoshihiro']","['Kang J', 'Kisenge RR', 'Toyoda H', 'Tanaka S', 'Bu J', 'Azuma E', 'Komada Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Arabidopsis Proteins/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/pharmacology', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['4699 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04699.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Dec;123(5):921-32. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04699.x.,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Arabidopsis Proteins)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-isoleucyl-glutamyl-threonyl-aspartic acid fluoromethyl', 'ketone)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 1.14.19.- (Fatty Acid Desaturases)', 'EC 1.14.99.- (Fad7 protein, Arabidopsis)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, novel neurotrophin-1 (NNT-1)/B cell-stimulating factor-3 (BSF-3), also reported as cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC), was identified as a cytokine belonging to the gp130 family. BSF-3, similar to IL-6, exerts regulatory effects on normal B cell functions, but its functional significance in haematological malignancies has not been defined. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biological effects and signalling pathways that are induced by BSF-3 in malignant plasma cells. Recombinant human BSF-3 was found to have growth stimulatory activity on plasmacytoma cell lines and primary tumour cells. In addition, BSF-3 was able to protect from Dexamethasone (Dex)-induced apoptosis. BSF-3 stimulated cell growth could not be inhibited by neutralizing anti-IL-6 or anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies, but was abrogated by anti-gp130 antibodies. In INA-6.Tu11 cells, a subline of the IL-6-dependent human plasma cell line INA-6 expressing gp130 and the receptor for leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), stimulation with BSF-3 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). AG490, an inhibitor of Janus kinases, decreased BSF-3 induced cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. This correlated with a reduction of STAT3 phosphorylation levels, while p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation was not affected. In conclusion, BSF-3 is a novel myeloma growth and survival factor with a potential role in the pathophysiology of the disease.","['Burger, Renate', 'Bakker, Frank', 'Guenther, Andreas', 'Baum, Wolfgang', 'Schmidt-Arras, Dirk', 'Hideshima, Teru', 'Tai, Yu-Tzu', 'Shringarpure, Reshma', 'Catley, Laurence', 'Senaldi, Giorgio', 'Gramatzki, Martin', 'Anderson, Kenneth C']","['Burger R', 'Bakker F', 'Guenther A', 'Baum W', 'Schmidt-Arras D', 'Hideshima T', 'Tai YT', 'Shringarpure R', 'Catley L', 'Senaldi G', 'Gramatzki M', 'Anderson KC']","['Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['4686 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04686.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Dec;123(5):869-78. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04686.x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', '0 (cardiotrophin-like cytokine)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A retrospective study to establish whether cCD20 and/or cCD52 were detectable in patients with lymphoma, and the clinical associations of these soluble antigens if detected, was conducted. cCD20 and cCD52 levels were analysed in a cohort of 65 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 37 with Hodgkin's disease (HD). Patients with NHL had elevated pretherapy levels of cCD20 and cCD52 compared with normal individuals. Patients with HD had significantly lower than normal pretherapy levels of both cCD20 and cCD52. cCD20 levels were marginally elevated post-therapy in NHL patients while in patients with HD, cCD20 levels remained significantly lower than normal after therapy. Serum cCD52 levels became significantly lower than normal post-therapy in NHL patients, and remained significantly lower than normal in HD patients. No predictive effects were found for pretherapy or post-therapy levels of cCD52 on survival for either cohort of patients. Post-therapy cCD20 levels independently highly correlated with survival in patients with NHL.

Four of the five remaining and assessable patients entered CR after designed salvage chemotherapy with mitoxantrone and high-dose cytosine arabinoside. Three patients are currently in CR. Three patients died, from treatment toxicity in two cases and progressive disease in one case. One patient relapsed 6 months after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and is still alive. Thus, biphenotypic T-acute leukaemia is clinically frequently associated with mediastinal involvement and the response to conventional chemotherapy used in ALL is poor.

Sixty-three patients (median 71 years, range 60-84 years) were included, constituting 72% of all eligible patients. Toxicity was limited, with no differences between the treatment arms. The early toxic death rate was 11%. The median time to recovery from neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was 22 and 17 d from the start of course no. 1, respectively, and the requirement for platelet and red cell transfusions was four and eight units respectively. Patients had a median of 8 d with fever over 38 degrees C, and 17 d with intravenous antibiotic treatment. The overall complete remission (CR) rate was 62%, with 51% CR from one course of CCI in comparison with 35% for the two-drug therapy (P = 0.014). The median survival with a 2-year follow-up was 14 months, and the 2-year survival was over 30%, with no differences between the treatment arms. Considering the median age and our population-based approach, the overall results are encouraging.","['Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Karlsson, Karin', 'Lofgren, Christina', 'Mollgard, Lars', 'Paul, Christer', 'Tidefelt, Ulf', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus']","['Juliusson G', 'Hoglund M', 'Karlsson K', 'Lofgren C', 'Mollgard L', 'Paul C', 'Tidefelt U', 'Bjorkholm M']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Linkoping, Sweden. gunnar.juliusson@stemcell.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['4702 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04702.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Dec;123(5):810-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04702.x.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,['Leukemia Group of Middle Sweden'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested leukaemic cells obtained from 177 common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (cALL) and 228 AML children at diagnosis. The median 70% lethal dose of l-asparaginase (LD70asp) (U/ml) was 0.46 in the cALL and 6.70 in the AML samples. The median LD70asp among each FAB subtype of AML was 0.76 (M0), 0.46 (M1), 10.00 (M2), 10.00 (M3), 1.18 (M4), 1.35 (M5) and 10.00 (M7). Type M3 samples had the highest LD70asp. The LD70asp of the M2 samples was significantly higher than that of the M1, M4 and M5 samples. When the LD70asp values were classified as low (0.016-0.159), intermediate (0.16-1.59) or high (1.6-10.00), the frequency of low, intermediate or high LD70asp among the M1 samples were similar to those among the cALL samples. In conclusion, cells from AML types M1, M4 and M5 were relatively sensitive to l-asparaginase, and M1 cells were as sensitive as those of cALL, suggesting that l-asparaginase treatment may be effective for these subtypes of AML.","['Okada, Shuichi', 'Hongo, Teruaki', 'Yamada, Sayuri', 'Watanabe, Chieko', 'Fujii, Yuji', 'Ohzeki, Takehiko', 'Horikoshi, Yasuo', 'Ito, Tsuyoshi', 'Yazaki, Makoto', 'Komada, Yoshihiro', 'Tawa, Akio']","['Okada S', 'Hongo T', 'Yamada S', 'Watanabe C', 'Fujii Y', 'Ohzeki T', 'Horikoshi Y', 'Ito T', 'Yazaki M', 'Komada Y', 'Tawa A']","['Department of Paediatrics, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan. sokada@hama-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Sex Factors']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['4703 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04703.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Dec;123(5):802-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04703.x.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE SUMMARY: A 65-year-old Asian woman received investigational treatment with imatinib 300 mg/d as maintenance therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Exfoliative dermatitis developed after 3 weeks of administration. Attempts to resume imatinib at lower dosages, with or without a low-dose corticosteroid, resulted in recurrent reactions. Once-weekly administration of imatinib, however, produced a tolerable, less severe reaction. After the woman had experienced exfoliative dermatitis for 4 months, the reaction subsided and disappeared. DISCUSSION: Once-weekly administration of imatinib allowed imatinib therapy to continue, and this dosing schedule appeared safe. Patients with severe cutaneous reactions who need to continue imatinib may benefit from this strategy, along with lowering of the dosage and premedication with a corticosteroid. CONCLUSIONS: In a patient with recurrent cutaneous reactions due to imatinib, a once-weekly dosing schedule was safe, well tolerated, and associated with eventual disappearance of the reaction.","['Tanvetyanon, Tawee', 'Nand, Sucha']","['Tanvetyanon T', 'Nand S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, IL, USA. ttanve@lumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,IM,"['Administration, Cutaneous', 'Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Dermatitis, Exfoliative/*prevention & control', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Secondary Prevention']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/04/14 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1345/aph.1D184 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2003 Dec;37(12):1818-20. doi: 10.1345/aph.1D184.,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis of cutaneous plasmacytoma presents a degree of difficulty, particularly with the plasmablastic variant, which can mimic hematologic as well as epithelioid malignancies. Approximately 25% of multiple myelomas express CD117 in the bone marrow by flow cytometry. Lysozyme immunoreactivity has been previously shown in 30% of poorly differentiated myelomas, while it is nonreactive in nonmalignant plasma cells. OBJECTIVE: To ascertain whether CD117 and lysozyme can aid in the diagnosis of cutaneous plasmacytomas, particularly the plasmablastic type. DESIGN: Pathology reports of 2357 patients with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma were reviewed to find 13 cutaneous plasmacytomas (8 Bartl grade II, 5 Bartl grade III). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained with CD117 and lysozyme on the Dako Autostainer system.Setting.-Patients with the diagnosis of multiple myeloma who developed cutaneous plasmacytoma(s). RESULTS: The cutaneous plasmacytomas uniformly expressed CD117 in a cytoplasmic or membranous and cytoplasmic distribution with varying degrees of staining intensity unrelated to the Bartl grade of the lesion, while they were uniformly negative for lysozyme. CONCLUSIONS: CD117 is a sensitive marker for malignant plasma cells in paraffin-embedded tissue, while lysozyme does not help identify poorly differentiated malignant plasma cells. While CD117 alone does not distinguish extramedullary myeloid tumor from poorly differentiated myeloma, the combination of CD117 and lysozyme may allow their differentiation. The possibility of c-kit inhibitors being used in the treatment of other hematopoietic malignancies allows speculation regarding implications for the treatment of multiple myeloma.","['Bayer-Garner, Ilene B', 'Schwartz, Mary R', 'Lin, Pei', 'Smoller, Bruce R']","['Bayer-Garner IB', 'Schwartz MR', 'Lin P', 'Smoller BR']","['Department of Pathology, Marshfield Clinic, Marshfield, Wis, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,IM,"['Biomarkers/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Muramidase/*analysis/immunology', 'Plasmacytoma/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*analysis/immunology', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/diagnosis', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology']",2003/11/25 05:00,2003/12/12 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['OA2321 [pii]', '10.5858/2003-127-1596-CBNLIP [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2003 Dec;127(12):1596-8. doi: 10.5858/2003-127-1596-CBNLIP.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human mast cell line 1 (HMC1) derived from a patient with malignant mastocytosis and purified skin mast cells were irradiated with single doses of ultraviolet B or ultraviolet A1, or pretreated with 8-methoxypsoralen prior to ultraviolet A1 exposure. After 0 to 48 h of incubation, the percentage of apoptotic and dead cells was assessed. In HMC1 cells, morphologic features of apoptosis were further evaluated by electron microscopy. All ultraviolet treatment induced apoptosis of HMC1 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Apoptosis was associated with activation of caspase-3, release of cytochrome C, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase, and nuclear accumulation of p53. In contrast, resting skin mast cells were resistant to ultraviolet light induced apoptosis. After incubation with stem cell factor and interleukin-4 for 2 wk, however, slowly proliferating skin mast cells also underwent apoptosis in response to ultraviolet light. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that ultraviolet light directly affects mast cells, but mainly aims at the proliferating mast cells as found in mastocytosis and mast cell dependent pruritic diseases, where increased numbers are observed due to the recruitment mast cell precursors from the blood.","['Guhl, Sven', 'Hartmann, Karin', 'Tapkenhinrichs, Silke', 'Smorodchenko, Alina', 'Grutzkau, Andreas', 'Henz, Beate M', 'Zuberbier, Torsten']","['Guhl S', 'Hartmann K', 'Tapkenhinrichs S', 'Smorodchenko A', 'Grutzkau A', 'Henz BM', 'Zuberbier T']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,IM,"['Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Mast Cells/*cytology/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Mastocytosis', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Skin/cytology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Ultraviolet Rays/adverse effects']",2003/11/25 05:00,2003/12/13 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1046/j.1523-1747.2003.12480.x [doi]', 'S0022-202X(15)30426-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 2003 Oct;121(4):837-44. doi: 10.1046/j.1523-1747.2003.12480.x.,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human and rat OATP-D have moderate amino acid sequence homology with LST-l/rlst-1, the rat oatp family, the prostaglandin transporter, and moatl/MOAT1/KIAA0880/OATP-B. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that OATP-D is branched in a different position from all known organic anion transporters. OATP-D transports prostaglandin E1 (Km 48.5 nM), prostaglandin E2 (Km 55.5 nM), and prostaglandin F2,, suggesting that, functionally, OATP-D encodes a protein that has similar characteristics to those of the prostaglandin transporter. Rat OATP-D also transports prostaglandins. The expression pattern of OATP-D mRNA was abundant mainly in the heart, testis, brain, and some cancer cells.

One of the main indications for the use of apheresis is in the treatment of the hyperviscosity syndromes that can result from either the presence of abnormal plasma components, such as antibodies, immune complexes, paraproteins, and cryoglobulins, or the excessive increase in blood cells as seen in polycythemia, leukemias, and myeloproliferative diseases. Apheresis involves withdrawal of anticoagulated blood via a vascular catheter, separation of different blood components by either centrifugation or membrane filtration, removal of the undesired component, and reinfusion of the remaining components with replacement fluid into the patient. The centrifugal method can be intermittent or continuous, the latter being faster and fully automated, and is principally used in North America. The membrane filtration technique, mainly used in Europe and Japan, involves the filtration of blood by filters of different pore sizes. These are used sequentially in a process called double or cascade filtration, enabling removal of specific plasma pathogens without need for replacement fluids. In paraproteinemias, hyperviscosity syndrome is most commonly seen with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, followed by immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgG (3) multiple myeloma. Single plasmapheresis with one plasma volume replacement (about 3 L) usually results in a dramatic improvement in patients with macrogobulinemia because of its predominant intravascular distribution, whereas repeated plasmapheresis is necessary with other types of paraproteins. Cryofiltration apheresis using a high-capacity cryofilter is specific for the removal of cryoglobulins. In leukemias with hyperleukocytosis, there are no evidence-based guidelines for use of leukapheresis, but it is commonly initiated when white blood cells (WBC) are > 100,000/microL or even with lower counts if leukostasis symptoms are present, especially in acute myeloid leukemia. Erythrocytapheresis and plateletpheresis are mostly used in the acute management of symptomatic patients with polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis, and sickle cell disease.","['Zarkovic, Mirjana', 'Kwaan, Hau C']","['Zarkovic M', 'Kwaan HC']","['Hematology/Oncology Division, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Semin Thromb Hemost,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,0431155,IM,"['Blood Component Removal/adverse effects/instrumentation/*methods', '*Blood Viscosity', 'Hematologic Diseases/blood/therapy', 'Humans']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/06/25 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2003-44560 [doi]'],ppublish,Semin Thromb Hemost. 2003 Oct;29(5):535-42. doi: 10.1055/s-2003-44560.,,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several clusters of genes significantly discriminated the 3 histologic subtypes. Genes associated with cell adhesion, angiogenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis were up-regulated in SLL. Genes associated with intracellular signaling via the AKT1 pathway were up-regulated in splenic MZL. Genes associated with cell cycle control and multidrug resistance were up-regulated in MCL.

An appropriate assay should not only allow the quantitative analysis of rapid cell death induction as measured by the conventional 51Cr release assay but also of the more slowly executing pathways of T-cell-induced apoptosis occurring within days instead of hours which cannot be measured using this method. Furthermore, it should dissect the differential susceptibility to T-cell-induced cell death of various target cell subpopulations and characterize the malignant precursor cells capable of producing malignant progeny. To fulfill these requirements we developed a new assay based on carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labeling of the target cell population combined with antibody staining of specific cell populations and addition of fluorescent microbeads to quantitatively monitor target cell death occurring within a longer time frame up to at least 5 days. This new assay facilitates the analysis of differential recognition of distinct cell types within a heterogeneous target cell population and allows simultaneously evaluation of the proliferative status of surviving target cells in response to relevant cytokines.","['Jedema, Inge', 'van der Werff, Nicole M', 'Barge, Renee M Y', 'Willemze, Roel', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik']","['Jedema I', 'van der Werff NM', 'Barge RM', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands. i.jedema@lumc.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20031120,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Division', 'Clone Cells', '*Fluoresceins', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'HLA-D Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Preleukemia/*immunology/pathology', '*Succinimides', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/05/12 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-06-2070 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43878-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Apr 1;103(7):2677-82. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-06-2070.

Segregation analyses in several F2 crosses showed that splenomegaly segregates as a single recessive trait caused by a novel mutation in BXH-2, independent of the infection. Histologic and fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analyses indicated that splenomegaly is associated with a large increase in Mac1+/GR1+ (macrophage antigen-1+/granulocyte differentiation antigen 1+) granulocyte precursors in spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow, resembling a myeloproliferative syndrome. This is concomitant to extramedullary erythropoiesis in the spleen, as measured by proportion of Ter119+ erythroid cells. The locus controlling this myeloproliferative syndrome and splenomegaly was designated Myls and maps to an 18 centimorgan (cM) region of chromosome 8, which also contains an integrated copy of an N-ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV) provirus (Emv2). The relationship between Myls, expansion of Mac1+/GR1+ cells, and Emv2 was investigated. Homozygosity at Myls is necessary but not sufficient for B-ecotropic virus replication in splenocytes, the extent of which appears to be under separate genetic control. Our results suggest a model in which Myls-dependent myeloproliferation in BXH-2 acts as a predisposing factor for the subsequent development of virally induced myeloid leukemia characteristic of this strain.","['Turcotte, Karine', 'Gauthier, Susan', 'Mitsos, Loukia-Maria', 'Shustik, Chaim', 'Copeland, Neal G', 'Jenkins, Nancy A', 'Fournet, Jean-Christophe', 'Jolicoeur, Paul', 'Gros, Philippe']","['Turcotte K', 'Gauthier S', 'Mitsos LM', 'Shustik C', 'Copeland NG', 'Jenkins NA', 'Fournet JC', 'Jolicoeur P', 'Gros P']","['Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada H3G 1Y6.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20031120,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cation Transport Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*growth & development', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/immunology/virology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mycobacterium bovis', 'Retroviridae Infections/*genetics/immunology', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Splenomegaly/genetics/pathology', 'Tuberculosis/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*genetics/immunology', 'Virus Replication']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/04/16 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-06-1852 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50032-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Mar 15;103(6):2343-50. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-06-1852.

We here report that primary acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells express high levels of the leptin-receptor (OB-R) long isoform. In cells with regulated promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor (PML-RARalpha) expression, inducing PML-RARalpha was found to increase OB-R levels. We then investigated the effects of leptin produced by BM adipocytes on APL cells using a coculture system with mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived adipocytes. In PML-RARalpha-expressing cells, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)- and doxorubicin-induced apoptosis were significantly reduced by coculture with adipocyte-differentiated MSCs. This antiapoptotic effect required direct cell-to-cell interactions, was associated with phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and was reduced by blocking OB-R. This report provides a mechanistic basis for the BM adipocyte-leukemia cell interaction and suggests that OB-R receptor blockade may have therapeutic use in APL.","['Tabe, Yoko', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Munsell, Mark F', 'Marini, Frank C', 'Zompetta, Claudia', 'McQueen, Teresa', 'Tsao, Twee', 'Zhao, Shourong', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Igari, Jun', 'Estey, Elihu H', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Tabe Y', 'Konopleva M', 'Munsell MF', 'Marini FC', 'Zompetta C', 'McQueen T', 'Tsao T', 'Zhao S', 'Pierce S', 'Igari J', 'Estey EH', 'Andreeff M']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20031120,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adipocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Coculture Techniques', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leptin/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*biosynthesis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Leptin', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/04/21 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-03-0802 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50097-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Mar 1;103(5):1815-22. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-03-0802.

Early identification of nonresponders would minimize toxicity and/or facilitate more effective strategies. The aim of this study was to identify a minimally invasive method for early prediction of response and relapse. Flow cytometric monitoring was performed in 887 blood samples and 201 marrow samples from 43 patients undergoing intravenous alemtuzumab therapy. Although the absolute lymphocytosis was resolved in all patients by week 4, significant depletion of bone marrow tumor only occurred if circulating B-lymphocyte counts were persistently less than 0.001 x 10(9)/L, which was rare in nonresponders. The majority of patients (16/28) who did not benefit from a full course of therapy were identified with 100% positive predictive value using the following algorithm: peripheral B-cell count greater than 0.001 x 10(9)/L at week 2 with less than 1 log depletion of circulating B cells between weeks 2 and 4. Monitoring CLL levels after treatment identified patients at risk of early disease progression and could potentially improve patient management. During alemtuzumab therapy, bone marrow CLL depletion only occurs after abrogation of circulating tumor, requiring close monitoring of circulating B-cell levels. If validated in prospective studies, blood monitoring at 2 and 4 weeks may be used to optimize therapy.","['Rawstron, Andy C', 'Kennedy, Ben', 'Moreton, Paul', 'Dickinson, Anita J', 'Cullen, Matthew J', 'Richards, Stephen J', 'Jack, Andrew S', 'Hillmen, Peter']","['Rawstron AC', 'Kennedy B', 'Moreton P', 'Dickinson AJ', 'Cullen MJ', 'Richards SJ', 'Jack AS', 'Hillmen P']","['Academic Unit of Haematology and Oncology, Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service, Leeds General Infirmary, United Kingdom. andy.rawstone@hmds.org.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20031120,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/04/16 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-10-3270 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)49992-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Mar 15;103(6):2027-31. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-10-3270.

Nine genetic subtypes have been described for FA (A, B, C, D1, D2, E, F, G, and L), all of which have been connected to distinct disease genes, except B. Here we report on 8 unrelated FA patients who were excluded from the known subtypes on the basis of phenotypic correction or genetic data. Four of these cell lines failed to complement each other in somatic cell hybrids and therefore represent a new group, termed FA-I. The remaining cell lines complemented group FA-I but did not complement each other, thus representing a second new group, FA-J. Both FA-I and -J cell lines were capable of forming an FA multiprotein core complex. This complex is required for activation of the FANCD2 protein by mono-ubiquitination, a key downstream event in the FA pathway. In FA-I cells FANCD2 was not mono-ubiquitinated, indicating a defect upstream in the FA pathway, whereas in FA-J cells FANCD2 was mono-ubiquitinated, indicating a downstream defect. Our results suggest that the FA pathway of genome stabilization may be controlled by at least 11 different genes, including FANCI and FANCJ.","['Levitus, Marieke', 'Rooimans, Martin A', 'Steltenpool, Jurgen', 'Cool, Nicolle F C', 'Oostra, Anneke B', 'Mathew, Christopher G', 'Hoatlin, Maureen E', 'Waisfisz, Quinten', 'Arwert, Fre', 'de Winter, Johan P', 'Joenje, Hans']","['Levitus M', 'Rooimans MA', 'Steltenpool J', 'Cool NF', 'Oostra AB', 'Mathew CG', 'Hoatlin ME', 'Waisfisz Q', 'Arwert F', 'de Winter JP', 'Joenje H']","['Department of Clinical Genetics and Human Genetics, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20031120,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fanconi Anemia/*classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Genes, Recessive', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Humans', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Transfection']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/05/12 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-08-2915 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43853-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Apr 1;103(7):2498-503. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-08-2915.

We demonstrate that Hu1D10 induces caspase-independent apoptosis following secondary cross-linking in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and signal transduction, as evidenced by phosphorylation of Syk and AKT, were noted. The source of the Hu1D10-induced ROS was examined using the Raji lymphoblastic cell line with engineered defects in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Hu1D10 treatment of clones with deficient mitochondrial respiration produced ROS suggesting a cytoplasmic source. Administration of ROS scavengers to primary CLL cells prior to Hu1D10 treatment diminished AKT activation. Treatment with Hu1D10 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 demonstrated in vitro synergy with enhanced apoptosis. In conjunction with an ongoing clinical trial, blood samples were collected following intravenous infusion of Hu1D10 and analyzed for phosphorylation of AKT. Two of 3 patient samples showed a sustained increase in AKT phosphorylation following Hu1D10 administration. These data suggest that Hu1D10 ligation in CLL cells induces death and survival signals for which combination therapies may be designed to greatly enhance efficiency of both Hu1D10 and other class II antibodies in development.","['Mone, Andrew P', 'Huang, Peng', 'Pelicano, Helene', 'Cheney, Carolyn M', 'Green, Jennifer M', 'Tso, J Yun', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Jefferson, Sara', 'Lin, Thomas S', 'Byrd, John C']","['Mone AP', 'Huang P', 'Pelicano H', 'Cheney CM', 'Green JM', 'Tso JY', 'Johnson AJ', 'Jefferson S', 'Lin TS', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, The Ohio State University, Columbus 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20031120,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Electron Transport', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/04/21 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-08-2836 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50101-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Mar 1;103(5):1846-54. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-08-2836.

To determine whether Mll genomic fusions can occur after exposure to topoisomerase II inhibitors, we developed a long-distance inverse PCR DNA-based assay for chimeric Mll fusions in mouse embryonic stem cells. We detected Mll fusions at a higher frequency following 100 microM etoposide for 8 h (16x10(-6) cell(-1)) than in no-drug controls (1.0x10(-6) cell(-1), P=0.0002) or after treatment with a comparably cytotoxic exposure to the antimicrotubule drug vincristine (1.0x10(-6) cell(-1), P=0.0047). The fusion points in Mll chimeric products induced by etoposide were localized to a 1.5 kb region between exons 9 and 11, analogous to the MLL breakpoint cluster region in human leukemia. All 49 Mll fusion partners analyzed matched known genomic murine sequences, with 40 (82%) matching annotated genes covering eighteen murine autosomes. One partner was Runx1, the murine homologue of the transcription factor AML-1, a target of human translocations in therapy-related leukemia. These findings indicate that etoposide triggers the formation of Mll gene fusions, a critical step for the development of treatment-induced leukemic transformation.","['Blanco, Javier G', 'Edick, Mathew J', 'Relling, Mary V']","['Blanco JG', 'Edick MJ', 'Relling MV']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20031120,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*toxicity', 'Artificial Gene Fusion', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/toxicity', 'Etoposide/*toxicity', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/genetics', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', '*Transcription Factors']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/02/11 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1096/fj.03-0638fje [doi]', '03-0638fje [pii]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2004 Jan;18(1):173-5. doi: 10.1096/fj.03-0638fje.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 1988 and December 2000, 431 men with Stage I seminoma were treated with para-aortic radiation to a midplane dose of 20 Gy in 8 fractions over 10 days. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 62 months, 15 patients (3.5%) had relapsed, with a median time to relapse of 13 months (range: 9 to 39 months). Nine patients had pelvic nodal relapse; in addition, 1 patient had para-aortic involvement, and 2 had distant disease. Four had metastatic disease only (mediastinum 2, lung 2). One patient had scrotal recurrence, and 1 was treated for progressive rise in human chorionic gonadotrophin without identifiable disease. Initial treatment at relapse was chemotherapy (12), radiation (2), and surgery (1). One patient died from progressive disease. Thirteen men (3%) have developed second malignancies, including 7 contralateral testicular tumors, 5 solid malignancies, and 1 leukemia. The overall 5-year survival was 98%, and the estimated recurrence-free survival at 5 years was 96.3%. On log-rank univariate analysis, lymphovascular invasion, involvement of the tunica, and a preoperative human chorionic gonadotrophin level of greater than 5 were found to be of prognostic significance for recurrence.

There is a significant difference in cell death of HL-60 cells that was detected between baicalein-treated and untreated groups. Furthermore, there was a further significant increase in apoptosis induction when cells were treated with baicalein compared to without baicalein treated groups. Flow cytometric assays and DNA fragmentation gel electrophoresis also confirmed baicalein induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Baicalein also promoted caspase-3 activity then leading to cleavage of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase finally leading to DNA fragmentation occurrence. Furthermore, the baicalein-induced apoptosis was markedly blocked by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk.

In the ECM invasion assay IL-18 significantly up-regulated transmigration of HL-60 cells, which in turn was inhibited by a synthetic MMP inhibitor: O-phenanthroline (o-PE), anti-MMP-9, anti-MMP-2 as well as anti-IL-18 monoclonal antibody (McAb), respectively, suggesting that induction of gelatinases by IL-18 leads to ECM degradation by these cells. Moreover, IL-18 could significantly increase MMP-9 but not MMP-2 production at both mRNA and/or protein level, slightly up-regulate TIMP-1 mRNA, and clearly induce TIMP-2 mRNA secretion.

HTLV-I transformed T-cell lines and fresh ATL cells are characterized by constitutive activation of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) signaling pathway however, the mechanism(s) responsible for constitutive IL-2R activation are unknown. To further examine the cause of this signaling pathway deregulation, we measured mRNA and protein expression levels by real-time PCR and Western blots, respectively, of four negative regulators of the IL-2R signaling pathway including src homology 2 (SH2)-containing phosphatase (SHP1), cytokine-inducible (CIS) SH2-containing protein, suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1) and protein inhibitor of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (PIAS3) in six HTLV-1 negative and seven HTLV-1 positive T-cell leukemia lines. The activation status of the JAK/STAT pathway was also examined. SHP1 mRNA and protein expression levels were selectively down regulated in all HTLV-1-infected transformed cell lines, while CIS, SOCS1, and PIAS3 protein expression were markedly but variably upregulated and the cells showed evidence of constitutive STAT3 activation. In acutely HTLV-1 infected primary CD4+ T-cells there was a gradual loss of SHP1 expression over 10 weeks in culture which correlated with progression from immortalization to transformation and loss of IL-2 dependence for growth. Two transformed cell lines that were established following HTLV-1 infection showed loss of SHP1 expression and overexpression of CIS, SOCS1, PIAS3. However, this overexpression was not adequate to block constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Thus, multiple levels of IL-2 receptor signal deregulation are found in HTLV-1 transformed cells, which may be a result of early loss of SHP1 expression.","['Cheng, Jihua', 'Zhang, Dongsheng', 'Zhou, Changhong', 'Marasco, Wayne A']","['Cheng J', 'Zhang D', 'Zhou C', 'Marasco WA']","['Department of Cancer Immunology & AIDS, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, 44 Binney Street, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adult', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/virology', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'HTLV-I Infections/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/metabolism', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Janus Kinase 3', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/02/18 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212603001589 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00158-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2004 Jan;28(1):71-82. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00158-9.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Socs1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (cytokine inducible SH2-containing protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn6 protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cases were excluded because they received different treatment. The overall complete remission (CR) rate post-induction therapy with Ara-C and daunorubicin (DNR) was 60% with a median disease free survival (DFS) of 72 weeks, and a median overall survival (OS) of 54 weeks. At diagnosis, CD34, deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), CD7, CD56, HLADR and CD19 were expressed in 65, 19, 32, 15, 87 and 5%, respectively, of 379 evaluable cases. CD34 positive patients had a significantly lower CR rate (P=0.0003) than CD34 negative patients and there was a trend to a lower remission rate in HLADR positive patients (P=0.067). In multi-variate analysis, co-expression of CD34 and HLADR was an independent adverse factor for achieving CR (P=0.0364). CD56 expression was associated with a significantly shorter overall survival (P=0.0262), but did not affect remission rate or disease free survival. Neither TdT nor CD7 expression was associated with treatment outcome. Age (60 years or older) and cytogenetic features (classified by favorable, intermediate and unfavorable groups) were associated with a lower CR rate, shorter disease free survival and shorter OS. Patients with higher white cell counts (WBC) also had a significantly lower remission rate (P=0.0064) and OS (P=0.0127). We propose a prognostic score for achieving CR in AML patients based on age, WBC, cytogenetics and CD34/HLADR status as four independent factors. Defined by number of factors, this score system may help to stratify AML patients to alternative treatment for better outcome.","['Chang, Hong', 'Salma, Fariha', 'Yi, Qin-long', 'Patterson, Bruce', 'Brien, Bill', 'Minden, Mark D']","['Chang H', 'Salma F', 'Yi QL', 'Patterson B', 'Brien B', 'Minden MD']","['Department of Laboratory Hematology, Princess Margaret Hospital/University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ont, Canada M5G 2M9. hong.chang@uhn.on.ca']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*analysis', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/02/18 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212603001802 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00180-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2004 Jan;28(1):43-8. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00180-2.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifty-one children (40%) had EMI at diagnosis and 27% of these showed multiple site involvement. Twenty-seven of 127 children (21%) presented myeloid tumors. No age related differences in the incidence of EMI was noted. However, analysis of clinical and biological features at diagnosis showed that WBC count > or =50 x 10(9) l(-1), hepatosplenomegaly >5 cm, FAB AML-M4 and AML-M5 subtypes and CD13, CD14 expression of bone marrow (BM) leukemic cells (>20%) were more frequent in children with EMI. Two consecutive treatment protocols were used. In both protocols remission was achieved with combined high-dose methylprednisolone (HDMP) as a differentiating and apoptosis inducing agent with mild cytotoxic chemotherapy (low-dose cytosine arabinoside (LD Ara-C), weekly mitoxantrone and Ara-C or 6-thioguanine). Administration of short-course (4-7 days) HDMP (20-30 mg/kg per day) alone resulted in a remarkable decrease in peripheral blood, BM blasts and in the size of EMI in responding patients. In both protocols, remission rate in patients with EMI was 71 and 80%, which was lower than that of the patients without EMI (87 and 89%). This may be attributed to the higher frequency of unfavorable features in children with EMI. However, in patients who presented with myeloblastoma and treated with a more intensive post-remission therapy (AML-94), the 4-year disease-free survival (DFS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates were not found to be significantly different from children who had no EMI (P>0.05). Whereas, the outcome of children who presented with gingival infiltration did not improve. In further studies, the prognostic significance of different localisation of EMI and the effect of addition of HDMP to cytotoxic chemotherapy should be explored in larger series.","['Hicsonmez, Gonul', 'Cetin, Mualla', 'Tuncer, A Murat', 'Yenicesu, Idil', 'Aslan, Deniz', 'Ozyurek, Emel', 'Unal, Selma']","['Hicsonmez G', 'Cetin M', 'Tuncer AM', 'Yenicesu I', 'Aslan D', 'Ozyurek E', 'Unal S']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Ihsan Dogramaci Children's Hospital, Hacettepe University, Ankara 06100, Turkey. gsonmez@haceteppe.edu.tr""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'CD13 Antigens/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*diagnosis', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/02/18 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212603001590 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00159-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2004 Jan;28(1):25-34. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(03)00159-0.,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nuclear staining with propidium iodide and DNA analysis by flow cytometry were used to identify apoptosis and cell cycle distribution. By the MTT and BrdU tests, both NIV and DON were significantly more toxic than FB1 by at least one order of magnitude, with ID50s ranging from 0.5 microM for NIV to 70 microM for FB1. The MTT test indicated that NIV was significantly (approximately four times) more toxic than DON. In contrast, the Trypan Blue test did not reveal any effects of mycotoxin exposure suggesting that, at the concentrations tested, NIV, DON and FB1 did not induce cytotoxicity through plasma membrane damage. Cell cycle analysis suggested apoptotic cytotoxicity, revealing 100% cellular debris at the highest concentrations of NIV and DON and approximately 2.9 times more debris than control at the highest FB1 concentration. Morphological evidence of apoptosis was related to the toxicity of the substances, such that the more toxic NIV and DON resulted in more late stage apoptotic events than FB1. This study suggests that human blood cells are sensitive to mycotoxin exposure, that NIV is more toxic than DON which is more toxic than FB1, and that DNA damage and apoptosis rather than plasma membrane damage and necrosis may be responsible for the observed cytotoxicity.","['Minervini, F', 'Fornelli, F', 'Flynn, K M']","['Minervini F', 'Fornelli F', 'Flynn KM']","['Istituto di Scienze delle Produzioni Alimentari, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Viale Einaudi, 51, 70125 Bari, Italy.fiorena.minervini@ispa.cnr.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Physiological Phenomena/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Cycloheximide/adverse effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fumonisins/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Mycotoxins/*adverse effects', 'Tetrazolium Salts/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Trichothecenes/*adverse effects', 'Trypan Blue/metabolism/pharmacology']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0887233303001309 [pii]', '10.1016/s0887-2333(03)00130-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2004 Feb;18(1):21-8. doi: 10.1016/s0887-2333(03)00130-9.,"['0 (Fumonisins)', '0 (Mycotoxins)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Trichothecenes)', '3ZZM97XZ32 (fumonisin B1)', '5WOP02RM1U (nivalenol)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)', 'JT37HYP23V (deoxynivalenol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we have reexamined the rarely used cesium salt, cesium trifluoroacetate, for the same purpose. A significant advantage of CsTFA lies in the fact that, unlike in CsCl, RNA can be recovered from a single, soluble fraction of the CsTFA gradient. Furthermore, unlike CsCl, CsTFA is freely soluble in ethanol so that co-precipitation of the salt in the recovered RNA upon alcohol precipitation does not take place. Hence, the RNA is recovered with minimum manipulations. The one-step separation of cellular macromolecule classes free of each other in small amount of starting materials provides a major advantage over other methods currently in use.","['Zhang, Hong', 'Chen, Huang-Tsu', 'Glisin, Vladimir']","['Zhang H', 'Chen HT', 'Glisin V']","['Nuvelo Inc., 675 Almanor Ave., Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient/*methods', 'DNA/chemistry/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Kidney/embryology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Proteins/chemistry/*isolation & purification', 'RNA/chemistry/*isolation & purification', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Trifluoroacetic Acid/*chemistry']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/02/21 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X03020060 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2003.09.246 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2003 Dec 5;312(1):131-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2003.09.246.,"['0 (Proteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'E5R8Z4G708 (Trifluoroacetic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DCs have been shown to induce strong antitumour immune responses both in vitro and in vivo. One way of providing the DCs with all relevant tumour antigens would be to incubate the DCs with material from dead tumour cells. We have examined the uptake of apoptotic and necrotic K562 leukaemia cells by DCs under different culture conditions. Results from coincubation experiments strongly suggested that uptake of apoptotic K562 cells was dependent upon the addition of autologous serum (AS). Under these conditions, 47-79% of all DCs were shown to ingest apoptotic material. AS also seemed to be important for the expression of functionally important markers, most notably HLA class I, CD86, CCR7 and CD83. The vast majority of DCs were shown to ingest necrotic material from K562 cells, with no additional effect of AS. The results suggest that incubation of DCs with apoptotic material for cell therapeutic purposes may best be performed in the presence of AS.","['Dalgaard, J', 'Beckstrom, K J', 'Brinchmann, J E']","['Dalgaard J', 'Beckstrom KJ', 'Brinchmann JE']","['Institute of Immunology, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Oslo, Norway. jakob.dalgaard@labmed.uio.no']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'K562 Cells/*pathology', 'Necrosis', 'Serum/*physiology']",2003/11/25 05:00,2003/12/12 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['1332 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-3083.2003.01332.x [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 2003 Nov;58(5):541-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-3083.2003.01332.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, AFM imaging is presented for two different RNA molecules able to self-assemble into complex supramolecular architectures. The first one is a molecular dimer of a 230-nt RNA fragment coming from the RNA genome of a murine leukaemia virus. The monomeric RNA fragment, which appears by AFM as an elongated structure with a mean aspect ratio of 1.4, assembles into a dimer of elongated structures through the formation of a 'kissing-loop' RNA interaction. The second one is a large supramolecular fibre formed of artificial self-assembling RNA molecular units called tectoRNA. The fibre lengths by AFM suggest that there are 50-70 tectoRNA units per fibre. Some methods and limitations are presented for measuring molecular volumes from AFM images.","['Hansma, H G', 'Oroudjev, E', 'Baudrey, S', 'Jaeger, L']","['Hansma HG', 'Oroudjev E', 'Baudrey S', 'Jaeger L']","['Department of Physics and Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA. hhansma@physics.ucsb.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,England,J Microsc,Journal of microscopy,0204522,IM,"['Animals', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/chemistry/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force/*methods', 'Nanotechnology', 'RNA/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Virus Assembly']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/02/20 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['1276 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2818.2003.01276.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Microsc. 2003 Dec;212(Pt 3):273-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2818.2003.01276.x.,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The frequency rate of visceral mycoses with leukemia and MDS was 27.9% (435/1557) in 1989, 23.0% (319/1388) in 1993 and 22.3% (246/1105) in 1997. In comparing the rate of mycoses in recipients of organ or bone marrow transplantation with that of non-recipients, that of recipients was approximately 10% higher. The predominant causative agents were Candida and Aspergillus, at approximately the same rate as in 1989. The rate of candidosis decreased to one-half that of aspergillosis by 1993. Furthermore, severe mycotic infections clearly increased from 58.9% in 1989 to 75.6% in 1997. Among a total of 1000 cases with mycotic infection in those 3 years, acute lymphatic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia were the major diseases (40.6% and 34.8%, respectively), followed by MDS (26.1%). The reasons for increased rates of aspergillosis and of severe mycotic infection can be surmised to be: (i) candidosis had become controllable by prophylaxis and by empiric therapy for mycoses with effective antifungal drugs; (ii) the marketed antifungal drugs were not sufficiently effective against severe infections or Aspergillus infections; and (iii) the number of patients surviving in an immunocompromised state had increased due to developments in chemotherapy and progress in medical care.","['Kume, Hikaru', 'Yamazaki, Toshikazu', 'Abe, Michiko', 'Tanuma, Hiroyuki', 'Okudaira, Masahiko', 'Okayasu, Isao']","['Kume H', 'Yamazaki T', 'Abe M', 'Tanuma H', 'Okudaira M', 'Okayasu I']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kitasato University, Kanagawa, Japan. mykume@mug.biglobe.ne.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aspergillosis/complications/*epidemiology', 'Autopsy/*statistics & numerical data', 'Candidiasis/complications/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cryptococcosis/complications/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/complications/*epidemiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications', 'Pathology, Clinical/statistics & numerical data', 'Zygomycosis/complications/epidemiology']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/07/29 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['1548 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1440-1827.2003.01548.x [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Int. 2003 Nov;53(11):744-50. doi: 10.1046/j.1440-1827.2003.01548.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three cell lines, human leukaemia T-cells (Jurkat), rat fibroblasts (3T3) and human neuroblastoma cells (IMR-32), were cultured for 48 h in control medium, in zinc-deficient medium (1.5 microM zinc; 1.5 Zn), or in the zinc-deficient medium supplemented with 15 microM zinc (15 Zn). The number of viable cells was lower in the 1.5 Zn group than in the control and 15 Zn groups. The frequency of apoptosis was higher in the 1.5 Zn group than in the control and 15 Zn groups. Membrane fluidity was evaluated using the 6-(9-anthroyloxy)stearic acid and 16-(9-anthroyloxy)palmitic acid probes. Membrane fluidity was higher in 1.5 Zn cells than in the control cells; no differences were observed between control cells and 15 Zn cells. The effect of zinc deficiency on membrane fluidity at the water/lipid interface was associated with a higher phosphatidylserine externalization. The higher membrane fluidity in the hydrophobic region of the bilayer was correlated with a lower content of arachidonic acid. We suggest that the increased fluidity of the membrane secondary to zinc deficiency is in part due to a decrease in arachidonic acid content and the apoptosis-related changes in phosphatidylserine distribution.","['Verstraeten, Sandra V', 'Zago, M Paola', 'MacKenzie, Gerardo G', 'Keen, Carl L', 'Oteiza, Patricia I']","['Verstraeten SV', 'Zago MP', 'MacKenzie GG', 'Keen CL', 'Oteiza PI']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, IQUIFIB (UBA-CONICET), School of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Buenos Aires, Junin 956, C1113AAD, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Aminoquinolines/chemistry', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Membrane/*chemistry', 'Cell Survival', 'Fatty Acids/analysis', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Membrane Fluidity', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylserines/analysis', 'Tosyl Compounds/chemistry', 'Zinc/analysis/deficiency/*physiology']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/05/20 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/11/14 00:00 [revised]', '2003/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1042/BJ20031054 [doi]', 'BJ20031054 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2004 Mar 1;378(Pt 2):579-87. doi: 10.1042/BJ20031054.,"['0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Tosyl Compounds)', '7SWW052N6R (N-(6-methoxy-8-quinolyl)-4-toluenesulfonamide)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",,,,['HD 01743/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,PMC1223981,,,,,

The cells lack expression of classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A and -B alleles but express some HLA-C, and non-classical HLA-G and -E. Upon binding to killing inhibitory receptor on natural killer (NK) cells, HLA-G prevents activation of cytolytic activity. We investigated whether Jeg3 cells are capable of immune stimulation after complementation with classical HLA and T cell costimulatory signal CD80. METHOD OF STUDY: Jeg3 cells were transduced to express HLA-A*0201 and/or CD80. Parental Jeg3 or transfectants Jeg3-A2, Jeg3-CD80 or Jeg3-CD80-A2 were used to stimulate allogeneic resting and activated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). The different cell lines were loaded with a HLA-A2-restricted Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) recall antigen peptide epitope and antigen presenting ability was examined. T cell lines specific for Jeg3 and transfectants were generated from HLA-A2 matched and nonmatched donors and compared for expansion, phenotypes and cytolytic activity. RESULTS: While all Jeg3 cell lines induced only marginal proliferation of resting T cells, phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated T cells were stimulated by CD80 or CD80-A2 expressing Jeg3. Only the transfectant Jeg3-CD80-A2 was capable of specific T cell stimulation by EBV recall antigen presentation. T cell lines of HLA-A2 non-matched donors stimulated with the Jeg3 transfectants showed significant expansion only when HLA-A2 and the costimulus CD80 were present. T cells from HLA-A2 positive donors did not expand significantly or differentially. No NK cells grew under any condition. In Jeg3-CD80-A2 stimulated T cells lines CD8+ cells expanded preferentially. These T cells exerted cytolytic activity toward all Jeg3 cell lines. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that, in spite of immunosuppressive mechanisms, proliferative and cytolytic T cell responses are induced by Jeg3 cells when classical HLA- and/or costimulatory signals are present on the cells.","['Koc, Serpil', 'Kather, Angela', 'Markert, Udo R', 'Durst, Matthias', 'Schneider, Achim', 'Kaufmann, Andreas M']","['Koc S', 'Kather A', 'Markert UR', 'Durst M', 'Schneider A', 'Kaufmann AM']","['Abteilung fur Frauenheilkunde, Gynakologische Molekularbiologie, Frauenklinik, FSU Jena, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Denmark,Am J Reprod Immunol,"American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y. : 1989)",8912860,IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'B7-1 Antigen/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'HLA-A Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'HLA-A2 Antigen', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/04/17 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1600-0897.2003.00072.x [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Reprod Immunol. 2003 Sep;50(3):243-53. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0897.2003.00072.x.,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its receptor is expressed highly throughout the reproductive tract. Cytokines have an important role in preparing the endometrium for implantation and leptin is known to modulate cytokine production in other tissues. We, therefore, investigated the possible role of leptin in endometrial growth and function. METHOD OF STUDY: Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry were used to determine the pattern of expression of leptin receptor isoforms in primary human endometrial epithelial and stromal cells in culture. The effect of leptin on cell growth and on the production of cytokines [Leukaemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), interleukin 6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha] and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) (MMP2 and MMP-9) was also investigated. RESULTS: Expression of the long form of the leptin was restricted to the cultured endometrial, epithelial cells. Both cultured endometrial stromal and epithelial cells expressed the short and variant isoforms of the receptor. Incubation of epithelial and stromal cell cultures with varying concentrations of leptin (0-1000 ng/mL) had no significant effect on cell growth or levels of MMP-2 or MMP-9 production. Leptin also had no significant effect on cytokine production by epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows for the first time, the presence of leptin receptor isoforms on endometrial, epithelial and stromal cells in culture. Leptin had no effect on cytokine and MMP production by these cells. However, it is possible that leptin affects other factors within the endometrium not investigated here.","['Quinton, N D', 'Laird, S M', 'Tuckerman, E M', 'Cork, B A', 'Li, T C', 'Blakemore, A I F']","['Quinton ND', 'Laird SM', 'Tuckerman EM', 'Cork BA', 'Li TC', 'Blakemore AI']","[""Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Leeds, St James' University Hospital, Leeds, UK. n.d.quinton@leeds.ac.uk""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Denmark,Am J Reprod Immunol,"American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y. : 1989)",8912860,IM,"['Adult', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Endometrium/drug effects/*enzymology/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leptin/*pharmacology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/*biosynthesis', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Leptin']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/04/17 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1600-0897.2003.00071.x [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Reprod Immunol. 2003 Sep;50(3):224-31. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0897.2003.00071.x.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (LEPR protein, human)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Leptin)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the epidemiological evidence in total suggests no increased risk of cancer, the results cannot be unequivocally interpreted in terms of cause and effect. The results are inconsistent, and most studies are limited by lack of detail on actual exposures, short follow-up periods, and the limited ability to deal with other relevant factors. In some studies, there may be substantial biases in the data used. For these same reasons, the studies are unable to confidently exclude any possibility of an increased risk of cancer.

Ara-C in patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 14 patients were treated between July 1987 and August 1995. All had sporadic PCNSL with proven histology of high-grade CNS lymphoma (twelve diffuse large-cell B-lymphomas, one lymphoblastic lymphoma, one large T-cell lymphoma). Patients were treated with two to four cycles of induction chemotherapy (40 mg/m2 Ara-C i.th.), four patients received additional Ara-C i.v. (150 mg/m2, d1-4). WBRT was administered using 1.8-Gy fractions. Intrathecal chemotherapy was planned afterwards in 4-week intervals for 6 months. Posttreatment neurocognitive evaluations were performed in two long-term survivors. RESULTS: Two of four patients who received i.v. and i.th. induction chemotherapy showed progressive disease, and irradiation was started immediately. Six of 14 patients received 50.4 Gy WBRT, four patients had WBRT up to 39.6 Gy followed by a 10.8-Gy boost. Five patients died early during therapy either due to a decline of the general medical condition or progressive disease. Median survival was 41 months (95% confidence interval: 6-79 months), survival at 3 and 5 years was 59% and 42%, respectively. Six patients survived for 3 years, two younger patients are still alive (> 12 years). They show only slightly impaired neurocognitive functions without clinical relevance.

Between 1987 and 2001, 105 patients received hyperfractionated (6 fractions in 3 days) 12 Gy Total Body Irradiation (TBI) in our institution with lateral opposed fields. All the patients had measurements with thermoluminiscence dosimetry (TLD100) placed on seven bilateral body sites in vivo, controlled by the randophantom measurements to verify reasonable dose homogeneity achievement. The comorbid effects in the whole TBI conditioning group with at least three months post BMT follow-up were noted and surviving patients who had a minimum 5-year and maximum 14-year follow-up (median 7.8 years) have been evaluated for carcinogenic radiation risk on the basis of tissue weighting factors as defined by ICRP 60. Reasonable dose homogeneity by lateral opposed beam TBI has been obtained in all 105 patients in whom lateral TLD100 measurement means were within +5% of the planned doses. Calculated carcinogenesis risk factor was 11.34% for males and 12.40% for females, and no second-cancer has been detected whilst radiation-induced 5 cataracts and 10 interstitial pneumonia comorbidities were noted. Dose homogenization can be well achieved for hyperfractionated lateral-beam TBI with acceptable comorbidities and estimated second-cancer risk is significant but relatively low compared to the risk from the clinical indications for TBI.","['Oysul, K', 'Dirican, B', 'Beyzadeoglu, M', 'Surenkok, S', 'Arpaci, F', 'Pak, Y']","['Oysul K', 'Dirican B', 'Beyzadeoglu M', 'Surenkok S', 'Arpaci F', 'Pak Y']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Gulhane Military Medical Academy, Ankara, Turkey. kaan@gata.edu.tr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Cataract/epidemiology', 'Dose Fractionation, Radiation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Radiation Injuries/classification/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/02/12 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2003;50(5):372-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main aim of our present study was to determine if patterns with low levels of neoplastic cells in bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) are of a value the early diagnosis and/or detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in HCL. Next we wished to determine if quantitative immunophenotyping given by molecules of equivalent soluble fluoresceine (MESF) could help to distinguish pathologic B-lymphocytic pool from that of normal residual B-cells also in patients with low numbers of HCL cells. The abnormal immunophenotypes were studied in 174 specimens from 19 patients with suspect HCL or during follow-up of already treated patients. For evaluation of marker density fluorescent calibration microbeads were used. In 12 HCL patients (67%) permanent complete remission was observed after treatment. In 6 patients (33%) transient MRD+ phenotype was identified but the clinical manifestation of relapse was followed till now in only three patients. One patient was phenotyped just only at diagnosis. The pathological cells in low levels were found in 5 patients at diagnosis (in the range from 2 to 12%) and in patients with MRD+ phenotype they were recognized repeatedly in the range from 2 to 8%. Furthermore, we observed in hairy cells significantly higher values of molecule numbers of some B-cell markers, comparing to that of residual B-cells in nonleukemic lymphocyte gate of the same sample. We found profound and persistent CD4+ lymphopenia in all but one studied patients after CdA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometric immunophenotyping of PB and BM is highly sensitive and specific method and is capable to detect low levels of malignant cells in HCL. Quantitative analysis of MESF values of pathological B-cells comparing to normal residual B-cells seems to be another new marker of HCL in common, which is reliable detecting also small cell numbers in examined sample. A long-term decline of CD4+ T-cells correlated with the relatively low incidence of clinical progression of HCL.","['Babusikova, O', 'Tomova, A']","['Babusikova O', 'Tomova A']","['Cancer Research Institute; Slovak Academy of Sciences, 833 91 Bratislava, Slovak Republic. exonobab@savba.sk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,IM,"['Antigens, CD/blood', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/02/12 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2003;50(5):350-6.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found, that leukocytes of untreated AML patients showed susceptibility to apoptosis similar to control cells. Marked increase in percentage of apoptotic leukocytes was observed after induction therapy exclusively in patients with longer survival, which was accompanied by better normalization of routine hematological parameters. In this group, the Bcl-2/Bax ratio was similar to the control and remained unchanged after treatment. In AML patients with shorter survival, a twofold increase in this ratio was observed both before and after the completion of induction therapy. In both groups of untreated patients, western blot analysis revealed the presence of prominent additional bands reacting with anti-Bcl-2 or anti-Bax antibody, which were undetectable in control leukocytes. After the therapy, these bands disappeared, especially in patients from group A. In conclusion, the lack of therapy-induced enhancement in leukocyte apoptosis, an increased ratio of Bcl-2/Bax as well as persistent presence of abnormal Bcl-2 and Bax protein bands after induction therapy in AML patients may be considered as factors associated with unfavorable clinical outcome.","['Dabrowska, M', 'Pietruczuk, M', 'Kostecka, I', 'Suchowierska, M', 'Kloczko, J', 'Nasilowska, B', 'Bany-Laszewicz, U', 'Marianska, B']","['Dabrowska M', 'Pietruczuk M', 'Kostecka I', 'Suchowierska M', 'Kloczko J', 'Nasilowska B', 'Bany-Laszewicz U', 'Marianska B']","['Department of Hematological Diagnostics; Medical University of Bialystok, 15-274 Bialystok, Poland. mdabrows@amb.edu.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Blast Crisis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes/*pathology/physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*blood', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*blood', 'Treatment Outcome', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/02/12 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2003;50(5):339-44.,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunoblot analyses and RT-PCR, however, failed to detect HLA-G antigen or HLA-G transcripts in cells that bind 4H84 mAb after acid-treatment. The binding of 4H84 mAb can be explained by the acid-induced cross-reactivity of this HLA-G specific mAb with classical HLA class I molecules [15].

To evaluate the impact of CE upon imatinib treatment in post-transplant settings, responses and toxicities in the relapsed AP-CE were analyzed in comparison with those in the relapsed chronic phase (CP). Both CP (n=7) and AP-CE patients (n=6) received imatinib mesylate in an oral dose of 400 mg/day. Complete cytogenetic responses were obtained in six patients of each group, CP (86%) and AC-CE (100%), while molecular remission was seen in 43 and 50%, respectively. Granulocytopenia or thrombocytopenia of grade III or more occurred in four (57%) and two (33%) patients with CP and AP-CE, respectively. Nonhematological adverse events were mild and tolerable in both groups and only one (7%) of the 13 patients experienced recurrent graft-versus-host disease after imatinib treatment. Although this is a relatively small group of patients, we suggest that imatinib mesylate should be considered as a front-line treatment for relapsed CML as it showed the high response rate and low toxicity.

In the present work, we evaluated the cAMP signaling in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells in the context of differentiation induced by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). There was a marked increase in the intracellular cAMP level within a few minutes after treatment with ATRA in APL cell line NB4 and fresh APL cells, whereas no such phenomenon was observed in NB4-R1 cells that are resistant to ATRA-induced maturation. In addition, the basal level of intracellular cAMP was lower in NB4-R1 than in NB4 cells. Mechanistic study showed that this induction of cAMP was mediated through the activation of adenylate cyclase. Moreover, we found that cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity was quickly upregulated in parallel in ATRA-treated NB4 cells, and the phosphorylation of RARalpha by PKA could increase its transactivation effect. Use of H-89, an inhibitor of PKA, could partially suppress the transcriptional expression of ATRA target genes and ATRA-induced differentiation of APL cells. Taken together, we suggested a crosstalk between ATRA-induced cytosolic pathway and nuclear pathway in APL cell differentiation.","['Zhao, Q', 'Tao, J', 'Zhu, Q', 'Jia, P-M', 'Dou, A-X', 'Li, X', 'Cheng, F', 'Waxman, S', 'Chen, G-Q', 'Chen, S-J', 'Lanotte, M', 'Chen, Z', 'Tong, J-H']","['Zhao Q', 'Tao J', 'Zhu Q', 'Jia PM', 'Dou AX', 'Li X', 'Cheng F', 'Waxman S', 'Chen GQ', 'Chen SJ', 'Lanotte M', 'Chen Z', 'Tong JH']","['State Key Lab for Human Genome Research (SKLHGR), Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation Laboratory of Shanghai Second Medical University (SSMU), Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adenylyl Cyclases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic AMP/analysis/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Receptor Cross-Talk', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Second Messenger Systems/*drug effects', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/02/26 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403226 [doi]', '2403226 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Feb;18(2):285-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403226.,"['0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency mice genetically engineered to produce ng/ml serum levels of human interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte/macrophage-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and Steel factor (SF) display a complex phenotype when transplanted with primitive human bone marrow (BM) or fetal liver cells. This phenotype is characterized by an enhancement of terminal human myelopoiesis and a matched suppression of terminal human erythropoiesis, with a slight reduction in human B-lymphopoiesis in the BM of the engrafted mice. Human clonogenic progenitors are more prevalent in the blood of the transplanted growth factor-producing mice and this is accompanied by a very marked reduction of more primitive human cells in the BM.

The functional activation of PI3K/AKT provides survival signals and blockade of this pathway may facilitate cell death. Downstream targets of PI3K-AKT include the proapoptotic protein BAD, caspase-9, NF-kappaB, and Forkhead. We have previously reported that BAD is constitutively phosphorylated in primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, a post-transcriptional modification, which inactivates its proapoptotic function. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 results in the dephosphorylation of AKT and BAD, and thus promote leukemia cell apoptosis. We investigated the effects of LY294002 in megakaryocytic leukemia-derived MO7E cells, primary AML and normal bone marrow progenitor cells. In MO7E cells, LY294002 reduced AKT kinase activity, induced dephosphorylation of AKT and BAD, and increased apoptosis. Concomitant inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling or combination with all-trans retinoic acid further enhanced apoptosis of leukemic cells. In primary AML samples, clonogenic cell growth was significantly reduced. Normal hematopoietic progenitors were less affected, suggesting preferential targeting of leukemia cells. In conclusion, the data suggest that the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway restores apoptosis in AML and may be explored as a novel target for molecular therapeutics in AML.","['Zhao, S', 'Konopleva, M', 'Cabreira-Hansen, M', 'Xie, Z', 'Hu, W', 'Milella, M', 'Estrov, Z', 'Mills, G B', 'Andreeff, M']","['Zhao S', 'Konopleva M', 'Cabreira-Hansen M', 'Xie Z', 'Hu W', 'Milella M', 'Estrov Z', 'Mills GB', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/02/26 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403220 [doi]', '2403220 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Feb;18(2):267-75. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403220.,"['0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",,,,"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

We characterized the der(11) and der(9) genomic breakpoint junctions in a case of AML following etoposide and doxorubicin. Etoposide-, etoposide metabolite- and doxorubicin-induced DNA topoisomerase II cleavage was examined in normal homologues of the MLL and AF-9 breakpoint sequences using an in vitro assay. Induction of DNA topoisomerase II cleavage complexes in CEM and K562 cell lines was investigated using an in vivo complex of enzyme assay. The translocation occurred between identical 5'-TATTA-3' sequences in MLL intron 8 and AF-9 intron 5 without the gain or loss of bases. The 5'-TATTA-3' sequences were reciprocally cleaved by DNA topoisomerase II in the presence of etoposide, etoposide catechol or etoposide quinone, creating homologous 4-base 5' overhangs that would anneal to form both breakpoint junctions without any processing. der(11) and der(4) translocation breakpoints in a treatment-related ALL at the same site in MLL are consistent with a damage hotspot. Etoposide and both etoposide metabolites induced DNA topoisomerase II cleavage complexes in the hematopoietic cell lines.

The procedure is highly sensitive and reproducible over a 100-fold range of input RNA, with excellent compatibility with RT-PCR and microarrays.

Both probe sets accurately assessed specific changes in gene expression in two relevant model systems. Stimulation of lymphocytes with various Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands induced distinct inflammatory profiles. Furthermore, osteosarcoma cells treated with cytostatic drugs showed as primary response strong up-regulation of the apoptogenic p53-inducible PUMA transcript. Suppression by RNAi validated that indeed Puma expression was responsible for apoptosis induction. Thus, RT-MLPA enables relevant changes in transcription patterns to be quickly pinpointed and guide further experiments.

The theoretical structure of two base pairs (2 bp) complex of H3 stem-loop of Moloney murine leukemia virus agrees with the NMR structure with modest violations of few NMR restraints comparable to violations present in the NMR structure. In contrast to the NMR structure, however, MD shows relaxed intermolecular G-C base pairs. The core region of the kissing complex forms a cation-binding pocket with highly negative electrostatic potential. The pocket shows nanosecond-scale breathing motions coupled with oscillations of the whole molecule. Additional simulations were carried out for 6 bp kissing complexes of the DIS HIV-1 subtypes A and B. The simulated structures agree well with the X-ray data. The subtype B forms a novel four-base stack of bulged-out adenines. Both 6 bp kissing complexes have extended cation-binding pockets in their central parts.

Functional diversity is created not only by the sequence but by changes in tertiary structure. Here we present evidence that lipid cofactors may enable otherwise unstable protein folding variants to maintain their conformation and to form novel, biologically active complexes. We have identified unsaturated C18 fatty acids in the cis conformation as the cofactors that bind apo alpha-lactalbumin and form HAMLET (human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells). The complexes were formed on an ion exchange column, were stable in a molten globule-like conformation, and had attained the novel biological activity. The protein-fatty acid interaction was specific, as saturated C18 fatty acids, or unsaturated C18:1trans conformers were unable to form complexes with apo alpha-lactalbumin, as were fatty acids with shorter or longer carbon chains. Unsaturated cis fatty acids other than C18:1:9cis were able to form stable complexes, but these were not active in the apoptosis assay. The results demonstrate that stereo-specific lipid-protein interactions can stabilize partially unfolded conformations and form molecular complexes with novel biological activity. The results offer a new mechanism for the functional diversity of proteins, by exploiting lipids as essential, tissue-specific cofactors in this process.","['Svensson, Malin', 'Mossberg, Ann-Kristin', 'Pettersson, Jenny', 'Linse, Sara', 'Svanborg, Catharina']","['Svensson M', 'Mossberg AK', 'Pettersson J', 'Linse S', 'Svanborg C']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Glycobiology (MIG), Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Protein Sci,Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,9211750,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoproteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Humans', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Lactalbumin/chemistry/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Leukemia L1210', '*Lipid Metabolism', 'Lipids/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Protein Conformation', '*Protein Folding', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Substrate Specificity']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/07/15 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1110/ps.0231103 [doi]'],ppublish,Protein Sci. 2003 Dec;12(12):2805-14. doi: 10.1110/ps.0231103.,"['0 (Apoproteins)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (apo-alpha-lactalbumin)', '9013-90-5 (Lactalbumin)']",,,,,,,,,PMC2366988,,,,,

Previous studies have shown that a conformational change is required to form HAMLET from alpha-lactalbumin, and that a partially unfolded conformation is maintained in the HAMLET complex. This study examined if unfolding of alpha-lactalbumin is sufficient to induce cell death. We used the bovine alpha-lactalbumin Ca(2+) site mutant D87A, which is unable to bind Ca(2+), and thus remains partially unfolded regardless of solvent conditions. The D87A mutant protein was found to be inactive in the apoptosis assay, but could readily be converted to a HAMLET-like complex in the presence of oleic acid. BAMLET (bovine alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells) and D87A-BAMLET complexes were both able to kill tumor cells. This activity was independent of the Ca(2+)site, as HAMLET maintained a high affinity for Ca(2+) but D87A-BAMLET was active with no Ca(2+) bound. We conclude that partial unfolding of alpha-lactalbumin is necessary but not sufficient to trigger cell death, and that the activity of HAMLET is defined both by the protein and the lipid cofactor. Furthermore, a functional Ca(2+)-binding site is not required for conversion of alpha-lactalbumin to the active complex or to cause cell death. This suggests that the lipid cofactor stabilizes the altered fold without interfering with the Ca(2+)site.","['Svensson, Malin', 'Fast, Jonas', 'Mossberg, Ann-Kristin', 'Duringer, Caroline', 'Gustafsson, Lotta', 'Hallgren, Oskar', 'Brooks, Charles L', 'Berliner, Lawrence', 'Linse, Sara', 'Svanborg, Catharina']","['Svensson M', 'Fast J', 'Mossberg AK', 'Duringer C', 'Gustafsson L', 'Hallgren O', 'Brooks CL', 'Berliner L', 'Linse S', 'Svanborg C']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Glycobiology (MIG), Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Protein Sci,Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,9211750,IM,"['Amino Acids/genetics', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Binding Sites', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Culture Media/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Lactalbumin/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Oleic Acid/metabolism', 'Protein Denaturation', '*Protein Folding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/07/15 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1110/ps.0231003 [doi]'],ppublish,Protein Sci. 2003 Dec;12(12):2794-804. doi: 10.1110/ps.0231003.,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Culture Media)', '2UMI9U37CP (Oleic Acid)', '9013-90-5 (Lactalbumin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,PMC2366987,,,,,

Traditionally, these cells have been cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder layers, which allow their continuous growth in an undifferentiated state. However, the use of hES cells in human therapy requires an animal-free culture system, in which exposure to mouse retroviruses is avoided. In this study we present a novel feeder layer-free culture system for hES cells, based on medium supplemented with 15% serum replacement, a combination of growth factors including transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1), leukemia inhibitory factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and fibronectin matrix. Human ES cells grown in these conditions maintain all ES cell features after prolonged culture, including the developmental potential to differentiate into representative tissues of the three embryonic germ layers, unlimited and undifferentiated proliferative ability, and maintenance of normal karyotype. The culture system presented here has two major advantages: 1) application of a well-defined culture system for hES cells and 2) reduced exposure of hES cells to animal pathogens. The feeder layer-free culture system reported here aims at facilitating research practices and providing a safer alternative for future clinical applications of hES cells.","['Amit, M', 'Shariki, C', 'Margulets, V', 'Itskovitz-Eldor, J']","['Amit M', 'Shariki C', 'Margulets V', 'Itskovitz-Eldor J']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, and The Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, 31096 Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20031119,United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/*pharmacology', 'Fetus', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Teratoma', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1095/biolreprod.103.021147 [doi]', 'biolreprod.103.021147 [pii]']",ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2004 Mar;70(3):837-45. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.103.021147.

PML-NBs are frequently targeted by viral infections, as a number of different RNA and DNA viruses, including herpesviruses, adenoviruses, papovaviruses, papillomaviruses and arenaviruses, cause changes in PML-NBs. Viruses interfere with PML-NB in two ways: 1) some viral proteins can associate with PML-NB proteins and/or lead to the destruction and lysis of this subnuclear compartment, thus aiding viral gene expression and disabling the host's innate immunity; 2) the parental genomes of some nuclear-replicating DNA viruses associate preferentially with PML-NBs, which presumably serves to assist in viral gene expression or replication.

In the present study we investigated whether oncogenic tyrosine kinase activation also occurs in other categories of lymphoma by staining 145 cases of lymphoma covering those tumours with a range of different subtypes including those with morphological similarity to ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Twelve cases of the borderline malignant disorder lymphomatoid papulosis were also studied. Twenty seven of the 28 cases of ALK-positive ALCL showed the extensive cytoplasmic labelling for phosphotyrosine in the neoplastic cells. The remaining case containing moesin-ALK exhibited membrane-associated phosphotyrosine expression. There was no nuclear phosphotyrosine labelling in any of the ALK-positive ALCL, even though ALK was present within the cell nuclei in 23 of the tumours. Variable degrees of phosphotyrosine labelling, usually membrane-restricted, were observed in 7/40 cases of ALK-negative ALCL, 9/29 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 3/6 cases of mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, 2/7 cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma, 3/6 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphomas unspecified, 4/6 cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, 2/6 cases of follicular lymphomas and 2/12 cases of lymphomatoid papulosis studied.

Once the adjustments were incorporated in the dose estimates, the data were modeled with a threshold term to allow for the possibility of a threshold dose response. The dose response models that were fit to the data were otherwise the same models used in the original papers. The threshold term was included in the model allowing for possible threshold values ranging from 0 to 0.35 Sv. These analyses suggest that the fit of the A-bomb solid tumor and leukemia incidence data are significantly improved by the addition of a threshold term in comparison with the purely linear or linear quadratic model. The results from the mortality data suggest that the leukemia data agree more with the threshold model than the linear quadratic model although the linear quadratic model is statistically equivalent, while the solid tumor data does not suggest any improvement with a threshold.","['Baker, Gizelle S', 'Hoel, David G']","['Baker GS', 'Hoel DG']","['Department of Biometry and Epidemiology at the Medical University of South Carolina, 171 Ashley Avenue, Charleston, SC 29425, USA. tessiegs@alumni.musc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,IM,"['*Algorithms', '*Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Male', '*Models, Biological', 'Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Neutrons', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiometry/*methods', 'Relative Biological Effectiveness', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Survivors/statistics & numerical data']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/01/21 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00004032-200312000-00016 [doi]'],ppublish,Health Phys. 2003 Dec;85(6):709-20. doi: 10.1097/00004032-200312000-00016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NASA'],['Non-programmatic'],

Such concern has been voiced by residents in Armstrong and Westmoreland Counties in Western Pennsylvania in conjunction with the operation of two former nuclear materials processing facilities located in the Apollo borough and the Parks township, just three miles apart. These facilities began operating in 1957 and 1960 and processed uranium and plutonium for commercial and naval applications. To evaluate the possibility of increased cancer rates in communities around the Apollo-Parks nuclear facilities, a cancer incidence and a cancer mortality survey were conducted. The county mortality findings are reported here. Nearly 40,000 cancer deaths occurred in the population residing in Armstrong and Westmoreland Counties from 1950 through 1995. Each of these two study counties was matched for comparison to three control counties in the same region on the basis of age, race, urbanization, and socioeconomic factors available from the 1990 U.S. Census. There were over 77,000 cancer deaths in the 6 control counties during the 45 y studied. Following similar methods used by the National Cancer Institute, Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs) were computed as the ratio of observed numbers of cancers in the study and control counties compared to the expected number derived from general population rates of the United States. Relative risks (RR) were computed as the ratios of the SMRs for the study and the control counties. There were no significant increases in the study counties for any cancer when comparisons were made with either the U.S. population or the control counties. In particular, deaths due to cancers of the lung, bone, liver, and kidney were not more frequent in the study counties than in the control counties. These are the cancers of a priori interest given that uranium and/or plutonium might be expected to concentrate in these tissues. Deaths from all cancers combined also were not increased in the study counties, and the RRs of cancer mortality before the facilities operated (1950-1964), during plant operations (1965-1980) and after plant closure (1980-1995) were similar: 0.96, 0.95 and 0.98, respectively. For childhood leukemia mortality, the relative risk comparing the study counties with their controls before plant start-up was 1.02, while during operations (RR 0.81) and after closure (RR 0.57) the relative risks were lower. The study is limited by the correlational approach and the relatively large size of the geographic areas of the counties studied.","['Boice, John D Jr', 'Bigbee, William L', 'Mumma, Michael T', 'Blot, William J']","['Boice JD Jr', 'Bigbee WL', 'Mumma MT', 'Blot WJ']","['International Epidemiology Institute, 1455 Research Blvd, Suite 550, Rockville, MD 20850, USA. boicej@compuserve.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cities/epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure/statistics & numerical data', 'Geography/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'Occupational Exposure/statistics & numerical data', 'Pennsylvania/epidemiology', '*Plutonium', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural Population/statistics & numerical data', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Topography, Medical/*methods', '*Uranium', 'Urban Population/statistics & numerical data']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/01/21 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00004032-200312000-00014 [doi]'],ppublish,Health Phys. 2003 Dec;85(6):691-700. doi: 10.1097/00004032-200312000-00014.,"['4OC371KSTK (Uranium)', '53023GN24M (Plutonium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two former nuclear materials processing facilities in Armstrong County Pennsylvania have been the focus of such public concern for over 20 y. The Apollo and Parks facilities processed uranium and plutonium fuels for use in nuclear applications. To evaluate the possibility of increased cancer rates in the communities near the Apollo-Parks nuclear processing materials plants, cancer incidence rates were assessed for the years 1993-1997, or nearly 40 y after the plants had begun operation in 1957 and 1960, respectively. The rates of cancer were evaluated among the approximately 17,000 persons living in 1 of 8 municipalities encompassing or near these nuclear sites. Numbers of cancers and mailing addresses (n = 935) were obtained from the Pennsylvania Department of Health. Because mailing addresses in small rural areas do not always reflect actual residences within a municipality, each of 935 addresses was validated (and corrections made when indicated) by contacting area postmasters and using Census Bureau geocoding information, street maps, and aerial photographs. Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIRs) were computed as the ratio of observed numbers of cancers in the study area compared to the expected number derived from general population rates of Pennsylvania. Forty percent of the mailing addresses were found not to be within the boundaries of the study municipalities. After excluding these persons who did not reside in one of the eight municipalities near the Apollo-Parks facilities, 581 cancers remained in contrast to 574.0 expected (SIR 1.01; 95% confidence interval 0.93-1.10). Based upon knowledge of the tissues where uranium or plutonium likely would be deposited after intake, cancers of the lung (SIR 0.88), kidney (SIR 1.05), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (SIR 1.10), liver (SIR 0.61), and bone (2 observed vs. 1.19 expected) were carefully evaluated, but no significant excesses were noted at these sites. Cancers of the female breast and thyroid and leukemia also were not significantly increased, as expected since these tissues are not sites where uranium or plutonium would concentrate. Overall, no increase in cancer risk could be attributed to living near the two former nuclear materials processing facilities. However, misleading elevations in cancer risks would have been suggested if mailing addresses had not been corrected to exclude addresses that were not within the boundaries of the municipalities for which population data were available. The study had sufficient power to exclude increased cancer risks of 10% or greater.","['Boice, John D Jr', 'Bigbee, William L', 'Mumma, Michael T', 'Blot, William J']","['Boice JD Jr', 'Bigbee WL', 'Mumma MT', 'Blot WJ']","['International Epidemiology Institute, 1455 Research Blvd, Suite 550, Rockville, MD 20850, USA. boicej@compuserve.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cities/epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Pennsylvania/epidemiology', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural Population/statistics & numerical data', 'Topography, Medical/*methods', '*Uranium', 'Urban Population/statistics & numerical data']",2003/11/25 05:00,2004/01/21 05:00,['2003/11/25 05:00'],"['2003/11/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00004032-200312000-00013 [doi]'],ppublish,Health Phys. 2003 Dec;85(6):678-90. doi: 10.1097/00004032-200312000-00013.,['4OC371KSTK (Uranium)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluated the characteristics of these rare cancers in a medical center. METHODS: Analyses of the characteristics of malignant neoplasms for patients aged 14 to 17 years at diagnosis were performed for all cases recorded in the tumor registry of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH) at Linkou for the period 1995 to 2001. All eligible tumors were categorized in 1 of 12 diagnostic groups according to the scheme of the International Classification of Childhood Cancer (ICCC). Relative frequencies, age, and gender variations and the characteristics of tumor types were analyzed. RESULTS: Cancer was diagnosed in 320 adolescents during the study period. The male/female ratio was 1.17. Leukemia was the leading diagnostic group. The frequency of carcinomas increased with age and was highest among 17-year-olds. In this age group, non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (non-RMS STS/PNET), thyroid carcinoma (CA) and ovarian germ cell tumor (GCT) were the 3 most common solid tumors; the embryonal malignancies were rare. Tumors with the greatest male predominance were intracranial GCT (91%), nasopharyngeal CA (87.5%), osteosarcoma (84.6%), and colorectal CA (75%). Tumors with the greatest female predominance were thyroid CA (78.3%), gonadal GCT (75%), and non-RMS/PNET (56.5%). Hepatocellular CA comprised 9.4% of all carcinomas. CONCLUSIONS: The relative frequency and the distribution of histology subtypes among adolescents were between those of childhood and adult cancers. There were marked variations in tumor occurrence between genders and among different ages.","['Hung, Iou-Jih', 'Yang, Chao-Ping', 'Jaing, Tang-Her']","['Hung IJ', 'Yang CP', 'Jaing TH']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Chang Gung Children's Hospital, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Singapore,J Formos Med Assoc,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,9214933,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Sex Distribution', 'Taiwan/epidemiology']",2003/11/20 05:00,2004/02/06 05:00,['2003/11/20 05:00'],"['2003/11/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/20 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Formos Med Assoc. 2003 Sep;102(9):631-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies in myeloma have shown persistent increased bone marrow microvessel density (MVD) after autologous transplantation. It is not clear if abnormal bone marrow angiogenesis persists following a curative intervention like allogeneic transplantation. We evaluated MVD from bone marrow samples obtained just prior to and at 3-5 months after ASCT in 24 patients with CML.

The impact of matched related allogeneic transplant in CR1 on the overall survival is equivocal, but what is not in doubt is a significant reduction in the relapse risk, compared to both autologous transplants and intensive chemotherapy, which is because of the allogeneic or the graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) effect. Yet, this does not always translate to improved survival. T cell depletion (TCD) can reduce deaths related to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and its therapy, but might increase the relapse risk. The existing literature suggests that TCD is associated with a disease-free survival (DFS) of 53-80% and is associated with a lower relapse risk than anticipated (0-30%). We discuss the evolution of TCD in allogeneic transplantation and its relevance in AML-CR1 with regard to GVHD, DFS, immune reconstitution and GVL effect. It is possible that by reducing TRM related to GVHD and extramedullary toxicities, particularly in the older patients, TCD might improve the impact of allogeneic transplantation in AML-CR1, provided the immune reconstitution and the relapse risk are not adversely affected.

All the patients were given oral STI 571 at the dose of 300-500 mg/d for a median treatment course of 5 months, and the 5 patients with CML-AP also received homoharringtonine at dose of 1-2 mg/d for an average of 1.5 treatment cycles (7-14 d for a complete treatment cycle). The Ph chromosome and the FISH-bcr/abl were analysed again 3 months after the treatment. RESULTS: STI 571 induced 100% complete hematological remission (CHR) and 79% major cytogenetic responses (MCR) in these patients. The complete cytogenetic remission (CCR) rates of CML-AP patients and CML-CP patients in advanced stage were lower than that of CML- CP patients in early stage (0% and 40% vs 88.9%). CONCLUSION: STI 571 can achieve high rate of CHR and MCR in CML-CP patients, especially in those in early stage of the disease.","['Meng, Fan-yi', 'Zheng, Wei-yang', 'Liu, Xiao-li', 'Xu, Bing', 'Song, Lan-lin', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Huang, Fen']","['Meng FY', 'Zheng WY', 'Liu XL', 'Xu B', 'Song LL', 'Zhang Y', 'Huang F']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, First Military Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China. mengfu@medmail.com.cn']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Di Yi Jun Yi Da Xue Xue Bao,Di 1 jun yi da xue xue bao = Academic journal of the first medical college of PLA,9426110,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",2003/11/20 05:00,2004/04/01 05:00,['2003/11/20 05:00'],"['2003/11/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/01 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/20 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Di Yi Jun Yi Da Xue Xue Bao. 2003 Nov;23(11):1149-50.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Thirteen patients with leukemia received URD-HSCT, of whom 11 had HLA genotypes and 2 had mismatch for 1 genetic locus. Another 11 leukemia patients all serologically matched underwent related donor (RD)-HSCT. Total body irradiation (TBI) plus cyclophosphamide (CTX) was adopted in 19 cases and modified BuCY conditioning regimen (hydroxyurea, busulfan, Ara-C, Cyclophosphamide ) in the other 5 cases. All the patients received CsA+MTX protocal for GVHD prophylaxis, and in those undergoing URD-HSCT, additional MMF and low-dose ATG were used. RESULTS: The incidence and severity of regimen-related toxicity differed little between unrelated and related transplantation. Acute GVHD (aGVHD) occurred in 46.2% of the patients undergoing URD- HSCT and in 55.6% of those with RD-HSCT, respectively. Four patients had chronic GVHD (cGVHD), in the 7 ones who could be followed up after URD-HSCT; 6 of the 9 patients with RD-HSCT developed cGVHD postoperatively. One patient with URD-HSCT died of hemorrhagic cystitis and another with RD-HSCT died of cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia. The at one-year disease-free survival rate was 87.5% and 90.9% in patients with unrelated and related transplantation respectively. Significant difference was not noted in the positivity rate of CMV antigen between the patients receiving URD-HSCT or RD-HSCT. CONCLUSION: CsA+MTX in combination with MMF and low-dose ATG may decrease the incidence and severity of aGVHD without increasing transplant-related mortality or CMV infection.","['Liu, Qi-fa', 'Sun, Jing', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Xu, Dan', 'Liu, Xiao-li', 'Xu, Bing', 'Meng, Fan-yi', 'Zhou, Shu-yun']","['Liu QF', 'Sun J', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu D', 'Liu XL', 'Xu B', 'Meng FY', 'Zhou SY']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, First Military Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China. liuqifa@fimmu.com']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Di Yi Jun Yi Da Xue Xue Bao,Di 1 jun yi da xue xue bao = Academic journal of the first medical college of PLA,9426110,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/administration & dosage', 'Cyclosporine/administration & dosage', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/etiology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/*prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycophenolic Acid/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",2003/11/20 05:00,2004/04/01 05:00,['2003/11/20 05:00'],"['2003/11/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/01 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/20 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Di Yi Jun Yi Da Xue Xue Bao. 2003 Nov;23(11):1143-5.,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this work was to synthesize an antisense peptide nucleic acid (PNA) complementary to the first six codons of the bcl-2 open reading frame, conjugated to a membrane-permeating peptide for intracellular delivery, and modified with a bifunctional chelating agent for targeting imaging and therapeutic radiometals to tumors overexpressing bcl-2. Four peptide-PNA constructs were synthesized by a combination of manual and automated stepwise elongation techniques, including bcl-2 antisense conjugates and nonsense conjugates with no complementarity to any known mammalian gene or DNA sequence. The PNA sequences were synthesized manually by solid-phase 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) techniques. Then a fully protected lysine monomer, modified with 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'""-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) for radiometal chelation, was coupled manually to each PNA sequence. Synthesis of the DOTA-PNA conjugates was followed by automated elongation with a peptide sequence (PTD-4-glycine, PTD-4-G), known to mediate cellular internalization of impermeable effector molecules, or its retro-inverso analogue (ri-PTD-4-G). Preparation of the four conjugates required an innovative synthetic strategy, using mild acid conditions to generate hydrophobic, partially deprotected intermediates. These intermediates were purified by semipreparative reversed-phase HPLC and completely deprotected to yield pure peptide-PNA conjugates in 6% to 9% overall yield. Using modifications of this synthetic strategy, the ri-PTD-4-G conjugate of bcl-2 antisense PNA was prepared using a lysine derivative of tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) for fluorescence microscopy. Plasma stability studies showed that (111)In-DOTA-labeled ri-PTD-4-G-anti-bcl-2 PNA was stable for 168 h at 37 degrees C, unlike the conjugate containing the parent peptide sequence. Scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy of TMR-labeled ri-PTD-4-G-anti-bcl-2 PNA in Raji lymphoma cells demonstrated that the retro-inverso peptide was active in membrane permeation and mediated cellular internalization of the antisense PNA into the cytoplasm, where high concentrations of bcl-2 mRNA are expected to be present.","['Gallazzi, Fabio', 'Wang, Yi', 'Jia, Fang', 'Shenoy, Nalini', 'Landon, Linda A', 'Hannink, Mark', 'Lever, Susan Z', 'Lewis, Michael R']","['Gallazzi F', 'Wang Y', 'Jia F', 'Shenoy N', 'Landon LA', 'Hannink M', 'Lever SZ', 'Lewis MR']","['Molecular Biology Program, University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, Missouri 65211, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', '*Genes, bcl-2/drug effects', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 1-Ring/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Indium Radioisotopes', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Molecular Structure', 'Peptide Nucleic Acids/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Peptides/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Rhodamines/chemistry', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",2003/11/20 05:00,2004/07/10 05:00,['2003/11/20 05:00'],"['2003/11/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/20 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bc034084n [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2003 Nov-Dec;14(6):1083-95. doi: 10.1021/bc034084n.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 1-Ring)', '0 (Indium Radioisotopes)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptide Nucleic Acids)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '1HTE449DGZ (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane- 1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid)']",,,,['CA86290/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The expression of SHP-1 protein is diminished or abolished in most leukemia and lymphoma cell lines and tissues, and in some non-hematopoietic cancer cell lines, such as estrogen receptor (ER) negative breast cancer cell lines and some colorectal cancer cell lines. However, we do not know whether the reduced SHP-1 expression is the cause of cancer diseases or the secondary effect of cancer developments. Here, we first demonstrate that SHP-1 has general tumor suppressing function in SHP-1 transfected cell lines. Transfected SHP-1 inhibits the growth of three lymphoma/leukemia cell lines (Ramos, H9, Jurkat) and one breast cancer cell line (HTB26). We also demonstrate a possible molecular mechanism for the tumor suppressing function of SHP-1: SHP-1 inhibits cell growth partly by negative regulation of activated JAK kinase. In addition, we find, for the first time, that SHP-1 down-regulates the level of TYK2 kinase in H9 cells and of JAK1 kinase in HTB26 cells, by accelerating their degradation. The SHP-1 accelerated degradation of JAK1 kinase in HTB26 cells was blocked with the treatment of MG132, a specific inhibitor for proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Our data suggest a new function of SHP-1 in the regulation of proteasome-mediated degradation pathway.","['Wu, Chengyu', 'Guan, Qin', 'Wang, Yingjian', 'Zhao, Z Joe', 'Zhou, G Wayne']","['Wu C', 'Guan Q', 'Wang Y', 'Zhao ZJ', 'Zhou GW']","['Program in Molecular Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/enzymology/*pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*pathology', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Lymphoma/enzymology/*pathology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'TYK2 Kinase', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'src Homology Domains']",2003/11/19 05:00,2004/07/21 05:00,['2003/11/19 05:00'],"['2003/11/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/19 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.10727 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2003 Dec 1;90(5):1026-37. doi: 10.1002/jcb.10727.,"['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Leupeptins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",,,,"['AL45858/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA75218/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL57393/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

It was found that the MIP-2 mRNA has a 70 bp 5'UTR, a 303 bp coding region and a 728 bp 3'UTR which contains adenylate/uridylate (AU)-rich areas defined as AU-rich elements (AREs). Site-directed mutagenesis studies using the tetracycline-sensitive transactivator protein-expressing rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3-TO cells) revealed that MIP-2 mRNA mutants which lack the 3'UTR are more stable than MIP-2-wild-type (wt) mRNA. A MIP-2 mRNA mutant in which some mutations were introduced to the ARE was also stable. The stability of MIP-2 mRNA was low in untreated RBL-2H3-TO cells, but it increased in the antigen-stimulated immunoglobulin E (IgE)-sensitized cells. The antigen-induced MIP-2 mRNA stabilization was counteracted by the highly specific p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB203580 and the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK-1) inhibitor PD98059. These findings indicate that ARE is the cis-element which mediates the rapid decay of MIP-2 mRNA, and the antigen stimulation stabilizes MIP-2 mRNA and the p38 MAPK and p44/42 MAPK pathways are involved in the antigen-induced stabilization of MIP-2 mRNA.","['Numahata, Keiichi', 'Komagata, Tatsuya', 'Hirasawa, Noriyasu', 'Someya, Koh-ichiro', 'Xiao, Yi-Qun', 'Ohuchi, Kazuo']","['Numahata K', 'Komagata T', 'Hirasawa N', 'Someya K', 'Xiao YQ', 'Ohuchi K']","['Laboratory of Pathophysiological Biochemistry, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University, Aoba Aramaki, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Miyagi 980-8578, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", ""5' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chemokine CXCL2', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'Male', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monokines/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/enzymology', 'Peritoneum/cytology', '*RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2003/11/19 05:00,2004/07/21 05:00,['2003/11/19 05:00'],"['2003/11/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/19 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.10710 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2003 Dec 1;90(5):976-86. doi: 10.1002/jcb.10710.,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", ""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Chemokine CXCL2)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Monokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,['GENBANK/AB060092'],,,,,,

The most important anti-leukemic effect may be mediated by the T-cells contained within the graft; however, the allogeneic T-cells may also give rise to graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). One way to control GVHD might be to transduce the donor T-cells with a drug-inducible suicide gene. If a retrovirus vector is to be used for this transduction, activation of the T-cells is required for integration of the transgene to occur. The activation protocol should ensure expansion of a broad repertoire of donor T-cells. Notably, T-cells specific for herpes virus family antigens are important for adoptive immunoprotection. METHODS: To define optimal activation conditions for retrovirus-mediated suicide gene transduction of donor T-cells, we examined the repertoire of CD8+ T-cells in general, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) specific T-cells in particular, following two different activation and expansion procedures. RESULTS: We found that repeated CD3/CD28 stimulation resulted in a high level of activation-induced T-cell death, affecting in vivo expanded clones, some of which were specific for EBV, in particular. In contrast, initial CD3/CD28 activation followed by proliferation in interleukin-2 lead to expansion of EBV-specific clones over and above the expansion observed for CD8+ T-cells in general. CONCLUSION: These results should impact on protocols for ex vivo activation of T-cells prior to suicide gene transduction.","['Hedfors, Ida Aagard', 'Brinchmann, Jan E']","['Hedfors IA', 'Brinchmann JE']","['Institute of Immunology, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, 0027 Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20031118,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'CD28 Antigens/metabolism', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*physiology/virology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology']",2003/11/19 05:00,2004/05/20 05:00,['2003/11/19 05:00'],"['2003/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2003/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/11/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/19 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-003-0462-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2004 May;53(5):439-44. doi: 10.1007/s00262-003-0462-z.

These advances have turned this agent from just another cytosine analogue into a targeted drug aimed at reversing epigenetic silencing in cancer cells. Here, recent clinical and translational studies with decitabine are reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS: Scientists are now taking a closer look at this drug as a targeted agent, with particular attention to schedules of administration and mechanisms of in vivo efficacy. Two phase II trials have reported substantial clinical activity of decitabine in the myelodysplastic syndrome and in chronic myelogenous leukemia. There is considerable interest in combining decitabine with histone deacetylase inhibitors and in using it to sensitize cells to chemotherapy or to biologic therapy. Finally, ongoing efforts are deciphering the in vivo mechanisms of responses seen after decitabine administration. SUMMARY: Decitabine, an old drug, has now made a comeback as a targeted agent and a prototype for epigenetic therapy in cancer.

Originally described as an antiviral mechanism in plants, known as posttranscriptional gene silencing, it is now appreciated that this phenomenon occurs in all living cells. Double-stranded RNA, when acting as part of RNA interference, reduces expression of genes with sequence similarity, but has no effect on the expression of genes of unrelated sequence. Studies of RNA interference in mammalian cells have demonstrated that exogenous genes delivered by DNA transfection as well as endogenous gene expression can be suppressed by the delivery of RNA interference. We discuss here the potential for exploiting this phenomenon to prevent or treat viral infections, in particular Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. RECENT FINDINGS: There have been several studies showing that RNA interference can be exploited to target a wide range of human viruses, including HIV-1, human T cell leukaemia virus-1, human papillomavirus, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and the polio virus. RNA interference is effective in mammalian cells and can be delivered by various methods. Double-stranded RNA has been injected into the tail veins of mice to block both virally and chemically induced hepatitis. SUMMARY: A greater understanding of RNA interference allows us to exploit this phenomenon in order to study the functions of genes in mammalian cells, and also to target the expression of mutated cellular or viral genes. New delivery techniques should be developed to allow the process to be used as a therapeutic tool against viruses and malignancies in humans.","['Godfrey, Andrew', 'Laman, Heike', 'Boshoff, Chris']","['Godfrey A', 'Laman H', 'Boshoff C']","['Cancer Research UK Viral Oncology Group, Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Infect Dis,Current opinion in infectious diseases,8809878,IM,"['Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*therapy', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', '*RNA Interference', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/*therapy']",2003/11/19 05:00,2004/05/20 05:00,['2003/11/19 05:00'],"['2003/11/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/00001432-200312000-00013 [doi]', '00001432-200312000-00013 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Infect Dis. 2003 Dec;16(6):593-600. doi: 10.1097/00001432-200312000-00013.,,70,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with whole-chromosome paints and BCR-ABL probes was used to confirm and/or complete the banding findings when a variant or a masked Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) translocation was found. Eight variant Ph translocations were identified. Three-way Ph translocations were found in seven patients. Chromosome 4 was involved in two of these cases and chromosomes 3, 11, 14, 17, and 16 in one case each; in the patient with chromosome 16 involvement, a ring of the translocated chromosome 9 was identified, that is r(9)t(9;16;22). The eighth patient had a five-way Ph translocation: t(2;9;16;22;22). The BCR-ABL fusion gene was detected on the Ph chromosome in all eight cases; two cases presented also a deletion of the 5' ABL region on the derivative chromosome 9. In the five-way translocation, the 3' DNA sequence of the ABL oncogene was fused with the 5' DNA sequence of the BCR gene on the Ph chromosome and the 5' end of ABL was inserted into the other chromosome 22. A masked Ph chromosome was identified in one of the 112 patients; it involved the insertion of the 3' ABL into BCR on an apparently normal chromosome 22, resulting in the BCR-ABL fusion gene. In conclusion, FISH analyses allowed not only a more accurate characterization of complex Ph translocations with subtle abnormalities and the identification of cryptic rearrangements, but also the recognition of deletion of the 5' ABL region, which could carry with it a poor prognosis.","['Morel, F', 'Herry, A', 'Le Bris, M-J', 'Morice, P', 'Bouquard, P', 'Abgrall, J-F', 'Berthou, C', 'De Braekeleer, M']","['Morel F', 'Herry A', 'Le Bris MJ', 'Morice P', 'Bouquard P', 'Abgrall JF', 'Berthou C', 'De Braekeleer M']","['Service de Cytogenetique, Cytologie et Biologie de la Reproduction, CHU Morvan, Brest, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Chromosome Painting', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2003/11/19 05:00,2004/01/08 05:00,['2003/11/19 05:00'],"['2003/11/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460803002048 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(03)00204-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2003 Dec;147(2):115-20. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(03)00204-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Should single-cell trisomy 8 be considered a clonal defect?,99-109,"We applied a dual-color interphase in situ fluorescence hybridization (I-FISH) technique using centromeric probes specific to chromosomes 7 and 8 on 20 control samples in order to define the statistical model best suited to determine cutoff values for detection of small abnormal clones. We found that the Poisson model is a more appropriate approach than a Gaussian model. Then, based on the analysis of 91 samples from 80 patients with myelocytic malignant hemopathies and either clonal or nonclonal -7 or +8 as determined with conventional cytogenetics (CC), we compared the respective power of I-FISH and CC for detection of aneuploidy, with special emphasis on the potential contribution of I-FISH as a complement to CC in the case of small abnormal clones. The I-FISH results were positive in samples with clonal -7 or +8 according to CC analysis. Whereas I-FISH was negative in samples with nonclonal -7 according to CC, thus confirming the reliability of the criteria used to define the clonality of -7; the situation was different with nonclonal +8.

The agar-gel immunodiffusion test was used to detect serum antibodies to BLV. 10-40 cows from each herd were tested and each tested cow was classified as negative or positive based on results of a single test. A multivariable regression model was used with the 976 herds with complete data for analysis. When compared to herds with no test-positive cows, herds with test-positive cows produced 218 kg per cow (i.e. 3%) less milk. The average reduction in AVP was $59 per cow for test-positive herds relative to test-negative herds. For the dairy industry as a whole, BLV seropositivity was associated with loss to producers of $285 million and $240 million for consumers. Most of this $525 million industry loss was due to reduced milk production in test-positive herds.","['Ott, S L', 'Johnson, R', 'Wells, S J']","['Ott SL', 'Johnson R', 'Wells SJ']","['USDA, Centers for Epidemiology and Animal Health, 2150 Centre Avenue, Building B, Mail Stop 2E5, Fort Collins, CO 80526-8117, USA. stephen.l.ott@aphis.usda.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Prev Vet Med,Preventive veterinary medicine,8217463,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis/blood', 'Cattle', 'Dairying/economics', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/blood/*economics/*epidemiology/physiopathology/virology', 'Female', 'Immunodiffusion/veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Milk/*physiology', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'United States/epidemiology']",2003/11/19 05:00,2004/01/16 05:00,['2003/11/19 05:00'],"['2003/11/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0167587703002162 [pii]', '10.1016/j.prevetmed.2003.08.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Prev Vet Med. 2003 Dec 12;61(4):249-62. doi: 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2003.08.003.,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The physiopathological effects of HTLV envelopes are unclear and the identity of the receptor, present on all vertebrate cell lines, has been elusive. We show that the receptor binding domains of both HTLV-1 and -2 envelope glycoproteins inhibit glucose transport by interacting with GLUT-1, the ubiquitous vertebrate glucose transporter. Receptor binding and HTLV envelope-driven infection are selectively inhibited when glucose transport or GLUT-1 expression are blocked by cytochalasin B or siRNAs, respectively. Furthermore, ectopic expression of GLUT-1, but not the related transporter GLUT-3, restores HTLV infection abrogated by either GLUT-1 siRNAs or interfering HTLV envelope glycoproteins. Therefore, GLUT-1 is a receptor for HTLV. Perturbations in glucose metabolism resulting from interactions of HTLV envelope glycoproteins with GLUT-1 are likely to contribute to HTLV-associated disorders.","['Manel, Nicolas', 'Kim, Felix J', 'Kinet, Sandrina', 'Taylor, Naomi', 'Sitbon, Marc', 'Battini, Jean-Luc']","['Manel N', 'Kim FJ', 'Kinet S', 'Taylor N', 'Sitbon M', 'Battini JL']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier, CNRS UMR 5535/IFR 122, F-34293 Montpellier Cedex 5, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytochalasin B/pharmacology', 'Deltaretrovirus Antigens/metabolism', 'Glucose/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lactic Acid/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Monosaccharide Transport Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism']",2003/11/19 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/11/19 05:00'],"['2003/11/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['S009286740300881X [pii]', '10.1016/s0092-8674(03)00881-x [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 2003 Nov 14;115(4):449-59. doi: 10.1016/s0092-8674(03)00881-x.,"['0 (Deltaretrovirus Antigens)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (Monosaccharide Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (SLC2A1 protein, human)', '0 (Slc2a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The C-terminal domain of IN is involved in DNA binding and enzyme multimerization. We previously performed single amino acid substitutions in the C-terminal domain of the avian leukemia and sarcoma viruses (ALSV) IN. Here, we modelled these IN mutants and analysed their ability to mediate concerted DNA integration (in an in vitro assay) as well as to form dimers (by size exclusion chromatography and protein-protein cross-linking). Mutations of residues located at the dimer interface (V239, L240, Y246, V257 and K266) have the greatest effects on the activity of the IN. Among them: (a) the L240A mutation resulted in a decrease of integration efficiency that was concomitant with a decrease of IN dimerization; (b) the V239A, V249A and K266A mutants preferentially mediated non-concerted DNA integration rather than concerted DNA integration although they were found as dimers. Other mutations (V260E and Y246W/DeltaC25) highlight the role of the C-terminal domain in the general folding of the enzyme and, hence, on its activity. This study points to the important role of residues at the IN C-terminal domain in the folding and dimerization of the enzyme as well as in the concerted DNA integration of viral DNA ends.","['Moreau, Karen', 'Faure, Claudine', 'Violot, Sebastien', 'Verdier, Gerard', 'Ronfort, Corinne']","['Moreau K', 'Faure C', 'Violot S', 'Verdier G', 'Ronfort C']","['Universite Claude Bernard, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,IM,"['Alpharetrovirus/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Catalysis', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Integrases/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', '*Virus Integration']",2003/11/19 05:00,2004/02/10 05:00,['2003/11/19 05:00'],"['2003/11/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['3833 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-1033.2003.03833.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 2003 Nov;270(22):4426-38. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-1033.2003.03833.x.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: We sought for novel partners of Su(fu) in fly using the two-hybrid method. Most of the Su(fu) interactors thus identified are (or are likely to be) able to enter the nucleus. We focused on one of these putative partners, dMLF, which resembles vertebrate myelodysplasia/myeloid leukaemia factors 1 and 2. We demonstrate that dMLF binds specifically to Su(fu) in vitro and in vivo. Using a novel anti-dMLF antibody, we showed, that dMLF is a nuclear, chromosome-associated protein. We over-expressed a dMLF transgene in fly using an inducible expression system and showed that dMLF over-expression disrupts normal development, leading to either a lethal phenotype or adult structural defects associated with apoptosis and increased DNA synthesis. Furthermore, the dMLF-induced eye phenotype is enhanced by the loss of Su(fu) function, suggesting a genetic interaction between Su(fu) and dMLF. CONCLUSION: We propose that dSu(fu) and dMLF act together at the transcriptional level to coordinate patterning and proliferation during development.","['Fouix, Sylvaine', 'Martin-Lanneree, Severine', 'Sanial, Matthieu', 'Morla, Luciana', 'Lamour-Isnard, Claudie', 'Plessis, Anne']","['Fouix S', 'Martin-Lanneree S', 'Sanial M', 'Morla L', 'Lamour-Isnard C', 'Plessis A']","['Laboratoire de genetique du developpement et evolution, Institut Jacques Monod, 2 Place Jussieu 75251 Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Genes Cells,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,9607379,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', '*Apoptosis', 'Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Chromosomes/genetics', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Drosophila melanogaster/embryology/genetics/*growth & development', 'Eye/cytology/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Morphogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'S Phase', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transgenes', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Wings, Animal/cytology/metabolism']",2003/11/19 05:00,2004/07/09 05:00,['2003/11/19 05:00'],"['2003/11/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['685 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2443.2003.00685.x [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Cells. 2003 Nov;8(11):897-911. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2443.2003.00685.x.,"['0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SUFU protein, human)', '0 (Su(fu) protein, Drosophila)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In each case, STLV provirus was acquired during the experiment, either from the blood transfusions or allograft donors. Seroconversion of anti-STLV titers occurred in 3 monkeys. However, Southern blot analysis showed the presence of STLV provirus at the DNA level in all PTLP tissues. PTLPD morphology and phenotype varied significantly. In conclusion, for the first time the oncogenic potential of STLV is identified in a rhesus monkey transplantation model. Moreover, the importance of screening blood and organ donors for HTLV-1 must be emphasized.","['Stevens, H P', 'Holterman, L', 'Haaksma, A G', 'Jonker, M', 'Heeney, J L']","['Stevens HP', 'Holterman L', 'Haaksma AG', 'Jonker M', 'Heeney JL']","['Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, University Hospital Dijkzigt, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Transpl Int,Transplant international : official journal of the European Society for Organ Transplantation,8908516,IM,"['Animals', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*physiopathology', 'Graft Rejection/*prevention & control', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*physiopathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*etiology', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Postoperative Complications/epidemiology/etiology/*virology', '*Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/isolation & purification', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*immunology']",1992/01/01 00:00,2003/12/24 05:00,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/24 05:00 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-77423-2_131 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Int. 1992;5 Suppl 1:S450-3. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-77423-2_131.,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SAMPLE POPULATION: 9 canine tumor cell lines derived from various neoplasms, 16 primary canine tumors, and tissues from 15 normal canine organs. PROCEDURE: Tumor cell lines were derived from canine tumors that included osteosarcoma, mammary gland adenocarcinoma, melanoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoma, and mastocytoma and a canine primary fibroblast culture. Canine TERT complementary DNA (cDNA) was amplified by use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced. Expression of TERT mRNA was examined by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay. Telomerase activity was measured by use of the telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay. RESULTS: The canine TERT cDNA clone was 237 base pairs in length and contained a central region encoding the reverse transcriptase motif 2. Expression of TERT mRNA was detected in canine tumor cell lines that had telomerase activity but not in telomerase-negative canine primary fibroblasts. The TERT mRNA was detected in 13 of 16 canine tumor tissues and several normal tissues such as liver, ovary, lymph node, and thymus. A significant correlation between TERT expression level and telomerase activity was noted. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Expression of TERT mRNA was closely associated with telomerase activity in neoplastic cells as well as some non-neoplastic cells from dogs. In addition to telomerase activity, expression of TERT mRNA can be used as a marker of tumor cells.","['Yazawa, Mitsuhiro', 'Okuda, Masaru', 'Kanaya, Noriko', 'Hong, Sung-Hyeok', 'Takahashi, Tomoko', 'Ohashi, Emi', 'Nakagawa, Takayuki', 'Nishimura, Ryohei', 'Sasaki, Nobuo', 'Masuda, Kenichi', 'Ohno, Koichi', 'Tsujimoto, Hajime']","['Yazawa M', 'Okuda M', 'Kanaya N', 'Hong SH', 'Takahashi T', 'Ohashi E', 'Nakagawa T', 'Nishimura R', 'Sasaki N', 'Masuda K', 'Ohno K', 'Tsujimoto H']","['Department of Veterinary Internal Medicine, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,0375011,IM,"['Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Dog Diseases/*enzymology/genetics', 'Dogs/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics/*veterinary', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reference Values', 'Telomerase/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/11/19 05:00,2004/01/07 05:00,['2003/11/19 05:00'],"['2003/11/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/19 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.2460/ajvr.2003.64.1395 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Vet Res. 2003 Nov;64(11):1395-400. doi: 10.2460/ajvr.2003.64.1395.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AB094677', 'GENBANK/AF015950', 'GENBANK/AF051911']",,,,,,

SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. METHODS: Fifty eight adult patients (age >14 years) diagnosed as cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia were studied with respect to their clinical, morphological and immunopathological features at presentation and their relationship with treatment outcomes. RESULTS: Forty five (77.5%) of the patients belonged to younger age group with male preponderance. The median age was 20 years and mean age was 25.1 years. Male to female ratio was 3:1. Common presenting signs were lymphadenopathy (17.2%), hepatomegaly (32.7%) and splenomegaly (62%). Laboratory features at presentation revealed: hemoglobin > or = 10 gm/dl in 18 (31%), WBC >50 x 10E9 / L in 18 (31%), LDH more than 1000 IU/L in 44 (75.8%) of patients. Morphology revealed that FAB L1 was seen in 21(37.2%) and L2 in 62 (32.7%). Immunophenotyping showed that 26 (61.9%) were early pre-B ALL, 6 (14.2%) were pre-B ALL and T-ALL were 10 (23.8%).

METHODS: Inhibition of the cell proliferation of NB4, HL-60 and THP-1 cells treated with As2O3 in different concentrations was observed by use of growth curves. Apoptosis was assessed by DNA electrophoresis and flow cytometric DNA contents analysis. TF, PAI-1 and PAI-2 antigen levels in cell lysates were measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). RESULTS: 1. After 24 hours exposure to 1 mumol/L As2O3 or 8 mumol/L As2O3, induced apoptosis of NB4 or HL-60 cells was noted. However induced apoptosis of THP-1 cells was not seen after exposure to 8 mumol/L As2O3 for 24 h. 2. The TF antigen levels were down-regulated during the As2O3-induced apoptosis of NB4 cells (P < 0.01), and the down-regulation effect of TF antigen levels was in the As2O3-concentration dependent fashion.

One of these genes with overexpression is inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate receptor type 3 (IP3R3). IP3R3 is an intracellular Ca2+ release channel responsible for mobilizing stored Ca2+. Three different receptor types have been molecularly cloned, and their genes have been classified into a family. But the role of the IP3 signaling pathway in the peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancers is still unclear. In this study, IP3R3 is overexpressed in gastric cancer cell lines established from malignant ascites, but weakly expressed in gastric cancer cell lines established from primary tumor as well as in normal gastric epithelial cells. IP3R1 and 2 are expressed only weakly or not at all in these cells. The antagonist of IP3R, 2-APB, inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis of gastric cancer cells from malignant ascites at concentrations of 100 nM to 100 microM in a dose dependent manner. Conversely, 2-APB showed a weak effect on other gastric cancer cells established from primary tumors (SNU1), lymph node metastases or liver metastases (MKN1 or 74), methothelial cell lines Met5A and myeloid leukemia cell HL60 cells. This suggests that this inhibitory effect depends on the level of IP3R3 expression. As cells that express IP3R3 mRNA (i.e., pancreatic aciner cells) are known to have a secretory function in which IP3/Ca2+ signaling has been shown to be involved, IP3R3 may be a prerequisite for secretion in gastric cancer cells. These results indicate that IP3R3 may be specifically involved in gastric cancer peritoneal dissemination and that IP3R3 may be a molecular target of the peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer. Its antagonist, 2-APB, may thus be useful for the treatment of gastric cancer, especially for peritoneal dissemination.","['Sakakura, Chouhei', 'Miyagawa, Koji', 'Fukuda, Kenichiro', 'Shimomura, Katsumi', 'Takemura, Manabu', 'Takagi, Tsuyoshi', 'Kin, Shuichi', 'Nakase, Yuen', 'Fujiyama, Junshin', 'Mikoshiba, Katsuhiko', 'Okazaki, Yasushi', 'Hayashizaki, Yoshihide', 'Hagiwara, Akeo', 'Yamagishi, Hisakazu']","['Sakakura C', 'Miyagawa K', 'Fukuda K', 'Shimomura K', 'Takemura M', 'Takagi T', 'Kin S', 'Nakase Y', 'Fujiyama J', 'Mikoshiba K', 'Okazaki Y', 'Hayashizaki Y', 'Hagiwara A', 'Yamagishi H']","['Dept. of Digestive Surgery, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and 95% confidence limits (CI) were calculated for age-specific familial risk in offspring by an exact proband status. The familial risks for offspring cancer were increased at 24/25 sites from concordant cancer in only the parent, at 20/21 sites from a sibling proband and at 12/12 sites from a parent and sibling proband.

When a sibling was affected, even prostate, renal, squamous cell skin, endocrine, gastric and lung cancer and leukemia showed SIRs in excess of 3.00. The highest cumulative risks were found for familial breast (5.5%) and prostate (4.2%) cancers. We identified reliable familial risks for 24 common neoplasms, most of which lack guidelines for clinical counseling or action level. If, for example, a familial SIR of 2.2 would be use as an action level, counseling would be needed for most cancers at some diagnostic age groups.

Each stage of the NK cytolytic pathway, (binding, activation and killing) was evaluated to identify the alterations responsible for the reduced cytotoxicity of the variant relative to its drug-sensitive parental line. The major cause of the decreased susceptibility to NK cytolysis was found to be reduced conjugate formation by the MDR variant. Activation of NK effectors by parental and MDR cells with concomitant release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) correlated with conjugate formation. N6/ADR was also more resistant than NALM6 to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and to cytotoxic factors released from NK cells as measured both by 51Cr-release and by DNA fragmentation. This is the first report of a P-gp-positive leukemic line that exhibits reduced conjugate formation as well as increased resistance to NK-mediated killing mechanisms.

Twenty tRAs, selected based on modulation of paclitaxel cytotoxicity in Pgp-overexpressing MDA435/LCC6(mdr1) cells, were studied for modulation of retention and cytotoxicity of substrates of MRP-1 and BCRP as well as Pgp in established cell lines overexpressing each of these transporters. Four tRAs modulated MRP-1 and 17 modulated BCRP in addition to Pgp. The four broad-spectrum tRAs strongly modulated daunorubicin and mitoxantrone efflux and enhanced their cytotoxicity in cell lines overexpressing the three MDRs, decreasing IC(50) values by as much as 97% [corrected]. These tRAs, especially tRA 98006, have promise for development as clinical broad-spectrum MDR modulators and warrant more preclinical analysis to determine pharmacokinetic interactions and efficacy.","['Brooks, Tracy A', 'Minderman, Hans', ""O'Loughlin, Kieran L"", 'Pera, Paula', 'Ojima, Iwao', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Bernacki, Ralph J']","['Brooks TA', 'Minderman H', ""O'Loughlin KL"", 'Pera P', 'Ojima I', 'Baer MR', 'Bernacki RJ']","['Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics and Leukemia Section, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*metabolism', 'Bridged-Ring Compounds/*chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Taxoids/*chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity']",2003/11/18 05:00,2004/07/29 05:00,['2003/11/18 05:00'],"['2003/11/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/18 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2003 Nov;2(11):1195-205.,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Bridged-Ring Compounds)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Taxoids)', '1605-68-1 (taxane)']",,,,"['1 R01 CA 73872-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1 R01 GM-42798/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '1 R21 CA 89938-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1 R21 CA98457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09072-28/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,"['Mol Cancer Ther. 2004 Jan;3(1):101.

Consequently, ATO-based therapies are being investigated in other cancers. We have reported that the combination of ATO and ascorbic acid is an effective strategy in chemoresistant myeloma cell lines and in plasma cells from patients. ATO action is multimodal and appears to involve thiol depletion, increased reactive oxygen species production, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), and activation of caspases. To better define the ATO death pathway, we asked whether caspase activity is required for ATO-mediated cell death. Here we report that ATO exerts cytotoxic effects in myeloma cell lines via both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways. We monitored ATO-induced changes in cell viability, caspase activity, superoxide production, and DeltaPsi(m) in the presence or absence of the caspase inhibitors t-butoxy carbonyl-Asp.fluoromethylketone (BocD.fmk) and Z-Val-Ala-Asp.fluoromethylketone (zVAD.fmk) and the anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine. Consistent with glutathione levels dictating ATO action, N-acetylcysteine abrogated ATO-induced changes in cell death, caspase activation, free radical production, and loss of DeltaPsi(m) in all the cell lines we tested. Experiments with caspase inhibitors suggested at least two models for ATO death signaling. In 8226/S cells, blockade of caspases had no effect on loss of cell viability, increase in reactive oxygen species production, and minimal effects on the loss of DeltaPsi(m). In contrast, BocD.fmk or zVAD.fmk conferred significant protection from the effects of ATO in U266 cells and MM1.S cells. Chemoresistant variants of 8226/S and MM1.S displayed similar ATO-induced death pathways as their respective parental lines. Studies with myeloma cells from bone marrow biopsies indicated that ATO initiates a caspase-independent pathway in the majority of samples.","['McCafferty-Grad, Jennifer', 'Bahlis, Nizar J', 'Krett, Nancy', 'Aguilar, Tatiana M', 'Reis, Isildinha', 'Lee, Kelvin P', 'Boise, Lawrence H']","['McCafferty-Grad J', 'Bahlis NJ', 'Krett N', 'Aguilar TM', 'Reis I', 'Lee KP', 'Boise LH']","['Sylvester Cancer Center, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33101, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Plasma Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/11/18 05:00,2004/07/29 05:00,['2003/11/18 05:00'],"['2003/11/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/18 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2003 Nov;2(11):1155-64.,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oxides)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",,,,"['R01CA97243/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29CA77837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

With the exception of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected macrophages, current models predict that the vps machinery is recruited by Gag to viral budding sites at the cell surface. However, here we demonstrate that HIV Gag and murine leukemia virus (MLV) Gag also drive assembly intracellularly in cell types including 293 and HeLa cells, previously believed to exclusively support budding from the plasma membrane. Using live confocal microscopy in conjunction with electron microscopy of cells generating fluorescently labeled virions or virus-like particles, we observed that these retroviruses utilize late endosomal membranes/multivesicular bodies as assembly sites, implying an endosome-based pathway for viral egress. These data suggest that retroviruses can interact with the vps sorting machinery in a more traditional sense, directly linked to the mechanism by which cellular proteins are sorted into multivesicular endosomes.","['Sherer, Nathan M', 'Lehmann, Maik J', 'Jimenez-Soto, Luisa F', 'Ingmundson, Alyssa', 'Horner, Stacy M', 'Cicchetti, Gregor', 'Allen, Philip G', 'Pypaert, Marc', 'Cunningham, James M', 'Mothes, Walther']","['Sherer NM', 'Lehmann MJ', 'Jimenez-Soto LF', 'Ingmundson A', 'Horner SM', 'Cicchetti G', 'Allen PG', 'Pypaert M', 'Cunningham JM', 'Mothes W']","['Section of Microbial Pathogenesis, Yale University School of Medicine, 295 Congress Ave, New Haven, CT 06536, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Traffic,"Traffic (Copenhagen, Denmark)",100939340,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Endosomes/metabolism/ultrastructure/virology', 'Exocytosis/*physiology', 'Gene Products, gag/metabolism', 'HIV/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Protein Transport', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Virion/genetics/metabolism', '*Virus Replication']",2003/11/18 05:00,2004/07/02 05:00,['2003/11/18 05:00'],"['2003/11/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['135 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0854.2003.00135.x [doi]']",ppublish,Traffic. 2003 Nov;4(11):785-801. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0854.2003.00135.x.,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",,,,"['1R01CA098727-0/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 57256-04/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 07680/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Antibodies against neutrophils or HLA molecules from the donor are thought to be the primary causative agents. Rarely, antibodies in the recipient may react with transfused neutrophils and initiate the same events, which raises the possibility that TRALI may also occur in an allogeneic PBPC transplantation setting. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old Japanese man with acute lymphoblastic leukemia developed TRALI immediately after the infusion of marrow cells from an unrelated donor. The infusion was suspended, and he gradually improved after receiving steroids and oxygen support. The next day, the remaining cells, which were separated to MNCs, were infused with no reactions. He then recovered over 5 days without the use of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: Laboratory evaluation disclosed the presence of antibodies to neutrophils in his sera sampled after transplantation, but not in the donor's marrow graft. Hence, antibodies to neutrophils in the recipient may have reacted with neutrophils in the graft and contributed to the development of TRALI. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of TRALI after allogeneic BMT. TRALI should be recognized as a rare but serious complication in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Urahama, Norinaga', 'Tanosaki, Ryuji', 'Masahiro, Kami', 'Iijima, Kimiko', 'Chizuka, Aki', 'Kim, Sung-Won', 'Hori, Akiko', 'Kojima, Rie', 'Imataki, Osamu', 'Makimito, Atsushi', 'Mineishi, Shin', 'Takaue, Yoichi']","['Urahama N', 'Tanosaki R', 'Masahiro K', 'Iijima K', 'Chizuka A', 'Kim SW', 'Hori A', 'Kojima R', 'Imataki O', 'Makimito A', 'Mineishi S', 'Takaue Y']","['Stem Cell Transplant Unit, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antibodies/blood', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/*etiology', 'Male', 'Neutrophils/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Pulmonary Edema/diagnostic imaging/*etiology', 'Radiography, Thoracic', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome/diagnostic imaging/*etiology']",2003/11/18 05:00,2003/12/13 05:00,['2003/11/18 05:00'],"['2003/11/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['542 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1537-2995.2003.00542.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2003 Nov;43(11):1553-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.2003.00542.x.,['0 (Antibodies)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A phase II trial of thalidomide was conducted in patients with relapsed- or refractory-AML previously treated with cytarabine-containing regimens. A total of 16 patients with refractory- or relapsed-AML were treated with thalidomide 200-800 mg orally daily (median dose 400 mg daily) for a median of 27 d (range, 3-94 d). Overall, one patient (6%) achieved complete remission (CR) lasting for 36 months, and two patients had a transient reduction in marrow blasts from 8% and 7% to less than 5% in both cases. There was no correlation between reduction in levels of angiogenesis markers and response. Toxicities related to thalidomide were significant, and precluded dose escalation beyond 400 mg orally daily in most patients. Although there appears to be some evidence of biological activity, single agent thalidomide is not an optimal choice of therapy for salvaging patients with relapsed- or refractory-AML.

This pattern of HTLV-1 replication over time is very different from that observed in asymptomatic carriers and reminiscent of that observed in ATLL, a result consistent with the proposal of ID as an ATLL cofactor.","['Gabet, Anne-Sophie', 'Kazanji, Mirdad', 'Couppie, Pierre', 'Clity, Emmanuel', 'Pouliquen, Jean-Francois', 'Sainte-Marie, Dominique', 'Aznar, Christine', 'Wattel, Eric']","['Gabet AS', 'Kazanji M', 'Couppie P', 'Clity E', 'Pouliquen JF', 'Sainte-Marie D', 'Aznar C', 'Wattel E']","[""Unite d'Oncogenese Virale, UMR5537 CNRS-Universite Claude Bernard, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Clone Cells', 'Dermatitis/*immunology/parasitology/*virology', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Lamivudine/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/parasitology', 'Parasitic Diseases/immunology/virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Regression Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Viral Load', 'Virus Replication']",2003/11/18 05:00,2003/12/05 05:00,['2003/11/18 05:00'],"['2003/11/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['4565 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04565.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Nov;123(3):406-12. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04565.x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '2T8Q726O95 (Lamivudine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of relapses (74%) occurred within 3 years from diagnosis, and most involved the bone marrow alone or with overt extramedullary relapse. Early relapse was more common in children with T-ALL and those with unfavourable cytogenetics. Factors influencing second remission included length of first remission and type of relapse. Children who had not received previous cranial irradiation had a superior survival. The German relapse score involving length of first remission, site of relapse and immunophenotype was highly predictive of outcome: event-free survival with 95% confidence intervals at 6 years for patients who received modern treatment [intensive chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation (BMT)] was 78% (51-92%) for standard risk, 41% (33-49%) for intermediate risk and 19% (10-31%) for highest risk. Retrospective comparison of BMT with chemotherapy showed no difference in the intermediate-risk group but a possible advantage in the highest risk group. Follow-up of 235 patients who relapsed after chemotherapy and received a third course of treatment showed an extremely high early attrition rate, but a small number of patients survived in third remission. We conclude that new approaches are needed to individualize therapy in intermediate-risk patients and to improve the outcome for those in the highest risk group. Only a small number of children can be treated effectively in third remission.","['Chessells, Judith M', 'Veys, Paul', 'Kempski, Helena', 'Henley, Patricia', 'Leiper, Ali', 'Webb, David', 'Hann, Ian M']","['Chessells JM', 'Veys P', 'Kempski H', 'Henley P', 'Leiper A', 'Webb D', 'Hann IM']","['Department of Haematology/Oncology, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Failure']",2003/11/18 05:00,2003/12/05 05:00,['2003/11/18 05:00'],"['2003/11/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['4584 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04584.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Nov;123(3):396-405. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04584.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such genetically modified T cells have been used in clinical trials for their graft-versus-leukaemia effects following allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In the event of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) the cells were susceptible to elimination through exposure to ganciclovir. We have investigated the impact of T-cell activation, required for successful retrovirus-mediated gene transfer, on T-cell receptor repertoire profile, subset distribution and antiviral potential. Using a combination of antibodies against CD3 and CD28, T cells were transduced at high efficiency when exposed to retrovirus between 48 and 72 h later. Lymphocytes had undergone up to seven cycles of cell division by the end of the procedure. Although the T-cell receptor Vbeta repertoire was not altered after retroviral transduction, there were notable shifts in subset profiles with an increased proportion of CD45RO cells in transduced populations. T cells continued to proliferate for several days after transduction and were difficult to sustain under the extended culture conditions required to generate virus-specific T cells. These observations may explain the lower than expected levels of GVHD and poor antiviral immunity reported in recent trials.","['Qasim, Waseem', 'King, Douglas', 'Buddle, Jo', 'Verfuerth, Stephanie', 'Kinnon, Christine', 'Thrasher, Adrian J', 'Gaspar, Hubert B']","['Qasim W', 'King D', 'Buddle J', 'Verfuerth S', 'Kinnon C', 'Thrasher AJ', 'Gaspar HB']","['Molecular Immunology Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, UK. w.qasim@ich.ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*administration & dosage', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/analysis', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/analysis', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Simplexvirus/*enzymology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation/*virology', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic/methods']",2003/11/18 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/11/18 05:00'],"['2003/11/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['4672 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04672.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Nov;123(4):712-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04672.x.,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The induced SOCS1 inhibits the signalling pathway through the association with a variety of tyrosine kinase proteins. In this study, the mutation analyses, CpG island methylation status, and the expression of the SOCS1 gene in 112 chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) samples, five leukaemia cell lines, and 30 normal controls were analysed. No genetic mutations of SOCS1 gene were noted in the CML samples. The SOCS1 gene was hypermethylated in 67% and 46% of the blastic and chronic phase CML samples respectively (P < 0.0001). However, there was no methylation of the SOCS1 gene in normal controls or CML in molecular remission. The methylation status of the SOCS1 gene is consistent with the results of the real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry staining. Our results demonstrate that the SOCS1 gene silencing is caused by the methylation of CpG islands in CML and is reversed to an unmethylated status in molecular remission. As SOCS1 has universal activity to negatively regulate several cytokine signalling pathways, the loss of the negative regulation of cytokine signalling by the SOCS1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of CML progression.","['Liu, Ta-Chih', 'Lin, Sheng-Fung', 'Chang, Jan-Gowth', 'Yang, Ming-Yu', 'Hung, Shih-Ya', 'Chang, Chao-Sung']","['Liu TC', 'Lin SF', 'Chang JG', 'Yang MY', 'Hung SY', 'Chang CS']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. d730093@cc.kmu.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins']",2003/11/18 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/11/18 05:00'],"['2003/11/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['4660 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04660.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Nov;123(4):654-61. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04660.x.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were heavily pretreated, most of them having progressed despite one to three courses of high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue. For patients conditioned with low dose total body irradiation and Fludarabine, development of full (100%) donor chimerism (FDC) within the first 3-4 months strongly depended on the number of T cells transplanted. This putative graft-versus-haematopoiesis effect, however, did not coincide with clinical response. Rather, 10 of 17 patients progressed although FDC in peripheral blood was achieved. In contrast, clinical graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) of grade III-IV was associated with disease remission. Four of six patients achieved complete remission (CR) and one patient achieved a partial remission (PR) in close temporal relation with their acute GvHD. Two of four patients in CR succumbed to the consequences of this side effect. One patient in PR progressed soon after successful treatment of the GvHD, one of two patients with a long-lasting CR developed chronic GvHD. Our observations suggest the existence of two distinct immune effects in MM following allogeneic transplantations with reduced conditioning regimen. First, the putative graft-versus-haematopoiesis effect that induced FDC was observed in all patients receiving unmanipulated grafts. Secondly, the graft-versus-myeloma effect that induced CR did not correlate with FDC but was associated with grade III-IV GvHD in our group of heavily pretreated patients.","['Luft, Thomas', 'Moos, Marion', 'Goldschmidt, Hartmut', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Gorner, Martin']","['Luft T', 'Moos M', 'Goldschmidt H', 'Ho AD', 'Gorner M']","['Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Poliklinik and Medizinische Klinik V, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Graft vs Host Reaction', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology/pathology/surgery', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2003/11/18 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/11/18 05:00'],"['2003/11/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['4670 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04670.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Nov;123(4):646-53. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04670.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant methylation of RASSF1A was found in nine of 32 MM patients and in one of four MM cell lines (U266), where the associated loss of transcription was reversible by demethylation treatment. RASSF1A transcription was further investigated on anti-CD138-sorted plasma cell-enriched bone marrow samples from 10 MM, one PCL and three reactive plasmacytosis patients. While the wild-type RASSF1A transcript was detected in all three reactive plasmacytosis and the PCL samples, we found no detectable wild-type transcripts in six of 10 MM samples studied. In two MM samples, only the non-functional variant transcript was detected, whereas the other four showed loss of transcription. In great contrast to western data, RAS mutations were identified in only four of 31 (13%) MM patients. While no RASSF1A or BRAF mutation (V599E) was detected in any of the primary MM studied (n = 21), the latter was found in the U266 cell line. Taken together, these data indicate that alterations of RAS signalling are critical in MM pathogenesis. In our current studies of Chinese MM patients, these alterations involved frequent RASSF1A inactivation (60%) as a result of transcriptional silencing or expression of a non-functional variant transcript.","['Ng, Margaret H L', 'Lau, K M', 'Wong, W S', 'To, K W', 'Cheng, S H', 'Tsang, K S', 'Chan, Natalie P H', 'Kho, Bonnie C S', 'Lo, K W', 'Tong, Joanna H M', 'Lam, C W', 'Chan, Joyce C W']","['Ng MH', 'Lau KM', 'Wong WS', 'To KW', 'Cheng SH', 'Tsang KS', 'Chan NP', 'Kho BC', 'Lo KW', 'Tong JH', 'Lam CW', 'Chan JC']","['Department of Anatomical & Cellular Pathology, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong (SAR). margaretng@cuhk.edu.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'China', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",2003/11/18 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/11/18 05:00'],"['2003/11/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['4664 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04664.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Nov;123(4):637-45. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04664.x.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RASSF1 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the CD56+ CD(dim/-) patients, LGL lymphocytes were CD4+ CD8- in one patient, CD4/CD8 double positive (DP) in three, and CD4- CD8+ in two. The CD4+ CD8dim DP cells expressed a CD8alphaalpha homodimer. T-cell receptor (TCR) Vbeta complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) size distribution analysis and direct sequencing identified at least 1 in-frame clonal TCR Vbeta transcript in each patient; three patients had two or three different clonal sequences. To determine whether these transcripts were translated into cell surface TCR, we performed flow cytometric analysis using Vbeta monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). A single Vbeta protein was identified in patients, even those with multiple in-frame transcripts. Previous and present results suggest that CD56+ CD16(dim/-) LGL leukaemia is more common than previously thought, and is associated with unusual phenotypes. When assessed using only molecular techniques, the monoclonal status of this disease may be misinterpreted as oligoclonal; thus, flow cytometric analysis using Vbeta mAb is quite useful. Because mAbs do not cover the entire Vbeta repertoire, assessing clonality using a combination of molecular methods and mAbs is preferable.","['Karasawa, Masamitsu', 'Mitsui, Takeki', 'Isoda, Atsushi', 'Tsumita, Yuki', 'Irisawa, Hiroyuki', 'Yokohama, Akihiko', 'Handa, Hiroshi', 'Matsushima, Takafumi', 'Tsukamoto, Norifumi', 'Murakami, Hirokazu', 'Nojima, Yoshihisa']","['Karasawa M', 'Mitsui T', 'Isoda A', 'Tsumita Y', 'Irisawa H', 'Yokohama A', 'Handa H', 'Matsushima T', 'Tsukamoto N', 'Murakami H', 'Nojima Y']","['Blood Transfusion Service, University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Gunma University, Maebashi, Japan. karasawa@showa.gunma-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'CD56 Antigen/analysis', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*analysis', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*analysis', 'Receptors, IgG/analysis']",2003/11/18 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/11/18 05:00'],"['2003/11/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['4665 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04665.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Nov;123(4):613-20. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04665.x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 is not associated with B-cell lymphoma. The relationship between B-cell lymphoma and HTLV-1 was analysed retrospectively in early stage B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) according to HTLV-1 infection and pathological features. We analysed 198 cases of head and neck B-cell NHL treated with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy; 21 were seropositive and 177 were seronegative for HTLV-1. We also immunostained 26 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBL), including 12 seropositive and 14 seronegative for HTLV-1 respectively, for CD20, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, MIB-1 and T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen (TIA-1) to examine the phenotype, immunity and proliferation activity. The 5-year overall survival rates were 78% and 49% (P = 0.007, log rank test) for HTLV-1 seronegative and seropositive cases respectively. Infection with HTLV-1 was significantly associated with poor survival in patients with B-cell lymphoma by multivariate analysis. For DLBL, HTLV-1 infection was not a significant factor, but the overall survival curve was similar to that of the 21 seropositive B-cell lymphoma cases. Lymphoma cells were negative for TIA-1, but the background lymphocytes were positive for this marker. The number of TIA-1-positive cells was higher in HTLV-1-negative cases than in-positive cases. In conclusion, patients with B-cell-NHL (B-NHL) who are also HTLV-1 carriers have a poorer prognosis than non-carriers. HTLV-1 does not seem to be associated with lymphomagenesis of the B phenotype itself, but correlates with host immunity by reducing the number of cytotoxic T-cells.","['Suefuji, Hiroaki', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Hayabuchi, Naofumi', 'Nakamura, Katsumasa', 'Kikuchi, Masahiro']","['Suefuji H', 'Ohshima K', 'Hayabuchi N', 'Nakamura K', 'Kikuchi M']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD56 Antigen/analysis', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Carrier State', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*complications/mortality', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/mortality/*virology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/mortality/*virology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/mortality/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",2003/11/18 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/11/18 05:00'],"['2003/11/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['4653 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04653.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Nov;123(4):606-12. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04653.x.,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While medical treatments in the past 30 years have improved survival rates, children's psychological experiences and quality of life during and after their illness have received limited attention. OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the therapeutic effects of play on 3- to 5-year-old children with leukaemia compared with a control group of healthy children. METHOD: The participants with leukaemia (n = 11) were from the external oncology clinic of an urban children's hospital; control children (n = 11) attended a day care centre. Measures included children's experience of stress, social and cognitive play behaviours, and daily mood. RESULTS: A series of manova revealed that the children with leukaemia, compared with the control children, engaged in (a) significantly fewer total play behaviours, and in particular less (b) parallel, (c) group and (d) dramatic play. Pearson correlations revealed significant relationships between reports of 'being happy' and play only for children with leukaemia. Quantitative and qualitative analyses revealed a pattern of repetitive play activities week after week for children with leukaemia, but not controls. DISCUSSION: Findings are discussed in light of the theoretical and practical implications for children undergoing treatment for leukaemia.","['Gariepy, N', 'Howe, N']","['Gariepy N', 'Howe N']","['Marie Curie Cancer Care, Edenhall Centre, London, UK. nadine.gariepy@mariecurie.org.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Child Care Health Dev,"Child: care, health and development",7602632,IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Anxiety/psychology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child Behavior/*psychology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology', 'Male', 'Play and Playthings/*psychology', 'Psychological Tests', 'Psychology, Social', 'Stress, Psychological/psychology']",2003/11/18 05:00,2004/02/13 05:00,['2003/11/18 05:00'],"['2003/11/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['372 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2214.2003.00372.x [doi]']",ppublish,Child Care Health Dev. 2003 Nov;29(6):523-37. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2214.2003.00372.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conclude that given an overall limited number of reported cases of blastic NK-cell lymphoma/leukaemia, its association with various myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorders seen in a subset of patients ( approximately 15-20%) is more than coincidental and may indicate their common origin.","['Kazakov, D V', 'Mentzel, T', 'Burg, G', 'Dummer, R', 'Kempf, W']","['Kazakov DV', 'Mentzel T', 'Burg G', 'Dummer R', 'Kempf W']","['Unit of Dermatopathology, Department of Dermatology, University Hospital, Gloriastrasse 31, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', '*Killer Cells, Natural', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*pathology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology']",2003/11/18 05:00,2003/12/19 05:00,['2003/11/18 05:00'],"['2003/11/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['5639 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2133.2003.05639.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 2003 Oct;149(4):869-76. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2133.2003.05639.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An investigation on the peculiar activities of bezafibrate could clarify some of the molecular events and the relationship with the biochemical and pharmacological properties of this class of compounds. In this view, the human acute promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell line and human rabdomiosarcoma TE-671 cell line were cultured in media containing bezafibrate and a number of observations such as spectrophotometric analysis of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes, NMR metabolite determinations, phosphofructokinase enzymatic analysis, and differentiation assays were carried on. Bezafibrate induced a derangement of NADH cytochrome c reductase activity accompanied by metabolic alterations, mainly a shift to anaerobic glycolysis and an increase of fatty acid oxidation, as shown by NMR analysis of culture supernatants where acetate, lactate, and alanine levels increased.

Known ophthalmic manifestations of HTLV-1 include malignant infiltrates in patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, retinal degeneration, neuroophthalmic disorders, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca in patients with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, and HTLV-1-associated uveitis. This report reviews the recent developments and ocular findings reported in patients with HTLV-1-related diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Most of the knowledge of the ocular manifestations of HTLV-1 comes from southwestern Japan, which has the highest incidence of infection worldwide. During the past few years, however, ocular disease associated with HTLV-1 has been described in patients from other endemic areas genetically distinct and geographically distant from Japan. The most interesting of these was the recognition of corneal pathology in Brazilian and Caribbean patients with HTLV-1 that have not been described in Japanese patients. Other developments include the use of molecular techniques in the diagnostic evaluation of ocular tissues from HTLV-1 patients, and clinical studies demonstrating choroidal involvement by indocyanine green angiography in patients with HTLV-1-associated uveitis, and suggesting that retinal vasculitis unresponsive to corticosteroid therapy maybe a poor prognostic sign. SUMMARY: The spectrum of ocular disease related to HTLV-1 continues to expand. Routine evaluation of HTLV-1-infected patients is important because immune-mediated or neoplastic ocular involvement may occur during the disease course.

However, target identification and drug development are limited by insufficient numbers of primary T-ALL cells and by their high rate of spontaneous apoptosis. We established a human interleukin-7 (IL-7)-dependent T-ALL cell line, TAIL7, that maintains several biologic and signaling properties of its parental leukemia cells. TAIL7 cells are pre-T-ALL cells that proliferate in response to IL-7 and IL-4. IL-7 stimulation of TAIL7 cells prevents spontaneous in vitro apoptosis and induces cell activation and cell cycle progression. The signaling events triggered by IL-7 include down-regulation of p27(kip1) and hyperphosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Stimulation of TAIL7 cells by IL-7 leads to phosphorylation of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3), signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), Akt/PKB (protein kinase B), and extracellular-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (Erk1/2). Importantly, specific blockade of JAK3 by its inhibitor WHI-P131 abrogates the IL-7-mediated proliferation and survival of TAIL7 cells, suggesting that activation of JAK3 is critical for IL-7 responsiveness by these cells. Because TAIL7 cells seem to be a biologic surrogate for primary leukemia T cells, this cell line constitutes a valuable tool for the study of the signaling pathways implicated in T-ALL. Exploitation of this cell line should allow the identification of molecular targets and promote the rational design and validation of antileukemia signaling inhibitors.","['Barata, Joao T', 'Boussiotis, Vassiliki A', 'Yunes, Jose A', 'Ferrando, Adolfo A', 'Moreau, Lisa A', 'Veiga, J Pedro', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Look, A Thomas', 'Nadler, Lee M', 'Cardoso, Angelo A']","['Barata JT', 'Boussiotis VA', 'Yunes JA', 'Ferrando AA', 'Moreau LA', 'Veiga JP', 'Sallan SE', 'Look AT', 'Nadler LM', 'Cardoso AA']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20031113,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Division', '*Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism', 'Interleukin-7/*genetics/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 3', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2003/11/15 05:00,2004/04/21 05:00,['2003/11/15 05:00'],"['2003/11/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-12-3861 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50107-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Mar 1;103(5):1891-900. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-12-3861.

We hypothesized that the increased expression ratios of AML-1A to AML-1B also induced abnormal expression of other hematopoietic and bone-specific genes that contribute to the poor prognosis of MM patients with high levels of MIP-1 alpha. We found that interleukin-3 (IL-3) was also induced by the imbalanced AML-1A and AML-1B expression in myeloma. IL-3 mRNA levels were increased in CD138+ purified myeloma cells with increased AML-1A-to-AML-1B expression from MM patients, and IL-3 protein levels were significantly increased in freshly isolated bone marrow plasma from MM patients (66.4 +/- 12 versus 22.1 +/- 8.2 pg/mL; P = .038). IL-3 in combination with MIP-1 alpha or receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) significantly enhanced human osteoclast (OCL) formation and bone resorption compared with MIP-1 alpha or RANKL alone. IL-3 stimulated the growth of interleukin-6 (IL-6)-dependent and IL-6-independent myeloma cells in the absence of IL-6, even though IL-3 did not induce IL-6 expression by myeloma cells.

This technique does not require the definition of the tumor antigen or HLA haplotype of the patients. We applied this approach to induce HLA class I- and class II-restricted T-cell responses directed against malignant cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Here, we show that DCs generated from monocytes of patients with B-CLL induce leukemia-specific cytotoxic and proliferative T-cell responses on transfection with total RNA isolated from autologous leukemic B lymphocytes. Standard 51Cr-release assays showed specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted cytotoxic activity against the autologous leukemic B cells and DCs transfected with CLL-RNA, whereas nonmalignant B cells were spared. The specificity of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response was confirmed using cold target inhibition assays and by blocking HLA class I molecules. Furthermore, we established a protocol for the amplification of whole B-CLL mRNA. The use of DCs transfected with in vitro amplified B-CLL mRNA elicited specific T-cell responses similar to the results obtained with native mRNA. These data suggest that vaccinations using DCs transfected with RNA might be a potent new strategy in the treatment of CLL.","['Muller, Martin R', 'Tsakou, Garyfalia', 'Grunebach, Frank', 'Schmidt, Susanne M', 'Brossart, Peter']","['Muller MR', 'Tsakou G', 'Grunebach F', 'Schmidt SM', 'Brossart P']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20031113,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigens, CD19/biosynthesis', 'CD4 Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'CD5 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'CD8 Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Division', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Electroporation', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'RNA/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",2003/11/15 05:00,2004/04/21 05:00,['2003/11/15 05:00'],"['2003/11/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-06-2097 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50089-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Mar 1;103(5):1763-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-06-2097.

Two principal effector proteins for cAMP are protein kinase A (PKA) and EPAC (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP), a Rap guanosine 5'-diphosphate (GDP) exchange factor. We here examine whether varying expression of EPAC accounts for the discrepant sensitivity of B-CLL and T cells to PDE4 inhibitor-induced apoptosis. B-CLL and peripheral blood B cells express EPAC1 transcript, whereas T-CLL, peripheral blood T cells, monocytes, and neutrophils do not. Treatment with the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram induces Rap1 activation in B-CLL cells but not in peripheral blood B cells, T-CLL, or any of the normal hematopoietic lineages examined. The EPAC-specific cAMP analog 8CPT-2Me-cAMP (8-(4-chloro-phenylthio)-2'-O-methyladenosine-3',5'-cAMP) activates Rap1 in B-CLL cells, but, unlike rolipram/forskolin or 8-Bromo-cAMP, it does not induce PKA activation, as judged by phosphorylation of the transcription factor cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB).

Here, we describe the preclinical profile of another immunoconjugate of CalichDMH, CMC-544, targeted to CD22 expressed by B-lymphoid malignancies. CMC-544 comprises a humanized IgG4 anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody (mAb), G5/44, covalently linked to CalichDMH via an acid-labile 4-(4'-acetylphenoxy) butanoic acid (AcBut) linker. Both CMC-544 and unconjugated G5/44 bound human CD22 with subnanomolar affinity. CMC-544, but not unconjugated G5/44, exerted potent cytotoxicity against CD22+ B-cell lymphoma (BCL) cell lines (inhibitory concentration of 50%: 6-600 pM CalichDMH). CMC-544 caused a potent inhibition of growth of small but established BCL xenografts leading to cures (therapeutic index > 10). CMC-544 prevented the establishment of BCL xenografts and also caused regression of large BCLs (> 1.5 g tumor mass). In contrast, unconjugated CalichDMH, unconjugated G5/44, and an isotype-matched control conjugate, CMA-676, were ineffective against these BCL xenografts. Thus, CD22-targeted delivery of CalichDMH is a potent and effective preclinical therapeutic strategy for BCLs. The strong antitumor profile of CMC-544 supports its clinical evaluation as a treatment option for B-lymphoid malignancies.","['DiJoseph, John F', 'Armellino, Douglas C', 'Boghaert, Erwin R', 'Khandke, Kiran', 'Dougher, Maureen M', 'Sridharan, Latha', 'Kunz, Arthur', 'Hamann, Philip R', 'Gorovits, Boris', 'Udata, Chandrasekhar', 'Moran, Justin K', 'Popplewell, Andrew G', 'Stephens, Sue', 'Frost, Philip', 'Damle, Nitin K']","['DiJoseph JF', 'Armellino DC', 'Boghaert ER', 'Khandke K', 'Dougher MM', 'Sridharan L', 'Kunz A', 'Hamann PR', 'Gorovits B', 'Udata C', 'Moran JK', 'Popplewell AG', 'Stephens S', 'Frost P', 'Damle NK']","['Department of Oncology Discovery, Wyeth Research, Pearl River, NY 10965, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20031113,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*therapeutic use', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Inotuzumab Ozogamicin', 'Lectins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/metabolism/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Models, Chemical', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Protein Binding', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2', 'Time Factors']",2003/11/15 05:00,2004/04/21 05:00,['2003/11/15 05:00'],"['2003/11/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-07-2466 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50096-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Mar 1;103(5):1807-14. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-07-2466.

Numerous studies have implicated HOXA9 as one of the possible targets of MLL fusion proteins. To determine if HOXA9 was required for leukemia development by MLL fusion genes, we compared the effects of the Mll-AF9 knock-in mutation in mice in the presence or absence of Hoxa9. Both groups of mice showed myeloid expansion at 8 weeks and then developed myeloid leukemia with a similar incidence and time course. The leukemia in the mice lacking Hoxa9 generally displayed a more immature myeloid phenotype than that in the mice that were wild-type for Hoxa9. Gene expression profiling revealed that expression of Mll-AF9 led to overexpression of Hoxa5, Hoxa6, Hoxa7, Hoxa9, and Hoxa10. Thus, genes of the Hox-a cluster are important in defining the phenotype but not the incidence of Mll-AF9 leukemia. These results demonstrate that the Mll-AF9 fusion gene disrupts the expression of several Hox genes, none of which as a single gene is likely to be necessary for development of leukemia. Instead, we propose that the ""Hox code"" minimally defined by the Hoxa5-a9 cluster is central to MLL leukemogenesis.","['Kumar, Ashish R', 'Hudson, Wendy A', 'Chen, Weili', 'Nishiuchi, Ritsuo', 'Yao, Qing', 'Kersey, John H']","['Kumar AR', 'Hudson WA', 'Chen W', 'Nishiuchi R', 'Yao Q', 'Kersey JH']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20031113,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Leukemia/*etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2003/11/15 05:00,2004/04/21 05:00,['2003/11/15 05:00'],"['2003/11/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-07-2582 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50098-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Mar 1;103(5):1823-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-07-2582.

In this report, we show that AML1 point mutations were found in 26 (23.6%) of 110 patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEBt), and AML following MDS (defined these 3 disease categories as MDS/AML). Among them, 9 (8.2%) mutations occurred in the carboxy (C)-terminal region, which were exclusively found in MDS/AML and were strongly correlated with sporadic MDS/AML. All patients with MDS/AML with an AML1 mutation expressed wild-type AML1 protein and had a significantly worse prognosis than those without AML1 mutations. Most AML1 mutants lost trans-activation potential, regardless of their DNA binding potential. These data suggested that AML1 point mutation is one of the major driving forces of MDS/AML, and these mutations may represent a distinct clinicopathologic-genetic entity.","['Harada, Hironori', 'Harada, Yuka', 'Niimi, Hiromasa', 'Kyo, Taiichi', 'Kimura, Akiro', 'Inaba, Toshiya']","['Harada H', 'Harada Y', 'Niimi H', 'Kyo T', 'Kimura A', 'Inaba T']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan. herf1@hiroshima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20031113,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'COS Cells', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/epidemiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism']",2003/11/15 05:00,2004/04/16 05:00,['2003/11/15 05:00'],"['2003/11/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-09-3074 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50028-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Mar 15;103(6):2316-24. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-09-3074.

All causes of death for male workers 30-69 years old provided by the National Mortality Information System between 1979 and 1998 were evaluated. To estimate cancer mortality risks of selected sites, mortality odds ratio (MOR) was employed, and three reference populations were used. Higher mortality of esophagus, stomach, and larynx cancer in agricultural workers 50-69 years old was observed in the period from 1979 to 1988 and of esophagus and stomach cancer from 1989 to 1998. Agricultural workers 30-49 years old showed higher, but not statistically significant, mortality by stomach, esophagus, liver, testis, and prostate cancer, and soft-tissue sarcoma in the period of 1979-1988, and by testis and penis cancer, leukemia, and soft-tissue sarcoma in the period of 1989-1998. Despite the limitations of ecological approaches concerning causality ascertainment, we believe that this study raises questions of the possible role of pesticide exposure on the cancer mortality profile among Brazilian agricultural workers.","['Meyer, Armando', 'Chrisman, Juliana', 'Moreira, Josino Costa', 'Koifman, Sergio']","['Meyer A', 'Chrisman J', 'Moreira JC', 'Koifman S']","['Centro de Estudos da Saude do Trabalhador e Ecologia Humana, Escola Nacional de Saude Publica, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rua Leopoldo Bulhoes, 1480.

SCL has also been detected in CNS, where other members of the bHLH-family have been shown to be indispensable for neuronal development; however, no detailed expression pattern of SCL has so far been described. We have generated a map of SCL expression in the embryonic and adult mouse brain based on histochemical analysis of LacZ reporter gene expression in sequential sections of brain tissue derived from SCL-LacZ knockin mice. The expression of LacZ was confirmed to reflect SCL expression by in situ hybridisation. LacZ expression was found in a range of different diencephalic, mesencephalic and metencephalic brain nuclei in adult CNS. Co-localisation of LacZ with the neuronal marker NeuN indicated expression in post-mitotic neurons in adulthood. LacZ expression by neurons was confirmed in tissue culture analysis. The nature of the pretectal, midbrain and hindbrain regions expressing LacZ suggest that SCL in adult CNS is potentially involved in processing of visual, auditory and pain related information. During embryogenesis, LacZ expression was similarly confined to thalamus, midbrain and hindbrain. LacZ staining was also evident in parts of the intermediate and marginal zone of the aqueduct and ventricular zone of the fourth ventricle at E12.5 and E14. These cells may represent progenitor stages of differentiating neural cells. Given the presence of SCL in both the developing brain and in post-mitotic neurons, it seems likely that the function of SCL in neuronal differentiation may differ from its function in maintaining the differentiated state of the mature neuron.","['van Eekelen, J A M', 'Bradley, C K', 'Gothert, J R', 'Robb, L', 'Elefanty, A G', 'Begley, C G', 'Harvey, A R']","['van Eekelen JA', 'Bradley CK', 'Gothert JR', 'Robb L', 'Elefanty AG', 'Begley CG', 'Harvey AR']","['Centre for Child Health Research and WAIMR, University of Western Australia, at the Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, PO Box 855, West Perth WA 6872, Australia. ankev@ichr.uwa.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Brain/*embryology/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Central Nervous System/embryology/growth & development/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Pregnancy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2003/11/15 05:00,2004/03/03 05:00,['2003/11/15 05:00'],"['2003/11/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0306452203005712 [pii]', '10.1016/s0306-4522(03)00571-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 2003;122(2):421-36. doi: 10.1016/s0306-4522(03)00571-2.,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, using the lithium-pilocarpine status epilepticus model, we performed a detailed in situ hybridization time-course study of five gp130 cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, leukemia inhibitory factor [LIF], IL-11, oncostatin-m [OSM], and ciliary neurotrophic factor), gp130, and the receptors of the cytokines we found to be induced (IL-6 receptor [IL-6R], LIF receptor [LIF-R], and IL-11 receptor [IL-11R]). Additionally, to further understand the regulation of these cytokines, we compared their expression with the pattern of neuronal degeneration and microglial activation. Under control conditions, all cytokines, except LIF, exhibited faint to moderate expression in hippocampal principal layers. After seizure, IL-6, LIF, and IL-11 exhibited a rapid, robust, and transient upregulation in non-principal cells. LIF also exhibited a remarkably early and transient induction in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. OSM exhibited only a mild and inconsistent induction. All receptors examined were strongly expressed only in hippocampal principal layers under control conditions. A mild and late induction of the IL-6R, LIF-R, and IL-11R occurred after seizure with a scattered distribution. A progressive and chronic induction of gp130 was observed in cells that appeared to be associated with blood vessels. Degeneration of hilar interneurons and CA1 pyramidal cells was early and progressive. Granule neurons of the dentate gyrus, however, exhibited a delayed and precipitous pattern of degeneration, specifically in the lateral portion of the superior blade. Microglial activation was maximal 24-48 h post-seizure. We speculate that gp130 cytokines play a paracrine, neuromodulatory role in the hippocampus since both before and after seizure, principal cells appear to be the major cell type expressing the receptors for these cytokines. Furthermore, we suggest that activity-dependent mechanisms may be involved in the regulation of cytokines expressed early, and that relatively late occurring cytokine expression may be elicited by injury-related stimuli.","['Rosell, D R', 'Nacher, J', 'Akama, K T', 'McEwen, B S']","['Rosell DR', 'Nacher J', 'Akama KT', 'McEwen BS']","['Laboratory of Neuroendocrinology, The Rockefeller University, 1230 York Avenue, Box 165, New York, NY 10021, USA. roselld@rockefeller.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hippocampus/chemistry/metabolism', 'Male', 'Microglia/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Nerve Degeneration/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Cytokine/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Status Epilepticus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2003/11/15 05:00,2004/03/03 05:00,['2003/11/15 05:00'],"['2003/11/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0306452203005931 [pii]', '10.1016/s0306-4522(03)00593-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 2003;122(2):329-48. doi: 10.1016/s0306-4522(03)00593-1.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (cytokine receptor, GLM-R)']",,,,"['5P01AG 16765/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07739/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'MH 41256/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'NS10611/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Information about the presentations and outcomes of patients with STM are limited. The authors sought to compare the clinical characteristics, course, and outcomes of patients with primary or secondary thyroid malignancies. METHODS: The authors reviewed the medical records of 8 children with PTM and 17 children with STM referred to St Jude Children's Research Hospital between February 1962 and February 2002 for evaluation and treatment of malignant thyroid carcinoma. RESULTS: The 8 children who had primary thyroid carcinoma had it diagnosed at a median age of 12.5 years (range, 7.3 to 16.3 years). Seven patients had papillary carcinoma, and 1 patient had follicular carcinoma. Three of the 8 (37.5%) had metastatic disease involving regional lymph nodes; 2 patients (25.0%) had lung metastases. Six patients required radioactive iodine (I 131) ablation for residual or metastatic disease after surgical resection. All 8 patients remain alive a median of 22.6 years after diagnosis (range, 0.7 to 30.5 years); 1 continues to receive radioactive iodine (I 131) ablation for persistent disease. Seventeen patients had thyroid carcinoma as a second malignant neoplasm after treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 6), Hodgkin's disease (n = 5), central nervous system tumor (n = 2), Wilms' tumor (n = 1), retinoblastoma (n = 1), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 1), or neuroblastoma (n = 1). Patients with secondary thyroid carcinoma presented at a median age of 21.5 years (range, 15.3 to 42.6 years), a median of 16.2 years (range, 0.9 to 29.2 years) after diagnosis of the primary cancer. Twelve of the 17 patients (70.6%) had received radiation to the thyroid gland during therapy for the primary cancer. Four patients (23.5%) had metastatic disease involving regional lymph nodes. Six patients (35.3%) required I(131) ablation for residual or metastatic disease after thyroidectomy. At the time of this report, all 17 patients are alive and in continue to be free of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric thyroid carcinoma is uncommon and responds well to current therapy. Given the limited period of follow-up of our cohort of secondary malignant thyroid tumors that arise after childhood cancer, these lesions appear to have similar presentations and outcomes when compared with primary carcinomas and can therefore be managed in the same manner.","['Gow, Kenneth W', 'Lensing, Shelly', 'Hill, D Ashley', 'Krasin, Matthew J', 'McCarville, M Beth', 'Rai, Shesh N', 'Zacher, Margie', 'Spunt, Sheri L', 'Strickland, Donald K', 'Hudson, Melissa M']","['Gow KW', 'Lensing S', 'Hill DA', 'Krasin MJ', 'McCarville MB', 'Rai SN', 'Zacher M', 'Spunt SL', 'Strickland DK', 'Hudson MM']","[""Department of Surgery, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma, Follicular/*epidemiology/surgery', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Carcinoma, Papillary/*epidemiology/radiotherapy/secondary/surgery', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/therapeutic use', 'Lung Neoplasms/secondary', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tennessee/epidemiology', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*epidemiology/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Thyroidectomy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/11/14 05:00,2004/02/27 05:00,['2003/11/14 05:00'],"['2003/11/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0022346803005633 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3468(03)00563-3 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 2003 Nov;38(11):1574-80. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3468(03)00563-3.,['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)'],49,,,['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens showed lymphocytic meningitis, but activated lymphocytes and low glucose levels were both noted in 7 patients. HSV DNA was detected in all CSF specimens, and HSV type 2 was identified in 7. Eight patients had suspected HSV-associated mucocutaneous lesions at the time of meningitis onset. Six patients had initial radiculalgia, with sphincter involvement in 2. Eleven patients received intravenous antiviral therapy, but treatment was delayed for 6 patients. Two of the 6 patients for whom treatment was delayed developed encephalitis and died, whereas 2 others experienced persistent neurological symptoms.

However, no clear correlation was observed between CD33 expression on leukemic blasts and response to GO therapy. We analyzed the CD33 specificity of GO-induced cell death and the effect of GO on CD33-negative malignancies. We demonstrate that lysis induced by clinically relevant GO concentrations is partially CD33 mediated, and that efficient non-CD33-mediated GO uptake can occur via endocytosis. In agreement with these results, we observed GO-mediated death of human CD33-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells both in vitro and in vivo in an NOD/SCID mouse model. Finally, sensitivity to GO-induced cell death was at least partially determined by the activation status of leukemic cells, with cells in activated phases of the cell cycle being most effective in both CD33-specific GO internalization, renewed expression of CD33 molecules, and non-CD33-mediated GO uptake via endocytosis. In conclusion, these data provide mechanistic insight into the efficacy of GO in CD33-positive as well as in CD33-negative malignancies with endocytic capacity, and provide a rationale for the use of GO in the treatment of malignancies with endocytic capacity.","['Jedema, I', 'Barge, R M Y', 'van der Velden, V H J', 'Nijmeijer, B A', 'van Dongen, J J M', 'Willemze, R', 'Falkenburg, J H F']","['Jedema I', 'Barge RM', 'van der Velden VH', 'Nijmeijer BA', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands. i.jedema@lumc.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aminoglycosides/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*physiology', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Endocytosis', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutagens/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",2003/11/14 05:00,2004/02/26 05:00,['2003/11/14 05:00'],"['2003/11/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403205 [doi]', '2403205 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Feb;18(2):316-25. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403205.,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Cd33 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a death receptor ligand that induces apoptosis preferentially in tumors. However, CLL cells seem to be resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The TRAIL apoptotic signaling pathway has also been implicated in genotoxin-induced apoptosis through upregulation of TRAIL death receptors DR4 and DR5. In the present study, we demonstrate that the treatment of primary CLL cells with CLB or Flu increases the mRNA, protein and cell surface expression levels of DR4 and DR5 in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast to CLL cells, drug treatment fails to increase significantly the expression of DR4 or DR5 in normal lymphocytes. CLL cells are, however, resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis compared to B-cell lines. In contrast, combinational treatment using CLB or Flu with TRAIL (100 ng/ml) gave a synergistic apoptotic response. Furthermore, TRAIL is readily detectable on the cell surface of CLL cells, but TRAIL expression fails to increase following drug treatment. Preventing TRAIL from interacting with DR4 and DR5 decreases CLB-induced apoptosis in CLL cells. A similar, but less marked effect is observed with Flu. These findings indicate the involvement of the TRAIL apoptotic pathway in the mechanism of action of chemotherapy, and this mechanism could be utilized to sensitize CLL cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.","['Johnston, James B', 'Kabore, Albert F', 'Strutinsky, Jeanna', 'Hu, Xiaojie', 'Paul, James T', 'Kropp, Dianne M', 'Kuschak, Brenda', 'Begleiter, Asher', 'Gibson, Spencer B']","['Johnston JB', 'Kabore AF', 'Strutinsky J', 'Hu X', 'Paul JT', 'Kropp DM', 'Kuschak B', 'Begleiter A', 'Gibson SB']","['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, 675 McDermot Ave., Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada R3E 0V9.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Chlorambucil/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",2003/11/14 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/11/14 05:00'],"['2003/11/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1207004 [doi]', '1207004 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Nov 13;22(51):8356-69. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207004.,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Bcr moiety is essential for the transforming activity of the Bcr/Abl oncogene. In search of physiologically relevant Bcr and Bcr/Abl-interacting proteins, we performed an interaction screen in yeast using the entire Bcr protein as bait. We here report that the alpha catalytic subunit of protein kinase CKII strongly and specifically forms a complex with Bcr in yeast in mouse lysates. The region in Bcr responsible for CKIIalpha binding was localized to residues 242-413. CKIIalpha was previously shown to be involved in leukemogenesis and tumorigenesis using different experimental approaches including mouse models. Inhibition of Bcr/Abl P190 in lymphoma cells from Bcr/Abl transgenic mice using imatinib reduced CKIIalpha activity.

Exposure of K562 cells to greater or less than 3.0 mM SB or 3.0 mM SAHA for 24-48 hr resulted in a marked induction of mitchondrial damage (e.g., cytochrome c release) and apoptosis, events associated with downregulation of Bcr/Abl and Raf-1, induction of p21CIP1, inactivation of MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and p70S6K, and a dramatic increase in JNK activation. HDI-mediated apoptosis was attenuated by pharmacologic JNK inhibitors and enhanced by the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 as well as by the JNK activator anisomycin. Interestingly, HDI-induced JNK activation was potentiated by pharmacologic MEK inhibition. Furthermore, HDI lethality was significantly diminished in cells ectopically expressing constitutively active MEK1, confirming a functional role for MEK/ERK inactivation in HDI-mediated apoptosis. Similar events were observed in Bcr/Abl+ LAMA 84 cells. Lastly, the free radical scavenger L-N-acetylcysteine (LNAC) attenuated HDI-mediated ROS generation, JNK activation, and apoptosis. Together, these findings support a model in which induction of apoptosis in Bcr/Abl+ cells by HDIs involves coordinate inactivation of the cytoprotective Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in conjunction with the ROS-dependent activation of JNK.","['Yu, Chunrong', 'Subler, Mark', 'Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Reese, Erin', 'Krystal, Geoffrey', 'Conrad, Daniel', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Yu C', 'Subler M', 'Rahmani M', 'Reese E', 'Krystal G', 'Conrad D', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', '*JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'K562 Cells/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2003/11/14 05:00,2004/03/09 05:00,['2003/11/14 05:00'],"['2003/11/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['454 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.2.5.454 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2003 Sep-Oct;2(5):544-51. doi: 10.4161/cbt.2.5.454.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",,,,"['CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

HOX genes are also expressed in normal adult cells, potentially in a tissue specific manner involving maintenance of the normal phenotype. In selected oncogenic transformations, mis-expression of many HOX genes have been shown, indicating an involvement of these transcriptional regulators in carcinogenesis and metastasis. Utilising quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays, the expression of 20 HOX genes and two known HOX co-factors, PBX1B and MEIS1, were analysed in human melanoma and breast cancer cell lines, comparing results against non-malignant cells. Alterations in HOX gene expression were observed for all malignant cells examined, with some dysregulated transcript levels seemingly random, and the expression of other HOX genes apparently following the same patterns in both skin and breast cancer establishment. Furthermore, HOX gene expression was correlated with the invasive capacity of the cells. The expression of the HOX co-factors PBX1B and MEIS1 showed no marked changes from the non-malignant to the malignant phenotypes, further indicating that it is dysregulated HOX gene expression, rather than dysregulated gene expression of HOX co-factors, that potentially commit the cell to re-differentiate and undergo oncogenic transformation.","['Svingen, Terje', 'Tonissen, Kathryn F']","['Svingen T', 'Tonissen KF']","['School of Biomolecular and Biomedical Science, Griffith University, Nathan, Queensland, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Homeobox/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Skin Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/11/14 05:00,2004/03/09 05:00,['2003/11/14 05:00'],"['2003/11/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['441 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.2.5.441 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2003 Sep-Oct;2(5):518-23. doi: 10.4161/cbt.2.5.441.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",,,,,['Cancer Biol Ther. 2003 Sep-Oct;2(5):524-5.

Seminal plasma and spermatozoa were collected from healthy volunteers and were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for cytokines. Epithelial and stromal cells from fertile women were cultured on matrigel or polystyrol and incubated with pooled seminal plasma or with transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which were found to be significantly concentrated in seminal plasma. Endometrial cytokine expression was analysed by RNase protection assay and supported by RT-PCR. Supernatants of highly purified spermatozoa did not contain detectable levels of IL-1beta, IL-6 and VEGF. Screening of seminal plasma revealed concentrations >10-fold above the serum level for TGF-beta1, IL-8 and VEGF. Incubation of epithelial cells with 0.1, 1 and 10% seminal plasma resulted in concentration-dependant stimulation of IL-1beta, IL-6 and LIF mRNA expression. Maximum stimulation was found in epithelial cells from tissue samples taken in the mid secretory phase. Epithelial mRNA expression of IL-1beta, IL-6 and LIF increased by stimulation with TGF-beta1 and IL-8, but not with VEGF. In conclusion, seminal plasma stimulates expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in endometrial epithelial cells in vitro.

This drug has the peculiarity of showing enhanced antitumor activity in cells with high glutathione S-transferase (GST)/glutathione content. The purpose of the study was to study multiple combinations of brostallicin with classical anticancer agents. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The cis-dichloro-diammine-platinum (cDDP)/brostallicin combination was tested in the human colon carcinoma (HCT-116) model transplanted in nude mice. Two treatment schedules were tested: cDDP followed by brostallicin 48 h after or brostallicin followed by cDDP. These two schemes were selected from the observation that tumor cells in vitro show an increased activity of GST 48 h after cDDP treatment. The HCT-116 model was used also to test the irinotecan (cPT-11)/brostallicin combination. The effect of brostallicin in combination with doxorubicin (DX) was studied in the i.v. injected murine L1210 leukemia. Three administration schedules were tested. The antitumor activity of brostallicin and Taxotere was tested on the A549 lung cancer xenografts. RESULTS: In line with the increased GST activity observed after treatment with cDDP, the cDDP/brostallicin interaction was sequence-dependent, leading to a more than additive antitumor effect, without additional toxicity, only when cDDP was given before brostallicin. The antitumor effect of CPT-11 was enhanced significantly by brostallicin cotreatment. A more than additive antitumor effect, without additional toxicity, was observed when DX/brostallicin were sequentially administered in L1210-bearing mice. Finally, additivity was observed when brostallicin/Taxotere simultaneous combination was tested. CONCLUSIONS: Although the precise molecular mechanism of interaction between brostallicin and the other tested cytotoxics has not yet been identified, a clear therapeutic gain is observed in preclinical models when brostallicin is combined with anticancer agents such as cDDP, DX, CPT-11, and Taxotere. These results indicate the potential therapeutic value of brostallicin in cancer combination treatment therapy.","['Sabatino, Maria Antonietta', 'Colombo, Tina', 'Geroni, Cristina', 'Marchini, Sergio', 'Broggini, Massimo']","['Sabatino MA', 'Colombo T', 'Geroni C', 'Marchini S', 'Broggini M']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Camptothecin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'DNA/genetics/*metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Guanidines/administration & dosage', 'Irinotecan', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Pyrroles/administration & dosage', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2003/11/14 05:00,2004/07/20 05:00,['2003/11/14 05:00'],"['2003/11/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/14 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Nov 1;9(14):5402-8.,"['0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'RPC6R41K4I (brostallicin)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study analyzes the ABCG2 expression and activity in 46 human de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia B- and T-lineage (ALL) samples. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: ABCG2 expression was measured flow cytometrically with the BXP-34 monoclonal antibody. ABCG2 functional activity was determined flow cytometrically by measuring mitoxantrone accumulation in combination with the ABCG2 inhibitor fumitremorgin C (FTC). To determine a possible effect of the transporters P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP1 and MRP2) on mitoxantrone accumulation, the accumulation was investigated in the presence of the P-glycoprotein inhibitor PSC 833 and MRP inhibitor MK-571. The ABCG2 gene was sequenced to investigate the amino acid at position 482. RESULTS: In B-lineage ALL (n = 23), the median BXP-34:IgG1 ratio was higher, namely 2.4 (range, 1.7-3.7), than in T-lineage ALL (n = 23; 1.9; range, 1.2-6.6; P = 0.003). The addition of FTC to mitoxantrone treatment caused a median increase in mitoxantrone accumulation of 21% (range, 0-140%) in B-lineage ALL. In T-lineage ALL, this FTC effect was less pronounced (5%; range, 0-256%; P = 0.013). The influence of FTC on mitoxantrone accumulation correlated with ABCG2 protein expression (r = 0.52; P < 0.001; n = 43). The increase in mitoxantrone accumulation, when FTC was added to cells treated with both PSC 833 and MK-571, correlated with the ABCG2 expression in B-lineage ALL but not in T-lineage ALL. Sequencing the ABCG2 gene revealed no ABCG2 mutation at position 482 in patients who accumulated more rhodamine after FTC. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that ABCG2 is expressed higher and functionally more active in B-lineage than in T-lineage ALL.","['Plasschaert, Sabine L A', 'van der Kolk, Dorina M', 'de Bont, Eveline S J M', 'Kamps, Willem A', 'Morisaki, Kuniaki', 'Bates, Susan E', 'Scheffer, George L', 'Scheper, Rik J', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'de Vries, Elisabeth G E']","['Plasschaert SL', 'van der Kolk DM', 'de Bont ES', 'Kamps WA', 'Morisaki K', 'Bates SE', 'Scheffer GL', 'Scheper RJ', 'Vellenga E', 'de Vries EG']","['Divisions of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, University Hospital Groningen, Groningen 9713 GZ, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bronchodilator Agents/pharmacology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/*metabolism', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Propionates/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology']",2003/11/14 05:00,2004/07/20 05:00,['2003/11/14 05:00'],"['2003/11/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/14 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Nov 1;9(14):5171-7.,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bronchodilator Agents)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Propionates)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5Q9O54P0H7 (verlukast)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'CW5S8OP3VO (tryptoquivaline)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The data of original and differentiation status of tumor can be analyzed by immunophenotype of bone marrow. These are necessary for diagnosis and treatment of lymphocytic malignancy. This study was designed to investigate the value of multiparameter flow cytometry in diagnosis of leukemia and bone marrow involvement of NHL. METHODS: The samples from 11 cases of untreated leukemia bone marrow and 41 cases of untreated NHL with bone marrow involvement and 2 cases of bone marrow whose biopsy could not be obtained due to huge mass in mediastinum and abdomen were detected by multiparameter flow cytometry using antibodies of T, B, Myeloid cell series. Three-color staining was done by CD45 combined with two cell series or special phase antibodies. Using CD45/SSC set gate to identify blast cells from mature cells. The samples were analyzed using five parameters [forward scatter (FSC), side scatter(SSC), McAb1-FITC, McAb2-PE, and CD45-cychrome]. RESULTS: Immunophenotype and diagnosis of 11 cases of leukemia were further confirmed by flow cytometry (FCM). Of 41 cases of NHL with bone marrow involvement, 33 cases (80.5%) lymph nodes immunophenotype by pathology diagnosis were consistent with bone marrow immunophenotype by FCM, 8 cases (19.5%) were inconsistent, but right diagnosis were made by combining with clinical presentation, pathology, bone marrow morphology and FCM. Another 2 cases with huge mediastinal mass and abdominal mass were diagnosed as T-NHL and B-NHL by bone marrow morphology and FCM without lymph node biopsy. CONCLUSION: Multiparameter flow cytometry of bone marrow can further ascertain the diagnosis of leukemia and NHL with bone marrow involvement. It also gives us data of cells lineage and differentiation status for leukemia and NHL. It is helpful for diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment.","['Sun, Xiao-Fei', 'He, Li-Rong', 'Feng, Hai-Lin', 'Yan, Su-Li', 'Xia, Zhong-Jun', 'Chen, Xiao-Qing']","['Sun XF', 'He LR', 'Feng HL', 'Yan SL', 'Xia ZJ', 'Chen XQ']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Center, Sun Yet-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, PR China. xfsun@21cn.com']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms/*diagnosis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2003/11/14 05:00,2004/02/18 05:00,['2003/11/14 05:00'],"['2003/11/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['1000467X2003111232 [pii]'],ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2003 Nov;22(11):1232-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies suggested that c-myc could regulate hTERT expression. This study was designed to examine the telomerase activity, the expression of hTERT and c-myc, and to analyze their correlations in acute leukemia. METHODS: The telomerase activity was semi-quantitatively assayed in mononuclear cells (MNCs) of bone marrow (BM) from 35 acute leukemia patients and 15 control cases by polymerase chain reaction enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (PCR-ELISA). The mRNA expression of hTERT and c-myc were determined using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the same time. RESULTS: The mean telomerase activity, the expression levels of the hTERT mRNA and c-myc mRNA in acute leukemia were 0.71+/-0.32, 0.47+/-0.36, and 0.85+/-0.31, respectively, which was significantly higher than those of control cases (P< 0.01). The telomerase activity and the expression level of c-myc mRNA were associated with the expression level of hTERT mRNA (P< 0.01). In the 25 follow-up patients, the mean telomerase activity and the expression level of the hTERT were 0.61+/-0.39 and 0.29+/-0.31 in complete remission cases, while 0.83+/-0.23 and 0.53+/-0.31 in none complete remission cases, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION: The telomerase activity and the expression of hTERT and c-myc mRNA were up-regulated in acute leukemia, and the elevated expression of hTERT may be an important adjuster of telomerase activity. It is likely that c-myc protein can stimulate the expression of hTERT and thereby enhance telomerase activity, which may involve in carcinogenesis of leukemia.","['Cheng, Xu', 'Chen, Zi-Xing', 'Wang, Wei', 'Fu, Jian-Xin', 'Cen, Jian-Nong', 'Yao, Li']","['Cheng X', 'Chen ZX', 'Wang W', 'Fu JX', 'Cen JN', 'Yao L']","['First Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, Jiangsu, PR China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Telomerase/*genetics/*metabolism']",2003/11/14 05:00,2004/02/18 05:00,['2003/11/14 05:00'],"['2003/11/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['1000467X2003111175 [pii]'],ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2003 Nov;22(11):1175-9.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The N(1)-substituents included benzyl, naphthalen-1-ylmethyl, anthracen-9-ylmethyl, and pyren-1-ylmethyl. The polyamine spacer units ranged from generic (4,4-triamine, 4,3-triamine, and diaminooctane) spacers to more exotic [2-(ethoxy)ethanoxy-containing diamine, hydroxylated 4,3-triamine, and cyclohexylene-containing triamine] spacers. Two control compounds were also evaluated: N-(anthracen-9-ylmethyl)-butylamine and N-(anthracen-9-ylmethyl)-butanediamine. Biological activities in L1210 (murine leukemia), alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO)-treated L1210, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and its polyamine transport-deficient mutant (CHO-MG) cell lines were investigated via IC(50) cytotoxicity determinations. K(i) values for spermidine uptake were also determined in L1210 cells. Of the series studied, the N(1)-benzyl-4,4-triamine system 6 had significantly higher IC(50) values (lower cytotoxicity) in the L1210, CHO, and CHO-MG cell lines. A cellular debenzylation process was observed in L1210 cells with 6 and generated ""free"" homospermidine. The size of the N(1)-arylmethyl substituent had direct bearing on the observed cytotoxicity in CHO-MG cells. The N(1)-naphthalenylmethyl, N(1)-anthracenylmethyl, and N(1)-pyrenylmethyl 4,4-triamines had similar toxicity (IC(50)s: approximately 0.5 microM) in CHO cells, which have an active polyamine transporter (PAT). However, this series had IC(50) values of >100 microM, 66.7 microM, and 15.5 microM, respectively, in CHO-MG cells, which are PAT-deficient. The observed lower cytotoxicity in the PAT-deficient CHO-MG cell line supported the premise that the conjugates use PAT for cellular entry. In general, moderate affinities for the polyamine transporter were observed for the N-arylmethyl 4,4-triamine series with their L1210 K(i) values all near 3 microM. In summary, the 4,4-triamine motif was shown to facilitate entry of polyamine conjugates into cells containing active polyamine transporters.","['Wang, Chaojie', 'Delcros, Jean-Guy', 'Cannon, Laura', 'Konate, Fanta', 'Carias, Horacio', 'Biggerstaff, John', 'Gardner, Richard Andrew', 'Phanstiel IV, Otto 4th']","['Wang C', 'Delcros JG', 'Cannon L', 'Konate F', 'Carias H', 'Biggerstaff J', 'Gardner RA', 'Phanstiel IV O 4th']","['Groupe de Recherche en Therapeutique Anticancereuse, Faculte de Medecine, 2, Avenue du Professeur Leon Bernard, University of Rennes 1, 35043 Rennes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Animals', 'Anthracenes/administration & dosage/chemistry/toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/chemistry/toxicity', 'Benzyl Compounds/administration & dosage/chemistry/toxicity', 'Biological Transport', 'CHO Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cricetinae', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods', 'Mutation', 'Naphthalenes/administration & dosage/chemistry/toxicity', 'Polyamines/*administration & dosage/chemistry/metabolism/toxicity', 'Pyrenes/administration & dosage/chemistry/toxicity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2003/11/14 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/11/14 05:00'],"['2003/11/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm030223a [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2003 Nov 20;46(24):5129-38. doi: 10.1021/jm030223a.,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzyl Compounds)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Pyrenes)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PTHrP produced by the tumor acts through a common PTH/PTHrP receptor to promote bone resorption, inhibit calcium excretion from the kidney, and induce hypercalcemia. Patients with HHM often develop cachexia associated with typical symptoms such as anorexia, malaise, nausea, constipation, polyuria, polydipsia, and confusion. The etiology of the cachexia is not fully understood but is thought to be caused by hypercalcemia and various cytokines such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, leukemia inhibitory factor, and others. In this study, we investigated the role of PTHrP in hypercalcemia and cachexia in HHM by using humanized anti-PTHrP antibody. A mouse monoclonal antibody that binds to PTHrP amino acid sequence 1-34 and inhibits PTHrP function has been humanized to create a specific and potent agent for the treatment of patients with HHM. The mouse monoclonal antibody has been shown to have antihypercalcemic activity against nude mice bearing human tumors. Because a mouse antibody is highly immunogenic in human patients, the complementarity-determining regions from the mouse antibody were grafted into a human antibody. The resulting humanized antibody specifically recognizes PTHrP(1-34) and neutralizes PTHrP functions in vitro and in vivo. The humanized anti-PTHrP antibody was administered intravenously to HHM model animals bearing tumors such as LC-6 human lung carcinoma. These animals showed symptoms similar to those of patients with HHM (eg, hypercalcemia and cachexia). The humanized anti-PTHrP antibody-treated animals responded with normalization of blood ionized calcium level through an improvement of bone metabolism and calcium excretion. Moreover, the treated animals also showed an improvement in body weight, ultromotivity, metabolic alkalosis, food consumption, water intake, serum phosphorus, and renal function. Consequently, the humanized antibody-treated animals experienced complete resolution of hypercalcemia and cachexia. These results suggest that the humanized antibody would be an effective and beneficial agent for patients with HHM, and that PTHrP is a major pathogenetic factor of hypercalcemia and cachexia in patients with HHM.","['Sato, Koh', 'Onuma, Etsuro', 'Yocum, Richard C', 'Ogata, Etsuro']","['Sato K', 'Onuma E', 'Yocum RC', 'Ogata E']","['Department of International Coordination, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd, Skizuuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Cachexia/*drug therapy/etiology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/*drug therapy/etiology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Animal', 'Neoplasms/complications/*metabolism', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein/immunology/*metabolism']",2003/11/13 05:00,2003/12/13 05:00,['2003/11/13 05:00'],"['2003/11/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0093775403004524 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminoncol.2003.08.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2003 Oct;30(5 Suppl 16):167-73. doi: 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2003.08.019.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)']",11,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This quest has taken a major leap forward with the demonstration that STI-571 (imatinib mesylate) induces clinical and molecular remissions in the majority of patients with interferon-refractory chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors through inhibition of the Bcr/Abl fusion protein required for the initiation and progression of chronic myelogenous leukemia and inhibition of a mutant, activated c-kit present in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Support for the concept of targeting products of fusion genes found in specific cancers was first provided by the efficacy of all-trans retinoic acid in acute promyelocytic leukemia where the RARalpha all-trans retinoic acid target is the target of multiple different chromosomal rearrangements. In breast cancer, trastuzumab, which alters the function of the HER2 proto-oncogene overexpressed in a portion of breast cancers, provides an additional example of targeting specific molecular aberrations present in cancer cells. Although the target for these signal transduction modulators is functional in normal cells, acceptable therapeutic indices sufficient to prevent tumor growth without unacceptable toxicities have been observed. Whether STI-571 and other signal transduction modulators also target the stroma, and specifically the neovasculature, in addition to the tumor remains an open question. The presence of the target in the cancer cells or in the surrounding stroma appears to be required but not sufficient for the action of molecular therapeutics. Thus, linking molecular diagnostics to identify patients where the target is amplified or activated and driving the pathophysiology of the patients' tumor to effective molecular therapeutics will be necessary to translate these concepts into approaches that will alter the outcome for breast cancer patients. This review will focus on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and novel molecules targeting this pathway to illustrate the questions and challenges underlying the implementation of molecular therapeutics in breast cancer.","['Mills, Gordon B', 'Kohn, Elise', 'Lu, Yiling', 'Eder, Astrid', 'Fang, Xianjun', 'Wang, Hongwei', 'Bast, Robert C', 'Gray, Joe', 'Jaffe, Robert', 'Hortobagyi, Gabriel']","['Mills GB', 'Kohn E', 'Lu Y', 'Eder A', 'Fang X', 'Wang H', 'Bast RC', 'Gray J', 'Jaffe R', 'Hortobagyi G']","['Department of Molecular Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Chromones/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Morpholines/therapeutic use', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2003/11/13 05:00,2003/12/13 05:00,['2003/11/13 05:00'],"['2003/11/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0093775403004445 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminoncol.2003.08.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2003 Oct;30(5 Suppl 16):93-104. doi: 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2003.08.011.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",96,,,['CA82716/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

TSP-1-mediated apoptosis was consistently associated with the up-regulation of active Caspase-3. Responses of 2 CD36 positive primary AML samples to TSP-1 and FA6-152 were similar with those of leukemia cell lines. TSP-1 significantly induced apoptosis in B-ALL but the counter-effects of FA6-152 were less apparent. CD36 negative AML cells appeared less susceptible to TSP-1 and FA6-152.

However, little information exists about the expression of the oncofetal fibronectin isoform containing the ED-B domain (ED-B+ fn) in adult human hematopoiesis. The study was aimed to analyze the ED-B+ fn expression in normal human bone marrow cells by immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The in vivo results were compared to ED-B+ fn expression in human long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMC), cytokine supported expansion cultures of CD34+ peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) and in leukemic cell lines with megakaryocytic characteristics (K562, CMK). ED-B+ fn protein was immunocytochemically demonstrated in normal bone marrow megakaryocytes as well as in megakaryocytic progenitor/precursor cells generated ex vivo from PBPC but we failed to detect ED-B+ fn mRNA. It was strongly expressed in LTBMC (RNA and protein). Analysis of human bone marrow mononuclear cells by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy revealed only cytoplasmic ED-B+ fn. The SCF/TPO induced megakaryocytic differentiation of ED-B+ fn negative CMK cells is associated with an increase of large megakaryocytes followed by an intracellular accumulation of ED-B+ fn mRNA and protein. We conclude that in normal human hematopoiesis ED-B+ fn protein expression and intracellular accumulation is restricted to differentiation of megakaryocytes. Low-abundant synthesis, intracellular accumulation and failure of membrane exposure might be due to a function during early events of wound healing (formation of a platelet-rich provisional extracellular matrix).","['Vogel, Wichard', 'Berndt, Alexander', 'Muller, Angelika', 'Dahse, Regine', 'Haas, Karl Michael', 'Borsi, Laura', 'Zardi, Luciano', 'Kosmehl, Hartwig']","['Vogel W', 'Berndt A', 'Muller A', 'Dahse R', 'Haas KM', 'Borsi L', 'Zardi L', 'Kosmehl H']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Rheumatology, and Immunology, Medical Center II, Eberhard Karls University, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Fibronectins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2003/11/13 05:00,2004/01/21 05:00,['2003/11/13 05:00'],"['2003/11/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/13 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2003 Dec;12(6):831-7.,['0 (Fibronectins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In total, 20 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia received an oral dose of 40 mg of simvastatin on study day 1. On study days 2-7, each patient received 400 mg of imatinib once daily orally and on study day 8, 400 mg imatinib together with 40 mg of simvastatin was given. Blood levels of simvastatin were measured predose and for 24 h postdose on study days 1 and 8. Two additional blood samples were taken for imatinib pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment on day 8 before, and 24 h after, imatinib administration. Imatinib increased the mean maximum concentration (C(max)) value of simvastatin two-fold and the area under concentration-time curve (AUC ((0-inf))) value 3.5-fold (P<0.001) compared with simvastatin alone. There was a statistically significant decrease in total-body clearance of drug from the plasma (CL/F) with a mean reduction of 70% for simvastatin (P<0.001): the mean half-life of simvastatin was prolonged from 1.4-2.7 h when given together with imatinib. No changes in imatinib PK parameters were found when given concomitantly with simvastatin. In conclusion, the coadministration of imatinib at steady state with 40 mg simvastatin increases the exposure (C(max) and AUCs) of simvastatin significantly (P<0.001) by two-three-fold. Caution is therefore required when administering imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window. The coadministration of simvastatin with imatinib (400 mg) was well tolerated and no major safety findings were reported in this study.","[""O'Brien, S G"", 'Meinhardt, P', 'Bond, E', 'Beck, J', 'Peng, B', 'Dutreix, C', 'Mehring, G', 'Milosavljev, S', 'Huber, C', 'Capdeville, R', 'Fischer, T']","[""O'Brien SG"", 'Meinhardt P', 'Bond E', 'Beck J', 'Peng B', 'Dutreix C', 'Mehring G', 'Milosavljev S', 'Huber C', 'Capdeville R', 'Fischer T']","[""Department of Haematology, University of Newcastle Medical School, Royal Victoria Infirmary, New Castle NE1 4LP, UK. s.g.o'brien@ncl.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Area Under Curve', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Simvastatin/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics']",2003/11/13 05:00,2004/01/08 05:00,['2003/11/13 05:00'],"['2003/11/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bjc.6601152 [doi]', '6601152 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2003 Nov 17;89(10):1855-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6601152.,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'AGG2FN16EV (Simvastatin)']",,,,,,,,,PMC2394453,,,,,

Apoptosis is activated either by death receptor-driven or mitochondrial pathways, both of which may provide potential targets for novel anticancer drugs. Although several ligands stimulating death receptors have been described, the actual molecular events triggering the mitochondrial pathway are largely unknown. Here, we show initiation of apoptosis by gradual depletion of the intracellular coenzyme NAD+. We identified the first low molecular weight compound, designated FK866, which induces apoptosis by highly specific, noncompetitive inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT), a key enzyme in the regulation of NAD+ biosynthesis from the natural precursor nicotinamide. Interference with this enzyme does not primarily intoxicate cells because the mitochondrial respiratory activity and the NAD+ -dependent redox reactions involved remain unaffected as long as NAD+ is not effectively depleted by catabolic reactions. Certain tissues, however, have a high turnover of NAD+ through its cleavage by enzymes like poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Such cells often rely on the more readily available nicotinamide pathway for NAD+ synthesis and undergo apoptosis after inhibition of NAPRT, whereas cells effectively using the nicotinic acid pathway for NAD+ synthesis remain unaffected. In support of this concept, FK866 effectively induced delayed cell death by apoptosis in HepG2 human liver carcinoma cells with an IC(50) of approximately 1 nM, did not directly inhibit mitochondrial respiratory activity, but caused gradual NAD+ depletion through specific inhibition of NAPRT. This enzyme, when partially purified from K562 human leukemia cells, was noncompetitively inhibited by FK866, and the inhibitor constants were calculated to be 0.4 nM for the enzyme/substrate complex (K(i)) and 0.3 nM for the free enzyme (K(i)'), respectively. Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide were both found to have antidote potential for the cellular effects of FK866. FK866 may be used for treatment of diseases implicating deregulated apoptosis such as cancer for immunosuppression or as a sensitizer for genotoxic agents. Furthermore, it may provide an important tool for investigation of the molecular triggers of the mitochondrial pathway leading to apoptosis through enabling temporal separation of NAD+ decrease from ATP breakdown and apoptosis by several days.","['Hasmann, Max', 'Schemainda, Isabel']","['Hasmann M', 'Schemainda I']","['Fujisawa GmbH, Neumarkter Strasse 61, 81673 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Acrylamides/*pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Mitochondria, Liver/drug effects/metabolism', 'NAD/metabolism', 'Niacin/pharmacology', 'Niacinamide/pharmacology', 'Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects', 'Pentosyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology']",2003/11/13 05:00,2004/01/17 05:00,['2003/11/13 05:00'],"['2003/11/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/13 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Nov 1;63(21):7436-42.,"['0 (Acrylamides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (N-(4-(1-benzoylpiperidin-4-yl)butyl)-3-(pyridin-3-yl)acrylamide)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '2679MF687A (Niacin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.12 (Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This alkaloid, which displays potent cytotoxic activities against multidrug-resistant tumor cell lines and is highly cytotoxic to prostate cancer cells, bears a 6H-[1]benzopyrano[4',3':4,5]pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinolin-one pentacyclic planar chromophore, whereas its synthetic 5,6-dehydro analogue, LAM-501, has a significantly tilted structure. DNA binding measurements by absorbance, fluorescence, and electric linear dichroism spectroscopy show that LAM-D is a weak DNA binder that intercalates between bp of the double helix. In contrast, the nonplanar analogue LAM-501 did not bind to DNA and failed to inhibit topoisomerase I. DNA intercalation may be required for the stabilization of topoisomerase I-DNA complexes by LAM-D. In the DNA relaxation assay, LAM-D strongly promoted the conversion of supercoiled DNA into nicked DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I. The marine product was approximately 5 times less efficient than camptothecin (CPT) at stabilizing topoisomerase I-DNA complexes, but interestingly, the two drugs exhibited slightly distinct sequence specificity profiles. Topoisomerase I-mediated DNA cleavage in the presence of LAM-D occurred at some sites common to CPT, but a few specific sites identified with CPT but not with LAM-D or conversely unique sites cleaved by LAM-D but not by CPT were detected. The distinct specificity profiles suggest that LAM-D and CPT interact differently with the topoisomerase I-DNA interface. A molecular modeling analysis provided structural information on the orientation of LAM-D within the topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complex. The marine alkaloid did not induce DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II. Immunoblotting experiments revealed that endogenous topoisomerase I was efficiently trapped on DNA by LAM-D in P388 and CEM leukemia cells. P388/CPT5 and CEM/C2 cell lines, both resistant to CPT and expressing a mutated top1 gene, were cross-resistant to LAM-D.

The expression of bFGF was significantly increased in AML patients [n = 81; median, 3.0 (interquartile range, 1.8-3.9) arbitrary units (AU)] as compared with controls [n = 18; 1.9 (1.5-2.3) AU]. The degree of bFGF expression did not correlate with microvessel density. bFGF/FGF receptor mRNA and bFGF protein were detected in different AML cell lines. To study autocrine growth stimulation of AML blasts, the AML cell lines HL-60, M-07e, and KG-1 were incubated with bFGF. A significant dose-dependent increase in proliferation and colony formation was observed. These effects were abrogated by the addition of a polyclonal anti-bFGF antibody. In conclusion, increased expression of bFGF in the bone marrow of AML patients seems to play an important role in the pathophysiology of AML by promoting autocrine growth stimulation of leukemic blasts.","['Bieker, Ralf', 'Padro, Teresa', 'Kramer, Julia', 'Steins, Martin', 'Kessler, Torsten', 'Retzlaff, Stephan', 'Herrera, Federico', 'Kienast, Joachim', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Mesters, Rolf M']","['Bieker R', 'Padro T', 'Kramer J', 'Steins M', 'Kessler T', 'Retzlaff S', 'Herrera F', 'Kienast J', 'Berdel WE', 'Mesters RM']","['Department of Medicine/Hematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Albert-Schweitzer-Strasse 33, D-48129 Muenster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics']",2003/11/13 05:00,2004/01/17 05:00,['2003/11/13 05:00'],"['2003/11/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/13 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Nov 1;63(21):7241-6.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, clonal analysis of BM from the cyclin D2-/- and cyclin D2+/+ mice confirmed that there were fewer B cell progenitors (B220+) in the cyclin D2-/- mice. In addition, the colonies from cyclin D2-/- mice were less mature (CD19lo) than those from cyclin D2+/+ mice (CD19Hi). The number of mature B2 B cells in vivo is the same in cyclin D2-/- and cyclin D2+/+ animals.

Without its ligand, retinoic acid (RA), PML-RAR functions as a constitutive transcriptional repressor, abnormally associating with the corepressor-histone deacetylase complex and blocking hematopoietic differentiation. In the presence of pharmacological concentrations of RA, PML-RAR activates transcription and stimulates differentiation. Even though it has been suggested that chromatin alteration is important for APL onset, the PML-RAR effect on chromatin of target promoters has not been investigated. Taking advantage of the Xenopus oocyte system, we compared the wild-type transcription factor RARalpha with PML-RAR as both transcriptional regulators and chromatin structure modifiers. Without RA, we found that PML-RAR is a more potent transcriptional repressor that does not require the cofactor RXR and produces a closed chromatin configuration. Surprisingly, repression by PML-RAR occurs through a further pathway that is independent of nucleosome deposition and histone deacetylation. In the presence of RA, PML-RAR is a less efficient transcriptional activator that is unable to modify the DNA nucleoprotein structure. We propose that PML-RAR, aside from its ability to recruit aberrant quantities of histone deacetylase complexes, has acquired additional repressive mechanisms and lost important activating functions; the comprehension of these mechanisms might reveal novel targets for antileukemic intervention.","['Segalla, Simona', 'Rinaldi, Laura', 'Kilstrup-Nielsen, Charlotte', 'Badaracco, Gianfranco', 'Minucci, Saverio', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Landsberger, Nicoletta']","['Segalla S', 'Rinaldi L', 'Kilstrup-Nielsen C', 'Badaracco G', 'Minucci S', 'Pelicci PG', 'Landsberger N']","[""Dipartimento di Biologia Strutturale e Funzionale, Universita dell'Insubria, 21052 Busto Arsizio (VA), Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Oocytes/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/metabolism', 'Xenopus']",2003/11/13 05:00,2003/12/17 05:00,['2003/11/13 05:00'],"['2003/11/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/13 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.23.23.8795-8808.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2003 Dec;23(23):8795-808. doi: 10.1128/MCB.23.23.8795-8808.2003.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,PMC262687,,,,,

Although there are only 24 amino acid differences between hCRM1 and rat CRM1 (rCRM1), rCRM1 can hardly support Rex activity, suggesting a role for rCRM1 as a determinant restricting the host range of HTLV-1. Here, we used a series of mutants, which were generated by interchanging residues of these CRM1s, to examine the relationship of hCRM1 functions. The functions for Rex multimerization and binding to nuclear export signals are mapped to different amino acid residues, and these are separable, suggesting that CRM1 not only functions as an export receptor but also participates in the formation of the RNA export complex through higher-ordered interaction with Rex. The region for the interaction with RanBP3, comprising four residues (amino acids [aa] 411, 414, 474, and 481), and the region for Rex multimerization, including two residues (aa 411 and 414), form an overlapped domain.

In addition to previous reported findings of occlusion of the central vein with endothelial cell damage, proliferation and activation of stellate cells, and collagen deposition in the central vein wall, there were prominent activated macrophages within the lumen and wall of central veins. The following mechanism of VOD was proposed: Tissue damage activates monocytes through monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. The secretory macrophages release TGF-beta, which promotes proliferation of stellate cells to cause collagenous thickening of the central vein. The activated stellate cells produce collagen. The normal drainage of the Space of Disse and sinusoids draining into the central vein are blocked by the fibrosis. This leads to extravasated RBCs trapped within the thickened central vein wall and impaction of RBCs in the sinusoids.","['Tang, Wendell', 'Ziring, David', 'Gershman, George', 'French, Samuel']","['Tang W', 'Ziring D', 'Gershman G', 'French S']","['Department of Pathology, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA 90509, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Netherlands,Exp Mol Pathol,Experimental and molecular pathology,0370711,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/chemically induced/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Liver/*cytology/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Macrophages/*ultrastructure', 'Mercaptopurine/adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Prednisone/adverse effects', 'Vincristine/adverse effects']",2003/11/13 05:00,2003/12/25 05:00,['2003/11/13 05:00'],"['2003/11/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0014480003000947 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-4800(03)00094-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Pathol. 2003 Dec;75(3):201-9. doi: 10.1016/s0014-4800(03)00094-7.,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'CCG-141 protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of the dead cells in intratumorally ATO-treated mice showed characteristic features of apoptosis, such as nuclear condensation and fragmentation, and were TUNEL-positive. The measurement of arsenic by using particle induced X-ray emission revealed that arsenic was accumulated more in the tumor than in brain, kidney or liver after the intravenous injection of ATO, which is consistent with the hemorrhagic cell death observed in ATO-treated tumor tissues. Thus, ATO appears to have potential for the treatment of solid tumors, as well as hematopoietic malignancies.","['Kito, Mariko', 'Matsumoto, Kenji', 'Wada, Naoko', 'Sera, Kouichiro', 'Futatsugawa, Shoji', 'Naoe, Tomoki', 'Nozawa, Yoshinori', 'Akao, Yukihiro']","['Kito M', 'Matsumoto K', 'Wada N', 'Sera K', 'Futatsugawa S', 'Naoe T', 'Nozawa Y', 'Akao Y']","['Institute of Applied Biochemistry, Yagi Memorial Park, Mitake, Kani-gun, Gifu 505-0116.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Brain/drug effects/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Kidney/drug effects/metabolism', 'Liver/drug effects/metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', 'Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/transplantation']",2003/11/13 05:00,2004/08/04 05:00,['2003/11/13 05:00'],"['2003/11/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/13 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2003.tb01393.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2003 Nov;94(11):1010-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2003.tb01393.x.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified a unique tumor antigen peptide pRL1a, IPGLPLSL that is recognized by CTL on BALB/c RL male 1 leukemia by peptide elution. The sequence of the peptide corresponded to the normally untranslated 5' region of akt. Cytotoxicity was generated in BALB/c spleen cells by in vivo and in vitro sensitization with pRL1a peptide in the form of multiple antigen peptide (MAP), but not the original form. pRL1a MAP immunization had a significant growth-inhibitory effect. pRL1a MAP was mostly internalized into the endosomal compartment of antigen-presenting cells, leaked to the cytosol, and degraded, and the pRL1a peptide produced was presented through the MHC class I pathway. In vivo depletion of CD4 T cells from tumor-inoculated BALB/c mice caused RL male 1 regression. Overexpression of the RLakt molecule seemed to induce CD4 immunoregulatory cells, which resulted in progressive RL male 1 growth in BALB/c mice. In vivo administration of anti-CD25 mAb (PC61) caused regression of RL male 1, suggesting that CD4(+) CD25(+) immunoregulatory cells were involved in the tumor growth. Recently, we improved the sensitivity and the efficacy of T cell antigen cloning from cDNA expression libraries by using large- and small-scale ELISPOT assays. Using the IFN-gamma ELISPOT method, we obtained a cDNA clone S35 of 937 bp recognized by AT-1 CTL on BALB/c Meth A sarcoma. S35 was a part of the retinoic acid-regulated nuclear matrix-associated protein (ramp). AT-1 CTL recognized the peptide LGAEAIFRL, which was derived from a newly created open reading frame due to the exon 14 extension.","['Uenaka, Akiko', 'Nakayama, Eiichi']","['Uenaka A', 'Nakayama E']","['Department of Immunology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine and Dentistry, Okayama 700-8558. uenaka@md.okayama-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Oligopeptides/immunology', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*immunology/prevention & control', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",2003/11/13 05:00,2004/08/04 05:00,['2003/11/13 05:00'],"['2003/11/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/13 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2003.tb01380.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2003 Nov;94(11):931-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2003.tb01380.x.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (pRL1a protein, mouse)', '0 (tumor-associated transplantation antigen)']",53,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The design of therapeutic strategies to preferentially kill malignant cells while minimizing harmful effects to normal cells depends on our understanding of the biological differences between cancer and normal cells. We have previously demonstrated that certain agents generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME) preferentially kill human leukemia cells without exhibiting significant cytotoxicity in normal lymphocytes. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the biochemical basis for such selective anticancer activity. METHODS: Flow cytometric analyses were utilized to measure intracellular O(2)(-) levels and apoptosis. MTT assays were used as indicators of cellular viability. Western blot analysis was used to measure the expression of antioxidant enzymes in cancer and normal cells. RESULTS: Malignant cells in general are more active than normal cells in the production of O(2)(-), are under intrinsic oxidative stress, and thus are more vulnerable to damage by ROS-generating agents. The intrinsic oxidative stress in cancer cells was associated with the upregulation of SOD and catalase protein expression, likely as a mechanism to tolerate increased ROS stress. The increase in SOD and catalase expression was observed both in primary human leukemia cells and in primary ovarian cancer cells. Both malignant cell types were more sensitive to 2-ME than their normal counterparts, as demonstrated by the significant accumulation of O(2)(-) and subsequent apoptosis. The administration of ROS scavengers in combination with 2-ME prevented the accumulation of O(2)(-) and abrogated apoptosis induction. CONCLUSIONS: O(2)(-) is an important mediator of 2-ME-induced apoptosis. The increased oxidative stress in cancer cells forces these cells to rely more on antioxidant enzymes such as SOD for O(2)(-) elimination, thus making the malignant cells more vulnerable to SOD inhibition than normal cells.","['Hileman, Elizabeth Oldham', 'Liu, Jinsong', 'Albitar, Maher', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Huang, Peng']","['Hileman EO', 'Liu J', 'Albitar M', 'Keating MJ', 'Huang P']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas M.

A similar but distinct current has been implicated in the control of cell proliferation in astrocytes. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we have examined the effects of the Cl- channel blocker tamoxifen on ion channel activity and cell proliferation in both HMC-1 and HLMCs. METHODS: We used the whole-cell patch-clamp technique to characterize macroscopic ion currents in mast cells before and after addition of tamoxifen. HMC-1 proliferation was assessed by incorporation of tritiated thymidine, HLMC proliferation was determined by counting cells in long-term culture, and cell viability was assessed by annexin V binding and propidium iodide uptake. RESULTS: In HMC-1, tamoxifen reduced the outward Cl- current at +130 mV by 73% +/- 9% at a concentration of 3 micromol/L and simultaneously opened a novel inwardly rectifying nonselective cation current with a mean inward current of 153 +/- 18 pA at -130 mV. Tamoxifen produced a dose-dependent inhibition of HMC-1 proliferation (90.3% +/- 4.0% inhibition at 30 micromol/L) without altering cell viability. Tamoxifen inhibited the outward ClC-5-like current in HLMCs, did not open an inward current, and produced a dose-dependent inhibition of HLMC proliferation in long-term culture. CONCLUSION: Tamoxifen inhibits HMC proliferation, possibly through ion channel modulation. This suggests that tamoxifen might be useful in the treatment of mast-cell-mediated diseases, including mastocytosis, asthma, and pulmonary fibrosis.","['Duffy, S Mark', 'Lawley, Wendy J', 'Kaur, Davinder', 'Yang, Weidong', 'Bradding, Peter']","['Duffy SM', 'Lawley WJ', 'Kaur D', 'Yang W', 'Bradding P']","['Division of Respiratory Medicine, Institute for Lung Health, University of Leicester Medical School, Leicester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,IM,"['Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Histamine/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ion Channels/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lung/cytology', 'Mast Cells/cytology/*pathology/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Tamoxifen/*pharmacology']",2003/11/12 05:00,2003/12/20 05:00,['2003/11/12 05:00'],"['2003/11/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.jaci.2003.07.004 [doi]', 'S0091674903020311 [pii]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2003 Nov;112(5):965-72. doi: 10.1016/j.jaci.2003.07.004.,"['0 (Ion Channels)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several reports also have shown that catechin has a protective effect against HIV infection, part of which is mediated by inhibiting virions to bind to the target cell surface. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of EGCG on the expression of CD4 molecules and on its ability to bind gp120, an envelope protein of HIV-1. METHODS: Peripheral blood CD4+ T cells were incubated in the presence of EGCG, and the expression of CD4 was evaluated by means of flow cytometry. The effect of EGCG on the antibody binding to CD4 was investigated by using a sandwich ELISA, and the effect on the gp120 binding to CD4 was analyzed by means of flow cytometry. RESULTS: EGCG efficiently inhibited binding of anti-CD4 antibody to its corresponding antigen. This effect was mediated by the direct binding of EGCG to the CD4 molecule, with consequent inhibition of antibody binding, as well as gp120 binding.

Rex function requires nuclear import, RNA binding, multimerization, and nuclear export. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the phosphorylation status of HTLV-2 Rex (Rex-2) correlates with RNA binding and inhibition of splicing in vitro. Recent mutational analyses of Rex-2 revealed that the phosphorylation of serine residues 151 and 153 within a novel carboxy-terminal domain is critical for function in vivo. To further define the functional domain structure of Rex-2, we evaluated a panel of Rex-2 mutants for subcellular localization, RNA binding capacity, multimerization and trans-dominant properties, and the ability to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Rex-2 mutant S151A,S153A, which is defective in phosphorylation and function, showed diffuse cytoplasmic staining, whereas mutant S151D,S153D, previously shown to be functional and in a conformation corresponding to constitutive phosphorylation, displayed increased intense speckled staining in the nucleoli. In vivo RNA binding analyses indicated that mutant S151A,S153A failed to efficiently bind target RNA, while its phosphomimetic counterpart, S151D,S153D, bound twofold more RNA than wild-type Rex-2. Taken together, these findings provide direct evidence that the phosphorylation status of Rex-2 is linked to cellular trafficking and RNA binding capacity. Mutants with substitutions in either of the two putative multimerization domains or in the putative activation domain-nuclear export signal displayed a dominant negative phenotype as well as defects in multimerization and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Several carboxy-terminal mutants that displayed wild-type levels of phosphorylation and localized to the nucleolus were also partially impaired in shuttling. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the carboxy terminus of Rex-2 contains a novel domain that is required for efficient shuttling. This work thus provides a more detailed functional domain map of Rex-2 and further insight into its regulation of HTLV replication.","['Narayan, Murli', 'Younis, Ihab', ""D'Agostino, Donna M"", 'Green, Patrick L']","['Narayan M', 'Younis I', ""D'Agostino DM"", 'Green PL']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biopolymers', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gene Products, rex/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism']",2003/11/12 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/11/12 05:00'],"['2003/11/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.23.12829-12840.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Dec;77(23):12829-40. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.23.12829-12840.2003.,"['0 (Biopolymers)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)']",,,,"['CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-069003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93584/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'TWO6053/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC262564,,,,,

Thymus and spleen cells from MoMLV-inoculated mice were plated on Mus dunni cells and mink cells, since these cells do not support the replication of MoMLV, and cells from A-MLV-inoculated mice were plated on ferret cells.

All of the MoMLV-inoculated mice also produced nonecotropic virus that was infectious for mink cells. Sequencing of three MoMLV- and two A-MLV-derived nonecotropic recombinants confirmed that these viruses contained substantial substitutions that included the regions of env encoding the surface (SU) protein and the 5' end of the transmembrane (TM) protein. The 5' recombination breakpoint for one of the A-MLV recombinants was identified in RNase H. The M. spretus-derived env substitutions were nearly identical to the corresponding regions in prototypical laboratory mouse polytropic proviruses, but the wild mouse infectious viruses had a more restricted host range. The M. spretus proviruses contributing to these recombinants were also sequenced. The seven sequenced proviruses were 99% identical to one another and to the recombinants; only two of the seven had obvious fatal defects. We conclude that the M. spretus proviruses are likely to be recent germ line acquisitions and that they contain functional genes that can contribute to the production of replication-competent virus.","['Jung, Yong Tae', 'Wu, Tiyun', 'Kozak, Christine A']","['Jung YT', 'Wu T', 'Kozak CA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-0460, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', 'Dogs', 'Mice', 'Mink', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/chemistry/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",2003/11/12 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/11/12 05:00'],"['2003/11/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.23.12773-12781.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Dec;77(23):12773-81. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.23.12773-12781.2003.,['0 (DNA Primers)'],,,,,,,,,PMC262560,,,,,

Roscovitine (Rosco), an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), inhibits the replication of HSV-1, HSV-2, human cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 by inhibiting specific steps or activities of viral regulatory proteins, indicating the broad and pleiotropic effects that cdks have on the replication of these viruses. We previously demonstrated that Rosco inhibits the transactivating activity of ICP0. In the present study, we asked whether Rosco also affects the ability of ICP0 to direct the degradation of ND10-associated proteins. For this purpose, WI-38 cells treated with cycloheximide (CHX) were mock infected or infected with wild-type HSV-1 or an ICP0(-) mutant (7134). After release from the CHX block, the infections were allowed to proceed for 2 h in the presence or absence of Rosco at a concentration known to inhibit ICP0's transactivating activity. The cells were then examined for the presence of ICP0 and selected ND10-associated antigens (promyelocytic leukemia antigen [PML], sp100, hDaxx, and NDP55) by immunofluorescence. Staining for the ND10-associated antigens was detected in </=20% of KOS-infected cells in the presence or absence of Rosco, demonstrating that Rosco-sensitive kinases are not required for ICP0's ability to direct the dispersal or degradation of these antigens. In contrast, >90% of 7134- and mock-infected cells stained positive for all ND10-associated antigens in the presence or absence of Rosco. Similar results were obtained with a non-ND10-associated antigen, DNA-PK(cs), a known target of ICP0-directed degradation. The results of the PML and DNA-PK(cs) immunofluorescence studies correlated with a decrease in the levels of these proteins as determined by Western blotting. Thus, the differential requirement for Rosco-sensitive cdk activities distinguishes ICP0's ability to direct the dispersal or degradation of cellular proteins from its transactivating activity.","['Davido, David J', 'Von Zagorski, William F', 'Maul, Gerd G', 'Schaffer, Priscilla A']","['Davido DJ', 'Von Zagorski WF', 'Maul GG', 'Schaffer PA']","['Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Roscovitine', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Vero Cells']",2003/11/12 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/11/12 05:00'],"['2003/11/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.23.12603-12616.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Dec;77(23):12603-16. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.23.12603-12616.2003.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Purines)', '0ES1C2KQ94 (Roscovitine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PRKDC protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,,,"['R01 AI041136/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA020260/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA20260/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI41136/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC262587,,,,,

In picornaviruses, as well as in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), cleavage of eIF4G by the viral protease leads to inhibition of protein synthesis directed by capped cellular mRNAs. In the present work, cleavage of both eIF4GI and eIF4GII has been analyzed by employing the proteases encoded within the genomes of several members of the family Retroviridae, e.g., Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV), mouse mammary tumor virus, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus. All of the retroviral proteases examined were able to cleave the initiation factor eIF4GI both in intact cells and in cell-free systems, albeit with different efficiencies. The eIF4GI hydrolysis patterns obtained with HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases were very similar to each other but rather different from those obtained with MoMLV protease. Both eIF4GI and eIF4GII were cleaved very efficiently by the MoMLV protease. However, eIF4GII was a poor substrate for HIV proteases. Proteolytic cleavage of eIF4G led to a profound inhibition of cap-dependent translation, while protein synthesis driven by mRNAs containing internal ribosome entry site elements remained unaffected or was even stimulated in transfected cells.","['Alvarez, Enrique', 'Menendez-Arias, Luis', 'Carrasco, Luis']","['Alvarez E', 'Menendez-Arias L', 'Carrasco L']","['Centro de Biologia Molecular (CSIC-UAM), Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Autonoma, Cantoblanco, 28049 Madrid, Spain. ealvarez@cbm.uam.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'COS Cells', 'DNA Primers', 'Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G/*metabolism/physiology', 'Hydrolysis', 'Retroviridae/*enzymology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2003/11/12 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/11/12 05:00'],"['2003/11/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.23.12392-12400.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Dec;77(23):12392-400. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.23.12392-12400.2003.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",,,,,,,,,PMC262572,,,,,

Alloreactive lymphocytes present within the hematopoietic transplant have been shown to be responsible for the occurrence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). Retrospective analysis of survival curves after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation performed for leukemia have shown that GVHD was accompanied with lower relapse rates suggesting graft-versus leukemia (GVL) affect. T cell-depletion demonstrated the inverse balance existing between GVHD/GVL and relapse. Allogeneic bulk lymphocyte infusions were further used for successful treatment of relapse after transplantation in CML patients. However they were responsible for some cases of lethal acute GVHD and myelosuppressions in some patients. The concept of allogeneic transplantations after reduced intensity conditioning regimen (RICT) has recently emerged as a new strategy to treat cancer. This strategy exploited the immunological properties of the graft followed or not by donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) while reducing the toxicity of the preparative regimen. Different means to perform RICT have been described, however the systematic use of DLI (bulk or escalating doses) after these transplantations remains controversial.

The clinical management of CLL is therefore challenging and considerable effort has been directed towards novel therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing the disease relapse rate. Recent insights into the role of dendritic cells as the pivotal antigen-presenting cells that initiate immune responses may provide the basis for generating more effective antitumor immune responses. Consequently, dendritic cells constitute an attractive approach in the context of CLL. However, understanding the relation between dendritic cells and the cellular immune response is crucial to elucidation of how to manipulate immune responses.

To better understand the mechanistic basis underlying this preferential depletion, we analyzed the in vitro susceptibility of T cell subsets to FLU-induced apoptosis. Contrasting with observations in vivo, our results showed that treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with FLU induced a higher level of apoptosis in CD8(+) than in CD4(+) T lymphocytes. This increased sensitivity of CD8(+) T cells to FLU was observed in samples from both, healthy donors and B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, and resulted in higher CD4:CD8 ratios in FLU-treated than in untreated cultures (P<0.01). Expression of factors involved in FLU transport and metabolism was then evaluated by quantitative real time-PCR in normal T cell subsets. It was found that mRNA levels of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 nucleoside transporter were higher whereas deoxycytidine kinase and IMP/GMP selective 5'-nucleotidase mRNA levels were lower in CD4(+) cells. However the dCK/cN-II ratio was 2-fold greater in CD8(+) than in CD4(+) T lymphocytes, which could account for the higher apoptosis levels observed in the CD8(+) subset. These results favor the view that decreased CD4:CD8 ratios in FLU-treated patients should be attributed to differences in cell recovery and/or homing between T cell subsets.","['Gamberale, Romina', 'Galmarini, Carlos M', 'Fernandez-Calotti, Paula', 'Jordheim, Lars', 'Sanchez-Avalos, Julio', 'Dumontet, Charles', 'Geffner, Jorge', 'Giordano, Mirta']","['Gamberale R', 'Galmarini CM', 'Fernandez-Calotti P', 'Jordheim L', 'Sanchez-Avalos J', 'Dumontet C', 'Geffner J', 'Giordano M']","['Departamento de Inmunologia Oncologica, Instituto de Investigaciones Hematologicas, Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2003/11/12 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/11/12 05:00'],"['2003/11/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295203006208 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2003.07.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2003 Dec 1;66(11):2185-91. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2003.07.008.,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPV is a reasonable candidate for development as a non-productively replicating viral vector for use in non-swine, mammalian species, such as the cat. A novel SPV gene deletion (SPV 043) was created and found to be non-attenuating. This deletion was utilized to generate a stable recombinant virus expressing the Gag-Pro and Env proteins of feline leukemia virus (FeLV). Expression and replication of this vector was studied in embryonic swine kidney cells (ESK-4), and two feline cell lines, Crandell feline kidney cells (CRFK) and feline skin fibroblasts (FSF). Our results showed that feline cells were susceptible to infection by SPV and supported expression of foreign genes driven by synthetic poxvirus promoters, however, SPV viral DNA was not replicated in feline cells and infectious virus was not recovered. In addition, FeLV Gag virus-like particles were produced from both ESK-4 and CRFK cells and foreign antigens were incorporated into infectious SPV intracellular mature virions (IMV). These results suggest that SPV may have potential as a safe vaccine delivery vector for cats.","['Winslow, Barbara J', 'Cochran, Mark D', 'Holzenburg, Andreas', 'Sun, Jingchuan', 'Junker, David E', 'Collisson, Ellen W']","['Winslow BJ', 'Cochran MD', 'Holzenburg A', 'Sun J', 'Junker DE', 'Collisson EW']","['Schering-Plough Animal Health Corporation, San Diego, CA 92121, USA. barbara.winslow@spcorp.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*metabolism', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Suipoxvirus/genetics/physiology', 'Swine', 'Virion/metabolism', '*Virus Replication']",2003/11/12 05:00,2004/02/11 05:00,['2003/11/12 05:00'],"['2003/11/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0168170203002442 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virusres.2003.08.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 2003 Dec;98(1):1-15. doi: 10.1016/j.virusres.2003.08.005.,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the likely involvement of inflammatory cytokines, namely, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interleukins 1 alpha and 1 beta (IL-1alpha and IL-1beta) and IL-6 at the primary implantation site of the rhesus monkey was examined immunocytochemically during lacunar (n=6) and villous (n=8) stages of gestation. Trophoblast cells and extraembryonic mesenchymal cells were immunopositive for LIF and IL-1alpha. The distribution of IL-1beta and IL-6 in trophoblast cells was low in lacunar stage samples, however, a higher degree of immunopositivity for IL-6 was observed in villous stage samples. Decidual cells were immunopositive for all the cytokines studied. In lacunar stage samples, plaque cells adjacent to implanted nidus were immunopositive for all the cytokines examined, and the degree of their immunoprecipitation increased, except that of IL-1beta, during the villous stage. Luminal and glandular epithelial cells were immunopositive for LIF, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 in lacunar and in villous stage samples. LIF immunopositivity was detected in endothelial cells of blood vessels within and below chorionic plate and cytotrophoblast shell, while vascular smooth muscle cells were positive for all the cytokines studied. The temporo-spatial characteristics of LIF, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 protein expressions in primary implantation sites of the rhesus monkey suggest that these pro-inflammatory cytokines play specific roles in regulating trophoblast cell proliferation, differentiation, invasion and associated maternal tissue remodelling during early gestation.","['Sengupta, Jayasree', 'Dhawan, Latika', 'Ghosh, D']","['Sengupta J', 'Dhawan L', 'Ghosh D']","['Department of Physiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi 110029, India. jayasreesengupta@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,IM,"['Animals', 'Embryo Implantation/physiology', 'Female', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-1/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Macaca mulatta/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy']",2003/11/12 05:00,2004/06/30 05:00,['2003/11/12 05:00'],"['2003/11/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1043466603003028 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cyto.2003.08.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2003 Dec 21;24(6):277-85. doi: 10.1016/j.cyto.2003.08.010.,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peptides within this family did not bind related members of the interleukin-6 family of cytokines, nor to murine LIF that has 80% sequence identity with human LIF. A representative peptide from this family was synthesized and found to bind to LIF with an affinity of approximately 300 nM. The phage-displayed form of this peptide was able to compete with the LIF receptor alpha chain (LIFR) for binding to LIF; however, the free synthetic peptide was unable to inhibit LIF-LIFR binding or inhibit LIF bioactivity in vitro. Using a panel of human/murine chimeric LIF molecules, the peptide-binding site on LIF was mapped to a groove located between the B and the C helices of the LIF structure, which is distinct from the surfaces involved in binding to receptor. To mimic the effect of the phage particle and convert the free peptide into an antagonist of LIFR binding, a 40 kDa poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) moiety was conjugated to the synthetic LIF-binding peptide. This PEG-peptide conjugate was found to be both an antagonist of LIF-LIFR binding and of LIF signaling in engineered Ba/F3 cells expressing LIFR and the gp130 coreceptor.","['Fairlie, W Douglas', 'Uboldi, Alessandro D', 'Hemmings, George J', 'Smith, Brian J', 'Martin, Helene M', 'Morgan, Phillip O', 'Baca, Manuel']","['Fairlie WD', 'Uboldi AD', 'Hemmings GJ', 'Smith BJ', 'Martin HM', 'Morgan PO', 'Baca M']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, The Cooperative Research Centre for Cellular Growth Factors, Parkville, Victoria 3050, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bacteriophage M13/genetics', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*chemistry', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Engineering/methods', 'Receptors, Cytokine/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemical synthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2003/11/12 05:00,2004/03/05 05:00,['2003/11/12 05:00'],"['2003/11/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi035303v [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2003 Nov 18;42(45):13193-201. doi: 10.1021/bi035303v.,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PGG has been shown to possess potent anti-oxidant, anti-mutagenic, anti-proliferative and anti-invasive effects. In this study, we examined the inhibitory effects of 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose (PGG) isolated from the root of Paeonia lactiflora Pall. on the COX-2 and iNOS activity in LPS-activated Raw 264.7 cells, COX-1 in HEL cells. To investigate the structure-activity relationships of gallate and gallic acid for the inhibition of iNOS and COX-2 activity, we also examined (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), gallic acid, and gallacetophenone. The results of the present study indicated that PGG, EGCG, and gallacetophenone treatment except gallic acid significantly inhibited LPS-induced NO production in LPS-activated macrophages. All of the four compounds significantly inhibited COX-2 activity in LPS-activated macrophages. Among the four compounds examined, PGG revealed the most potent in both iNOS (IC50 approximately 18 microg/mL) and COX-2 inhibitory activity (PGE2: IC50 approximately 8 microg/mL and PGD2: IC50 approximately 12 microg/mL), respectively. Although further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and structure-activity relationship by which PGG exerts its inhibitory actions, our results suggest that PGG might be a candidate for developing anti-inflammatory and cancer chemopreventive agents.","['Lee, Sung-Jin', 'Lee, Ik-Soo', 'Mar, Woongchon']","['Lee SJ', 'Lee IS', 'Mar W']","['Natural Products Research Institute, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul 110-460, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Korea (South),Arch Pharm Res,Archives of pharmacal research,8000036,IM,"['Acetophenones/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclooxygenase 1', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Dinoprostone/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gallic Acid/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Hydrolyzable Tannins', 'Isoenzymes/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/cytology/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Nitric Oxide/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', 'Paeonia', 'Plant Extracts', 'Plant Roots/chemistry', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/biosynthesis', 'Pyrogallol/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tannins/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",2003/11/12 05:00,2004/07/03 05:00,['2003/11/12 05:00'],"['2003/11/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02980029 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pharm Res. 2003 Oct;26(10):832-9. doi: 10.1007/BF02980029.,"['0 (Acetophenones)', '0 (Hydrolyzable Tannins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Tannins)', '01Y4A2QXY0 (Pyrogallol)', '14937-32-7 (beta-penta-O-galloyl-glucose)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '528-21-2 (gallacetophenone)', '632XD903SP (Gallic Acid)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nos2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 1)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Ptgs1 protein, mouse)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The remaining 16 samples were determined to be nonneoplastic. All samples were diagnosed before assessment with anti-V beta flow cytometry. By using a cutoff of 1.6 times the upper limit of normal range (ULN) to define malignant restriction of V beta use, pathologic restriction of V beta use was found directly or indirectly in all 27 samples carrying a diagnosis of malignancy and directly in 2 of 16 samples without a diagnosis of malignancy. TCR gene rearrangement studies were used to confirm V beta flow cytometry results. By using a cutoff of 1.6 times the ULN for the detection of malignancy, the antibody panel had a diagnostic sensitivity of 89% for direct detection of pathologic V beta restriction and a specificity of 88%, making it useful for rapid diagnosis of T-cell leukemia.","['Beck, Rose C', 'Stahl, Steve', ""O'Keefe, Christine L"", 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Theil, Karl S', 'Hsi, Eric D']","['Beck RC', 'Stahl S', ""O'Keefe CL"", 'Maciejewski JP', 'Theil KS', 'Hsi ED']","['Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, 9500 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Antibodies/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', '*Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/diagnosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*immunology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sezary Syndrome/diagnosis']",2003/11/12 05:00,2003/12/04 05:00,['2003/11/12 05:00'],"['2003/11/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1309/835B-04QX-GNNF-NRJU [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2003 Nov;120(5):785-94. doi: 10.1309/835B-04QX-GNNF-NRJU.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the plasma membrane is an easily accessible cellular compartment, relatively little is known about its changes during apoptosis. We investigated whether specific changes in the expression of plasma membrane glycoproteins take place during apoptosis and whether these changes could be used for a quantitative estimation of apoptosis. METHODS: Lectin cytochemical study of normal and apoptotic murine leukemia cells of the L1210 line was done. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled Laburnum anagyroides bark agglutinin, Phaseolus vulgaris agglutinin, Pisum sativum lectin (PSL), Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA-120; 120 kDa), Solanum tuberosum agglutinin, Triticum vulgaris lectin (wheat germ agglutinin), Viscum album agglutinin, Canavalia ensiformis lectin (concanavalin A), and Helix pomatia lectin were used to compare specific glycoprotein expressions in normal and apoptotic murine leukemia cells of the L1210 line sensitive (L1210) and resistant (L1210R) to apoptosis induction by cisplatin. RESULTS: The data demonstrated significantly increased binding of alpha-D-mannose-specific PSL lectin (P<0.01) and beta-D-galactose-specific RCA-120 lectin (P<0.001) by the apoptotic cells of the L1210 and L1210R lines in comparison with the intact cells. That binding was shown to be specific because it was blocked by the corresponding inhibitory sugars. CONCLUSIONS: Lectins specific to alpha-D-mannose (PSL) and beta-D-galactose (RCA-120) can be used to distinguish between native and apoptotic murine leukemia L1210 cells and to quantitatively estimate apoptosis in a population of these cells.","['Bilyy, R O', 'Stoika, R S']","['Bilyy RO', 'Stoika RS']","['Department of Biochemistry, Ivan Franko Lviv National University, Lviv, Ukraine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

While extramedullary relapses have been described in JMML, this is the first report of a CNS relapse.

Accumulating evidence also indicates that Rap1 is a major activator of integrins, playing important roles in the regulation of a variety of integrin-dependent cellular functions.

A family of membrane fusion proteins called SNAREs, which are present on both the granule and the plasma membrane, plays a role in the fusion of these granules with the plasma membrane of mast cells. In addition to the SNAREs themselves, it is likely that the SNARE accessory protein, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), affects the composition and structure of the SNARE complex. NSF is a cytoplasmic ATPase that disassembles the SNARE complexes. To investigate the role of NSF in mast cell degranulation, we developed an assay to measure secretion from transiently transfected RBL (rat basophilic leukemia)-2H3 mast cells (a tumor analog of mucosal mast cells). RBL-2H3 cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding a human growth hormone secretion reporter along with either wild-type NSF or an NSF mutant that lacks ATPase activity. Human growth hormone was targeted to and released from secretory granules in RBL-2H3 cells, and coexpression with mutant NSF dramatically inhibited regulated exocytosis from the transfected cells. Biochemical analysis of SNARE complexes in these cells revealed that overexpression of the NSF mutant decreased disassembly and resulted in an accumulation of SNARE complexes. These data reveal a role for NSF in mast cell exocytosis and highlight the importance of SNARE disassembly, or priming, in regulated exocytosis from mast cells.","['Puri, Niti', 'Kruhlak, Michael J', 'Whiteheart, Sidney W', 'Roche, Paul A']","['Puri N', 'Kruhlak MJ', 'Whiteheart SW', 'Roche PA']","['Experimental Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/deficiency/genetics', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Degranulation/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Ethylmaleimide/pharmacology', 'Exocytosis/genetics/physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/cytology/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'N-Ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Proteins', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/genetics/*physiology', 'Qa-SNARE Proteins', 'R-SNARE Proteins', 'Rats', 'SNARE Proteins', 'Secretory Vesicles/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', '*Vesicular Transport Proteins']",2003/11/11 05:00,2004/02/19 05:00,['2003/11/11 05:00'],"['2003/11/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/11 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.171.10.5345 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2003 Nov 15;171(10):5345-52. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.171.10.5345.,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Qa-SNARE Proteins)', '0 (R-SNARE Proteins)', '0 (SNARE Proteins)', '0 (VAMP7 protein, human)', '0 (Vamp7 protein, rat)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', '0 (yellow fluorescent protein, Bacteria)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.4.6 (N-Ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.4.6 (Nsf protein, rat)', 'O3C74ACM9V (Ethylmaleimide)']",,,,['HL56652/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

This protein has been implicated in the control of neurosecretion from dense core granules in neuronal cells as well as in the control of constitutive secretory pathways in both yeast and mammalian cells. We show that RBL-2H3 cells, secretory cells of the immune system, endogenously express the 22-kDa NCS-1 protein as well as an immune-related 50-kDa protein. Both proteins associate in vivo with phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase beta (PI4Kbeta) and colocalize with the enzyme in the Golgi region. We show further that overexpression of NCS-1 in RBL-2H3 cells stimulates the catalytic activity of PI4Kbeta, increases IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI)-triggered hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P(2)), and stimulates FcepsilonRI-triggered, but not Ca(2+) ionophore-triggered, exocytosis. Conversely, expression of a kinase-dead mutant of PI4Kbeta reduces PI4Kbeta activity, decreases FcepsilonRI-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis, and blocks FcepsilonRI-triggered, but not Ca(2+) ionophore-triggered, exocytosis. Our results indicate that PI(4)P, produced by the Golgi-localized PI4Kbeta, is the rate-limiting factor in the synthesis of the pool of PI(4,5)P(2) that serves as substrate for the generation of lipid-derived second messengers in FcepsilonRI-triggered cells. We conclude that NCS-1 is involved in the control of regulated exocytosis in nonneural cells, where it contributes to stimulus-secretion coupling by interacting with PI4Kbeta and positive regulation of its activity.","['Kapp-Barnea, Yaara', 'Melnikov, Semyon', 'Shefler, Irit', 'Jeromin, Andreas', 'Sagi-Eisenberg, Ronit']","['Kapp-Barnea Y', 'Melnikov S', 'Shefler I', 'Jeromin A', 'Sagi-Eisenberg R']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['1-Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase/genetics/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Calcium Signaling/genetics/*immunology', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Activation/immunology', 'Exocytosis/genetics/*immunology', 'Mast Cells/cytology/*enzymology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Neuronal Calcium-Sensor Proteins', 'Neuropeptides/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, IgE/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transfection']",2003/11/11 05:00,2004/02/19 05:00,['2003/11/11 05:00'],"['2003/11/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/11 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.171.10.5320 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2003 Nov 15;171(10):5320-7. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.171.10.5320.,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neuronal Calcium-Sensor Proteins)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (frequenin calcium sensor proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.67 (1-Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to receptor tyrosine activation and interacts with ras GTPase-activating protein and Nck, leading to inhibition of ras signaling pathway activation and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Jun activation, respectively. In chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, it has shown constitutive phosphorylation. The N-terminal phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of Dok1 can recognize and bind specifically to phosphotyrosine-containing motifs of receptors. Here we report the crystal structure of the Dok1 PTB domain alone and in complex with a phosphopeptide derived from RET receptor tyrosine kinase. The structure consists of a beta-sandwich composed of two nearly orthogonal, 7-stranded, antiparallel beta-sheets, and it is capped at one side by a C-terminal alpha-helix. The RET phosphopeptide binds to Dok1 via a surface groove formed between strand beta5 and the C-terminal alpha-helix of the PTB domain. The structures reveal the molecular basis for the specific recognition of RET by the Dok1 PTB domain. We also show that Dok1 does not recognize peptide sequences from TrkA and IL-4, which are recognized by Shc and IRS1, respectively.","['Shi, Ning', 'Ye, Sheng', 'Bartlam, Mark', 'Yang, Maojun', 'Wu, Jing', 'Liu, Yiwei', 'Sun, Fei', 'Han, Xueqing', 'Peng, Xiaozhong', 'Qiang, Boqing', 'Yuan, Jiangang', 'Rao, Zihe']","['Shi N', 'Ye S', 'Bartlam M', 'Yang M', 'Wu J', 'Liu Y', 'Sun F', 'Han X', 'Peng X', 'Qiang B', 'Yuan J', 'Rao Z']","['Laboratory of Structural Biology, Tsinghua University and National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing 100084, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20031107,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Static Electricity', 'Substrate Specificity']",2003/11/11 05:00,2004/04/02 05:00,['2003/11/11 05:00'],"['2003/11/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M311030200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)75086-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Feb 6;279(6):4962-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M311030200.

This association was investigated in a nested case-control study of female breast cancer within a cohort of African Americans, Latinas, and Caucasians in Los Angeles County, California. Incident breast cancer was ascertained from 1993 to 1999 by linkage to county and state tumor registries. Controls were selected from a random sample of cohort members without breast cancer at baseline. Exposure was assessed in 1995-2001 by means of wiring configuration coding (an indirect measure of magnetic field exposure that has been associated with increased risk of childhood leukemia in Los Angeles and elsewhere in North America) in all homes occupied over the previous 10 years for 743 cases and 699 controls and by measurement of magnetic fields in the bedroom over a 7-day period for 347 cases and 286 controls. The estimated risk of breast cancer was not higher among women with wiring configuration codes associated with the highest magnetic fields (for a very high current configuration relative to very low, the adjusted odds ratio was 0.76 (95% confidence interval: 0.49, 1.18)). Stronger measured fields were not significantly associated with increased risk.

However, recent reports of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (t-MDS/AML) developing after treatment with immunosuppressants and G-CSF has raised concern over the use of this agent in patients with aplastic anemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: We undertook a multi-institutional, non-randomized study of 112 children given a diagnosis of aplastic anemia, and then treated with different immunosuppressants with or without G-CSF. In each case, bone marrow specimens were tested at study entry and every 6 months for 3 years to detect t-MDS/AML, defined by stringent morphological and molecular/cytogenetic criteria. Incidence rates were calculated by the person-years statistical method. RESULTS: As of December 2001, all eligible patients had been followed for a median of 3 years, and the G-CSF (+) group had received a median total G-CSF dose of 30,100 micrograms altogether, administered over a median of 4 months. Only one case of MDS developed among the G-CSF (+) patients (n=81), compared with three in the group receiving other agents (n=31). This isolated case was not associated with monosomy 7, the cytogenetic abnormality most often linked to G-CSF treatment. Incidence rates of MDS in the two groups were not significantly different (3.8 vs. 22.4 per 1,000 patient-years at risk, p=0.125). There were no cases of overt AML in either cohort.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Using sequence analysis of FR1/JH polymerase chain reaction products, the VH immunoglobulin gene configuration was analyzed in 159 rearranged IgH alleles from 154 CLL patients. Having previously identified a spatial relationship between VH gene usage and JH proximity in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), we performed linear and Poisson regression analysis on patients with germline and mutated CLL against VH rearrangements from normal peripheral blood. RESULTS: Sequence analysis showed that 102 patients (64%) had mutated sequences (>2% DNA base pair changes) while 57 (36%) had germline sequences. The germline CLL group showed JH proximal overusage similar to that reported in ALL patients, while the mutated CLL group showed a pattern comparable to that of the control group (peripheral blood rearranged VH sequences). The CDR3 region was statistically longer in the patients with germline CLL than in those with mutated CLL. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights differences in the VDJ profile in mutated and germline CLL, consistent with the suggestion that CLL comprises two subgroups. The interpretation of these differences is that the B-cell of CLL, particularly in the germline group, may derive from a pool that has been unable to follow or complete the normal pathway of B-cell differentiation.","['Duke, Veronique M', 'Gandini, Domenica', 'Sherrington, Paul D', 'Lin, Ke', 'Heelan, Bridget', 'Amlot, Peter', 'Mehta, Atul B', 'Hoffbrand, A Victor', 'Foroni, Letizia']","['Duke VM', 'Gandini D', 'Sherrington PD', 'Lin K', 'Heelan B', 'Amlot P', 'Mehta AB', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Foroni L']","['Department of Hematology, RFUCSM, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Alleles', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Joining Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics']",2003/11/11 05:00,2004/02/26 05:00,['2003/11/11 05:00'],"['2003/11/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/11 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Nov;88(11):1259-71.,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Joining Region)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the ALL-BFM trials, early treatment response is assessed by in vivo response to glucocorticoids (prednisone response), the molecular background of which is unknown. Initial in vivo resistance to glucocorticoid (GC) treatment in childhood ALL (prednisone-poor response) is associated with a dramatically shorter event-free survival than that found in GC-sensitive patients (prednisone-good responders). The intracellular effects of glucocorticoids are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The protein expression of the GR has been linked to in vivo and in vitro GC resistance in various diseases treated with GC. However, existing data are conflicting. RESULTS: DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a case-control study for prednisone response to investigate the association of in vivo GC resistance and GR protein expression in childhood ALL. GR expression was assessed using Western blot technology. RESULTS: The median relative GR protein expression of all patients was 0.87. Overall, we did not find different GR protein expression in PPR and PGR patients. GR protein expression was 0.91 in PGR patients versus 0.85 in PPR ones of in vivo GC resistance and GR expression.

It has been demonstrated to be over-expressed in precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) blasts when compared to in their normal counterparts, suggesting its potential use in the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry (FC). To assess the reliability and accuracy of CD58 for this purpose, we studied its expression in a large series of normal and ALL bone marrow (BM) samples using quantitative FC. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 180 precursor-B ALL BM samples at diagnosis (8 pro-B, 164 early-B, 8 mature-B ALL) and 123 follow-up BM samples (n=54 at day +15 and n=69 at day +78), as well as 51 normal BM samples and 7 regenerating BM samples from patients with T-ALL at week 12. We used four-color quantitative FC, focusing analysis on CD58 expression. In follow-up samples from day +78, the MRD level was simultaneously evaluated by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) amplification of antigen receptor genes. RESULTS: CD58 expression was significantly higher in ALL blasts than in normal B lymphocytes, while no significant differences between regenerating and normal B lymphocytes were observed. CD58 was expressed in 99.4% of the precursor-B ALL cases and 93.5% of these showed over-expression compared to normal. No significant modulation of CD58 expression during remission induction therapy was noted. Finally, 66 (95.6%) of 69 BM samples simultaneously analyzed using both FC and RQ-PCR at day +78 showed concordant results regarding MRD.

However, results of previous reports have been controversial. This study was undertaken to clarify the influence of GST polymorphism on the outcome of childhood B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). DESIGN AND METHODS: Eighty-two patients with childhood B-precursor ALL treated during 1988-1999 with our ALL protocol (median follow-up time 89.5 months, range 31 -169 months) were examined for GST gene patterns. The effect of GSTM1 and GSTT1 deletion genotypes on the clinical features and therapeutic results was analyzed. RESULTS: All patients attained complete remission but 12 had an early relapse (within 30 months of the initiation of treatment). In univariate analysis, early relapse of ALL was correlated significantly with the presence of the t(9;22)(q34;q11) cytogenetic abnormality (p=0.0003), high white blood cell counts (p=0.015) and double null genotype (p=0.027). Multivariate analysis revealed that the GST double null genotype was the only significant independent predictor of early relapse (p=0.018). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous deletion of both the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes is more predictive than any other parameter of early relapse of childhood B-precursor ALL.","['Takanashi, Mami', 'Morimoto, Akira', 'Yagi, Tomohito', 'Kuriyama, Kikuko', 'Kano, Gen', 'Imamura, Toshihiko', 'Hibi, Shigeyoshi', 'Todo, Shinjiro', 'Imashuku, Shinsaku']","['Takanashi M', 'Morimoto A', 'Yagi T', 'Kuriyama K', 'Kano G', 'Imamura T', 'Hibi S', 'Todo S', 'Imashuku S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan. mamikiti@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione Transferase/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2003/11/11 05:00,2004/02/26 05:00,['2003/11/11 05:00'],"['2003/11/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/11 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Nov;88(11):1238-44.,"['EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among thymic stromal elements, epithelial cells (TEC) are known to exert a dominant inductive role in survival and maturation of normal, immature T-cells. In this study we explored the possible effect of TEC on T-ALL cell survival and analyzed the role of interleukin-7 (IL-7) within the microenvironment generated by T-ALL-TEC interactions. DESIGN AND METHODS: T-ALL blasts derived from 10 adult patients were cultured with TEC obtained from human normal thymuses. The level of blast apoptosis was measured by annexin V-propidium iodide co-staining and flow cytometry. The proliferative response of leukemic cells to interaction with TEC was evaluated by thymidine incorporation at various time intervals of culture. To assess the role of IL-7, lympho-epithelial co-cultures were carried out in the presence of anti-IL-7 or anti IL-7R blocking antibodies and the level of apoptosis of T-ALL blasts was analyzed. RESULTS: When T-ALL cells were cultured in the presence of TEC monolayers, the percentage of viable cells increased significantly and this survival was sustained with time in culture. In addition, the interaction with TEC induced a considerable proliferative response in T-ALL cells (15-fold greater than that of the control cells after 7 days of culture). The presence of IL-7 or IL-7R blocking antibodies in lympho-epithelial co-cultures consistently reduced the TEC-mediated apoptosis inhibition in T-ALL blasts (70% decrease). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results point to the role of thymic epithelium in the regulation of T blast survival. In addition, they show that interaction between IL-7 and its receptor has the major role in modulating T-ALL survival within the microenvironment generated by the T-ALL/TEC interaction.","['Scupoli, Maria T', 'Vinante, Fabrizio', 'Krampera, Mauro', 'Vincenzi, Carlo', 'Nadali, Gianpaolo', 'Zampieri, Francesca', 'Ritter, Mary A', 'Eren, Efrem', 'Santini, Francesco', 'Pizzolo, Giovanni']","['Scupoli MT', 'Vinante F', 'Krampera M', 'Vincenzi C', 'Nadali G', 'Zampieri F', 'Ritter MA', 'Eren E', 'Santini F', 'Pizzolo G']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Section of Haematology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy. mariateresa.scupoli@univr.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Female', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-7/*physiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*physiology', 'Thymus Gland/*cytology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology']",2003/11/11 05:00,2004/02/26 05:00,['2003/11/11 05:00'],"['2003/11/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/11 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Nov;88(11):1229-37.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These abnormalities frequently cause inappropriate expression of the EVI1 gene located at 3q26. Other genes that have been implicated at the rearrangement breakpoint are GR6 and RPN1 (both on 3q21). The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of the EVI1 fusion genes in AML patients with 3q21q26 syndrome. DESIGN AND METHODS: We used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to evaluate the expression of EVI1 and GR6, and particularly of the fusion genes RPN1-EVI1 and GR6-EVI1 in 9 AML patients with either inv(3)(q21q26) (7 cases) or t(3;3)(q21;q26) (2 cases). RESULTS: EVI1 and GR6 were always expressed, as was RPN1-EVI1; GR6-EVI1 was absent. In 8/9 patients, the part of EVI1 retained in RPN1-DEVI1 contained blocks B and C of the PR domain commonly found in the MDS1-EVI1 gene. In the remaining patient [with inv(3) (q21q26)], only block C was retained: we named this variant fusion gene RPN1-DEVI1. This patient lacked the micromegakaryocytopoiesis frequently found in 3q21q26 syndrome. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that EVI1 activation plays a dominant role in the pathogenesis of the 3q21q26 syndrome. EVI1 expression might occur either as a consequence of rearrangements leading to the formation of different fusion transcripts, such as RPN1-EVI1 and RPN1-DEVI1 or following disruption of the PR activation domain of the MDS1-EVI1 gene.","['Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Ottaviani, Emanuela', 'Buonamici, Silvia', 'Isidori, Alessandro', 'Borsaru, Gabriela', 'Visani, Giuseppe', 'Piccaluga, Pier Paolo', 'Malagola, Michele', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'Rondoni, Michela', 'Nucifora, Giuseppina', 'Tura, Sante', 'Baccarani, Michele']","['Martinelli G', 'Ottaviani E', 'Buonamici S', 'Isidori A', 'Borsaru G', 'Visani G', 'Piccaluga PP', 'Malagola M', 'Testoni N', 'Rondoni M', 'Nucifora G', 'Tura S', 'Baccarani M']","['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology ""L. & A.

DESIGN AND METHODS: We report the characteristics and clinical outcome of 30 patients [16 males and 14 females, median age 50 (range, 18 to 72) years] with CML in BC included in a phase II international multicenter extended trial of treatment with imatinib. The initially administered dose of imatinib was 600 mg orally once daily. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (60%) achieved a sustained hematologic remission (SHR) at a median time of 4 weeks (range, 2-14) after starting therapy. The median duration of SHR was 5 months (range, 4-13). Four patients (13%) achieved a cytogenetic remission at a median time of 8 weeks (range, 6-10) after beginning imatinib therapy. The rates of event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) at 1 year were 29%+/-8% and 36%+/-13%, respectively. In univariate analysis, the achievement of a SHR was more frequent in patients without a complex karyotype and in those receiving imatinib without having had previous chemotherapy. A long interval between the diagnosis of BC and imatinib therapy (> or = 9.5 weeks) (p=0.0011), the presence of additional cytogenetic abnormalities (p=0.015), and extramedullary involvement (p=0.02) were associated with significantly shorter EFS. In contrast, longer OS was observed in patients treated with imatinib shortly after the diagnosis of BC (p=0.0003) and in those without additional cytogenetic abnormalities (p=0.0043). Multivariate analyses indicated that the time interval between the diagnosis of BC and the beginning of imatinib therapy was the only significant prognostic factor for both EFS and OS. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: STI571 therapy produces a high percentage of SHR in patients with CML in BC; a minority of the patients also obtain some degree of cytogenetic response. Nevertheless, these responses are transient and additional therapy should be offered.","['Sureda, Anna', 'Carrasco, Marina', 'de Miguel, Miguel', 'Martinez, Jesus A', 'Conde, Eulogio', 'Sanz, Miguel A', 'Diaz-Mediavilla, Joaquin', 'Sierra, Jorge']","['Sureda A', 'Carrasco M', 'de Miguel M', 'Martinez JA', 'Conde E', 'Sanz MA', 'Diaz-Mediavilla J', 'Sierra J']","['Clinical Hematology Division, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain. asureda@hsp.santpau.es']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/blood', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/blood', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/11/11 05:00,2004/02/26 05:00,['2003/11/11 05:00'],"['2003/11/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/11 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Nov;88(11):1213-20.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have found that a dependence exists between the cell autofluorescence pattern and the degree of cell differentiation. When cells differentiate, their autofluorescence emission changes, following the morphological and functional rearrangement of cell structures. A decrease in emission intensity and a different distribution of endogenous fluorophores are observed. Thus, autofluorescence monitoring on living cells is a potentially useful tool for in vitro study of the differentiation processes. Furthermore, different maturation steps can be distinguished on the basis of the cell fluorescence pattern, leading the way to future application of the technique in diagnostics.","['Monici, Monica', 'Agati, Giovanni', 'Fusi, Franco', 'Pratesi, Riccardo', 'Paglierani, Milena', 'Santini, Valeria', 'Bernabei, Pietro Antonio']","['Monici M', 'Agati G', 'Fusi F', 'Pratesi R', 'Paglierani M', 'Santini V', 'Bernabei PA']","['Centre of Excellence in Optronics, Largo Enrico Fermi, 6, 50125 Florence, Italy. monici@ino.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Photochem Photobiol Sci,Photochemical & photobiological sciences : Official journal of the European Photochemistry Association and the European Society for Photobiology,101124451,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fluorescence', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Photobiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2003/11/11 05:00,2003/12/10 05:00,['2003/11/11 05:00'],"['2003/11/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/11 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/b306276g [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol Sci. 2003 Oct;2(10):981-7. doi: 10.1039/b306276g.,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This success is proof of principle for the concept of molecularly targeted therapy: rational treatment based on the recognition of the causal lesion responsible for malignant growth. In this manuscript, the preclinical and clinical development of imatinib for the treatment of CML will be reviewed. Room will be given to problems and challenges that may be typical of molecularly targeted therapy in general, such as the emergence of resistance as a result of point mutations.

LacZ activity was first detected in the cerebral cortex from postnatal days 3 to 7 (P3-P7), and then gradually increased with age to reach nearly the maximal level by P28. In the adult brain, LacZ activity was detected in neurons in various brain regions including the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamic nuclei, amygdaloid nuclei, geniculate nuclei, red nuclei, deep cerebellar nuclei, cranial nerve nuclei, and spinal cord. Loss of Purkinje cells in lurcher mice did not affect the pattern and level of LacZ activity in the DCN. Stimulation of primary neurons with glutamate, KCl, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and leukemia inhibitory factor appreciably increased the level of c-Fos but not of Cdkl2 transcripts.

Its major advantage over conventional chemotherapy lies in the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects mediated by allo- or tumor-reactive donor lymphocytes given in the course of SCT or post transplantation as donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). The benefits of cell-mediated immunotherapy over myeloablative radiochemotherapy have also made it possible to reduce the intensity of conditioning regimens. Mobilized peripheral blood has proved preferable to bone marrow (BM) as a source of stem cells for transplantation, since it provides a larger number of stem cells on the one hand and immunologically competent lymphocytes on the other. The use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), which is necessary to mobilize and increase the number of stem cells, may down-regulate the GVL effect by suppression of donor effector T lymphocytes by inducing Th1-->Th2 cytokine switch. It has previously been shown that GVL effects may be amplified by both in vivo and in vitro activation of donor lymphocytes with human recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2). Our studies using a leukemic murine model prepared for transplantation with low intensity conditioning prior to infusion of G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) have demonstrated that mobilization of blood cells with G-CSF and in vivo treatment with rIL-2 following low-intensity conditioning enhances the GVL effects and prolongs survival of recipients inoculated with BCL1. Activation of donor lymphocytes with rIL-2 may thus be useful for amplifying GVL effects following mobilization with G-CSF.","['Weiss, Lola', 'Or, Reuven', 'Slavin, Shimon', 'Naparstek, Ella', 'Reich, Shoshana', 'Abdul-Hai, Ali']","['Weiss L', 'Or R', 'Slavin S', 'Naparstek E', 'Reich S', 'Abdul-Hai A']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cancer Immunotherapy, Hadassah University Hospital, POB 12000, 91120 Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20031105,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/metabolism', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2003/11/08 05:00,2004/04/30 05:00,['2003/11/08 05:00'],"['2003/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2003/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/11/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/08 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-003-0440-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2004 Apr;53(4):358-62. doi: 10.1007/s00262-003-0440-5.

Its family distribution suggests transmissibility. Populations moving from countries with a low incidence to those with a high incidence increase to the higher rate. African and New Guinea village groups developed asthma with return of individuals who have acquired atopy in the city. Protection (and possibly immunity) develops with early exposure to child care or to affected older siblings. T helper (Th) type 2 clones driving specific allergies remain active even without further allergen exposure. Other IgE responses remain normal. Once boosted to completeness, the patterns of skin test results remain quite stable, possibly by the localization of abnormality maintained by immunity. An example of a virus causing the immortality of Th2 cells is herpes simplex virus type 1. It infects mouse or human Th2 cells and, although it does not multiply, causes immortality by increasing FAS-mediated apoptosis of T cells directed against the infected cells. Human T-cell leukemia virus 1 and probably others use similar ploys. Abnormal levels of FAS receptors and resistance to FAS apoptosis in nasal polyp lymphocytes and abnormal Th2 clones of atopy are interesting in this regard. The localizing role of a staphylococcal superantigen in atopic dermatitis, and possibly in autoimmunity in nonatopic eczema and intrinsic asthma, encourage the consideration of roles for microorganisms in localization and etiology.

Microscopic tumor necrosis (TN) is a poor prognostic factor in solid tumors, but it has not been characterized in MM. We wished to evaluate the incidence of TN in MM and its correlations with clinicopathologic factors, angiogenesis, and survival. METHODS: TN was graded in 171 routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded hematoxylin-eosin-stained tumor sections by two independent observers. Angiogenesis was assessed by the microvessel count (MVC) of CD34 immunostained sections. TN was correlated with survival by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analysis, and stepwise, multivariate Cox models were used to compare TN with angiogenesis and established prognostic factors and prognostic scoring systems. RESULTS: TN was identified in 39 cases (22.8%) and correlated with low hemoglobin (p = 0.01), thrombocytosis (p = 0.04), and high MVC (p = 0.02). TN was a poor prognostic factor in univariate analysis (p = 0.008). Patients with TN had a median survival of 5.3 months vs 8.3 months in negative cases. Independent indicators of poor prognosis in multivariate analysis were nonepithelioid cell type (p = 0.0001), performance status > 0 (p = 0.007), and increasing MVC (p = 0.004) but not TN. TN contributed independently to the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) [p = 0.03] and to the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) [p = 0.03] prognostic groups in respective multivariate Cox analyses. CONCLUSIONS: TN correlates with angiogenesis and is a poor prognostic factor in MM.

In EPRO-Gr, neutrophil differentiation occurs either in GM-CSF upon addition of ATRA or upon induction with G-CSF alone.

This suggests that ATRA-mediated differentiation of EPRO-Gr cells occurs via a RARE-dependent, STAT3-independent pathway, while G-CSF-mediated differentiation occurs via a RARE-independent, STAT3-dependent pathway. ATRA and G-CSF thus regulate differentiation by divergent pathways. We characterized these pathways in the APL cell line, NB4. ATRA induction of NB4 cells resulted in morphologic differentiation and up-regulation of C/EBPepsilon and G-CSFR, but not in STAT3 phosphorylation. The addition of G-CSF with ATRA during NB4 induction resulted in STAT3 phosphorylation but did not enhance differentiation. These results may elucidate how G-CSF and ATRA affect the differentiation of primary and ATRA-resistant APL cells.","['Maun, Noel A', 'Gaines, Peter', 'Khanna-Gupta, Arati', 'Zibello, Theresa', 'Enriquez, Louie', 'Goldberg, Laura', 'Berliner, Nancy']","['Maun NA', 'Gaines P', 'Khanna-Gupta A', 'Zibello T', 'Enriquez L', 'Goldberg L', 'Berliner N']","['Section of Hematology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20031106,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/*cytology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Response Elements', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation']",2003/11/08 05:00,2004/04/21 05:00,['2003/11/08 05:00'],"['2003/11/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/08 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-10-3247 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50080-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Mar 1;103(5):1693-701. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-10-3247.

Patient cohorts received decitabine at 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg/m2 intravenously over one hour daily, 5 days a week for 2 consecutive weeks, doses 5- to approximately 30-fold lower than the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). There were 2 groups that also received 15 mg/m2 daily for 15 or 20 days. A total of 50 patients were treated (44 with acute myelogenous leukemia [AML]/myelodysplasia [MDS], 5 with chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML], and 1 with acute lymphocytic leukemia [ALL]), and the drug was well tolerated at all dose levels, with myelosuppression being the major side effect. Responses were seen at all dose levels. However, the dose of 15 mg/m2 for 10 days appeared to induce the most responses (11 of 17 or 65%), with fewer responses seen when the dose was escalated or prolonged (2 of 19 or 11%). There was no correlation between P15 methylation at baseline or after therapy and response to decitabine.

We could show that distinct activating FLT3-TKD mutations at position D835 mediate primary resistance to FLT3 PTK inhibitors in FLT3-transformed cell lines. In the presence of increasing concentrations of the FLT3 PTK inhibitor SU5614, we generated inhibitor resistant Ba/F3 FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) cell lines (Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD-R1-R4) that were characterized by a 7- to 26-fold higher IC50 (concentration that inhibits 50%) to SU5614 compared with the parental ITD cells. The molecular characterization of ITD-R1-4 cells demonstrated that specific TKD mutations (D835N and Y842H) on the ITD background were acquired during selection with SU5614. Introduction of these dual ITD-TKD, but not single D835N or Y842H FLT3 mutants, in Ba/F3 cells restored the FLT3 inhibitor resistant phenotype. Our data show that preexisting or acquired mutations in the PTK domain of FLT3 can induce drug resistance to FLT3 PTK inhibitors in vitro.

Here, we analyzed the biologic and clinical significance of the FLT3 transcript level in comparison with several gene alterations in 181 de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. The mean expression level in AML was higher than that in normal mononuclear cells, whereas the range varied widely. A high level of FLT3 is related to internal tandem duplication of the FLT3 gene (FLT3/ITD), the mutations within the activation loop of FLT3 (FLT3/D835Mt), and tandem duplication of the MLL gene (MLL-TD) but not to p53 or N-RAS gene mutations. Furthermore, a high expression level in AML cases with FLT3 mutations was not related to MLL-TD. Overexpressed FLT3 revealed autophosphorylation and had the same sensitivity to the FLT3 inhibitor as FLT3/ITD. Overexpression of FLT3 (more than 200,000 copies/microgRNA) was an unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival in 91 AML cases without FLT3/ITD.

Conversely, enforced HOXA9 expression is leukemogenic in mice, and HOXA9 is frequently activated in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although HOXA9 is thought to function as a transcription factor, few downstream targets have been identified. We searched for early HOXA9 target genes by using a transient overexpression strategy in 3 hematopoietic cell lines (2 myeloid, 1 lymphoid). cDNA microarray analyses identified 220 genes whose expression was modulated at least 2-fold. Expression signatures in myeloid and lymphoid cells demonstrated that HOXA9 functions as both an activator and repressor of a variety of genes in cell-specific patterns suggesting that the transcriptional effects of HOXA9 are largely dependent on the cell context. Transient transcription assays and target gene expression patterns in HOXA9(-/-) marrow cells imply that we have identified direct physiologic targets. Many target genes are expressed in CD34+ stem cells or are members of gene families involved in proliferation or myeloid differentiation. Expression of 14 HOXA9 target genes correlated with high-level HOXA9 expression in primary AML.

OBJECTIVE: This study was a comprehensive economic analysis of the cost-effectiveness of using the IBS for single-donor apheresis platelets (AP) and random-donor pooled platelet concentrates (PC) versus AP and PC without the IBS in the United States in patient populations in which platelets are commonly transfused. METHODS: All data used in this analysis were summarized from existing published sources (primarily indexed in MEDLINE) and data on file at Baxter Healthcare Corporation (Chicago, Illinois) and Cerus Corporation (Concord, California). A literature-based decision-analytic model was developed to assess the economic costs and clinical outcomes associated with the use of AP and PC treated with the IBS for several conditions and procedures that account for a considerable proportion of the platelet usage in the United States: acute lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, coronary artery bypass graft, and hip arthroplasty Risks of infection with HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1, or bacterial agents were incorporated into the model. Possible benefits of reduction of the risk of emerging HCV like pathogens and elimination of the need for gamma irradiation were explored in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained by using AP + IBS versus untreated AP ranged from 1,308,833 dollars to 4,451,650 dollars (without bacterial testing) and 4,759,401 dollars to 22,968,066 dollars (with bacterial testing). Corresponding figures for PC + IBS versus untreated PC ranged from 457,586 dollars to 1,816,060 dollars. Inclusion of emerging HCV like virus and the elimination of the need for gamma irradiation improved the cost-effectiveness to a range of 177,695 dollars to 1,058,127 dollars for AP without bacterial testing, 176,572 dollars to 1,330,703 dollars for AP with bacterial testing, and 22,888 dollars to 153,564 dollars for PC. The model was most likely to be affected by mortality from bacterial contamination, IBS effect on platelet utilization, and the inclusion of potential benefits (ie, gamma irradiation and/or emergent HCV-like virus). The model was relatively insensitive to changes in the IBS price and viral transmission risks. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of pathogen inactivation via the IBS for platelets is comparable to that of other accepted blood safety interventions (eg, nucleic acid amplification technology).

We investigated the effects of a Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate, on the proliferation, adhesive properties, and morphology of a Bcr-Abl-transferred cell line, TF-1 Bcr-Abl, in comparison with parental TF-1. First, the factor-independent growth of TF-1 Bcr-Abl was inhibited in the presence of imatinib mesylate, but this inhibition was overcome by addition of exogenous granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Imatinib mesylate remarkably reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl, Cbl, and Crkl in a time-dependent manner, and their complex formation also was affected. Imatinib mesylate inhibited activation of Stat5 rather than the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway. TF-1 Bcr-Abl cells exhibited a round shape, unlike TF-1, and the adhesive property to fibronectin was much lower than that of TF-1. Although the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein may be involved negatively in cell adhesion, the decreased adhesion and altered morphology of TF-1 Bcr-Abl cells were minimally affected by imatinib mesylate and seemed independent of Bcr-Abl kinase activity.

This review will summarize the current knowledge of the immunobiology of minor H ags and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of cellular immunotherapy strategies that aim to separate the GVL effect from GVHD by targeting donor T-cells to hematopoietic system-specific minor H ags.","['Mutis, Tuna']",['Mutis T'],"['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands. t.mutis@azu.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Animals', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic System/cytology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/*methods', '*Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', '*Transplantation Immunology']",2003/11/08 05:00,2004/02/21 05:00,['2003/11/08 05:00'],"['2003/11/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/08 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02983796 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2003 Oct;78(3):208-12. doi: 10.1007/BF02983796.,['0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)'],54,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Until recently, bone marrow transplantation was used primarily to eliminate malignant, genetically abnormal, or otherwise deficient stem cells; hence, highly toxic myeloablative regimens were considered mandatory for the eradication of undesirable cells of host origin. Recent data suggest that high-dose chemoradiotherapy may be successively replaced by nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST), which represents a safer biologic tool that involves the induction of host-versus-graft transplantation tolerance. NST thus provides allogeneic donor lymphocytes with the capacity to induce immune-mediated graft-versus-malignancy effects, either against mismatched minor or major histocompatibility alloantigens or against tumor-specific or tumor-associated antigens expressed by tumor or other hematologic cells of host origin. The future goals of the wider and safer clinical application of NST for the treatment of a larger number of indications and larger numbers of patients in need depend, on the one hand, on the development of more effective and safer modalities for maximizing the antitumor potential of donor lymphocytes (T-cells as well as natural killer and natural killer T-cells). On the other hand, these goals depend on using more selective approaches for targeting anticancer effector cells to their target cells. Such changes will thus set the stage for smarter rather than stronger modalities for the treatment of malignant and life-threatening nonmalignant diseases.","['Slavin, Shimon']",['Slavin S'],"['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cancer Immunotherapy, Cell Therapy and Transplantation Research Center, The Danny Cunniff Leukemia Research Laboratory, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel. slavin@cc.huji.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Animals', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Transplantation Chimera', '*Transplantation Immunology']",2003/11/08 05:00,2004/02/21 05:00,['2003/11/08 05:00'],"['2003/11/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/08 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02983795 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2003 Oct;78(3):195-207. doi: 10.1007/BF02983795.,,95,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epidemiological studies on association between childhood cancers, particularly leukemia and brain cancer, and exposure to low- and high-frequency EMF suggested an etiological role of EMFs in inducing adverse health effects. To investigate whether exposure to high-frequency EMFs could affect in vitro cell survival, we cultured acute T-lymphoblastoid leukemia cells (CCRF-CEM) in the presence of unmodulated 900 MHz EMF, generated by a transverse electromagnetic (TEM) cell, at various exposure times. We evaluated the effects of high-frequency EMF on cell growth rate and apoptosis induction, by cell viability (MTT) test, FACS analysis and DNA ladder, and we investigated pro-apoptotic and pro-survival signaling pathways possibly involved as a function of exposure time by Western blot analysis. At short exposure times (2-12 h), unmodulated 900 MHz EMF induced DNA breaks and early activation of both p53-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways while longer continuous exposure (24-48 h) determined silencing of pro-apoptotic signals and activation of genes involved in both intracellular (Bcl-2) and extracellular (Ras and Akt1) pro-survival signaling. Overall our results indicate that exposure to 900 MHz continuous wave, after inducing an early self-defense response triggered by DNA damage, could confer to the survivor CCRF-CEM cells a further advantage to survive and proliferate.","['Marinelli, F', 'La Sala, D', 'Cicciotti, G', 'Cattini, L', 'Trimarchi, C', 'Putti, S', 'Zamparelli, A', 'Giuliani, L', 'Tomassetti, G', 'Cinti, Caterina']","['Marinelli F', 'La Sala D', 'Cicciotti G', 'Cattini L', 'Trimarchi C', 'Putti S', 'Zamparelli A', 'Giuliani L', 'Tomassetti G', 'Cinti C']","['Institute for Organ Transplantation and Immunocytology, ITOI-CNR, Bologna unit, c/o IOR, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/genetics/radiation effects', 'Cell Division/radiation effects', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Gene Expression/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/*radiation effects', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/radiation effects']",2003/11/07 05:00,2004/02/10 05:00,['2003/11/07 05:00'],"['2003/11/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.10425 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2004 Feb;198(2):324-32. doi: 10.1002/jcp.10425.,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,['J Cell Physiol. 2004 Mar;198(3):479-80']

When cultured in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ES cells are maintained in an undifferentiated (self-renewing) state. Addition of RA to the culture media overrides the self-renewing effects of LIF to induce ES cell differentiation. Therefore, we hypothesized that RA-induced differentiation of ES cells may be accomplished by antagonism of LIF-induced signaling pathways. We demonstrate that RA-induced differentiation of CCE ES cells is associated with (1) downregulation of the LIF receptor (LIFR); (2) decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 protein (Stat3); and (3) increased activation of extracellular regulated kinase (Erk1/2). We conclude that RA induces CCE ES cell differentiation in the presence of LIF, in part, by disrupting signaling between the LIFR/gp130 receptor and nuclear targets that are required to prevent ES cell differentiation. Our data indicate that RA-induced inhibition of LIF signaling does not involve Erk1/2-dependent actions.","['Tighe, Ann P', 'Gudas, Lorraine J']","['Tighe AP', 'Gudas LJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Mice', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Receptors, Cytokine/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Trans-Activators/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2003/11/07 05:00,2004/02/10 05:00,['2003/11/07 05:00'],"['2003/11/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.10424 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2004 Feb;198(2):223-9. doi: 10.1002/jcp.10424.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,"['T32 CA062948/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA39036/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

Several lines of evidence suggest that fragile sites are regions of DNA that are unusually sensitive to interference during replication. We have determined that the FRA16D alleles replicate in a synchronous fashion and that replication of these sequences occurs primarily in late S phase extending into G2 phase. Exposure to aphidicolin, an inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha, results in a modest increase in cells with replication of FRA16D sequences in early S phase. This may represent initiation of replication in early S phase coupled with slow replication progression, or, alternatively, these cells may have passed through mitosis, entered the G1-S phase of the next cell cycle, and initiated replication/repair. Our results support a model in which common fragile sites are sequences that may initiate replication in early-mid S phase but are slow to complete replication, and the chromosomal breaks and gaps observed in metaphase cells result from unreplicated DNA.","['Palakodeti, Aparna', 'Han, Yu', 'Jiang, Yanwen', 'Le Beau, Michelle M']","['Palakodeti A', 'Han Y', 'Jiang Y', 'Le Beau MM']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, and the Cancer Research Center, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['*Acid Anhydride Hydrolases', 'Adult', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Fragile Sites/*genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping/methods', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/genetics', 'DNA Replication/drug effects/*genetics', 'Female', 'G2 Phase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'S Phase/drug effects/genetics']",2003/11/07 05:00,2004/01/07 05:00,['2003/11/07 05:00'],"['2003/11/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.10290 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2004 Jan;39(1):71-6. doi: 10.1002/gcc.10290.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (fragile histidine triad protein)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)']",,,,['CA41644/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

Here, we present a chromosome bar code approach in which the problem of color redundancy has been overcome. It allows the detailed description of translocations, including breakpoints as well as intrachromosomal rearrangements in the karyotype of tumor cells. The resolution of discernable bars was increased to 100 bars per haploid chromosome set by including human chromosome-specific probes and more well-defined subregional probes such as chromosome arm- and segment-specific probes. Technically, no limitation to further increase in the resolution of the pattern became apparent. The approach was validated by the analysis of four established tumor cell lines widely used as models in cell biology, revealing numerous inter- and intrachromosomal rearrangements. Chromosome bar coding as presented here may provide further useful information for the subregional assignment of chromosomal breakpoints in complex chromosome aberrations, as found in various neoplasms that cannot be obtained by chromosome painting or classical banding techniques alone.","['Muller, Stefan', 'Eder, Verena', 'Wienberg, Johannes']","['Muller S', 'Eder V', 'Wienberg J']","['Institute of Anthropology and Human Genetics, Department of Biology II, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', '*DNA Probes', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Gene Rearrangement/*genetics', 'Genetic Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/chemistry/cytology/pathology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/chemistry/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasms/chemistry/*genetics']",2003/11/07 05:00,2004/01/07 05:00,['2003/11/07 05:00'],"['2003/11/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.10301 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2004 Jan;39(1):59-70. doi: 10.1002/gcc.10301.,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)']",,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

A computer-based analysis of the PYST2 locus revealed that it harbors two alternative open reading frames promoted by two conserved promoter regions. Using Northern blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction followed by sequencing and alignment of the products, we confirmed the existence of two mRNAs that were transcribed from this genomic region. Western blot analysis indicated that these transcripts were translated. Functional bioinformatic analysis of both transcripts revealed that exon 2 exists in only one of the PYST2 transcripts, designated PYST2-L, and has the consensus elements of the phosphatase catalytic domain (PCD). We found that the translation from the PYST2-L transcript starts 46 codons upstream from the (already-known) PYST2 5' sequence. Furthermore, the existence of three PYST2-L transcripts was indicated. These transcripts differ only in their 5' untranslated regions (5'UTRs). Unlike PYST2-L, the other mRNA (PYST2-S) is devoid of any known PCD. Analysis of the predicted Pyst2-S protein revealed the presence of the vertebrate metallothionein signature I, the mammalian defensin, and the zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenase motifs. These motifs might confer on this protein the ability to sense changes in the cellular environment. From these and previous results, we speculate that Pyst2-S may function as a negative regulator of Pyst2-L.","['Levy-Nissenbaum, Orlev', 'Sagi-Assif, Orit', 'Witz, Isaac P']","['Levy-Nissenbaum O', 'Sagi-Assif O', 'Witz IP']","['Department of Cell Research and Immunology, George S Wise Faculty of Life Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Catalytic Domain/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dual-Specificity Phosphatases', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Substrate Specificity', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2003/11/07 05:00,2004/01/07 05:00,['2003/11/07 05:00'],"['2003/11/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.10295 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2004 Jan;39(1):37-47. doi: 10.1002/gcc.10295.,"['EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (DUSP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Dual-Specificity Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,['GENBANK/AF508727'],,,,,,['Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2004 Feb;39(2):170']

Blinded specimens were reviewed by three independent pathologists. The final consensus classification included 44 CB (67%), seven IB (10%) and 15 PB/PC-F (23%). The interobserver agreement between two centers (Vienna, Wurzburg) was 93.5%. Most PB/PC-F were CD20+, cIgM+, MUM-1+, CD138+/-, bcl-6-, corresponding to an activated B-cell phenotype. Immunoglobulin-V(H) gene mutation analysis was consistent with a germinal or postgerminal center-cell origin. By fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, 11/13 (85%) PB/PC-F had a monoallelic TP53 deletion. The pretreatment characteristics of patients with PB/PC-F included a tendency for more B symptoms, extranodal disease and a higher IPI. Importantly, PB/PC-F were resistant to standard chemotherapy (complete remission rate 47%, relapse rate 71%) and even autologous stem-cell transplantation. The median overall survival (OS) (14 months, P<0.002) and disease-free survival (6 months, P=0.02) were significantly shorter compared to patients with CB and IB. The OS difference was pronounced within the low and low-intermediate IPI risk group (P<0.001).

However, acute lymphoblastic leukemias that express Bcr/Abl only transiently respond to imatinib. Therefore, alternative treatments for this type of leukemia are urgently needed. Here, we examined the activity of the farnesyltransferase inhibitor SCH66336 as a single chemotherapeutic agent in a nude mouse model representative of very advanced stage Bcr/Abl P190-positive lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. Our results show that oral administration of the inhibitor was able to significantly increase the survival of these mice compared to controls treated with vehicle (P<0.005), and caused marked regression of the tumor burden in the treated mice. Upon prolonged treatment, lymphomas re-emerged and a subset of cells from two of such lymphomas tested was able to survive in the presence of increased concentrations of SCH66336. The same cells, however, remained sensitive towards imatinib. A combination of the two drugs, preceded by a therapy to reduce the initial tumor burden, could be very effective in the treatment of Ph-positive ALL. We conclude that SCH66336, on its own, is remarkably effective in eradicating large numbers of lymphoblastic lymphoma cells and causing visible reduction in tumor size, with minimal toxicity.","['Mishra, S', 'Zhang, B', 'Groffen, J', 'Heisterkamp, N']","['Mishra S', 'Zhang B', 'Groffen J', 'Heisterkamp N']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Section of Molecular Carcinogenesis, Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles Research Institute, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Farnesyltranstransferase', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Piperidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyridines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/transplantation']",2003/11/07 05:00,2004/02/11 05:00,['2003/11/07 05:00'],"['2003/11/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403203 [doi]', '2403203 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Jan;18(1):23-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403203.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'IOW153004F (lonafarnib)']",,,,"['CA 50248/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 90321/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

The AF4 body is non-nucleolar and is not coincident with any known nuclear structures we have examined. The AF4-AF9 interaction is maintained by the MLL-AF4 fusion protein, and expression of the MLL-AF4 fusion can alter the subnuclear localization of AF9.

However, the robustness of subtype-specific gene expression signatures has to be proven on independent patient samples. Here, we present gene expression data of 34 adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients (Affymetrix U133A microarrays). Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were applied to stratify our samples based on given gene lists reported to predict MLL, BCR-ABL, and T-ALL, as well as MLL and non-MLL gene rearrangement positive pediatric ALL. In addition, seven other B-precursor ALL cases not bearing t(9;22) or t(11q23)/MLL chromosomal aberrations were analyzed. Using top differentially expressed genes, hierarchical cluster and principal component analyses demonstrate that the genetically more heterogeneous B-precursor ALL samples intercalate with BCR-ABL-positive cases, but were clearly distinct from T-ALL and MLL profiles.

Previously, PTEN expression in the PTEN-null Jurkat T cell leukaemia line was shown to cause reduced proliferation without cell cycle arrest. Here, we further these investigations by determining the basis for this phenomenon. By BrdU pulse-chase and cell cycle arrest and release assays, we find that PTEN expression reduced proliferation by slowing progression through all phases of the cell cycle. This was associated with reduced levels of cyclins A, B1 and B2, cdk4, and cdc25A and increased p27KIP1 expression. Apoptosis played no role in the antiproliferative effect of PTEN, since only marginal increases in the rate of apoptosis were detected upon PTEN expression, and inhibitors of effector caspases did not restore proliferative capacity. Active Akt blocked the antiproliferative effects of PTEN, indicating that PTEN mediates its effects through conventional PI3K-linked signalling pathways. Similar results were obtained from a different PTEN-null leukaemia T cell line, CEM. Together, these results show that PTEN expression in leukaemic T cells leads to reduced proliferation via an apoptosis-independent mechanism involving slower passage through the cell cycle.","['Seminario, Maria-Cristina', 'Precht, Patricia', 'Wersto, Robert P', 'Gorospe, Myriam', 'Wange, Ronald L']","['Seminario MC', 'Precht P', 'Wersto RP', 'Gorospe M', 'Wange RL']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology, National Institute on Aging, IRP/NIH/DHHS, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",2003/11/07 05:00,2003/12/12 05:00,['2003/11/07 05:00'],"['2003/11/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206872 [doi]', '1206872 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Nov 6;22(50):8195-204. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206872.,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A disruption of the mitochondrial potential followed by activation of caspases 9 and 3 was observed in cells treated by the combination TNF-alpha+AS602868.

Cytotoxic reagents may also induce apoptosis of cancer cells in Fas-FADD-dependent manners. In this study, we explored the possible link between these two apparently distinct pathways in T leukemia cell Jurkat. Our results demonstrated that gamma-irradiation, similar to cisplatin, induced apoptosis by triggering Fas aggregation and activating FADD-caspase-8 apoptotic cascade. The absence of caspase-8 or Fas greatly reduced the sensitivity to apoptosis mediated by DNA-damaging agents. In addition, apoptosis induced by cisplatin and gamma-irradiation, but not by Fas, was inhibited by ROS scavengers, including N-acetyl cysteine, MnTBAP, and C60. Importantly, these ROS scavengers effectively prevented the clustering of Fas receptor induced by cisplatin and gamma-irradiation. Our results suggest that cisplatin and gamma-irradiation promote ROS production, which in turn contributes to Fas receptor aggregation and cell death. The novel coupling between ROS and Fas clustering likely plays a significant role in apoptosis triggered by DNA-damaging reagents in Fas-expressing leukemia cells.","['Huang, Huey-Lan', 'Fang, Li-Wen', 'Lu, Shu-Ping', 'Chou, Chen-Kung', 'Luh, Tien-Yau', 'Lai, Ming-Zong']","['Huang HL', 'Fang LW', 'Lu SP', 'Chou CK', 'Luh TY', 'Lai MZ']","['Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/*radiation effects', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'fas Receptor/*radiation effects']",2003/11/07 05:00,2003/12/12 05:00,['2003/11/07 05:00'],"['2003/11/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206979 [doi]', '1206979 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Nov 6;22(50):8168-77. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206979.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of IkBm significantly reduced constitutive NF-kB activity in EU-1 cells, resulting in decreased cell growth. In response to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs, IkBm-transfected cells (EU-1/IkBm) exhibited increased sensitivity to vincristine (VCR), whereas sensitivity to doxorubicin (Dox) was not changed as compared to neo-transfected control (EU-1/neo) cells. To further evaluate the link between IkBm and sensitivity to Dox and VCR, we demonstrated that both endogenous IkBalpha and ectopic IkBm bind to p53. In response to Dox, the cytosolic p53.IkBalpha complex rapidly dissociated due to downregulation of IkBalpha. However, the p53.IkBm complex did not dissociate under these conditions. Although treatment of EU-1/IkBm cells with Dox increased the expression of p53, the nondissociating p53.IkBm complex resulted in decreased p53 function, as demonstrated by absence of cell-cycle arrest and induction of p53 target genes. Contrastingly, VCR-induced cell death neither downregulated IkBalpha nor induced p53, as shown by the lack of NF-kB activation and p53-mediated gene expression in VCR-treated cells. Our data suggest that IkBm simultaneously downregulates NF-kB activation and sequesters p53 in the cytoplasm, thus enhancing NF-kB-regulated apoptosis but blocking p53-dependent apoptosis.","['Zhou, Muxiang', 'Gu, Lubing', 'Zhu, Ningxi', 'Woods, William G', 'Findley, Harry W']","['Zhou M', 'Gu L', 'Zhu N', 'Woods WG', 'Findley HW']","['Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. mzhou@emory.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', '*Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2003/11/07 05:00,2003/12/12 05:00,['2003/11/07 05:00'],"['2003/11/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206911 [doi]', '1206911 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Nov 6;22(50):8137-44. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206911.,"['0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,['R01 CA82323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

While loss-of-function studies have shown that Lmo2 and Scl/Tal1 are essential for haematopoiesis and angiogenic remodelling of the vasculature, gain-of-function studies have suggested an earlier role for Scl/Tal1 in the specification of haemangioblasts, putative bipotential precursors of blood and endothelium. In zebrafish embryos, Scl/Tal1 can induce these progenitors from early mesoderm mainly at the expense of the somitic paraxial mesoderm. We show that this restriction to the somitic paraxial mesoderm correlates well with the ability of Scl/Tal1 to induce ectopic expression of its interaction partner Lmo2. Co-injection of lmo2 mRNA with scl/tal1 dramatically extends its effect to head, heart, pronephros and pronephric duct mesoderm inducing early blood and endothelial genes all along the anteroposterior axis. Erythroid development, however, is expanded only into pronephric mesoderm, remaining excluded from head, heart and somitic paraxial mesoderm territories. This restriction correlates well with activation of gata1 transcription and co-injection of gata1 mRNA along with scl/tal1 and lmo2 induces erythropoiesis more broadly without ventralising or posteriorising the embryo. While no ectopic myeloid development from the Scl/Tal1-Lmo2-induced haemangioblasts was observed, a dramatic increase in the number of endothelial cells was found. These results suggest that, in the absence of inducers of erythroid or myeloid haematopoiesis, Scl/Tal1-Lmo2-induced haemangioblasts differentiate into endothelial cells.","['Gering, Martin', 'Yamada, Yoshihiro', 'Rabbitts, Terence H', 'Patient, Roger K']","['Gering M', 'Yamada Y', 'Rabbitts TH', 'Patient RK']","[""Institute of Genetics, University of Nottingham, Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham NG7 2UH, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20031105,England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Body Patterning', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*deficiency/*genetics', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/physiology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Functional Laterality', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Mesoderm/*cytology', 'Metalloproteins/*genetics', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/*physiology', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/*deficiency/*genetics', 'Zebrafish', 'Zebrafish Proteins/*genetics']",2003/11/07 05:00,2004/01/31 05:00,['2003/11/07 05:00'],"['2003/11/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1242/dev.00875 [doi]', 'dev.00875 [pii]']",ppublish,Development. 2003 Dec;130(25):6187-99. doi: 10.1242/dev.00875.

To identify cells secreting HLA-G5 we generated a rabbit antiserum against a peptide motif encoded by intron-4 of HLA-G (RaHLA-G/I-4). Utilizing this antiserum as capture and antihuman beta 2-microglobulin as detection reagent, an enzyme-linked immunospot assay specific for HLA-G5 was developed.

In all experiments the number of HLA-G5 specific spots was significantly (p < 0.001) increased primarily in monocytes compared with T and B cells, which suggests that peripheral blood monocytes are the predominant cells secreting HLA-G5.","['Rebmann, Vera', 'Busemann, Annika', 'Lindemann, Monica', 'Grosse-Wilde, Hans']","['Rebmann V', 'Busemann A', 'Lindemann M', 'Grosse-Wilde H']","['Institute of Immunology, University Hospital of Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Hum Immunol,Human immunology,8010936,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/*methods', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/blood/immunology/*metabolism', 'HLA-G Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/blood/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferons/pharmacology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*immunology', 'Male', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Rabbits', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/immunology']",2003/11/07 05:00,2004/08/17 10:00,['2003/11/07 05:00'],"['2003/11/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/17 10:00 [medline]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0198885903005421 [pii]', '10.1016/j.humimm.2003.08.354 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Immunol. 2003 Nov;64(11):1017-24. doi: 10.1016/j.humimm.2003.08.354.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-G Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trends of the European age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates were estimated by the Estimated Annual Percentage Change (EAPC) method. Increases in incidence were found for cancer of the breast and lung for females. For males, an increase was observed for cancer of the prostate, colon, rectum and testis. In both groups, oesophageal and pharyngeal cancer increased, but that of stomach and gallbladder cancer decreased. The main increases in mortality were found for pharyngeal cancer in males, lung in females and oesophageal cancer in both sexes. Decreases were shown for stomach cancer for both sexes and lung cancer for males. Trends in incidence may be a result of changes in behaviour, smoking habits in preceding decades are related to the increase in lung cancer for females, and early detection, screening programmes increased the incidence for breast and prostate cancers. Decreases in mortality may be related to more successful treatment of leukaemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, colorectal and testicular cancers. Primary prevention of cancer remains important.","['Siesling, S', 'van Dijck, J A A M', 'Visser, O', 'Coebergh, J W W']","['Siesling S', 'van Dijck JA', 'Visser O', 'Coebergh JW']","['Head of the Department of Research and Registration, Comprehensive Cancer Centre Stedendriehoek Twente, Lasondersingel 133, 7514 BP Enschede, The Netherlands. s.siesling@ikst.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality/trends', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors']",2003/11/07 05:00,2004/01/13 05:00,['2003/11/07 05:00'],"['2003/11/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0959804903006221 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(03)00622-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2003 Nov;39(17):2521-30. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(03)00622-1.,,,['Working Group of The Netherlands Cancer Registry'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objective was to investigate whether PDTC was able to interfere with apoptotic process in leukemic and normal bone marrow CD34+ cells. Since hematopoietic growth factors stimulate growth and differentiation and prevent apoptosis, we therefore studied the effect of growth factors pretreatment, such as interleukin-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, in human myeloid CD34+ cells to evaluate whether they protect the cells from the apoptotic action of PDTC. We revealed that PDTC exerted an apoptotic effect in leukemic CD34+ cells. This effect was dependent on the ability of this compound to generate the oxidation of cellular glutathion to its disulphide and consequently to induce an intracellular oxidative stress. Hematopoietic growth factors did not protect cells from apoptosis induced by previous treatment with PDTC. The ability of PDTC to induce apoptosis was restricted to acute myelogenous leukaemia CD34+ cells, since normal CD34+cells were insensitive to the pro-oxidant effect of PDTC. These findings imply that normal cells are equipped with mechanisms by which they respond differently to PDTC effects with respect to leukemic cells.","['Malaguarnera, L', 'Pilastro, M R', 'DiMarco, R', 'Scifo, C', 'Renis, M', 'Mazzarino, M C', 'Messina, A']","['Malaguarnera L', 'Pilastro MR', 'DiMarco R', 'Scifo C', 'Renis M', 'Mazzarino MC', 'Messina A']","['Department of Bio Medical Sciences, University of Catania, Italy. lucmal@mbox.unict.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Pyrrolidines/*pharmacology', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Thiocarbamates/*pharmacology']",2003/11/07 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2003/11/07 05:00'],"['2003/11/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1025550726803 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2003 Oct;8(5):539-45. doi: 10.1023/a:1025550726803.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (Thiocarbamates)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '25769-03-3 (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamic acid)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We have developed a soluble fusion protein that bridges adenoviral fibers and the c-Kit receptor to alter Ad5 tropism to immature hematopoietic cells. The CAR-SCF fusion protein consists of the extracellular domains of CAR and stem cell factor (SCF). The human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell lines UT-7 and M07e, human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K-562, and erythroleukemia cell line TF-1 were used to assess CAR-SCF-assisted Ad5-mediated gene transfer. Hematopoietic cell lines were infected with an Ad5 vector (Ad5-eGFP) or a fiber-mutant Ad5/F35 (Ad5/F35-eGFP) expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein gene in the presence or absence of CAR-SCF. RESULTS: Twenty-four hours after infection, more than 80% of M07e cells infected in the presence of CAR-SCF were eGFP-positive, compared with very few eGFP-positive cells following Ad5-eGFP infection in the absence of CAR-SCF. The enhancement of Ad5-eGFP infection by CAR-SCF was greater than that caused by Ad5/F35-eGFP (50%). The ability of CAR-SCF to enhance Ad5-eGFP infectivity was highly dependent on cellular c-Kit expression levels. Furthermore, CAR-SCF also enhanced Ad5-mediated gene transfer into human primary CD34(+) cells. CONCLUSIONS: The CAR-SCF fusion protein assists Ad5-mediated transduction to c-Kit(+) CAR(-) hematopoietic cells. The use of this fusion protein would enhance a utility of Ad5-mediated hematopoietic cell transduction strategies.","['Itoh, Akira', 'Okada, Takashi', 'Mizuguchi, Hiroyuki', 'Hayakawa, Takao', 'Mizukami, Hiroaki', 'Kume, Akihiro', 'Takatoku, Masaaki', 'Komatsu, Norio', 'Hanazono, Yutaka', 'Ozawa, Keiya']","['Itoh A', 'Okada T', 'Mizuguchi H', 'Hayakawa T', 'Mizukami H', 'Kume A', 'Takatoku M', 'Komatsu N', 'Hanazono Y', 'Ozawa K']","['Division of Genetic Therapeutics, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,IM,"['*Adenoviridae', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor-Like Membrane Protein', 'DNA Primers', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/*metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Plasmids/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Stem Cell Factor/*metabolism']",2003/11/06 05:00,2004/08/03 05:00,['2003/11/06 05:00'],"['2003/11/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/06 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.430 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2003 Nov;5(11):929-40. doi: 10.1002/jgm.430.,"['0 (CLMP protein, human)', '0 (Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor-Like Membrane Protein)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,

Eight of 17 patients with SHMs had sjTREC levels in the range of or higher than normal donors, whereas only 3 of the 13 patients lacking SHMs had normal sjTREC levels.

METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) at diagnosis (n = 2) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) at diagnosis (n = 14) were analysed for parvovirus B19 DNA by means of nested polymerase chain reaction. In addition, samples from patients with benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) (n = 10) and hydrocephalus (n = 13) were tested as controls. RESULTS: Four leukaemia cases were positive-common ALL (n = 2), null cell ALL (n =1), and M7 AML (n = 1)-whereas all controls were negative (Yates corrected chi(2) value, 3.97; p = 0.046; odds ratio, 16.92; confidence interval, 1.03 to 77.18). All four patients were significantly anaemic, but none was encephalitic or had evidence of central nervous system leukaemia. In three of these patients, serum tumour necrosis alpha, interferon gamma, interleukin 6, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (range, 34.93-3800.06 pg/ml), and macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 were detectable. All of these four patients carried at least one of the HLA-DRB1 alleles, which have been associated with symptomatic parvovirus B19 infection. CONCLUSION: Erythroid suppression and immune cell proliferation are both associated with B19 infection and may also be important in the pathogenesis of acute leukaemia.","['Kerr, J R', 'Barah, F', 'Cunniffe, V S', 'Smith, J', 'Vallely, P J', 'Will, A M', 'Wynn, R F', 'Stevens, R F', 'Taylor, G M', 'Cleator, G M', 'Eden, O B']","['Kerr JR', 'Barah F', 'Cunniffe VS', 'Smith J', 'Vallely PJ', 'Will AM', 'Wynn RF', 'Stevens RF', 'Taylor GM', 'Cleator GM', 'Eden OB']","['Department of Microbiology, Royal Brompton Hospital, Imperial College London, Sydney Street, London SW3 6NP, UK. j.kerr@ic.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytokines/blood', 'DNA, Viral/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*virology', 'Male', 'Parvoviridae Infections/*complications/immunology', '*Parvovirus B19, Human', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*virology']",2003/11/06 05:00,2003/12/19 05:00,['2003/11/06 05:00'],"['2003/11/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/06 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.56.11.873 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2003 Nov;56(11):873-5. doi: 10.1136/jcp.56.11.873.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,PMC1770100,,,,,

Although increased risks for leukemia have been found in medical workers and other professionals exposed to formaldehyde, studies in industrial workers, who are thought to have higher exposures, have shown inconsistent associations. We extended follow-up of a cohort of industrial workers to evaluate the association between formaldehyde exposure and lymphohematopoietic cancers. METHODS: The cohort consisted of 25 619 workers (865 708 person-years) employed before January 1, 1966, at one of 10 U.S. industrial plants and followed through December 31, 1994. We analyzed formaldehyde exposure (peak exposure, average exposure intensity, cumulative exposure, and duration of exposure) and mortality from lymphohematopoietic malignancies using standardized mortality ratios and relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on Poisson regression. Statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Among the cohort, there were 178 deaths from lymphohematopoietic malignancies. Relative risks for leukemia (69 deaths), particularly for myeloid leukemia (30 deaths), increased with formaldehyde exposure. Compared with workers exposed to low peak levels of formaldehyde (0.1-1.9 ppm), relative risks for myeloid leukemia were 2.43 (95% CI = 0.81 to 7.25) and 3.46 (95% CI = 1.27 to 9.43) for workers exposed to peak levels of 2.0-3.9 ppm and > or = 4.0 ppm, respectively (P(trend) =.009). Compared with workers exposed to low levels of average exposure intensity of formaldehyde (0.1-0.4 ppm), workers exposed to 0.5-0.9 ppm and > or = 1.0 ppm average intensity had relative risks of 1.15 (95% CI = 0.41 to 3.23) and 2.49 (95% CI = 1.03 to 6.03), respectively (P(trend) =.088). The relative risk for leukemia was not associated with cumulative exposure but was weakly associated with duration of exposure. Relative risks for Hodgkin's disease also increased with formaldehyde exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to formaldehyde may cause leukemia, particularly myeloid leukemia, in humans. However, results from other investigations are mixed, suggesting caution in drawing definitive conclusions.","['Hauptmann, Michael', 'Lubin, Jay H', 'Stewart, Patricia A', 'Hayes, Richard B', 'Blair, Aaron']","['Hauptmann M', 'Lubin JH', 'Stewart PA', 'Hayes RB', 'Blair A']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. hauptmann@nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinogens/*adverse effects', 'Chemical Industry', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disinfectants/adverse effects', 'Fixatives/adverse effects', 'Formaldehyde/*adverse effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Odds Ratio', 'United States/epidemiology']",2003/11/06 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/11/06 05:00'],"['2003/11/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/06 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/djg083 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2003 Nov 5;95(21):1615-23. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djg083.,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Disinfectants)', '0 (Fixatives)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']",,,,,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 2004 Jun 16;96(12):966-7; author reply 967-8.

DESIGN: prospective cohort study. SETTING: two medicine for the elderly wards. PARTICIPANTS: patients admitted to the wards over a 17-month period. MEASUREMENT: presence of Clostridium difficile on culture of stool specimens and toxins A and/or B. Patient's age, sex, source of admission, antibiotic, laxative, antacid and steroid use, presence/absence of colonic disease, neoplasia, leukaemia and nasogastric or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube feeding. RESULTS: 390 of 865 patients admitted provided a total of 1003 faecal specimens. Age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.001-1.07 per year), admission from another hospital (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.29-3.50), non-cephalosporin antibiotics (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.25-3.46) and cephalosporin use (OR 8.45, 95% CI 2.99-23.9) increased risk of becoming Clostridium difficile culture positive. Becoming toxin-positive was associated with antibiotic use only (OR 3.02, 95% CI 1.15-7.92), specifically amoxycillin (OR 8.72, 95% CI 1.66-45.9) and cephalosporins other than ceftriaxone (OR 7.28, 95% CI 1.34-39.6). CONCLUSION: different risk factors are important for the two stages leading to Clostridium difficile diarrhoea. Age, source of admission and third generation cephalosporins increase risk of becoming culture positive, whilst only antibiotic use is associated with the step of becoming toxin-positive. Understanding these differential risks may aid infection control strategies.","['Starr, John M', 'Martin, Heather', 'McCoubrey, Jodie', 'Gibson, Gavin', 'Poxton, Ian R']","['Starr JM', 'Martin H', 'McCoubrey J', 'Gibson G', 'Poxton IR']","['Geriatric Medicine Unit, Edinburgh University, Royal Victoria Hospital, Craigleith Road, Edinburgh EH4 2DN, UK.

Human clinical trials to date have used Moloney leukemia virus-based amphotropic and gibbon ape leukemia virus-based envelopes in stable retroviral packaging lines. However, retroviruses pseudotyped with these envelopes have low titers due to the inability to concentrate viral supernatants efficiently by centrifugation without damaging the virus and low transduction efficiencies because of low-level expression of viral target receptors on human HSC. The RD114 envelope from the feline endogenous virus has been shown to transduce human CD34+ cells using transient packaging systems and to be concentrated to high titers by centrifugation. Stable packaging systems have potential advantages over transient systems because greater and more reproducible viral productions can be attained. We have, therefore, constructed and tested a stable RD114-expressing packaging line capable of high-level transduction of human CD34+ cells. Viral particles from this cell line were concentrated up to 100-fold (up to 10(7) viral particles/ml) by ultracentrifugation. Human hematopoietic progenitors from cord blood and sickle cell CD34+ cells were efficiently transduced with a Neo(R)-containing vector after a single exposure to concentrated RD114-pseudotyped virus produced from this cell line. Up to 78% of progenitors from transduced cord blood CD34+ cells and 51% of progenitors from sickle cell CD34+ cells expressed the NeoR gene. We also show transfer of a human beta-globin gene into progenitor cells from CD34+ cells from sickle cell patients with this new RD114 stable packaging system. The results indicate that this packaging line may eventually be useful in human clinical trials of globin gene therapy.","['Ward, Maureen', 'Sattler, Rose', 'Grossman, I Robert', 'Bell, Anthony J Jr', 'Skerrett, Donna', 'Baxi, Laxmi', 'Bank, Arthur']","['Ward M', 'Sattler R', 'Grossman IR', 'Bell AJ Jr', 'Skerrett D', 'Baxi L', 'Bank A']","['Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/biosynthesis', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Centrifugation', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Globins/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Methylcellulose/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sickle Cell Trait', 'Time Factors', '*Transduction, Genetic']",2003/11/06 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/11/06 05:00'],"['2003/11/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(03)00263-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ymthe.2003.07.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2003 Nov;8(5):804-12. doi: 10.1016/j.ymthe.2003.07.002.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9004-67-5 (Methylcellulose)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (Cd38 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,"['DK-07373/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-59887/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Two cis-acting elements located within the upstream region of the direct repeat, which positively regulated retroviral expression, were identified. Transcription factors NFAT5 and Sp1, which are ubiquitously expressed in a variety of tissues, bound to these elements. To increase specificity without lowering the potency of retroviral expression in hepatocytes, these elements were replaced by a sequence derived from the hepatitis B virus enhancer II region. Novel vectors, SF-Hep3 and SF-Hep5 (SFFVp-based vector for hepatocytes 3 and 5), were developed with these engineered LTRs. The engineered LTRs of these vectors enhanced the retroviral expression only in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines in vitro. These vectors also increased transgene expression 4- to 9-fold or 3.5- to 5-fold in comparison with a Moloney murine leukemia virus-based vector or a vector containing the wild-type LTR of SFFVp, respectively, in murine hepatocytes in vivo.","['Yamaguchi, Kanji', 'Itoh, Katsuhiko', 'Ohnishi, Naoki', 'Itoh, Yoshito', 'Baum, Christopher', 'Tsuji, Takashi', 'Nagao, Toshikazu', 'Higashitsuji, Hiroaki', 'Okanoue, Takeshi', 'Fujita, Jun']","['Yamaguchi K', 'Itoh K', 'Ohnishi N', 'Itoh Y', 'Baum C', 'Tsuji T', 'Nagao T', 'Higashitsuji H', 'Okanoue T', 'Fujita J']","['Department of Clinical Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, 606-8507, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hepatocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/genetics', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transfection', '*Transgenes/genetics']",2003/11/06 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/11/06 05:00'],"['2003/11/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(03)00284-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ymthe.2003.08.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2003 Nov;8(5):796-803. doi: 10.1016/j.ymthe.2003.08.005.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Malignant cells have a CD4+ T-helper phenotype and are found in early stages of the disease in plaques and cutaneous tumors. MLV/HIV-pseudotyped retroviral vectors target gene transfer to CD4-positive T cells and are therefore well suited to be specific delivery vehicles to treat CTCLs.

Vector particles were intratumorally injected into CTCL nude mouse xenografts. Mice were systemically treated with ganciclovir (GCV) and the tumor tissue was analyzed. A significant delay in tumor growth was observed for HSV-TK-transduced and GCV-treated tumors. GFP expression could be detected exclusively in CD4+ cells of tumors after transduction with GFP-encoding control vectors. The data demonstrate a cell-specific in vivo gene delivery via MLV/HIV-pseudotyped vectors and open new avenues for the treatment of CTCL in humans.","['Thaler, Sonja', 'Burger, Angelika M', 'Schulz, Thomas', 'Schnierle, Barbara S']","['Thaler S', 'Burger AM', 'Schulz T', 'Schnierle BS']","['Institute for Biomedical Research, Georg-Speyer Haus, Paul-Ehrlich-Strasse 42-44, D-60596, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Ganciclovir/therapeutic use', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HIV/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'Simplexvirus/enzymology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Time Factors']",2003/11/06 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/11/06 05:00'],"['2003/11/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(03)00241-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s1525-0016(03)00241-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2003 Nov;8(5):756-61. doi: 10.1016/s1525-0016(03)00241-7.,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Normally if the packaging cell line does not produce a functional viral fusion glycoprotein, such as the retroviral envelope protein or a foreign viral glycoprotein, then the viruses will be incapable of transducing cells. We have found that incubating envelope protein-deficient virus particles bound to cells with chlorpromazine leads to transduction. Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is a membrane-active reagent that is commonly used to induce the hemifusion to fusion transition when membrane fusion is mediated by partially defective viral glycoproteins. The concentration and pH dependence of the promotion of transduction by CPZ is consistent with a role for CPZ micelle formation in viral entry. These data indicate that caution is warranted when experiments concerning membrane fusion completion promoted by CPZ are analyzed.","['Taylor, Gwen M', 'Zullo, Alfred J', 'Larson, Geraldine M', 'Sanders, David Avram']","['Taylor GM', 'Zullo AJ', 'Larson GM', 'Sanders DA']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Lilly Hall, 915 W.

However, Bcr-Abl gene mutations have been reported mainly in relapsing or resistant patients. In primary resistant patients, only few mutations have been documented so far, suggesting alternative mechanisms. We aimed to investigate if alpha 1 acid glycoprotein (AGP), an acute phase drug binding protein, could be a biological marker for pharmacological resistance to imatinib in nine patients in acute phase CML. All patients (3/3) with high AGP dosages (2.31+/-0.17 mg/mL; normal values, 0.5-1.3mg/mL) were primary resistant to imatinib whereas an early clinical response was observed for the six patients with normal AGP levels (1.13+/-0.2mg/mL). No mutation in the adenosine triphosphate domain of Abl were detected before the initiation of imatinib therapy. By using in vitro tests combining various imatinib concentrations (1-10 microM) with purified human AGP (1 and 3 mg/mL), we demonstrate that imatinib-induced apoptosis of K562 or fresh leukemic CML cells is abrogated or reduced. The same effect was observed using sera from donors with high AGP levels (1.9-3.28 mg/mL). In patients with CML in blastic phase, AGP levels could reflect pharmacological resistance to imatinib, suggesting that increased dosage of imatinib or the use of a competitor to drug binding should be recommended to optimize the therapeutic effect of the drug.","['Larghero, Jerome', 'Leguay, Thibaut', 'Mourah, Samia', 'Madelaine-Chambrin, Isabelle', 'Taksin, Anne Laure', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Bastie, Jean Noel', 'Degos, Laurent', 'Berthaud, Patrice', 'Marolleau, Jean Pierre', 'Calvo, Fabien', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Mahon, Francois Xavier', 'Rousselot, Philippe']","['Larghero J', 'Leguay T', 'Mourah S', 'Madelaine-Chambrin I', 'Taksin AL', 'Raffoux E', 'Bastie JN', 'Degos L', 'Berthaud P', 'Marolleau JP', 'Calvo F', 'Chomienne C', 'Mahon FX', 'Rousselot P']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire Hematopoietique, EMI 00-03, Hopital Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Orosomucoid/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/11/06 05:00,2003/12/20 05:00,['2003/11/06 05:00'],"['2003/11/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295203004696 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(03)00469-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2003 Nov 15;66(10):1907-13. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(03)00469-6.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Orosomucoid)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present hypothesis accents on the mechanisms whereby Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase remains inhibited by Glivec, but alternative signalling pathways become activated-the potential reason associates with activation of telomerase after long-term treatment with Glivec and recovery of cell proliferation and immortality. The hypothesis is based on the observations about differences in telomere dynamics and telomerase activity between chronic and blast phases of CML patients, as well as about the potential effect of Glivec on the cross-talk between telomerase, Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase and protein kinase C family-key enzymes in CML. It proceeds from recently published data, demonstrating that protein kinase C activates and c-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibits telomerase. During optimization of chemical structure, Glivec loose its effect on protein kinase C and enhances the effect on Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, resulting in a high potential to activate telomerase indirectly through its effect on both kinases. Experimental preclinical data are given in confirmation of this hypothesis.","['Bakalova, Rumiana', 'Ohba, Hideki', 'Zhelev, Zhivko', 'Ishikawa, Mitsuru', 'Shinohara, Yasuo', 'Baba, Yoshinobu']","['Bakalova R', 'Ohba H', 'Zhelev Z', 'Ishikawa M', 'Shinohara Y', 'Baba Y']","['National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, AIST-Shikoku, 2217-14 Hayashi-cho, 761-0395 Takamatsu, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/11/06 05:00,2003/12/20 05:00,['2003/11/06 05:00'],"['2003/11/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295203005574 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2003.06.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2003 Nov 15;66(10):1879-84. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2003.06.001.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epidemiological reports suggest a possible association between exposure to ELF-EMF and an increased risk of cancer (e.g. childhood acute leukaemia). Benzene is an established human leukomogen. This xenobiotic, which is unlikely to be the ultimate carcinogen, is metabolized in the liver to its primary metabolite phenol, which is hydroxylated to hydroquinone (1,4-benzenediol) and 1,2,4-benzenetriol. In this in vitro approach, to test the genotoxic and / or co-genotoxic potency of ELF-EMF, the cytokinesis block micronucleus (MN) method with Jurkat cells has been used. A 50 Hz magnetic field (MF) of 5 mT field strength was applied for different length of time (from 1 to 24 h), either alone or with benzene, 1,4-benzenediol, or 1,2,4-benzenetriol.

Benzene exposure does not show any cytogenetic activity, whereas 1,4-benzenediol or 1,2,4-benzenetriol alone significantly affect the number of MN in Jurkat cells, as compared to untreated cultures. Moreover, co-exposure to ELF-MF does not seem to affect the frequency of micronuclei induced by benzene, 1,4-benzenediol, or 1,2,4-benzenetriol.","['Pasquini, R', 'Villarini, M', 'Scassellati Sforzolini, G', 'Fatigoni, C', 'Moretti, M']","['Pasquini R', 'Villarini M', 'Scassellati Sforzolini G', 'Fatigoni C', 'Moretti M']","['Department of Hygiene and Public Health, University of Perugia, Via del Giochetto, I-06126 Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,IM,"['Benzene/*toxicity', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*toxicity', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Mitotic Index', 'Time Factors']",2003/11/06 05:00,2004/07/09 05:00,['2003/11/06 05:00'],"['2003/11/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0887233303001371 [pii]', '10.1016/s0887-2333(03)00137-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2003 Oct-Dec;17(5-6):581-6. doi: 10.1016/s0887-2333(03)00137-1.,"['0 (Hydroquinones)', '173O8B04RD (hydroxyhydroquinone)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These are exemplified by the mouse gene Fv1, which encodes a Gag-like protein able to protect against murine leukemia virus (MLV) infection. The block is saturable, occurs after reverse transcription and is directed against the viral capsid gene. Several other mammalian species are also able to block MLV infection with the same capsid specificity. A human gene with this activity has been named Ref1. Recently, primates have been shown to restrict a variety of retroviruses only very distantly related to MLVs through a gene named Lv1. Restricted viruses include MLV as well as lentiviruses such as human immunodeficiency viruses 1 and 2, simian immunodeficiency virus and equine infectious anemia virus. In each case the block to one retrovirus can be saturated by co-infection with a second restricted virus. The possible mechanisms of action, and evolutionary consequences of restriction, are reviewed.","['Towers, Greg J', 'Goff, Stephen P']","['Towers GJ', 'Goff SP']","['Wohl Virion Center, Department of Immunology and Molecular Pathology, Windeyer Institute, University College London, 46 Cleveland St., London W1T 4JF, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,Spain,AIDS Rev,AIDS reviews,101134876,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics/physiology', 'Mammals/virology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/growth & development/physiology', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*genetics/immunology/metabolism/*virology']",2003/11/06 05:00,2004/01/21 05:00,['2003/11/06 05:00'],"['2003/11/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/06 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,AIDS Rev. 2003 Jul-Sep;5(3):156-64.,,73,,,['R01 CA 30488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

In this study we examined the transcriptional mechanisms of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced down-regulation of TF in the APL cell line NB4, by analysis of stable clones expressing the luciferase gene under the control of 5' flanking regions of the TF gene. We show that the TF promoter is constitutively active in NB4 cells, and that ATRA induces rapid suppression of the promoter. Basal activity and ATRA-induced suppression of TF promoter is determined by the proximal -383 to +121 bp of the promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate the binding of Fos/Jun complexes to two TF promoter AP-1 sites in this region. Both complexes were suppressed by ATRA treatment. The ectopic expression of the APL-specific PML/RARalpha oncoprotein in U-937 cells results in induction of TF mRNA and promoter activity. Interestingly, this PML/RARalpha-mediated increase in TF promoter activity is sensitive to ATRA treatment. These data indicate that TF expression in APL cells is exacerbated by the presence of the PML/RARalpha fusion protein, and implicates the loss of Fos/Jun binding to the TF promoter in ATRA-induced suppression of TF.","['Tenno, Taavo', 'Oberg, Fredrik', 'Mackman, Nigel', 'Nilsson, Kenneth', 'Siegbahn, Agneta']","['Tenno T', 'Oberg F', 'Mackman N', 'Nilsson K', 'Siegbahn A']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Clinical Chemistry, Laboratory for Coagulation Research, University Hospital, SE 751 85 Uppsala, Sweden.

Here, we show a biological role of HB-EGF-C in cells. Subsequent to proteolytic cleavage of proHB-EGF, HB-EGF-C translocated from the plasma membrane into the nucleus. This translocation triggered nuclear export of the transcriptional repressor, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), which we identify as an HB-EGF-C binding protein.

Previously, we showed that the hematopoietic-specific activator NF-E2, which is required for beta-globin transcription in erythroleukemia cells, induces histone H3 hyperacetylation and H3-meK4 at the adult beta-globin genes (betamajor and betaminor). Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that NF-E2 occupies hypersensitive site two (HS2) of the beta-globin locus control region. The mechanism of NF-E2-mediated chromatin modification was investigated by complementation analysis in NF-E2-null CB3 erythroleukemia cells. The activation domain of the hematopoietic-specific subunit of NF-E2 (p45/NF-E2) contains two WW domain-binding motifs (PXY-1 and PXY-2). PXY-1 is required for activation of beta-globin transcription. Here, we determined which step in NF-E2-dependent transactivation is PXY-1-dependent. A p45/NF-E2 mutant lacking 42 amino acids of the activation domain, including both PXY motifs, and a mutant lacking only PXY-1 were impaired in inducing histone H3 hyperacetylation, H3-meK4, and RNA polymerase II recruitment. The PXY motifs were not required for transactivation in the context of a GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusion to p45/NF-E2 in transient transfection assays. As the PXY-1 mutant occupied HS2 normally, the chromatin modification defect occurred post-DNA binding. PXY-1 was not required for recruitment of the histone acetyltransferases cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) and p300 to HS2. These results indicate that PXY-1 confers chromatin-specific transcriptional activation via interaction with a co-regulator distinct from CBP/p300 or by regulating CBP/p300 function.","['Kiekhaefer, Carol M', 'Boyer, Meghan E', 'Johnson, Kirby D', 'Bresnick, Emery H']","['Kiekhaefer CM', 'Boyer ME', 'Johnson KD', 'Bresnick EH']","['University of Wisconsin Medical School, Department of Pharmacology, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20031102,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites/physiology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Gene Deletion', 'Globins/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Histones/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Megakaryocytes', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/11/05 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2003/11/05 05:00'],"['2003/11/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M309750200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)44440-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Feb 27;279(9):7456-61. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M309750200.

Our previous study showed that PML enhances tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the NFkappaB survival pathway. To continue exploring the mechanism of PML-induced apoptosis, we performed a DNA microarray screening of PML target genes using a PML-inducible stable cell line. We found that Survivin was one of the downstream target genes of PML. Cotransfection experiments demonstrated that PML4 repressed transactivation of the Survivin promoter in an isoform-specific manner. Western blot analysis demonstrated that induced PML expression down-regulated Survivin. Inversely, PML knockdown by siRNA up-regulated Survivin expression. A substantial increase in Survivin expression was found in PML-deficient cells. Re-expression of PML in PML-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts down-regulated the expression of Survivin. Furthermore, cells arrested at the G2/M cell cycle phase expressed a high level of Survivin and a significantly lower level of PML. Overexpression of PML in A549 cells reduced Survivin expression leading to massive apoptotic cell death associated with activation of procaspase 9, caspase 3, and caspase 7.

Increased GGH activity has been found in rat hepatoma cells resistant to the cancer drug methotrexate (MTX). The aim of this study was to identify polymorphisms in the GGH gene that modulate GGH activity and that may affect methotrexate resistance. Exons of the human gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (hGGH) gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from breast cancer tissue and leukemia cell lines. Single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was performed, and PCR products containing different patterns were cloned and sequenced. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, at bases -401C>T, -354G>T, -124T>G, +16T>C, +452C>T, and +1102A>G, relative to the A of the translation start codon being considered as +1. The SNP at +16, which changes codon -19 (relative to the start of the mature hGGH protein) in the endoplasmic reticulum targeting sequence of hGGH protein from cysteine to arginine, has previously been identified in this laboratory. The SNP at +452 changes the conserved hGGH protein codon 127 from threonine to isoleucine. The functions of SNPs in the promoter of the hGGH gene were studied by site-directed mutagenesis of a 516-bp region of the hGGH gene promoter in a luciferase reporter vector and transfection into HepG2 and MCF-7 cells. All of the promoter polymorphisms enhanced the production of luciferase compared to the wild-type hGGH gene promoter in HepG2 cells, and -401C>T and -124T>G enhanced luciferase expression in MCF-7 cells, suggesting that polymorphisms in the hGGH gene promoter may increase expression of hGGH protein.","['Chave, Karen J', 'Ryan, Thomas J', 'Chmura, Stacey E', 'Galivan, John']","['Chave KJ', 'Ryan TJ', 'Chmura SE', 'Galivan J']","['Division of Molecular Medicine, Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, PO Box 509, Albany, NY 12201-0509, USA. chave@wadsworth.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase/*genetics/metabolism']",2003/11/05 05:00,2004/01/21 05:00,['2003/11/05 05:00'],"['2003/11/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0378111903008072 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(03)00807-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2003 Nov 13;319:167-75. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(03)00807-2.,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.4.19.9 (gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase)']",,,,"['CA25933/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA82425/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'USO/CCU213244/CC/ODCDC CDC HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the cytotoxicity of this compound to two human cell lines of myeloid origin: the monocytic lymphoma cells U-937 and the promyelocytic leukemia cells HL-60. In some experiments HL-60 cells partially differentiated towards the eosinophilic phenotype were also used. Cultures of U-937 cells and HL-60 cells in stationary phase were exposed to beauvericin at concentrations ranging from 100 nM to 300 microM for periods of time of 4 and 24h, respectively. The effects of beauvericin on cell viability were assessed by the Trypan blue exclusion method. In another set of experiments, performed with U-937 cells, the mycotoxin was included in the culture medium at passaging, in order to assess its possible effects on cell growth. Viability of both U-937 cells and HL-60 cells was not affected by beauvericin at concentrations up to 3 microM, after 4h exposure, whereas a steady decline was seen at higher concentrations. Similarly, after an exposure time of 24h, a decline in viability was observed in cultures exposed to beauvericin at a concentration of 10 microM or higher. Thus, 50% cytotoxic concentrations at 24h of congruent with 30 microM and congruent with 15 microM were estimated for U-937 cells and HL-60 cells, respectively.Similar experiments were performed with cultures of HL-60 cells partially differentiated towards the eosinophilic phenotype, revealing that, in 4h exposure experiments (but not in 24h experiments), the viability of these cultures underwent a significantly less pronounced decline, in comparison to undifferentiated HL-60 cultures. Interestingly, when U-937 cells were allowed to proliferate in the presence of the mycotoxin, included in the culture medium at passaging, a substantial cytotoxicity was observed at lower concentrations, compared with prevalently resting, stationary phase cultures. Accordingly, a definite inhibition of the proliferative capability of the cells was detected. The information provided by this work may be useful in selecting appropriate myeloid cell models for the development of biossays aimed at detecting beauvericin (and, possibly, other mycotoxins) in foods and other commodities.","['Calo, Lucia', 'Fornelli, Francesca', 'Ramires, Rossella', 'Nenna, Saverio', 'Tursi, Alfredo', 'Caiaffa, Maria Filomena', 'Macchia, Luigi']","['Calo L', 'Fornelli F', 'Ramires R', 'Nenna S', 'Tursi A', 'Caiaffa MF', 'Macchia L']","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Allergology, University of Bari, Policlinico, Piazza Giulio Cesare, 70124 Bari, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Pharmacol Res,Pharmacological research,8907422,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Depsipeptides/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mycotoxins/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Peptides, Cyclic/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Time Factors', 'Trypan Blue']",2003/11/05 05:00,2005/01/26 09:00,['2003/11/05 05:00'],"['2003/11/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1043661803002524 [pii]', '10.1016/j.phrs.2003.07.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Res. 2004 Jan;49(1):73-7. doi: 10.1016/j.phrs.2003.07.002.,"['0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Mycotoxins)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '26S048LS2R (beauvericin)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initial double strand break (DSB) level and DSB rejoining were measured, using pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) in human G1 phase lymphocytes subjected to Pt complex treatment alone and in combination with 10Gy of X-rays. Effects of Pt complex pre-treatment followed by X-irradiation were examined on survival (clonogenic ability) and growth (48 h growth tests) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1), xrs6 and L5178Y (LY) cells (LY-R and LY-S sublines). Cell cycle distributions of CHO cells after drug treatment were determined with the use of flow cytometry. Pt1 slowed down rejoining of X-ray induced DSB. It exerted a more than additive lethal effect on CHO-K1 cells but not on L5178Y cells subjected to combined Pt complex treatment and X-irradiation. In xrs6 cells the effect of combined Pt1+X treatment was additive. We conclude that, as earlier proposed for other Pt complexes, the radiosensitizing effect of Pt1 is connected with converting repairable DNA damage into irrepairable one (mode (i) of action). The requirements for this mode of sensitization are functional DNA repair systems (nucleotide excision repair (NER) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)). Pt4 does not slow down DSB rejoining. It shows a considerable ability to arrest cells in G2 phase. We assume that Pt4 pre-treatment arrests cells in G2 phase and thus sensitizes to X-rays these cells that have a radiosensitive G2 phase (mode (ii) of action).","['Gradzka, Iwona', 'Buraczewska, Iwona', 'Kuduk-Jaworska, Janina', 'Romaniewska, Anna', 'Szumiel, Irena']","['Gradzka I', 'Buraczewska I', 'Kuduk-Jaworska J', 'Romaniewska A', 'Szumiel I']","['Department of Radiobiology and Health Protection, Institute of Nuclear Chemistry and Technology, Dorodna 16, 03-195 Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells/drug effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/chemistry/toxicity', 'DNA Adducts/chemistry/drug effects/radiation effects', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/drug effects/radiation effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*chemistry/*toxicity', 'Radiation Tolerance/*drug effects', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*chemistry/*toxicity', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*chemistry']",2003/11/05 05:00,2003/12/17 05:00,['2003/11/05 05:00'],"['2003/11/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0009279703001066 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-2797(03)00106-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2003 Oct 25;146(2):165-77. doi: 10.1016/s0009-2797(03)00106-6.,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While double-strand break repair protein rad 21 homologue, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit 5, mixed lineage leukemia septin-like fusion protein-B and heat shock protein 75 were increased; beta-amyloid precursor-like protein 1, tropomyosin 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion oncoprotein type 2, Nck adaptor protein 2, Src homology domain growth factor receptor bound 2-like endophilin B2, beta tubulin, septin 7 and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells 140 were decreased. The current data suggest that misexpression of proteins that have functions ranging from signaling to cellular structural organization could contribute to or reflect brain dysgenesis in Down syndrome.","['Engidawork, E', 'Gulesserian, T', 'Fountoulakis, M', 'Lubec, G']","['Engidawork E', 'Gulesserian T', 'Fountoulakis M', 'Lubec G']","['Department of Neonatology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cerebral Cortex/abnormalities/embryology/*metabolism', 'Down Syndrome/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Female', 'Fetus/abnormalities/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proteome/metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",2003/11/05 05:00,2004/03/20 05:00,['2003/11/05 05:00'],"['2003/11/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0306452203006055 [pii]', '10.1016/s0306-4522(03)00605-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 2003;122(1):145-54. doi: 10.1016/s0306-4522(03)00605-5.,"['0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Proteome)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evaluation of DNA correlation was performed according to Tenover criteria. A total of 309 febrile episodes occurred in 187 patients. Of 139 organisms isolated in 116 bacteremias, 48% were gram negative bacilli (GNB); P. aeruginosa bacteremias were recorded in 34 (51%) of GNB sepsis. Evaluation of DNA correlation showed 2 related in 1997, 7 related in 1998, 10 related in 1999, 6 related in 2000-2001 (mainly closely and possibly related); therefore isolates closely related among themselves were also possibly related with other strains. About 60% of patients with related strains were hospitalized in the same room or in different rooms but became infected in the same period.

Previous studies demonstrate a critical role for Pbx1 as a developmental regulator whose absence results in embryonic lethality and multiple tissue and organ system abnormalities. Here we report a requirement for Pbx1 in the differentiation of urogenital organs, where Pbx1 is widely expressed in mesenchymal tissues. The complete lack of adrenal glands and formation of gonads displaying rudimentary sexual differentiation correlated with decreased cellular proliferation in Pbx1(-/-) genital ridges. Furthermore, expression of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), a nuclear receptor essential for adrenal organogenesis, was reduced to minimal levels in Pbx1 mutants, indicating an upstream function for Pbx1 in adrenocortical development. Finally, loss of Pbx1 markedly reduces urogenital ridge outgrowth and results in impaired differentiation of the mesonephros and kidneys and the absence of Mullerian ducts. These findings establish a Pbx1-dependent pathway that regulates the expansion of SF-1 positive cells essential for adrenal formation and gonadal differentiation and demonstrate an early requirement for Pbx1 in urogenital development.","['Schnabel, Catherine A', 'Selleri, Licia', 'Cleary, Michael L']","['Schnabel CA', 'Selleri L', 'Cleary ML']",,['eng'],"['Letter', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Genesis,"Genesis (New York, N.Y. : 2000)",100931242,IM,"['Adrenal Glands/*embryology', 'Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development', 'Female', 'Fushi Tarazu Transcription Factors', 'Gonads/embryology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice/embryology', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Sex Differentiation/*genetics/physiology', 'Steroidogenic Factor 1', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics/*pharmacology', 'Urogenital System/*embryology']",2003/11/05 05:00,2004/07/22 05:00,['2003/11/05 05:00'],"['2003/11/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/22 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gene.10235 [doi]'],ppublish,Genesis. 2003 Nov;37(3):123-30. doi: 10.1002/gene.10235.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fushi Tarazu Transcription Factors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Steroidogenic Factor 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (steroidogenic factor 1, mouse)']",,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

Along with B-cell malignancies, pediatric lymphomas also include T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and Hodgkin disease, each with unique prognoses. The purpose of this study was to elucidate epigenetic changes in the DAP-kinase promoter region of pediatric cases to determine associations with aberrant hypermethylation. PROCEDURES: Thirty-nine cases of different lymphoid pathology [10 Burkitt lymphoma, 1 B-cell NHL; 7 T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma; 4 anaplastic large cell lymphoma (LCL); 2 B-cell LCL; 14 nodular sclerosing Hodgkin disease (NSHD); and 1 B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)] had methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction performed on bisulfite-treated DNA, which distinguishes the methylation status of the promoter region, and DAP-kinase mRNA expression assays performed on available specimens. RESULTS: In normal lymphocytes, the CpG islands in the promoter region were unmethylated, as were the T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and anaplastic LCL. In contrast, 100% of the Burkitt lymphoma (10/10) and B-cell ALL (1/1) were hypermethylated. Of the specimens with mRNA available, 7/8 Burkitt lymphoma had no DAP-kinase mRNA expression compared to normal expression in 3/3 and 4/4 T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and NSHD, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In these pediatric lymphoid tumors, hypermethylation of the DAP-kinase promoter region with associated loss of DAP-kinase gene expression was associated with B-cell malignancies and thus may be important in the development and/or provide a prognostic tool in B- cell lymphomas.","['Shiramizu, Bruce', 'Mick, Paul']","['Shiramizu B', 'Mick P']","['Departments of Pediatrics & Medicine, John A Burns School of Medicine, Pacific Biomedical Research Center, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, USA. bshirami@hawaii.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*genetics', 'Child', 'CpG Islands/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Death-Associated Protein Kinases', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics']",2003/11/05 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/11/05 05:00'],"['2003/11/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.10326 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2003 Dec;41(6):527-31. doi: 10.1002/mpo.10326.,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Death-Associated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",,,,['G12RR0061/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

From the available data, there are no significant differences in survival with these two regimens. A small benefit of decreased relapse rate with CyTBI is counterbalanced by a nonsignificant increase in treatment-related mortality. The incidence of veno-occlusive disease is significantly higher in patients treated with BuCy. Therapeutic monitoring of busulfan was not reported in any of the studies comparing the regimens.

In these patients, lesions tend to show atypical clinical patterns, leading to misdiagnosis. OBJECTIVES: To detect HSV, using an ELISA test, in oral lesions of patients under oncologic therapy, to determine localization of these lesions in the oral cavity, to relate their presence with the general diagnosis of the patient and to compare the test results with the previous clinical diagnosis of the lesions. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty lesions where examined in nineteen pediatric patients under oncologic therapy. Direct samples of all lesions were taken and an ELISA test for HSV type I and II was applied to them. General diagnosis of the patients was consigned, as well as localization of the lesions in the oral cavity and clinical diagnosis of them. A database was elaborated with all the information. RESULTS: 33% of lesions were positive to the test, most of them in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Localization of lesions was not restricted to areas of mucosa attached to periosteum, but also in areas like the dorsum of the tongue. Positive predictivity of clinical diagnosis was 56,25% and negative predictive index was 92,86%. Sensitivity of the test was 90% and specificity was 65%. CONCLUSIONS: It is very important to corroborate clinical diagnosis of gingivitis and ulcerative lesions of the oral cavity of patients under oncologic therapy with laboratory tests, because of the atypical clinical presentation that can lead to misdiagnosis.","['Sepulveda Tebache, Ester', 'Brethauer Meier, Ursula', 'Jimenez Moraga, Marco', 'Morales Figueroa, Rocio', 'Rojas Castro, Jaime', 'Le Fort Canales, Patricia']","['Sepulveda Tebache E', 'Brethauer Meier U', 'Jimenez Moraga M', 'Morales Figueroa R', 'Rojas Castro J', 'Le Fort Canales P']","['Departamento de Patologia y Diagnostico, Facultad de Odontologia, Universidad de Concepcion, Chile. esepulve@udec.cl']","['eng', 'spa']",['Journal Article'],,Spain,Med Oral,Medicina oral : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Medicina Oral y de la Academia Iberoamericana de Patologia y Medicina Bucal,9815821,IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Mouth Mucosa/*virology', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*virology', 'Simplexvirus/*isolation & purification']",2003/11/05 05:00,2004/01/16 05:00,['2003/11/05 05:00'],"['2003/11/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10488712 [pii]'],ppublish,Med Oral. 2003 Nov-Dec;8(5):329-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on this, we have investigated Semenogelin 1, a major protein of human semen coagulum thought to be highly specific to seminal vesicles, in leukemic cells. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Semenogelin 1 gene was frequently expressed in chronic myeloid leukemia (5 of 8, 62.5%) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (5 of 12, 41.7%) but rarely in multiple myeloma (2 of 30, 6.7%). The gene was not expressed in bone marrow or peripheral blood from healthy donors. Semenogelin 1 expression is normally confined to the testis, suggesting that it is a novel Cancer-Testis (CT) antigen. Translation of the mRNA to Semenogelin 1 protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis of tumor cell lysates and by immunocytochemistry. The recombinant Semenogelin 1 protein was used with a control Escherichia coli-derived recombinant protein in ELISA and Western blot analysis to show that high titer IgG antibodies against Semenogelin 1 were detected in some patients, suggesting the in vivo immunogenicity of the protein. Immune responses predicted gene expression by the leukemia cells. Semenogelin 1 was also frequently coexpressed with other CT antigens, Sperm protein 17 and SPAN-Xb. These results therefore indicate that Semenogelin 1 is a novel CT antigen capable of inducing B-cell responses in vivo in chronic leukemias.","['Zhang, Yana', 'Wang, Zhiqing', 'Liu, Haichao', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Lim, Seah H']","['Zhang Y', 'Wang Z', 'Liu H', 'Giles FJ', 'Lim SH']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Amarillo, Texas 79106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Seminal Vesicle Secretory Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology']",2003/11/05 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2003/11/05 05:00'],"['2003/11/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00002371-200311000-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother. 2003 Nov-Dec;26(6):461-7. doi: 10.1097/00002371-200311000-00001.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Seminal Vesicle Secretory Proteins)', '0 (seminal vesicle-specific antigen)']",,,,['R01 CA88434/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Although several studies have compared differences in cancer incidence between white and black children, few have examined cancer among Alaska Natives/American Indians. We know of no published article describing cancer incidence in AN children. We compared our findings with those of American Indian children of New Mexico and of Alaska white children. Data on mortality, survival, and prevalence are also included. Alaska Native is the term used collectively for the inhabitants whose ancestors occupied the area before European contact of what is now the state of Alaska. Alaska Natives include Eskimo, Indian, and Aleut groups. Although the 3 major groups differ in culture, language, and probably genetics, there are similarities in numerous social and economic indicators. The Northern Eskimo of Alaska (Inupiat) are related to Canadian and Greenland Inuit. Indians in Alaska include Athabaskan (in the interior of the state), who share commonalities with Canadian Athabaskan as well as with Navajo and Apache in the southwestern United States. Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian groups reside primarily in the southeast panhandle of the state. The panhandle Indian groups are similar to those of British Columbia. METHODS: Data on cancer incidence are from the Alaska Native Tumor Registry, 1969-1996. We studied children under age 20 to make our results comparable to national data as presented in the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Pediatric Monograph. Population data for AN are based on census data and Indian Health Service intercensal estimates. Data for US whites and New Mexico Indians are from the National Cancer Institute's SEER program. Calculations were made using SEERStat software. Data for Alaska whites are for the years 1996-2000. (The Alaska Cancer Registry has collected data for all Alaskans only since 1996). Odds ratios (ORs) of rates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: The rate among all AN children (both sexes) for all cancers combined is similar to that of US whites (OR: 1.0; 95% CI: 0.8-1.1). Examination of childhood cancer rates by ethnicity, however, reveal that rates are significantly lower for Indian (OR: 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4-0.8) but not significantly different for Eskimo or Aleut children. For most International Classification of Childhood Cancers groups, incidence rates for AN children are also similar to those of US whites. However, AN children are at significantly higher risk for hepatic tumors (OR: 13.1; 95% CI: 7.9-20.5), particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (OR: 43.8; 95% CI:24.4-75.1) and retinoblastoma (OR: 2.8; 95% CI: 1.3-5.3). By ethnic group, rates for hepatocellular carcinoma are significantly high only for Eskimo. Rates for all AN children are lower for neuroblastoma (OR: 0.1; 95% CI: 0.1-0.6) and lymphoma (OR: 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3-0.9), particularly Hodgkin's disease (OR: 0.2; 95% CI: 0.0-0.5). On the basis of 5 years of data, rates for Alaska white children do not seem to differ from those of US white children. Because of our findings of differences between AN and US whites, we reviewed data of other relevant populations, specifically American Indian data from the New Mexico SEER registry. Using SEER data and SEER software, we calculated rates for New Mexican American Indians (NMAI) and compared them with US white rates. Rates for all cancers combined among NMAI are significantly lower than for US white (OR: 0.8). However, similar to AN children, the rate among NMAI for retinoblastoma is higher compared with US whites (OR: 2.5; 95% CI:1.4-4.5). Similar to AN, NMAI also seem to be at low risk for neuroblastoma (OR: 0.2; 95% CI: 0.1-0.7), lymphoma as a group (OR: 0.1; 95% CI: 0.0-0.3), and, specifically, Hodgkin's disease (OR: 0.1; 95% CI: 0.0-0.4). Rates among NMAI children are low for central nervous system tumors (OR: 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3-0.7). The average annual age-adjusted cancer mortality rate among AN children is lower but not significantly lower than that of US white children (28.6 vs 37.3 per million). CONCLUSIONS: Comparison of AN rates for all cancers combined are similar to those of US and Alaska white children but seem higher than those of NMAI. Differences between AN and US whites exist for select International Classification of Childhood Cancers groups. The most striking rate differences are found in hepatic tumors, largely because of elevated rates of hepatitis B-associated hepatocellular carcinoma. All children in our study with hepatocellular carcinoma were hepatitis B antigen positive. A statewide hepatitis B virus immunization program was begun in late 1982. Although 16 children who were born before 1983 developed hepatocellular carcinoma, no children who were born in the 20 years since hepatitis B immunization was instituted among infants have received a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, a significant difference. Comparing AN and US white childhood cancer rates after removing hepatocellular carcinoma cases from both populations results in an OR of 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7-1.0). Thus, if no increase in other childhood cancers occurs in the coming generations, then rates for childhood cancer may soon be significantly lower than those in US white children. Rates are low for all lymphomas, largely because of very low rates of Hodgkin's disease. Rates are also low for neuroblastoma. It is reassuring that rates for AN children are not in excess and do not seem to be increasing. There is concern among the population regarding environmental exposure, including ionizing radiation. Our data do not show excess childhood leukemia or thyroid cancers, malignancies for which radiation is known to increase risk.","['Lanier, Anne P', 'Holck, Peter', 'Ehrsam Day, Gretchen', 'Key, Charles']","['Lanier AP', 'Holck P', 'Ehrsam Day G', 'Key C']","['Office of Alaska Native Health Research, Division of Community Health Services, Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, Anchorage, Alaska, USA. aplanier@anmc.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alaska/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Indians, North American', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Inuits', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/ethnology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Whites']",2003/11/05 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/11/05 05:00'],"['2003/11/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1542/peds.112.5.e396 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatrics. 2003 Nov;112(5):e396. doi: 10.1542/peds.112.5.e396.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the nature of the signal that couples store content to the opening of these Ca2+ channels is unclear. One model proposes that the Ca2+ channels are initially stored in cytoplasmic vesicles but inserted into the plasma membrane upon store depletion via a regulated exocytoytic mechanism (vesicular fusion model). Using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique to measure the store-operated Ca2+ current ICRAC and the capacitance method to monitor vesicular fusion, an indicator of exocytosis, we have investigated the effects of interfering with regulated exocytosis on the ability of ICRAC to activate. We find that the recombinant protein alpha-SNAP1-285, an inhibitor of exocytosis in many systems, suppresses such fusion but has no impact on the activation of ICRAC. A variety of other manoeuvres that interfere with vesicle trafficking and exocytosis were also without effect on ICRAC. Impairing constitutive exocytosis with brefeldin A reduced the extent of ICRAC, but this effect was less pronounced when current density was considered instead. Activation of ICRAC can therefore be clearly dissociated from an exocytotic mechanism, a finding that is not easily reconcilable with the vesicular fusion model.","['Bakowski, Daniel', 'Burgoyne, Robert D', 'Parekh, Anant B']","['Bakowski D', 'Burgoyne RD', 'Parekh AB']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signalling, Department of Physiology, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20031031,England,J Physiol,The Journal of physiology,0266262,IM,"['Animals', 'Brefeldin A/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/drug effects/*physiology', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Electric Capacitance', 'Ethylmaleimide/pharmacology', 'Exocytosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology/physiopathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/pharmacology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/pharmacology', 'Soluble N-Ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Factor Attachment Proteins', 'Tetanus Toxin/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', '*Vesicular Transport Proteins', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",2003/11/05 05:00,2004/09/24 05:00,['2003/11/05 05:00'],"['2003/11/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1113/jphysiol.2003.055335 [doi]', 'jphysiol.2003.055335 [pii]']",ppublish,J Physiol. 2003 Dec 1;553(Pt 2):387-93. doi: 10.1113/jphysiol.2003.055335.

In mice, CBFalpha regulates the expression of ELA2, suggesting a common link for both diseases. However, gene-targeted mouse models have failed to reproduce either human disease, thus prohibiting further in vivo studies in mice. Here we investigate CBFalpha regulation of the human ELA2 promoter, taking advantage of bone marrow obtained from patients with either illness. In particular, we have identified novel ELA2 promoter substitutions (-199 C to A) within a potential motif for lymphoid enhancer factor-1 (LEF-1), a transcriptional mediator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, in SCN patients. The LEF-1 motif lies adjacent to a potential CBFalpha binding site that is in a different position in human compared with mouse ELA2. We find that LEF-1 and CBFalpha co-activate ELA2 expression. In vitro, the high mobility group domain of LEF-1 interacts with the runt DNA binding and proline-, serine-, threonine-rich activation domains of CBFalpha. ELA2 transcript levels are up-regulated in bone marrow of an SCN patient with the -199 C to A substitution. Conversely, a mutation of the CBFalpha activation domain, found in a patient with familial platelet disorder with AML, fails to stimulate the ELA2 promoter in vitro, and bone marrow correspondingly demonstrates reduced ELA2 transcript. Observations in these complementary patients indicate that LEF-1 cooperates with CBFalpha to activate ELA2 in vivo and also suggest the possibility that up-regulating promoter mutations can contribute to SCN. Two hereditary AML predisposition syndromes may therefore intersect via LEF-1, potentially linking them to more generalized cancer mechanisms.","['Li, Feng-Qian', 'Person, Richard E', 'Takemaru, Ken-Ichi', 'Williams, Kayleen', 'Meade-White, Kimberly', 'Ozsahin, Ayse H', 'Gungor, Tayfun', 'Moon, Randall T', 'Horwitz, Marshall']","['Li FQ', 'Person RE', 'Takemaru K', 'Williams K', 'Meade-White K', 'Ozsahin AH', 'Gungor T', 'Moon RT', 'Horwitz M']","['Department of Medicine, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington 98195-7720, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20031031,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukocyte Elastase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Syndrome', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",2003/11/05 05:00,2004/04/24 05:00,['2003/11/05 05:00'],"['2003/11/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M310759200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)52658-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Jan 23;279(4):2873-84. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M310759200.

Hierarchical clustering methods used in this area do not provide unique partitioning of data. We describe an unsupervised dynamic hierarchical self-organizing approach, which suggests an appropriate number of clusters, to perform class discovery and marker gene identification in microarray data. In the process of class discovery, the proposed algorithm identifies corresponding sets of predictor genes that best distinguish one class from other classes. The approach integrates merits of hierarchical clustering with robustness against noise known from self-organizing approaches. RESULTS: The proposed algorithm applied to DNA microarray data sets of two types of cancers has demonstrated its ability to produce the most suitable number of clusters. Further, the corresponding marker genes identified through the unsupervised algorithm also have a strong biological relationship to the specific cancer class. The algorithm tested on leukemia microarray data, which contains three leukemia types, was able to determine three major and one minor cluster. Prediction models built for the four clusters indicate that the prediction strength for the smaller cluster is generally low, therefore labelled as uncertain cluster. Further analysis shows that the uncertain cluster can be subdivided further, and the subdivisions are related to two of the original clusters. Another test performed using colon cancer microarray data has automatically derived two clusters, which is consistent with the number of classes in data (cancerous and normal).

Due to some special features of gene expression data, several new methods have been proposed, including the weighted voting scheme of Golub et al., the compound covariate method of Hedenfalk et al. (originally proposed by Tukey), and the shrunken centroids method of Tibshirani et al. These methods look different and are more or less ad hoc. RESULTS: We point out a close connection of the three methods with a linear regression model. Casting the classification problem in the general framework of linear regression naturally leads to new alternatives, such as partial least squares (PLS) methods and penalized PLS (PPLS) methods. Using two real data sets, we show the competitive performance of our new methods when compared with the other three methods.","['Huang, Xiaohong', 'Pan, Wei']","['Huang X', 'Pan W']","['Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota, A460 Mayo Building (MMC 303), Minneapolis, MN 55455-0378, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Validation Study']",,England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Colonic Neoplasms/classification/genetics', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/genetics', 'Linear Models', '*Models, Genetic', '*Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms/*classification/*genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2003/11/05 05:00,2004/04/14 05:00,['2003/11/05 05:00'],"['2003/11/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/bioinformatics/btg283 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2003 Nov 1;19(16):2072-8. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btg283.,,,,,['R01-HL65462/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

PARP mediates the transfer of poly-ADP-ribose moieties on itself and other nuclear proteins by the breakdown of NAD+. The present study investigated how modulation of PARP activity interferes with cell death induced by two different alkylating agents used in cancer chemotherapy. 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidinium (MNNG) decreased cellular reduction capacity (WST-1 assay) in HL60 and CCRF-CEM cells, accompanied by increased activity of PARP and depletion of intracellular NAD+ and ATP. Pretreatment with the PARP inhibitors 3-AB or 4-AN resulted in transient cell protection, which was associated with a switch from necrosis to apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells and enhanced apoptosis in HL60 cells. Both PARP inhibitors delayed the drop in WST-1 reduction and retained NAD+ and ATP levels required for apoptosis. Furthermore, 3-AB or 4-AN prevented progressive DNA degradation in MNNG-treated CCRF-CEM cells. In contrast to MNNG, we did not observe early activation of PARP, decrease in WST-1 reduction, or wasteful consumption of NAD+ and ATP after treatment with melphalan. However, preincubation with 3-AB or 4-AN resulted in decreased HL60 cell membrane blebbing and reduced formation of apoptotic bodies. In conclusion, the cell death preventing effects of PARP inhibitors are mediated by their ability to maintain cellular energy metabolism, to inhibit the activation of endonucleolytic DNA degradation and to prevent cell blebbing. Surprisingly, these protective effects of PARP inhibitors on different cell functions seem to be independent of each other and are rather determined by the respective cytotoxic mechanisms implicated by different drugs. Our results support the hypothesis, that PARP activation and/or cleavage plays a regulatory role in the induction of apoptosis.","['Pogrebniak, A', 'Schemainda, I', 'Pelka-Fleischer, R', 'Nussler, V', 'Hasmann, M']","['Pogrebniak A', 'Schemainda I', 'Pelka-Fleischer R', 'Nussler V', 'Hasmann M']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Klinikum Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Eur J Med Res,European journal of medical research,9517857,IM,"['1-Naphthylamine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Alkylating Agents/*antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Melphalan/pharmacology', 'Methylnitronitrosoguanidine/pharmacology', 'NAD/metabolism', 'Naphthalimides', '*Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Quinolones/pharmacology']",2003/11/05 05:00,2004/06/24 05:00,['2003/11/05 05:00'],"['2003/11/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Med Res. 2003 Oct 22;8(10):438-50.,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Naphthalimides)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinolones)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '12H3O2UGSF (Methylnitronitrosoguanidine)', '1742-95-6 (4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide)', '8J365YF1YH (3-aminobenzamide)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9753I242R5 (1-Naphthylamine)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Severe treatment-induced cytopenia is observed in patients with malignant disorders who receive conventional intensive chemotherapy or autologous stem cell transplantation. The quantitative T cell defect can then be characterized by flow cytometric analysis of membrane molecule expression, whereas the functional status of the remaining T cell population is more difficult to evaluate. In the present study, we describe a standardized whole blood assay that requires small sample volumes and can be used for repeated analysis even in severely ill patients. The assay is based on the following strategy: (i) blood samples are diluted with the serum-free medium X-vivo 10, (ii) T cells are activated either with monoclonal immunoglobulin E (IgE) anti-CD3 or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28; (iii) T cell proliferation is assayed by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation after 4 days of in vitro culture. These proliferative responses are not affected by the plasma levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), sIL-2-R alpha, IL-7 and IL-15, and the kinetics of the response are not altered by the presence of exogenous cytokines. Detectable proliferation is observed for most patients with treatment-induced cytopenia.

Besides counting the percentage of CAM-positive cells, we decided to define clearly the antigen density (AgD) of the CAM on mobilized- and steady-state CD34(+) HPC using QIFIKIT calibration beads. Five sources of cells were compared: PB and BM from normal donors (nPB, nBM) cord blood (CB), mobilized PB obtained from leukapheresis products (LKP), and mobilized BM (mBM) samples. In our study the CAM-AgD was the lowest on CD34(+) cells in LKP which, on the contrary, contained the highest percentage of CD117(+), CD54(+), CD58(+) cell subsets. As for CB, a greater proportion of CD44(+) and CD62L(+) cells was observed in LKP than in other products. The LKP-CD34(+) cell population contained a greater percentage of CD11a(+) cells when compared to mBM, but the lowest percentage of CD49d(+) and CD49e(+) cells when compared to all products. The proportion of the CD34(+)CD38(-) immature subset expressing CD11a, CD44, CD54, or CD62L was greater in LKP than in mBM; the CD62L-AgD was higher in LKP than in mBM. This quantitative analysis clearly showed a downregulation of all CAM on LKP-CD34(+). The CD44, CD62L, CD11a, and CD54 AgD decrease appears to be specifically involved in the egress of the CD34(+) subsets into PB. The control of antigen density of these adhesion molecules is likely to be clinically important for effective mobilization of HPC as well as for rapid engraftment following HPC transplant.","['Sovalat, H', 'Racadot, E', 'Ojeda, M', 'Lewandowski, H', 'Chaboute, V', 'Henon, P']","['Sovalat H', 'Racadot E', 'Ojeda M', 'Lewandowski H', 'Chaboute V', 'Henon P']","['Institut de Recherche en Hematologie et Transfusion, Hopital du Hasenrain, Mulhouse, France. arht@newel.net']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Hematother Stem Cell Res,Journal of hematotherapy & stem cell research,100892915,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/*analysis', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*chemistry', 'Breast Neoplasms/blood/therapy', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*analysis', 'Cell Count', 'Drug Therapy', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*chemistry/cytology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*chemistry', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/therapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/therapy', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/blood/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/therapy']",2003/11/05 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2003/11/05 05:00'],"['2003/11/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/152581603322448187 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother Stem Cell Res. 2003 Oct;12(5):473-89. doi: 10.1089/152581603322448187.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Altered FLT3 signaling leads to antiapoptotic and proliferative signaling pathways. We recently showed that these mutations can also contribute to the differentiation arrest that characterizes leukemia. In this report we investigated the mechanism by which internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation of FLT3 signaling blocks differentiation. Normally, myeloid differentiation requires the induction of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) and PU.1 expression. Expression of both genes was repressed by FLT3/ITD signaling in 32Dcl3 (32D) cells and this repression was overcome by treatment with a FLT3 inhibitor, allowing differentiation to proceed. We also observed increased expression of C/EBPalpha and PU.1 accompanied by signs of differentiation in 2 of 3 primary AML samples from patients with FLT3/ITD mutations receiving a FLT3 inhibitor, CEP-701, as part of a clinical trial. Forced expression of C/EBPalpha was also able to overcome FLT3/ITD-mediated differentiation block, further proving the importance of C/EBPalpha in this process.","['Zheng, Rui', 'Friedman, Alan D', 'Levis, Mark', 'Li, Li', 'Weir, Edward G', 'Small, Donald']","['Zheng R', 'Friedman AD', 'Levis M', 'Li L', 'Weir EG', 'Small D']","['Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21231-1000, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20031030,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/biosynthesis', 'Up-Regulation', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2003/11/01 05:00,2004/04/21 05:00,['2003/11/01 05:00'],"['2003/11/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-06-1978 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50106-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Mar 1;103(5):1883-90. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-06-1978.

Here, we report the overexpression of IL-7R alpha that occurs in the early T-cell compartment from AKR/J mice, animals that are highly susceptible to the spontaneous development of thymoma. Increased IL-7R alpha was revealed by surface staining, and increased IL-7R alpha mRNA was documented by using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This resulted in increased survival of AKR/J early thymocytes, shown by the decreased frequency of TUNEL(+) (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate [dUTP]-fluorescein nick end labeling) cells. In an in vivo thymocyte repopulation model, AKR/J thymocytes had a selective advantage over healthy thymocytes. This advantage occurred at early stages of T-cell development.

Although leukemic cells from patients with ATL exhibit an intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies directed against CD25 (interleukin 2 receptor alpha [IL-2Ralpha] antibody) have been used as specific therapeutic agents. However, significant clinical results with these antibodies have been demonstrated only in chronic forms of ATL. In contrast to resting T cells, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-infected cells constitutively express high levels of surface transferrin receptor (TfR). Herein, we report the characterization of a new monoclonal antibody (mAb A24) directed against the human TfR and the evaluation of its capacity to block the proliferation of ATL cells ex vivo. We determined that A24 binds TfR with an equilibrium constant (K'd) of 2.7 nM and competes with transferrin for binding to TfR. A24 also inhibited [55Fe]-transferrin uptake in activated T cells and blocked T-cell proliferation. Moreover, A24 reduced and impaired TfR expression and recycling, respectively. Most important, we showed that A24 blocked the ex vivo proliferation of malignant T cells from both acute and chronic forms of ATL, through induction of programmed cell death.

There is evidence that this expanded B cell population has altered signaling, and resistance to apoptosis has been proposed as one mechanism of B cell expansion. In human and murine B cells, antigen binding initiates movement of the B cell receptor (BCR) into membrane microdomains enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol, termed lipid rafts. Lipid rafts include members of the Src-family kinases and exclude certain phosphatases. Inclusion of the BCR into lipid rafts plays an important role in regulation of early signaling events and subsequent antigen internalization. Viral proteins may also influence signaling events in lipid rafts. Here we demonstrate that the largely CD5(+) B cell population in PL cattle has different mobilization and internalization of the BCR when compared to the largely CD5-negative B cells in BLV-negative cattle. Unlike B cells from BLV-negative cattle, the BCR in B cells of BLV-infected, PL cattle resists movement into lipid rafts upon stimulation and is only weakly internalized. Expression of viral proteins as determined by detection of the BLV transmembrane (TM) envelope glycoprotein gp30 did not alter these events in cells from PL cattle. This exclusion of the BCR from lipid rafts may, in part, explain signaling differences seen between B cells of BLV-infected, PL, and BLV-negative cattle and the resistance to apoptosis speculated to contribute to persistent lymphocytosis.","['Hamilton, Valerie T', 'Stone, Diana M', 'Cantor, Glenn H']","['Hamilton VT', 'Stone DM', 'Cantor GH']","['Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology, Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99164-7040, USA.

Despite the fact that the very few markers that are lineage-specific are localized inside the cell (e.g. myeloperoxidase, lactoferrin, cytoplasmic CD3, cytoplasmic CD22), several investigators still shy away from including these essential test elements in their routine panels. Of course, the staining of intracellular antigens requires the added effort of determining optimal conditions. Published suggestions often need to be revised, and cell lines must be used as positive and negative controls. The same holds true for other new and exciting applications of flow cytometry, such as the monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) or the establishment of physiological assays (e.g. measuring the activity of drug-efflux pumps). The beauty of-and unfortunately for some, the problem with-multiparameter flow cytometry is that although immunophenotyping by flow cytometry has become a routine approach to the diagnosis of haematological malignancies it is a discipline that is still in development. New antibodies are continually being introduced and new diagnostic and prognostically relevant subtypes are being published in almost every issue of the major scientific journals. It is therefore very important for the flow cytometrist not only to strive for optimal performance of all tests employed but also to keep up with new knowledge and to incorporate it into the interpretation of routine specimens.

Given the astonishing pace of research in microarray technology, a key question for the haematopathologist is: will gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays replace immunophenotyping, or will these two technologies evolve together as complementary approaches to improve diagnosis and therapy?

Among many lineage- and differentiation-specific antigens, disease-specific antigens are increasingly recognized because of their specific prognostic or therapeutic relevance. Expression of the multidrug resistance proteins of the ABC transporter family is associated with a poor response to treatment and a grave clinical prognosis. Recently, attempts to reverse refractory disease by using P-glycoprotein inhibitors have been performed in acute myeloid leukaemia, so far without evidence of clinical benefit. Other new leads to use antigen expression as a way of designing tumour-specific therapy have resulted in imatinib and Flt3 inhibitors which target tyrosine kinases in the leukaemic cell. Clinical trials are underway to investigate the effect of these new agents.

Morphology forms the initial diagnosis of leukaemia, but generally is not sufficient to identify biologically and clinically relevant subsets within the main categories of leukaemia. Immunophenotyping precisely defines the lineage and stage of differentiation of malignantly transformed haematopoietic cells. This is usually sufficient for precise classification of mature lymphoid malignancies, although immunogenetic and (molecular) cytogenetic studies might be helpful to confirm the diagnosis of disseminated non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. However, certain categories of disease that are clearly defined by cytomorphology and immunophenotyping, particularly acute leukaemias, are still heterogeneous, mainly owing to different underlying leukaemogenic events. Immunophenotyping can reveal subgroups highly suggestive of certain chromosome aberrations but reliable identification of such aberrations requires cytogenetic or molecular studies. Such combined diagnostic information forms the basis of current WHO classification of tumours of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. This will be complemented in the near future with novel criteria revealed by microarray gene expression profiling. This chapter summarizes and comments on the currently used immunophenotypic classification systems of acute and chronic leukaemias and on the added value of molecular diagnostics.","['Szczepanski, Tomasz', 'van der Velden, Vincent H J', 'van Dongen, Jacques J M']","['Szczepanski T', 'van der Velden VH', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Dr Molewaterplein 50, 3015 GE, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

Several viral proteins act in concert to increase the responsiveness of T-cells to extracellular stimulation, modulate proapoptotic and antiapoptotic gene signals, enhance T-cell survival, and avoid immune recognition of the infected T-cells. The virus promotes T-cell proliferation by usurping several signaling pathways central to immune T-cell function. Viral proteins modulate the downstream effects of antigen stimulation and receptor-ligand interaction, suggesting that extracellular signals are important for HTLV-1 oncogenesis. Environmental factors such as chronic antigen stimulation are therefore important, as also suggested by epidemiological data. The ability of a given individual to respond to specific antigens is determined genetically. Thus, genetic and environmental factors, together with the virus, contribute to disease development. As in the case of other virus-associated cancers, HTLV-1-induced leukemia/lymphoma can be prevented by avoiding viral infection or by intervention during the asymptomatic phase with approaches able to interrupt the vicious cycle of virus-induced proliferation of a subset of T-cells. This review focuses on current knowledge of the mechanisms regulating HTLV-1 replication and the T-cell pathways that are usurped by viral proteins to induce and maintain clonal proliferation of infected T-cells in vitro.

The measured magnetic flux densities were compared with the reference values for this frequency range indicated in the European Union (EU) recommendations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The repeated measurements in incubators were made with a calibrated magnetometer EFA 300 in the frequency range of 5-30 kHz. Effective values of magnetic flux densities of ELF EMF were determined taking account of the reference values. RESULTS: The results of many repeated measurements showing the values of magnetic flux density in modern incubators with plastic supporting frame, were compared with those obtained in old type incubators with iron skeleton. A power frequency of 50 Hz was detected in the incubator and the ELF EMF values were by over two orders lower than the EU reference values. CONCLUSIONS: The paper emphasizes the need to take a special care of newborns kept in incubators even if only the sub-reference values are detected. The EU reference values are intended for the adult human population. A baby in an incubator has much smaller dimensions, higher electric conductivity and maybe trigger another mechanism of response to ELF EMF than that indicated in this paper.","['Cermakova, Eleonora']",['Cermakova E'],"['Department of Physics, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic. cermakova.e@fce.vutbr.cz']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Int J Occup Med Environ Health,International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,9437093,IM,"['Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'European Union', 'Humans', '*Incubators, Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Reference Values', 'Risk Factors']",2003/11/01 05:00,2003/12/10 05:00,['2003/11/01 05:00'],"['2003/11/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/11/01 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 2003;16(3):215-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adhesion molecules (AMs) on hematopoietic cells are involved in hematopoietic cells' homing. It may be possible to enhance CB CD34+ cells engraftment by increasing their expressions of AM. Twenty-three patients with childhood acute leukemia treated with unrelated CBT were studied. It was found that the time to neutrophil recovery correlated with CXCR4 and the time to platelet recovery correlated with both CD62L and CXCR4. Platelet microparticles (PMPs) carry some AMs such as aIIb b (CD41), P-selectin (CD62P), and CXCR4, CD34+ cells express platelet-binding antigens (CD162 and CD11b). It was found that AMs were increased dramatically on CD34+ cells surface in the presence of PMPs, and CD34+ cells covered with PMPs adhered better to human umbilical vein endothelial cells and fibronectin.

In all, 16 CLL patients responding to sequential chemo-immunotherapy entered the study. In 10, mobilization regimen consisted of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 5-10 microg/kg/die. Patients failing mobilization or not achieving the target of 2.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg underwent a second attempt using intermediate-dose (ID) Ara-C, 800 mg/m(2) every 12 h for six doses+G-CSF. PBPC collection after G-CSF alone was successful in two out of 10 patients. An adequate number of CD34+ cells were collected after ID Ara-C+G-CSF in eight patients failing the mobilization with G-CSF alone and in five out of six who did not receive G-CSF before. Greater yields of PBPCs were collected with Ara-C+G-CSF compared with G-CSF alone (13.8 vs 3.3). The extrahematologic toxicity was manageable.

The median overall survival (OS) was shorter in t-AML than in de novo AML (10 vs 15 months, P=0.0007). Favorable and unfavorable cytogenetics had a prognostic impact with respect to OS in both t-AML (P=0.001 and 0.0001) and de novo AML (P<0.0001 and <0.0001). To define the overall prognostic impact of cytogenetics and t-AML, a multivariate Cox's regression analysis was performed for OS with favorable cytogenetics, unfavorable cytogenetics, t-AML, age, and white blood cell (WBC) count as covariates. All parameters proved to be independently related to OS (P=0.001 for t-AML, P<0.0001 for all other parameters). Within patients with t-AML, there were significant correlations between OS and both unfavorable (P<0.0001) and favorable cytogenetics (P=0.001), while age and WBC count had no impact on OS. In conclusion, these data indicate that cytogenetics are an important prognostic parameter in t-AML.

We hypothesized that (i) tissue-committed stem cells circulate at a low level in the peripheral blood (PB) under normal steady-state conditions, maintaining a pool of stem cells in peripheral tissues, and their levels increase in PB during stress/tissue injury, and (ii) they could be chemoattracted to the BM where they find a supportive environment and that the SDF-1-CXCR4 axis plays a prominent role in the homing/retention of these cells to BM niches. We performed all experiments using freshly isolated cells to exclude the potential for 'transdifferentiation' of hematopoietic stem or mesenchymal cells associated with in vitro culture systems. We detected mRNA for various early markers for muscle (Myf-5, Myo-D), neural (GFAP, nestin) and liver (CK19, fetoprotein) cells in circulating (adherent cell-depleted) PB mononuclear cells (MNC) and increased levels of expression of these markers in PB after mobilization by G-CSF (as measured using real-time RT-PCR). Furthermore, SDF-1 chemotaxis combined with real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that (i) these early tissue-specific cells reside in normal murine BM, (ii) express CXCR4 on their surface and (iii) can be enriched (up to 60 x) after chemotaxis to an SDF-1 gradient. These cells were also highly enriched within purified populations of murine Sca-1(+) BM MNC as well as of human CD34(+)-, AC133(+)- and CXCR4-positive cells. We also found that the expression of mRNA for SDF-1 is upregulated in damaged heart, kidney and liver. Hence our data provide a new perspective on BM not only as a home for hematopoietic stem cells but also a 'hideout' for already differentiated CXCR4-positive tissue-committed stem/progenitor cells that follow an SDF-1 gradient, could be mobilized into PB, and subsequently take part in organ/tissue regeneration.","['Ratajczak, M Z', 'Kucia, M', 'Reca, R', 'Majka, M', 'Janowska-Wieczorek, A', 'Ratajczak, J']","['Ratajczak MZ', 'Kucia M', 'Reca R', 'Majka M', 'Janowska-Wieczorek A', 'Ratajczak J']","['Stem Cell Biology Program at James Graham Brown Cancer Center and Department of Medicine, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Biomarkers/analysis/blood', 'Blood Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/genetics/metabolism', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Keratins/genetics/metabolism', 'Liver/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Muscle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*metabolism', 'MyoD Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Myogenic Regulatory Factor 5', '*Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Nestin', 'Neurons/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism', '*Trans-Activators', 'alpha-Fetoproteins/genetics/metabolism']",2003/10/31 05:00,2004/02/11 05:00,['2003/10/31 05:00'],"['2003/10/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403184 [doi]', '2403184 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Jan;18(1):29-40. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403184.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (MYF5 protein, human)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Myf5 protein, mouse)', '0 (MyoD Protein)', '0 (Myogenic Regulatory Factor 5)', '0 (NES protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nes protein, mouse)', '0 (Nestin)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '68238-35-7 (Keratins)']",,,,['R01 HL61796-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Here we report the expression of IL-6, IL-6 receptor alpha (IL-6Ralpha), and gp130 in human esophageal carcinoma tissues. We further demonstrate that IL-6 protects an esophageal carcinoma cell line CE48T/VGH from apoptosis induced by staurosporine. IL-6 stimulation induced a rapid phosphorylation of gp130 and STAT3, and a dominant-negative STAT3 completely abolished the antiapoptotic effect. IL-6 also activated ERK 1/2 in CE48T/VGH cells. Inhibition of the ERK activation by PD98059 and transfection of a dominant-negative ERK2 completely blocked the protection of IL-6 against apoptosis. Thus, both STAT and MAP kinase pathways are responsible for the IL-6-delivered survival signal in human esophageal carcinoma cells. In contrast, PI3-K inhibitors only partially attenuated the effect of IL-6, suggesting that PI3-K does not play a major role in the antiapoptotic signal of IL-6 in our system. To investigate whether IL-6 could induce the production of antiapoptotic molecules, proteins of the Bcl-2 family were measured. While Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L,), and Bax were not affected, Mcl-1 was induced by IL-6 in human esophageal carcinoma cells.

Herein, we show for the first time that cell transformation induced by Bcr-Abl leads to increased expression and kinase activity of MEK kinase 1 (MEKK1), which acts upstream of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Inhibition of MEKK1 activity using a dominant-negative MEKK1 mutant (MEKK1km) diminished the ability of Bcr-Abl to protect cells from genotoxin-induced apoptosis, but had no effect on the proliferation of Bcr-Abl-transformed cells. Expression of MEKK1km also reduced NF-kappaB activation, and inhibited antiapoptotic c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 mRNA expression in response to the genotoxin. By contrast, neither JNK nor ERK activation was affected. These results indicate that MEKK1 is a downstream target of Bcr-Abl, and that the antiapoptotic effect of Bcr-Abl in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells is mediated via the MEKK1-NF-kappaB pathway.","['Nawata, Ryouhei', 'Yujiri, Toshiaki', 'Nakamura, Yukinori', 'Ariyoshi, Koichi', 'Takahashi, Toru', 'Sato, Yutaka', 'Oka, Yoshitomo', 'Tanizawa, Yukio']","['Nawata R', 'Yujiri T', 'Nakamura Y', 'Ariyoshi K', 'Takahashi T', 'Sato Y', 'Oka Y', 'Tanizawa Y']","['Department of Bio-Signal Analysis, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1-1 Minami Kogushi, Ube, Yamaguchi 755-8505, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Genes, abl/*physiology', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', '*MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*physiology', 'Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2003/10/31 05:00,2003/12/04 05:00,['2003/10/31 05:00'],"['2003/10/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206901 [doi]', '1206901 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Oct 30;22(49):7774-80. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206901.,"['0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Birc2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Birc3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (Map3k1 protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/U88908', 'GENBANK/U88909']",,,,,,

Previously, we mapped an EST with similarity to a protein tyrosine phosphatase to the minimally deleted region for all these neoplasms. The corresponding gene, DUSP16/MKP-7, was recently shown to code for a mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase, suggestive for a function as tumor suppressor. Overexpression of DUSP16 in BCR-ABL-transformed Rat-1 fibroblasts reduces their transforming capacity in vitro and in vivo via downregulation of BCR-ABL-induced JNK activation. A role for DUSP16 as a regulator of JNK signaling was further demonstrated via overexpression in Ba/F3 cells, which increased their antiapoptosis. However, no inactivating mutations could be detected in leukemia patients hemizygous for DUSP16, and the effect of hemizygosity on DUSP16 expression level could not be assessed due to the variability of DUSP16 transcript levels observed in leukaemia cell lines and in patients. Taken together, the functional data point to a context-dependent role for DUSP16 on cell transformation and apoptosis, reflecting the dual role of JNK, and therefore suggest that DUSP16 might be haploinsufficient for tumor suppression.","['Hoornaert, Inge', 'Marynen, Peter', 'Goris, Jozef', 'Sciot, Raf', 'Baens, Mathijs']","['Hoornaert I', 'Marynen P', 'Goris J', 'Sciot R', 'Baens M']","['Human Genome Laboratory, Department of Human Genetics, Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology (VIB), Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Herestraat 49, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Dual-Specificity Phosphatases', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics/*physiology', 'Rats', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2003/10/31 05:00,2003/12/04 05:00,['2003/10/31 05:00'],"['2003/10/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1207089 [doi]', '1207089 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Oct 30;22(49):7728-36. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207089.,"['EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (DUSP16 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Dual-Specificity Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By monovalently displaying human LIF on the surface of M13 phage and randomizing clusters of residues in regions predicted to be important for human LIFR binding, we have identified mutations, which lead to significant increases in affinity for binding to LIFR. Six libraries were constructed in which regions of 4-6 amino acids were randomized then panned against LIFR. Mutations identified in three distinct clusters, residues 53-57, 102-103, and 150-155, gave rise to proteins with significantly increased affinity for binding to both human and mouse LIFR. Combining the mutations for each of these regions further increased the affinity, such that the best mutants bound to human LIFR with >1000-fold higher affinity than wild-type human LIF. NMR analysis indicated that the mutations did not alter the overall structure of the molecule relative to the native protein, although some local changes occurred in the vicinity of the substituted residues. Despite increases in LIFR binding affinity, these mutants did not show any increase in activity as agonists of LIF-induced proliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing human LIFR and gp130 compared with wild-type LIF.

In some patients, resistance arises due to powerful selective pressure on rare cells that carry amplified copies of the BCR-ABL fusion oncogene or point mutations in the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase domain that affect binding of the drug to the oncoprotein. However, in a proportion of patients neither mechanism operates, and resistance appears to be a priori, existing prior to exposure to the drug. These mechanisms of imatinib resistance are poorly understood and may be heterogeneous. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have previously described such innate resistance to imatinib in subclones of a myeloid leukemia cell line, KCL22, in which imatinib exposure inhibits the activity of Bcr-Abl and yet fails to induce apoptosis. We describe here whole-genome expression analysis of imatinib-sensitive and -resistant cells derived from the original KCL22 line, using Affymetrix microarray analysis. RESULTS: We detected differential expression of 39 genes that correlate with the imatinib-resistant phenotype. The resistant cells overexpress several genes associated with the suppression of apoptosis or with conferral of a transformed phenotype. CONCLUSION: Amongst the differentially-expressed genes correlating with imatinib resistance, several suggest the activation of alternative pathway(s) that maintain viability and growth independently of Bcr-Abl kinase activity. Given the high rate of primary imatinib resistance in blast crisis, the potential of activating such alternative pathways appears to correlate with disease progression.","['Tipping, Alex J', 'Deininger, Michael W', 'Goldman, John M', 'Melo, Junia V']","['Tipping AJ', 'Deininger MW', 'Goldman JM', 'Melo JV']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2003/10/31 05:00,2003/12/12 05:00,['2003/10/31 05:00'],"['2003/10/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/31 05:00 [entrez]']",['S0301472X03002650 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Nov;31(11):1073-80.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MEL1 (at chromosome band 1p36.3) is thought to be transcriptionally activated as a result of juxtaposition to the RPN1 gene at 3q21. It is not known whether MEL1 expression is restricted to cases with this particular translocation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using real-time polymerase chain reaction, we measured MEL1 expression levels, normal bone marrow, and distinct blood cell fractions in 162 de novo AML patients. We also investigated the existence of an EVI1-like gene (EL1) by applying the same method. The existence of these transcripts was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. RESULTS: MEL1 expression was detected in 87% (141/162) of de novo AML patients. The EL1 transcript also was detected in the majority of the patients. EL1 expression levels highly correlated with MEL1 expression levels in AML cases. Variable MEL1/EL1 expression levels were observed. However, all the patients with favorable-risk karyotypes, i.e., with t(15;17), t(8;21), or inv(16), showed low MEL1/EL1 expression levels. Expression analysis of MEL1/EL1 compared with MDS1-EVI1/EVI1 in distinct normal marrow or blood cell fractions revealed that 1) all four gene products are expressed in CD34(+) progenitor cell fractions; 2) both MEL1 and EVI1 are turned down in neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages; while 3) MDS1-EVI1 and EL1 remain expressed in mature blood cell fractions.

The role of BAALC in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis is unknown.

RESULTS: Expression analyses of FACSorted cells revealed high BAALC transcript levels in CD34(+) bone marrow cells including CD34(+)/CD38(-), CD34(+)/CD33(+), as well as CD34(+)/CD19(+)/CD10(+), CD34(+)/CD7(+), and CD34(+)/CD71(+)/CD45(-) cell fractions. Expression was significantly lower in all CD34(-) fractions. In vitro differentiation of CD34(+) bone marrow cells showed downregulation of BAALC and CD34 transcripts as early as day 4 in suspension cultures supplemented with lineage-specific cytokines (G-CSF, M-CSF, or EPO). In cultures with only lineage-unspecific cytokines (IL-3, SCF, GM-CSF), BAALC transcripts persisted up to day 20, while CD34 transcripts disappeared earlier. These observations suggest that expression of BAALC is stage specific. CONCLUSIONS: BAALC expression is restricted to progenitor cells, and downregulation of BAALC occurs with cell differentiation.

In this study, we evaluated the possibility of generating and expanding in vitro CTL directed toward different types of either leukemia or myelodysplastic cells, using both HLA-matched and partially matched donors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven donor/recipient pairs were enrolled; donor-derived dendritic cells, pulsed with patient blast cells, were used to generate CTL. RESULTS: Anti-leukemia CTL lines were successfully obtained from 10 of 11 donors. After repeated rounds of stimulation, CTL lines showed, along with an increase in cytotoxic activity, a variable but continuous expansion of cultured cells. In order to increase the magnitude of CTL expansion, two anti-leukemia CTL lines were further stimulated using allogeneic feeder cells, anti-CD3, and low doses of interleukin-2 (IL-2). This stimulation gave rise to 150-fold to 270-fold expansion of the absolute number of cultured cells. Most cultures showed either absent or low reactivity of anti-leukemia CTL against patient non-leukemia cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen consecutive high-risk leukemia patients (age 9-41) underwent haploidentical BMT with G-CSF-primed marrow as stem cells without ex vivo T-cell depletion. Basiliximab, along with a combination of cyclosporine (CSA), methotrexate (MTX), and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), was used for GVHD prophylaxis. Immunophenotyping, limited-dilution assay, and colony-forming assays were used to measure the effect of basiliximab on the subsets of lymphocytes, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursors (CTLp), and hematopoietic cells. RESULTS: All patients established successful trilineage engraftment with full donor chimerism. No patients developed grade II-IV acute GVHD. Patients who survived more than 12 months and were free of relapse showed limited chronic skin GVHD. Ten of 13 patients are currently alive with a Karnofsky performance score of 100% at median follow-up of 17 months (range 12-24 months). Basiliximab significantly decreased alloreactive CTLp by 10-fold to 100-fold in limiting-dilution assays. It had no effect on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells as determined by in vitro colony-forming assays. CONCLUSION: The addition of basiliximab to CSA, MMF, and MTX as GVHD prophylaxis effectively reduced severe lethal GVHD in haploidentical BMT. It is possible to selectively eliminate or reduce the number of alloreactive T cells with anti-CD25 antibody, which results in prevention of or a reduction in the severity of GVHD.","['Chen, Hui-Ren', 'Ji, Shu-Quan', 'Wang, Heng-Xiang', 'Yan, Hong-Ming', 'Zhu, Ling', 'Liu, Jing', 'Xue, Mei', 'Xun, Chang-Qing']","['Chen HR', 'Ji SQ', 'Wang HX', 'Yan HM', 'Zhu L', 'Liu J', 'Xue M', 'Xun CQ']","['Research Institution Of Air Force Hematology PLA, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Basiliximab', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Recombinant Fusion Proteins']",2003/10/31 05:00,2003/12/12 05:00,['2003/10/31 05:00'],"['2003/10/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X03002285 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00228-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Nov;31(11):1019-25. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00228-5.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9927MT646M (Basiliximab)']",,,,['CA 1795/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Several lines of investigation demonstrated that many of the genes activated during early hematopoietic development are also expressed in the vascular endothelium. Gene-targeting studies using embryonic stem cells have identified Flk-1, SCL, and Runx-1 as important regulatory molecules that specify both hematopoietic and vascular outcomes. Although it was anticipated that the hemangioblast would be present only during the earliest stages of vascular development in the yolk sac, accumulating evidence now indicates that hematopoietic cells with hemangioblast activity persist into adulthood. In the adult, bone marrow-derived, circulating endothelial progenitors contribute to postnatal neovascularization and enhance vascular repair following ischemic injury. Highly purified populations of hematopoietic stem cells from humans and mice can differentiate into both blood cells and vascular tissue at the single cell level. These recent findings suggest that bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells or their progeny may contribute to the maintenance and repair of both the hematopoietic and the vascular systems during adult life.","['Bailey, Alexis S', 'Fleming, William H']","['Bailey AS', 'Fleming WH']","['BMT & Leukemia Program, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University,., Portland, Ore 97239, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/physiology']",2003/10/31 05:00,2003/12/12 05:00,['2003/10/31 05:00'],"['2003/10/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X03002558 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2003.07.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Nov;31(11):987-93. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2003.07.001.,,82,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of these discussions assume that DNA methylation, a major mediator of epigenetic information, is fairly immutable and uniform in adult cells and tissues. There is, however, growing evidence that DNA methylation changes subtly with age. Normal aging cells and tissues show a progressive loss of 5-methylcytosine content, primarily within DNA repeated sequences, but also in potential gene regulatory areas. In parallel, selected genes show progressive age-related increases in promoter methylation, which, once a critical methylation density is reached, have the potential to permanently silence gene expression. These changes are highly mosaic within a given tissue and introduce a high degree of epigenetic variability in aging cells. Such epigenetic phenomena could impact immune response through masking/unmasking potential tissue antigens as well as by modulating the differentiation and response of immune effector cells. The contribution of epigenetic changes to the altered immune function observed in aging humans deserves careful investigation.","['Issa, Jean-Pierre']",['Issa JP'],"['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas at M D Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77401, USA. jpissa@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,Clin Immunol,"Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)",100883537,IM,"['Aging/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Cell Division', '*DNA Methylation', 'Humans', 'Immune System/metabolism', 'Mosaicism']",2003/10/31 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/31 05:00'],"['2003/10/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1521661603002031 [pii]', '10.1016/s1521-6616(03)00203-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Immunol. 2003 Oct;109(1):103-8. doi: 10.1016/s1521-6616(03)00203-1.,,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since methylation and transcriptional status are inversely correlated, the hypermethylation of genes involved in cell-cycle control and apoptosis could have a pathogenetic role in the development of cancer. In particular, high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and secondary leukemias show a high prevalence of tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation. The progression of chronic myeloproliferative diseases and of myelodysplastic syndromes, as well as that of lymphoproliferative diseases, is associated with an increased methylation rate, pointing to a role for hypermethylation of critical promoter regions in the transformation to more aggressive phenotypes. In the same line, a significantly worse prognosis has been shown for patients with hypermethylation of several genes compared to that of patients with unmethylated genes. For these reasons, the use of irreversible DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, such as 5-azacytidine and Decitabine, appears to be a promising option for the treatment of MDS and acute myeloid leukemia. In clinical trials, Azacytidine results in a significantly higher response rate, improved quality of life, reduced risk of leukemic transformation, and improved survival compared to supportive care. Similarly, Decitabine showed favorable results, promising response rates, a good nonhematologic toxicity profile, and a trend for better survival compared to intensive chemotherapy, particularly in older patients. The synergistic effect of histone deacetylase inhibitors, including phenylbutyrate (PB), in reactivating silenced genes encouraged clinical studies on the combination of PB and demethylating agents in hematological diseases, characterized by p15 silencing. The sequential administration of a ""first generation"" demethylating agent and HDAC inhibitors gave preliminary evidence of a reduced methylation of target genes, as also described with Decitabine. Clinical trials are still ongoing, and preliminary data indicate for the first time that the natural history of MDS may be changed by a non-intensive treatment, characterized by an outstanding toxicity profile.","['Leone, Giuseppe', 'Voso, Maria Teresa', 'Teofili, Luciana', 'Lubbert, Michael']","['Leone G', 'Voso MT', 'Teofili L', 'Lubbert M']","['Institute of Hematology, Catholic University, Rome, Italy. gleone@rm.unicatt.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Clin Immunol,"Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)",100883537,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Cytidine/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism']",2003/10/31 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/31 05:00'],"['2003/10/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1521661603002079 [pii]', '10.1016/s1521-6616(03)00207-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Immunol. 2003 Oct;109(1):89-102. doi: 10.1016/s1521-6616(03)00207-9.,"['0 (Histones)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",117,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main epigenetic modification in humans is DNA methylation. Transformed cells undergo a dramatic change in their DNA methylation patterns: certain CpG islands located in the promoter regions of tumor-suppressor genes become hypermethylated and the contiguous gene rests silenced and this phenomenon occurs in an overall genomic environment of DNA hypomethylation. The profile of CpG island hypermethylation in hematologic malignancies is an epigenetic signature unique for each subtype of leukemia or lymphoma. Although the most widely studied genes are the cell-cycle inhibitors p15INK4b and p16INK4a (specially in AML and ALL), the list of methylation-repressed genes in these neoplasms is expanding very rapidly, including MGMT, RARB2, CRBP1, SOCS-1, CDH1, DAPK1, and others. A necessary cross-talk between genetic alterations and DNA methylation exists: certain chromosomal translocations may induce hypermethylation, such as the PML-RARa, or attract methylation, such as BCR-ABL, but DNA hypomethylation can be the culprit behind the genesis of certain abnormal recombination events. From a translational standpoint, hypermethylation can be used as a marker of recurrent disease or progression, for example, in MDS, or response to chemotherapy, such as MGMT methylation in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Furthermore, promising studies using DNA demethylating agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors are underway to awake these dormant tumor-suppressor genes for a better treatment of the patient with a hematologic malignancy.","['Esteller, Manel']",['Esteller M'],"['Cancer Epigenetics Laboratory, Spanish National Cancer Center (CNIO), Melchor Fernandez Almagro 3,28029 Madrid, Spain. mesteller@cnio.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Clin Immunol,"Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)",100883537,IM,"['CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genome, Human', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic']",2003/10/31 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/31 05:00'],"['2003/10/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1521661603002080 [pii]', '10.1016/s1521-6616(03)00208-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Immunol. 2003 Oct;109(1):80-8. doi: 10.1016/s1521-6616(03)00208-0.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",89,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given their central role in adaptive immunity, the genes encoding these peptide-presenting molecules are regulated in a tight fashion to meet with local requirements for an adequate immune response. In contrast to MHC class I gene products, which are expressed on almost all nucleated cells, constitutive expression of MHC class II molecules is found in specialized antigen presenting cells of the immune system only. Transcription of both MHC class I and class II genes can be induced by immune regulators and upon cell activation. Transcription of MHC class I genes is mediated by a set of conserved cis acting regulatory elements in their promoters. Of these regulatory elements, MHC class II promoters share the SXY-module. Essential for activation of MHC class II promoters is the class II transactivator (CIITA), which acts through protein/protein interactions with regulatory factors bound to the SXY module.

The drug is undergoing two phase II trials for the treatment of cytomegalovirus leukaemia (CML) in the US, one of which will assess the safety, response rate, duration of response, and survival of decitabine (injection) in combination with imatinib mesylate (oral). SuperGen initiated a phase II clinical study of decitabine in combination with imatinib mesylate in June 2003 that will be conducted under SuperGen's CRADA with the National Cancer Institute and will take place at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in the US. Approximately 80 patients with CML will be enrolled in the study. This followed on decitabine's orphan drug status for the same indication, which was granted by the US FDA in 2002. In addition, the European Commission has granted orphan drug status to decitabine for MDS treatment in February 2003. In March 2003, SuperGen announced that patient enrolment was completed for its open-label, phase III trial comparing decitabine with standard care therapy for treatment of advanced myelodysplastic syndrome, which was initiated in March 2001. The study will be conducted at 22 medical centres in the US and will enrol a total of 160 patients. A pivotal trial is also underway in Europe for the same indication and is aiming to enrol 220 patients. In addition, decitabine is undergoing phase II trials for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Canada and for prostate cancer in the US. In July 2003, SuperGen was issued a US patent relating to decitabine as part of a combination therapy with other anticancer agents to treat ovarian, breast, prostate, gastric, lung, pancreatic and colon cancers through the correction of DNA hypermethylation. SuperGen was issued a US patent (No. 6 191 119) in 2001 covering the use of decitabine in combination with rubitecan and antibiotic agents, including doxorubicin.",,,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Drugs R D,Drugs in R&D,100883647,IM,"['Anemia, Sickle Cell/drug therapy', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Decitabine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy']",2003/10/31 05:00,2004/04/13 05:00,['2003/10/31 05:00'],"['2003/10/31 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/31 05:00 [entrez]']","['464 [pii]', '10.2165/00126839-200304060-00004 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs R D. 2003;4(6):352-8. doi: 10.2165/00126839-200304060-00004.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",25,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors evaluated pulmonary complications in patients with CLL and identified prognostic variables that predict hospital mortality in these patients. METHODS: Clinical data were analyzed retrospectively from patients with CLL who required hospitalization for a respiratory illness at a tertiary care institution from January 1993 to December 2001. A logistic regression analysis with a backward elimination procedure was carried out to determine prognostic variables that predict hospital mortality. RESULTS: There were 110 patients who were admitted on 142 occasions with a pulmonary complication. The median age was 75 years (range, 43-97 years), and the male:female ratio was 1.7:1.0. Among 142 admissions, 68% were high risk according to the Rai criteria, 68% of patients admitted had received prior therapy for CLL, and 35% had received treatment within 3 months of admission. The most common pulmonary complications were pneumonias (75%), malignant pleural effusion/and or lung infiltrate due to CLL (9%), pulmonary leukostasis (4%), Richter transformation or nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (3%), and upper airway obstruction (2%). Forty-four of 110 patients (40%) died. In multivariate analysis, admission absolute neutrophil counts </= 0.5 x 10(9)/L (odds ratio, 4.6; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.3-16.6) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels >/= 20 mg/dL (odds ratio, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.1-8.3) were correlated significantly with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia was the major pulmonary complication in hospitalized patients with CLL.

This phenomenon is different from true clonal evolution in that the additional cytogenetic abnormality occurs in Ph-negative cells. METHODS: The authors analyzed their experience with 342 patients with CML in chronic phase treated with imatinib to investigate the frequency and significance of this event. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 16-35 months), 21 patients (6%; 95% confidence interval, 0.04, 0.09) developed 25 chromosomal abnormalities in Ph-negative cells. Thirteen (54%) of these abnormalities were seen in 2 or more metaphases. The median time from the start of treatment with imatinib to the appearance of the abnormalities was 6 months (range, 3-22 months). The most common cytogenetic abnormality detected was trisomy 8 (33%). Twenty of 21 patients (95%) achieved a major (Ph < 35%) cytogenetic response (complete cytogenetic response in 13-62%). After a median follow-up of 22 months (range, 4-33 months), all 21 patients were alive, 20 of them in chronic phase and in complete hematologic response.

To elucidate how extracellular Pi regulates cellular functions of pre-osteoblastic cells, we investigated the expression of type III sodium (Na)-dependent Pi transporters in rat bone marrow stromal cells and ROB-C26 pre-osteoblastic cells. The mRNA expression level of gibbon ape leukemia virus receptor (Glvr)-2 was increased by the addition of Pi in rat bone marrow stromal cells, but not in ROB-C26 or normal rat kidney (NRK) cells. In contrast, the level of Glvr-1 mRNA was not altered by the addition of extracellular Pi in these cells. The induction of Glvr-2 mRNA by Pi was inhibited in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX). Moreover, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) /extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway inhibitors; U0126 (1.4-diamino-2, 3-dicyano-1, 4-bis [2-amino-phenylthio] butadiene) and PD98059 (2'-Amino-3'-methoxyflavone) inhibited inducible Glvr-2 mRNA expression, but p38 MEK inhibitor SB203580 [4-(4'-fluorophenyl)-2-(4'-methyl-sulfinylphenyl)-5-(4'pyridyl) imidazole] did not inhibit the induction of Glvr-2 mRNA expression, suggesting that extracellular Pi regulates de novo protein synthesis and MEK/ERK activity in rat bone marrow stromal cells, and through these, induction of Glvr-2 mRNA. Although Pi also induced osteopontin mRNA expression in rat bone marrow stromal cells but not in ROB-C26 and NRK cells, changes in cell viability with the addition of Pi were similar in both cell types. These data indicate that extracellular Pi regulates Glvr-2 mRNA expression, provide insights into possible mechanisms whereby Pi may regulate protein phosphorylation, and suggest a potential role for the Pi transporter in rat bone marrow stromal cells.","['Wada, Keinoshin', 'Mizuno, Morimichi', 'Komori, Takahide', 'Tamura, Masato']","['Wada K', 'Mizuno M', 'Komori T', 'Tamura M']","['Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Department of Organ Therapeutics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cycloheximide/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/physiology', 'Osteopontin', 'Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sialoglycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/*metabolism']",2003/10/30 05:00,2004/01/21 05:00,['2003/10/30 05:00'],"['2003/10/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.10383 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2004 Jan;198(1):40-7. doi: 10.1002/jcp.10383.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Spp1 protein, rat)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

First clinical studies have been preformed in patients with recurrent chronic myelogenous leukemia. In these patients complete molecular remissions were induced that persist without further maintenance treatment. These results have been confirmed in larger multicenter studies in Europe and the USA. The best results were obtained in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML); repeated successes have been reported in relapsing acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes and multiple myeloma (MMY), and rare responses were reported for acute lymphoid leukemia. Contrary to animal experiments GVHD has been observed in human patients although to a lesser extent than expected in transplants not given immunosuppression. Secondly myelosuppression has been observed in patients treated with relapsing CML. In CML the incidence of GVHD could be reduced by depleting CD8+ T cells from the donor lymphocyte concentrate. Alternatively only small numbers of T lymphocytes can be transfused and in the case of failing responses, the numbers of donor lymphocytes may be increased. Results in recurrent AML have been improved by the use of low-dose cytosine arabinoside, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilized blood cells as compared to lymphocytes only. In MMY the response rate is higher than in AML, but the remissions are of limited duration in most patients. Several protocols have been designed to include preemptive donor lymphocyte transfusion in patients with a high relapse risk after transplantation. Problems remain to avoid chronic GVHD and to circumvent the immune escape mechanisms of leukemia.","['Kolb, Hans-Jochem', 'Schmid, Christoph', 'Chen, Xiao', 'Woiciechowski, Anja', 'Roskrow, Marie', 'Weber, Martin', 'Guenther, Wolfgang', 'Ledderose, Georg', 'Schleuning, Michael']","['Kolb HJ', 'Schmid C', 'Chen X', 'Woiciechowski A', 'Roskrow M', 'Weber M', 'Guenther W', 'Ledderose G', 'Schleuning M']","['Department of Medicine III, Klinikum University of Munich-Grosshadern, and GSF-National Research Center for Environment and Health, Munich, Germany. kolb@med3.med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,IM,"['Adoptive Transfer/*methods', 'Animals', 'Chimera', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocytes/immunology']",2003/10/30 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/30 05:00'],"['2003/10/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1159/000072460 [doi]', '72460 [pii]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2003;110(2-3):110-20. doi: 10.1159/000072460.,,88,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 S.

Chimeric gene for the promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RAR alpha) is the hallmark of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Specific gene silencing of an oncogene is desirable for the treatment of these diseases. We have previously constructed an allosterically controllable ribozyme (designated maxizyme) targeted for bcr-abl chimeric mRNA, whose cleavage activity is induced only in the presence of a specific RNA sequence of interest. It has been demonstrated recently that RNA interference induced by short hairpin-type RNAs provides a powerful method for sequence-specific gene silencing. Here we report that DNA vector-based maxizymes and short hairpin-type RNAs driven by the promoter of a human gene for tRNA(Val) specifically inhibit the expression of the chimeric gene for PML-RAR alpha both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings confirm the potential utility of maxizymes and shRNAs as therapeutic agents.","['Oshima, Keisuke', 'Kawasaki, Hiroaki', 'Soda, Yasushi', 'Tani, Kenzaburo', 'Asano, Shigetaka', 'Taira, Kazunari']","['Oshima K', 'Kawasaki H', 'Soda Y', 'Tani K', 'Asano S', 'Taira K']","['Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Silencing', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Catalytic/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Transfer, Val/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Transfection']",2003/10/30 05:00,2003/12/23 05:00,['2003/10/30 05:00'],"['2003/10/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/30 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Oct 15;63(20):6809-14.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Val)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The exposure values are derived by calculation from engineering and operational data about the power stations rather than from measurements. They are provided for each of 11 job categories for each year of operation of each power station represented in the cohort. The engineering data are used to determine the average magnetic fields in specified areas of work within the power station and then applied to information about the time spent in these areas by each of the job categories. The operational data are used to adjust the exposures for each year according to the power station output for the year. Earlier methods used measurements or the advice of panels of experts to provide exposure scores for a number of job categories across all power stations and years. Such methods were not able to distinguish exposures from different power facilities or during the different years of their operation. Measurement surveys at 10 power stations of the magnetic fields in the work areas gave confidence that the calculations were realistic. Exposure measurements on 215 workers at three power stations were compared in job groups with the exposures predicted by the method. The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.86 and the slope and intercept of the line of best fit were 0.87 and 0.07 microT respectively. The method gives a good prediction of measured exposure and is being used for studies of occupational exposure to magnetic fields and leukaemia, and of cardiovascular disease, and a reanalysis of brain cancer.","['Renew, D C', 'Cook, R F', 'Ball, M C']","['Renew DC', 'Cook RF', 'Ball MC']","['National Grid Transco plc. 1-3 Strand, London WC2N 5EH, UK.

To identify genetic aberrations associated with the development of MTX resistance in OS cells, in addition to the previously reported expression changes of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and reduced folate carrier (RFC) genes, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)-based techniques were used. The direct comparison between MTX-resistant variants of U-2OS or Saos-2 human OS cell lines with their respective parental cell lines by CGH on chromosomes revealed that development of MTX resistance was associated with gain of the chromosomal regions 5q12-q15 and 11q14-qter in U-2OS variants, and with gain of 8q22-qter in Saos-2 variants. Further analyses by CGH on microarrays demonstrated a progressively increasing gain of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene (11q23) in U-2OS MTX-resistant variants, which was also confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), in addition to gain of FGR (1p36), amplification/overexpression of DHFR, and slight decrease of RFC expression. In Saos-2 MTX-resistant variants, gain of MYC (8q24.12-q24.13) was detected, together with a remarkable decrease of RFC expression. Further analyses of DHFR, MLL, MYC, and RFC gene status in four additional human OS cell lines revealed that only gain of DHFR and MLL were associated with an inherent lower sensitivity to MTX. These data demonstrate that genetic analyses with complementary techniques are helpful for the identification of new candidate genes, which might be considered for an early identification of MTX unresponsive tumors.","['Hattinger, Claudia M', 'Reverter-Branchat, Gemma', 'Remondini, Daniel', 'Castellani, Gastone C', 'Benini, Stefania', 'Pasello, Michela', 'Manara, Maria C', 'Scotlandi, Katia', 'Picci, Piero', 'Serra, Massimo']","['Hattinger CM', 'Reverter-Branchat G', 'Remondini D', 'Castellani GC', 'Benini S', 'Pasello M', 'Manara MC', 'Scotlandi K', 'Picci P', 'Serra M']","['Laboratorio di Ricerca Oncologica, Istituti Ortopedici Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy. genetica.onc@ior.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bone Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Osteosarcoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Ploidies', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/10/30 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2003/10/30 05:00'],"['2003/10/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2003/10/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0171-9335(04)70319-2 [pii]', '10.1078/0171-9335-00336 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 2003 Sep;82(9):483-93. doi: 10.1078/0171-9335-00336.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The increase is about 5-fold after entry of cells into the stationary phase of growth, but much higher (25-fold) when reduction in growth accompanies cell differentiation. In the latter case, the enzyme increase is similar to that which can be induced in these cells by exogenous interferon (IFN). The increase in 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase was shown to be due to a spontaneous secretion of IFN by the cells themselves: it is completely abolished if antiserum to murine type I IFN is added to the culture medium. In attempts to isolate some of this spontaneously secreted IFN, we show that it is stable at pH 2, not neutralized by antiserum to type II IFN, and that it also differs from the known IFN species induced by Sendai virus in Friend cells. The major component of this spontaneously secreted IFN is 20,000 M(r) and differs from the corresponding virus-induced 20,000-M(r) IFN by its lower affinity for antiserum to type I IFN and its antigenic characterization as beta-murine IFN. The major component of the spontaneous IFN also exhibits a higher ratio of antigrowth to antiviral activity than the Sendai-induced IFNs. We suggest that Friend cells produce this specific type of IFN for the regulation of their growth and differentiation.","['Revel, M F', 'Kimchi, A']","['Revel MF', 'Kimchi A']","['Department of Virology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/*metabolism"", 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Interferons/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Weight', 'Sendai virus/metabolism']",1982/12/01 00:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['1982/12/01 00:00'],"['1982/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '1982/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.2.12.1472-1480.1982 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1982 Dec;2(12):1472-80. doi: 10.1128/mcb.2.12.1472-1480.1982.,"['9008-11-1 (Interferons)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)""]",,,,,,,,,PMC369956,,,,,

However, the necessity of assaying for all 3 pan B-cell markers (CD20, FMC7, and CD79b) by flow cytometry has not been definitively documented for CLL. METHODS: Qualitative patterns and semi-quantitative assessment of staining intensity for CD20, FMC7 and CD79b were performed in 70 cases with a current or prior diagnosis of CLL or CLL with increased prolymphocytes leukemia (CLL/PL). The concurrent morphology in 66 of 70 specimens was classified as typical CLL in 53 cases, CLL/PL in 10 cases, and large cell lymphoma in 3 cases. RESULTS: Forty percent of the cases varied from the characteristic immunophenotype by having moderate or bright staining of CD20 (36%), FMC7 (7%), and/or CD79b (18%). Discrepant qualitative staining patterns were found between FMC7 and CD20 (21%), CD20 and CD79b (15%), and CD79b and FMC7 (10%). Semiquantitative measurement of staining intensity showed little correlation between CD79b and CD20 or FMC7. Moderate correlation was seen between CD20 and FMC7. No correlation was observed between morphology and intensity of marker expression. CONCLUSIONS: Variable patterns and intensity of staining were seen for FMC7, CD20, and CD79b in this cohort of CLL samples. Dim or negative staining was most consistently seen for FMC7 (93% of specimens). Although FMC7 staining intensity was moderately correlated with CD20, CD79b intensity was poorly correlated with either CD20 or FMC7, and thus, may provide some independent information.","['Monaghan, Sara A', 'Peterson, LoAnn C', 'James, Cathy', 'Marszalek, Laura', 'Khoong, Adela', 'Bachta, Dina J', 'Karpus, William J', 'Goolsby, Charles L']","['Monaghan SA', 'Peterson LC', 'James C', 'Marszalek L', 'Khoong A', 'Bachta DJ', 'Karpus WJ', 'Goolsby CL']","['Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

We studied the intracellular expressions of interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in T-helper 1 cells (Th1 response) of B-CLL. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 21 healthy individuals and purified T cells from 21 early-stage and 15 late-stage B-CLL patients were activated with phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin. The Th1 cytoplasmic cytokines were evaluated in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The percentages of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells positive for IL-2 were significantly lower in B-CLL patients than in healthy individuals (P = 0.030 and 0.049, respectively). No significant differences in TNF-alpha or IFN-gamma intracellular expressions were found between patients and healthy individuals. TNF-alpha- and IFN-gamma-expressing CD8 T cells were disease stage dependent, being significantly higher in late-stage patients (P < 0.001 for both cytokines).

METHODS: Leukemic cells (cells) from the bone marrow of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 112) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 30) were cultured for 20 h in vitro. The level of apoptosis was detected by fluorescent microscopy after staining with acridine orange (AO) or by flow cytometry after staining using PI, JC-1, the APO-BRDU kit, or the AnnexinV-FITC kit. RESULTS: ALL cells were significantly more sensitive to spontaneous apoptosis versus AML cells, as was detected by all methods. The least sensitive technique was apoptosis detection by sub-G1-peak/PI-staining. No difference in the rate of apoptosis in cells was determined between T- and B-lineage ALL patients. In patients with B-lineage ALL, strong positive correlation existed between the level of cells with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (JC-1), chromatin condensation (AO), and externalization of phosphatidylserine (AnnexinV+PI+). The proportion of AnnexinV+PI- cells had no correlative link with any other apoptotic cell subpopulation.

The diagnostic category of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) can now be viewed as an amalgam of several different diseases that have distinct gene expression profiles, oncogenic mechanisms, and clinical outcomes. Other diagnostic categories such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have a single gene expression signature that distinguishes them from other lymphoid malignancies. Nevertheless, elevated expression of a single gene, ZAP-70, is characteristic of a more aggressive subtype of CLL that may require novel treatment approaches. In mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), a quantitative measurement of gene expression associated with tumor proliferation is a powerful predictor of survival. Ultimately, the molecular diagnosis of these malignancies will identify molecular pathways that can be exploited for therapy. For example, one of the gene expression subgroups of DLBCL, termed activated B-cell like DLBCL, is characterized by constitutive activation of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway, and interference with this pathway selectively kills these lymphoma cells. The full benefit of gene expression profiling can only be realized if we incorporate this technology into prospective clinical trials.","['Wiestner, Adrian', 'Staudt, Louis M']","['Wiestner A', 'Staudt LM']","['Metabolism Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,IM,"['Drug Delivery Systems', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques']",2003/10/29 05:00,2004/07/10 05:00,['2003/10/29 05:00'],"['2003/10/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['S003719630300194X [pii]', '10.1016/s0037-1963(03)00194-x [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2003 Oct;40(4):296-307. doi: 10.1016/s0037-1963(03)00194-x.,,80,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T-ALL's clinical features and the biological properties of the leukemia cells are not predictive of prognosis, and thus have not been useful for risk-specific adjustments in therapeutic intensity. Microarray gene expression analyses of T-cell leukemic lymphoblasts have not only improved our understanding of the biological heterogeneity of this disease but have revealed clinically relevant molecular subtypes. Five different multistep molecular pathways have been identified that lead to T-ALL, involving activation of different T-ALL oncogenes: (1) HOX11, (2) HOX11L2, (3) TAL1 plus LMO1/2, (4) LYL1 plus LMO2, and (5) MLL-ENL. Gene expression studies indicate activation of a subset of these genes-HOX11, TAL1, LYL1, LMO1, and LMO2-in a much larger fraction of T-ALL cases than those harboring activating chromosomal translocations. In many such cases, the abnormal expression of one or more of these oncogenes is biallelic, implicating upstream regulatory mechanisms. Among these molecular subtypes, overexpression of the HOX11 orphan homeobox gene occurs in approximately 5% to 10% of childhood and 30% of adult T-ALL cases. Patients with HOX11-positive lymphoblasts have an excellent prognosis when treated with modern combination chemotherapy, while cases at high risk of early failure are included largely in the TAL1- and LYL1-positive groups. Supervised learning approaches applied to microarray data have identified a group of genes whose expression is able to distinguish high-risk cases. Further analyses of gene expression signatures of T-ALL lymphoblasts are especially needed for patients treated on modern combination chemotherapy trials to clearly distinguish the 10% to 15% of patients who fail induction or relapse in the first year of treatment. These high-risk patients would be ideal candidates for more intensive therapies in first remission, such as myeloablative regimens with stem cell rescue. Based on the rapid pace of research in T-ALL, made possible in large part through microarray technology, deep analysis of molecular pathways should lead to new and much more specific targeted therapies.","['Ferrando, Adolfo A', 'Look, A Thomas']","['Ferrando AA', 'Look AT']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Oncogenes', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",2003/10/29 05:00,2004/07/10 05:00,['2003/10/29 05:00'],"['2003/10/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0037196303001951 [pii]', '10.1016/s0037-1963(03)00195-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2003 Oct;40(4):274-80. doi: 10.1016/s0037-1963(03)00195-1.,['0 (Transcription Factors)'],36,,,"['CA 59571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

The clinical and radiological findings, mostly nonspecific or inconclusive, seldom obviate the need for a kidney biopsy. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report 5 new cases of diffuse bilateral renal lymphoma diagnosed by percutaneous kidney biopsy, all presenting with acute renal failure (ARF) of unknown cause. Three cases showed an interstitial and 2 an intraglomerular/intravascular type of lymphomatous infiltration. All tumors were of B-cell lineage. Our cases add to 50 similar cases reported since 1980. Considering all 55 cases together, 39 (87%) of the 44 cases with interstitial and 5 of 11 (45%) of those with intraglomerular lymphoma presented with ARF. In contrast, 5 of 10 cases with intraglomerular but none with interstitial infiltration presented with nephrotic range proteinuria. All but 2 cases (95%) with ARF and interstitial lymphoma but none with ARF and intraglomerular lymphoma showed bilaterally enlarged kidneys. Signs of extrarenal lymphomatous involvement were detected in 24 cases (44%) at the time of kidney biopsy or shortly thereafter. However, in only 10 cases (18%), all with interstitial lymphoma, was a tumor suspected prior to biopsy, mainly based on radiographical evidence of enlarged kidneys. CONCLUSION: Both types of diffuse bilateral renal lymphoma may clinically mimic renal medical disease. ARF in interstitial and in intraglomerular lymphoma may be due to increased intrarenal pressure and intraglomerular obstruction, respectively. Percutaneous kidney biopsy provides the most expedient means of establishing the diagnosis. Differential diagnosis includes interstitial nephritis and proliferative glomerulonephritis.","['Tornroth, Tom', 'Heiro, Maija', 'Marcussen, Niels', 'Franssila, Kaarle']","['Tornroth T', 'Heiro M', 'Marcussen N', 'Franssila K']","['Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland. tom.tornroth@hus.fi']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Kidney Dis,American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,8110075,IM,"['Aged', 'Biopsy, Needle/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney/*pathology', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Ultrasonography, Interventional']",2003/10/29 05:00,2004/04/10 05:00,['2003/10/29 05:00'],"['2003/10/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0272638603010825 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ajkd.2003.08.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Kidney Dis. 2003 Nov;42(5):960-71. doi: 10.1016/j.ajkd.2003.08.004.,,64,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MM remains an incurable disease, with median survival rates of 4-6 years. Thus, newer treatments with good safety profiles are needed to improve the quality of responses, prolong progression, and increase overall survival. METHOD: The current state of the art regarding the role of ATO in the management of MM and the rationale for this consideration is reviewed. RESULTS: Preclinical evidence suggests that one of the mechanisms in which ATO exerts its antimyeloma effect is by immunologic mechanisms. One such mechanism appears to be achieved by a marked increase in lymphokine-activated killer (LAK)-mediated killing and up-modulation of CD38 and CD54, two molecules involved in cell-cell interactions. Two phase II trials have shown that the drug appears to be clinically effective. CONCLUSIONS: With the improved understanding of the interaction between the myeloma cell and its microenvironment as well as the cytokine support system, it does not appear than any particular agent will be able to control the disease permanently. In the clinical arena, the next generation of studies will be designed to combine different molecules to take advantage of non-overlapping toxicities and to compromise the extensive and redundant myeloma support system, thus controlling the disease in a chronic phase.","['Hussein, Mohamad A']",['Hussein MA'],"['Myeloma Research Program, Cleveland Clinic, OH 44195, USA. mah@runbox.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Cancer Control,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,9438457,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use']",2003/10/29 05:00,2004/02/20 05:00,['2003/10/29 05:00'],"['2003/10/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/107327480301000503 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Control. 2003 Sep-Oct;10(5):370-4. doi: 10.1177/107327480301000503.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",28,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 is the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia and lymphoma, an aggressive clonal malignancy of human CD4-bearing T lymphocytes. Infection with HTLV-2 has not been conclusively linked to lymphoproliferative disorders. We previously showed that human hematopoietic progenitor (CD34(+)) cells can be infected by HTLV-1 and that proviral sequences were maintained after differentiation of infected CD34(+) cells in vitro and in vivo. To investigate the role of the Tax oncoprotein of HTLV on hematopoiesis, bicistronic lentiviral vectors were constructed encoding the HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 tax genes (Tax1 and Tax2, respectively) and the green fluorescent protein marker gene. Human hematopoietic progenitor (CD34(+)) cells were infected with lentivirus vectors, and transduced cells were cultured in a semisolid medium permissive for the development of erythroid, myeloid, and primitive progenitor colonies. Tax1-transduced CD34(+) cells displayed a two- to fivefold reduction in the total number of hematopoietic clonogenic colonies that arose in vitro, in contrast to Tax2-transduced cells, which showed no perturbation of hematopoiesis. The ratio of colony types that developed from Tax1-transduced CD34(+) cells remained unaffected, suggesting that Tax1 inhibited the maturation of relatively early, uncommitted hematopoietic stem cells. Since previous reports have linked Tax1 expression with initiation of apoptosis, lentiviral vector-mediated transduction of Tax1 or Tax2 was investigated in CEM and Jurkat T-cell lines. Ectopic expression of either Tax1 or Tax2 failed to induce apoptosis in T-cell lines. These data demonstrate that Tax1 expression perturbs development and maturation of pluripotent hematopoietic progenitor cells, an activity that is not displayed by Tax2, and that the suppression of hematopoiesis is not attributable to induction of apoptosis. Since hematopoietic progenitor cells may serve as a latently infected reservoir for HTLV infection in vivo, the different abilities of HTLV-1 and -2 Tax to suppress hematopoiesis may play a role in the respective clinical outcomes after infection with HTLV-1 or -2.","['Tripp, Adam', 'Liu, Yingxian', 'Sieburg, Michelle', 'Montalbano, Joanne', 'Wrzesinski, Stephen', 'Feuer, Gerold']","['Tripp A', 'Liu Y', 'Sieburg M', 'Montalbano J', 'Wrzesinski S', 'Feuer G']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York 13210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Lineage', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2003/10/29 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/29 05:00'],"['2003/10/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.22.12152-12164.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Nov;77(22):12152-64. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.22.12152-12164.2003.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)']",,,,"['R01 RR014324/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '1R29 CA77567/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 RR14324/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC254283,,,,,

Isolation of G541R in multiple populations suggested it played a critical role in viral envelope function. Using a viral vector system, the observed effects of the G541R mutation within MuLV envelope proteins were pleiotropic and included effects on the regulation of SU-TM interactions and membrane fusion. G541R suppresses enhanced cell-cell fusion events attributable to the absence of the R-peptide yet does not adversely affect virus titers. The ability to suppress cell-cell fusion is dependent on the presence of the C terminus of the amphotropic 4070A SU protein. Within the wild-type 4070A envelope background, the mutation results in a decreased level of Env at the cell surface that is mirrored in the virion. The TM mutation alters recognition of the SU C terminus by a monoclonal antibody, suggestive of an altered conformation.

Proline-to-alanine mutations were introduced into either or both motifs of HTLV-1 to determine the effect on the release of HTLV-1 virus-like particles from 293T cells. The release of both single mutants was significantly reduced, whereas a double mutation in both motifs abolished the release of the HTLV-1 particles. Two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays showed that the HTLV-1 Gag polyprotein binds both Tsg101 and Nedd4 proteins. The interaction with HTLV-1 Gag required the central WW domain of Nedd4 and the ubiquitin enzyme variant (UEV) domain of Tsg101. We expressed various fragments of Nedd4 and Tsg101 proteins in 293T cells and tested for their ability to interfere with virion release mediated by the HTLV-1 Gag-Pro polyprotein. Fragments consisting of the N-terminal UEV domain of Tsg101 and the central WW and C-terminal Hect domains of Nedd4 protein all caused transdominant inhibition of HTLV-1 particle release. Similarly, inhibition of the proteasome significantly decreased HTLV-1 particle release. Furthermore, the WW domain overexpression caused an early arrest of HTLV-1 particle morphogenesis before the membrane is deformed into the typical half-shell structure.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively compared the characteristics of all patients with de novo AML diagnosed in the referral area of our university hospital between 1985 and 1994. RESULTS: Of a total of 170 AML patients, 45% were included in a phase III trial for the treatment of AML and 55% were treated outside a protocol. Another 45 patients were registered only at diagnosis but were treated elsewhere. Nonstudy patients differed significantly from patients included in clinical trials with respect to age and performance status at clinical presentation, comorbidity, and type of AML. The great majority of patients excluded from trial participation showed distinct exclusion criteria, such as advanced age and severe comorbidity. Study patients were treated significantly more often with curative intent and achieved better response and survival. Patients treated in an equivalent manner but outside a protocol showed no significant difference in survival compared with patients enrolled onto a trial. CONCLUSION: Study patients were not representative for the entire population of patients with AML; many patients were excluded from phase III trial participation for failure to meet stringent entry criteria. Therefore, results of phase III studies may not be extrapolated to all AML patients but should only be applied to patients who do not differ in substantial characteristics from the study population.","['Mengis, Catherine', 'Aebi, Stefan', 'Tobler, Andreas', 'Dahler, Werner', 'Fey, Martin F']","['Mengis C', 'Aebi S', 'Tobler A', 'Dahler W', 'Fey MF']","['Institute of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic/*standards', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Medical Records', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Selection', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Switzerland/epidemiology']",2003/10/29 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/29 05:00'],"['2003/10/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2003.03.186 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.03.186 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Nov 1;21(21):3933-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.03.186.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biologic factors, such as the mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable genes (VH, cytogenetics, CD38 expression, and some serum markers, have recently improved prognostic assessment in CLL. In this study, we analyzed the prognostic value of VH mutational status within the different stages of Binet's classification in 145 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our series consisted of 83 VH mutated (MT) and 62 VH unmutated (UM) patients. MT cases predominated within Binet's stage A (70%), whereas UM cases predominated among stages B and C (62%). RESULTS: Median overall survival (OS) was 84 months for UM patients and was not achieved for the MT group (70% 12-year survival, P <.0001). Concerning Binet's stage A, both median OS and progression-free survival were significantly shorter for UM patients when compared with those of MT patients (97 months v not achieved, P =.0017; and 42 v 156 months, P <.0001), which compared favorably with the classical A' and A"" substaging. The VH mutational profile could also segregate stage B and C patients into two groups with different survival patterns (median OS, 78 v 120 months for UM and MT patients, respectively; P =.002). CONCLUSION: The significant survival differences observed between the VH mutational groups, among stage A and stage B and C patients, indicate that Binet's classification and VH genes are independent prognostic variables and are most likely complementary.","['Vasconcelos, Yuri', 'Davi, Frederic', 'Levy, Vincent', 'Oppezzo, Pablo', 'Magnac, Christian', 'Michel, Ariane', 'Yamamoto, Mihoko', 'Pritsch, Otto', 'Merle-Beral, Helene', 'Maloum, Karim', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista, Florence', 'Dighiero, Guillaume']","['Vasconcelos Y', 'Davi F', 'Levy V', 'Oppezzo P', 'Magnac C', 'Michel A', 'Yamamoto M', 'Pritsch O', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Maloum K', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista F', 'Dighiero G']","['Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Brazil', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'France', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging/*methods', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Uruguay']",2003/10/29 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/29 05:00'],"['2003/10/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2003.02.134 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.02.134 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Nov 1;21(21):3928-32. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.02.134.,['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to examine the potential of apicidin to induce apoptosis in human Bcr-Abl-positive leukemia cells and to assess the mechanism of apicidin-induced apoptosis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Cells were exposed to various concentrations of apicidin for 2-72 h, after which the levels of apoptosis, histone acetylation, mitochondrial damage, caspase activation, and Bcr-Abl expression were assessed. RESULTS: Apicidin induced apoptosis in K562 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Similarly, apicidin notably induced the apoptosis in the primary leukemic blasts obtained from chronic myelogenous leukemia patients in blast crisis. The acetylated histone H4 levels increased in a concentration-dependent manner in the K562 cells. However, the timing of cell death caused by apicidin did not exactly correlate with the histone deacetylase inhibitory effect. The disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release into the cytosol, and the mitochondrial Bax translocation were notably demonstrated after the apicidin treatment. Apicidin induced the proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-9, -3, -8, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Pretreatment of the K562 cells with the caspase-3 inhibitor, DEVD-CHO, completely inhibited the apicidin-induced apoptosis, suggesting that apicidin-induced apoptosis was caspase-dependent. The Fas/Fas ligand death receptor pathway was not involved in the apicidin-mediated apoptosis in K562 cells. Pretreatment of the cells with the caspase-9 inhibitor LEHD-fmk abrogated the apicidin- induced cleavage of procaspase-3, -8, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. The p210 Bcr-Abl protein levels were notably decreased after the apicidin treatment, with near complete loss after 48 h. Reverse transcription-PCR assay demonstrated that the Bcr-Abl mRNA level was also remarkably decreased in a time-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that apicidin effectively induces the apoptosis of Bcr-Abl-positive leukemia cells through the activation of the mitochondrial pathway-dependent caspase cascades. The down-regulation of Bcr-Abl mRNA might also be one of the mechanisms implicated in the apicidin-mediated apoptosis in the K562 cells. This study provides the rationale to additionally investigate apicidin as a potential therapeutic agent for the drug-resistant Bcr-Abl-positive leukemia cells.","['Cheong, June-Won', 'Chong, So Young', 'Kim, Ji Yeon', 'Eom, Ju In', 'Jeung, Hoi Kyung', 'Maeng, Ho Young', 'Lee, Seung Tae', 'Min, Yoo Hong']","['Cheong JW', 'Chong SY', 'Kim JY', 'Eom JI', 'Jeung HK', 'Maeng HY', 'Lee ST', 'Min YH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 120-752, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Annexin A5/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Biological Transport', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coloring Agents/pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Peptides, Cyclic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2003/10/29 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2003/10/29 05:00'],"['2003/10/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2003/10/29 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Oct 15;9(13):5018-27.,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (apicidin)', '0 (aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartal)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is highly expressed in >85% of cancer cells and thus is a potential target for tumor vaccines. We therefore sought to identify promiscuous Th epitopes in hTERT, which can be presented by more than one MHC class II allele. Each of 10 peptides derived from hTERT that were predicted to bind to MHC class II molecules was found to be able to induce primary human T-cell responses in vitro. We then established CD4(+) T-cell clones specific for these peptides and found that only hTERT(766) (LTDLQPYMRQFVAHL)-specific CD4(+) Th cells were effective in recognizing naturally processed hTERT antigen. We further found that the naturally processed epitopes hTERT(766) and hTERT(672) (which was identified previously) were promiscuous and capable of inducing CD4(+) T-cell responses in the context of several commonly found HLA-DR alleles, including DR1, DR7, and DR15 for hTERT(672), and DR4, DR11, and DR15 for hTERT(766). We further demonstrated that immunization of humanized HLA-DR4 transgenic mice with hTERT(766) peptide elicited antigen-specific Th responses that can recognize the antigenic peptides derived from hTERT protein and various hTERT-positive tumors, such as breast cancer, melanoma, and leukemia. It was also shown that T-cell precursors specific for the naturally processed epitopes are part of the T-cell repertoires in healthy donors and prostate cancer patients. Thus, these promiscuous, naturally processed Th epitopes in hTERT could be used to develop improved cancer vaccines through the simultaneous stimulation of CTL and Th cells against a broad spectrum of hTERT-positive tumors.","['Schroers, Roland', 'Shen, Lei', 'Rollins, Lisa', 'Rooney, Cliona M', 'Slawin, Kevin', 'Sonderstrup, Grete', 'Huang, Xue F', 'Chen, Si-Yi']","['Schroers R', 'Shen L', 'Rollins L', 'Rooney CM', 'Slawin K', 'Sonderstrup G', 'Huang XF', 'Chen SY']","['Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry', 'Antigens', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Dendritic Cells/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitopes/chemistry', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Insecta', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Telomerase/*metabolism']",2003/10/29 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2003/10/29 05:00'],"['2003/10/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2003/10/29 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Oct 15;9(13):4743-55.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,"['AI48711/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA090427/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,['Clin Cancer Res. 2004 May 15;10(10):3576']

Imatinib mesylate has promising single-agent antileukemic activity in patients with advanced Ph(+) acute leukemias. It was the aim of this analysis to determine the incidence of, and risk factors associated with, meningeal leukemia during imatinib monotherapy. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed 107 consecutive patients with relapsed or refractory Ph(+) acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL; n = 65) or chronic myeloid leukemia blast crisis (n = 42) who were enrolled in successive Phase II trials of single-agent imatinib and who did not receive routine prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy. RESULTS: CNS leukemia developed in 13 of 107 patients (12%) and was associated primarily with a lymphoid or bilineage phenotype (12 of 78; 15%) and with imatinib refractory Ph(+) ALL (5 of 19; 26%). Meningeal leukemia did not occur among patients who received prior prophylactic cranial irradiation. The median survival with combined CNS and systemic disease was 108 days (range, 58-141), with no patient surviving long term. In contrast, two of three patients with exclusively meningeal leukemia achieved prolonged molecular remissions with intrathecal chemotherapy, cranial irradiation, and continued imatinib. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Ph(+) ALL are at considerable risk of meningeal leukemia during imatinib monotherapy and should routinely receive CNS prophylaxis. Although the prognosis with combined meningeal and systemic relapse is dismal, patients with an isolated meningeal relapse may still achieve sustained remissions. The optimal type of CNS-directed treatment and the extent of protection afforded by prophylactic cranial irradiation remain to be defined.","['Pfeifer, Heike', 'Wassmann, Barbara', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Komor, Martina', 'Scheuring, Urban', 'Bruck, Patrick', 'Binckebanck, Anja', 'Schleyer, Eberhard', 'Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Wolff, Thomas', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Leimer, Lothar', 'Gschaidmeier, Harald', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Ottmann, Oliver G']","['Pfeifer H', 'Wassmann B', 'Hofmann WK', 'Komor M', 'Scheuring U', 'Bruck P', 'Binckebanck A', 'Schleyer E', 'Gokbuget N', 'Wolff T', 'Lubbert M', 'Leimer L', 'Gschaidmeier H', 'Hoelzer D', 'Ottmann OG']","['Department of Hematology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitat, 60590 Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*diagnosis/secondary/therapy', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Phenotype', 'Piperazines/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/10/29 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2003/10/29 05:00'],"['2003/10/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2003/10/29 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Oct 15;9(13):4674-81.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The possible relationship between genetic alterations and morphologic variants and the clinical course of the disease, however, is not well known. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was used to detect chromosomal imbalances in eight patients diagnosed with T-PLL, including three cases of small-cell variant with an indolent clinical evolution.

The chromosomal regions most often underrepresented were 8p and 11q (75%), 13q (37%), and 6q, 7q, 16q, 17p, and 17q (25%). The number of chromosomal imbalances in the three small-cell variants was relatively similar to that of cases with typical morphology. Only gains of 6p and losses of 7q present in three and two cases, respectively, with typical morphology were not detected in any small-cell variant. CGH analysis revealed alterations in 15 chromosomal regions not detected by conventional cytogenetics. These results indicate that T-PLL carry a high number of chromosomal alterations that are not related to the morphologic variants or the clinical behavior of the disease.","['Costa, Dolors', 'Queralt, Rosa', 'Aymerich, Marta', 'Carrio, Ana', 'Rozman, Maria', 'Vallespi, Teresa', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Nomdedeu, Benet', 'Montserrat, Emili', 'Campo, Elias']","['Costa D', 'Queralt R', 'Aymerich M', 'Carrio A', 'Rozman M', 'Vallespi T', 'Colomer D', 'Nomdedeu B', 'Montserrat E', 'Campo E']","[""Hematopathology Unit, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Villarroel 170, University of Barcelona, 08036-Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. dcosta@clinic.ub.es""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Chromosomal Instability/*genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Skin/pathology']",2003/10/29 05:00,2003/12/04 05:00,['2003/10/29 05:00'],"['2003/10/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460803001614 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(03)00161-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2003 Nov;147(1):36-43. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(03)00161-4.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the effect of MGN-3 on death receptor-induced apoptosis in the human leukemic HUT 78 cell line. HUT 78 cells were pre-treated with MGN-3, and then were incubated with the agonistic antibody against death receptor (Fas, CD95). Apoptosis was determined by the propidium iodide technique using FACScan. Activation of caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9 was determined by flow cytometry. Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured with DIOC(6) dye using FACScan. Expression of CD95 and Bcl-2 were measured by flow cytometry. In a dose-dependent manner, MGN-3 enhanced anti-CD95 antibody-induced apoptosis. Increased cell death was correlated with increased depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased activation of caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9. MGN-3 treatment had no effect on the level of expression of CD95, but it caused down regulation of Bcl-2 expression. These results suggest that MGN-3 increases the susceptibility of cancer cells to undergo apoptosis mediated by death ligands, which may be relevant for anti-cancer activities.","['Ghoneum, Mamdooh', 'Gollapudi, Sastry']","['Ghoneum M', 'Gollapudi S']","['Department of Otolaryngology, Drew University of Medicine and Science, 1621 E. 120th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90059, USA. mghoneum@ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects/physiology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Xylans/*pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",2003/10/29 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/10/29 05:00'],"['2003/10/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0304383503004580 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(03)00458-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2003 Nov 10;201(1):41-9. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(03)00458-0.,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Xylans)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '0 (polysaccharide MGN3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In concert with human CREB, Tax recruits the human transcriptional coactivator and histone acetyltransferase p300/CBP to the HTLV-1 promoter. Here we investigate the structural features of the interaction between Tax and the KIX domain of p300/CBP. Circular dichroism spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shift perturbation mapping, and sedimentation equilibrium analysis show that KIX binds a Tax subdomain corresponding to residues 59-98 of Tax (called Tax(59-98)). Circular dichroism spectroscopy suggests that Tax(59-98) is intrinsically disordered (natively unfolded) in isolation and adopts an ordered conformation upon binding KIX. The interaction is disrupted by a single amino acid variation of Tax(59-98) in which leucine 68 is substituted with proline. Chemical shift perturbation mapping reveals that the Tax-binding surface of KIX is distinct from that utilized by CREB, and corresponds to the site of KIX that interacts with the human transcription factors c-Jun and mixed lineage leukemia protein (MLL). Sedimentation equilibrium analysis shows that Tax and the phosphorylated KID domain of CREB can simultaneously bind KIX to form a ternary 1:1:1 complex. The results provide a molecular description of the concerted recruitment of p300/CBP via the KIX domain by Tax and phosphorylated CREB during Tax-mediated gene expression.","['Vendel, Andrew C', 'McBryant, Steven J', 'Lumb, Kevin J']","['Vendel AC', 'McBryant SJ', 'Lumb KJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523-1870, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Circular Dichroism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism']",2003/10/29 05:00,2003/12/12 05:00,['2003/10/29 05:00'],"['2003/10/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi0353023 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2003 Nov 4;42(43):12481-7. doi: 10.1021/bi0353023.,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were included only if they had histologically confirmed SLL that also satisfied the immunophenotypic criteria of CD5/CD23 coexpression with negative CD10 and < 55% prolymphocytes. On the basis of an initial blind review of routinely stained slides from the FNA specimens, the authors defined four groups based on a consensus review diagnosis: Group 1: typical SLL; Group 2: low-grade SLL-AP; Group 3: high-grade SLL-AP; and Group 4: TLCL. Cytomorphologic features, including the proportion of intermediate-to-large cells with prominent nucleoli and intermediate-sized plasmacytoid lymphoid cells, increased numbers of mitotic figures, the presence of apoptotic bodies and necrosis, and a myxoid/dirty background, were considered features that indicated an accelerated phase. Specimens that had more than two grades of diagnostic discrepancy compared with the original reported diagnosis were reexamined using a Ki-67 immunostaining labeling index to reach a final review diagnosis. RESULTS: On the basis of the review diagnosis, the specimens were recategorized as follows: Group 1: 20 patients with typical SLL; Group 2: 13 patients with low-grade-SLL-AP; Group 3: 16 patients with high-grade SLL-AP; and Group 4: 10 patients with TLCL. The mean Ki-67 labeling index (%) was correlated with the morphologic progression of SLL as follows: Group 1: 11%; Group 2: 16%; Group 3: 34%; and Group 4: 48%. The follow-up by subsequent FNA or biopsy demonstrated large cell transformation in 25% of patients in Group 1, 25% of patients in Group 2, and 100% of patients in Group 3. Among the clinical parameters, increased value of serum beta2-microglobulin and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were found to be well correlated with the cytomorphologic progression of SLL/chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Aspirates from patients who had signs and symptoms clinically suspicious for SLL-AP demonstrated a spectrum of cytomorphologic features, ranging from low-grade SLL-AP and high-grade SLL-AP to TLCL. The results showed that the Ki-67 labeling index, as determined by immunohistochemical studies in FNA specimens, and the levels of serum beta2-microglobulin and LDH are valuable diagnostic adjuncts for recognizing a subset of patients with SLL-AP or SLL in transformation who may require more aggressive therapy.","['Shin, Hyung Ju C', 'Caraway, Nancy P', 'Katz, Ruth L']","['Shin HJ', 'Caraway NP', 'Katz RL']","['Department of Pathology, The University of Texas M.

ABCG2 expression occurs in a variety of normal tissues, and is relatively limited to primitive stem cells. ABCG2 expression is associated with the side population (SP) phenotype of Hoechst 33342 efflux. The substrate profile of ABCG2 includes the antineoplastic drugs primarily targeting topoisomerases, including anthracyclines and camptothecins. More recently, pheophorbide, a chlorophyll-breakdown product, and protoporhyrin IX have been described as ABCG2 substrates, perhaps indicating a physiologic role of cytoprotection of primitive cells. Also, mice lacking ABCG2 expression have no intrinsic stem cell defects, although there is a remarkable increase in toxicity with antineoplastic drugs that are ABCG2 substrates, and also a photosensitivity resembling protoporphyria. Like other members of the ABC family, such as MDR1 and MRP1, ABCG2 is expressed in a variety of malignancies. Despite numerous reports of ABCG2 expression in AML, there is little evidence that ABCG2 expression is correlated with an adverse clinical outcome. This review will focus on the potential usefulness of ABCG2 as a marker primitive stem cells and possible physiologic roles of ABCG2 in protection of primitive stem cell populations, and potential methods of overcoming ABCG2-associated drug resistance in anticancer therapy.","['Abbott, Brian L']",['Abbott BL'],"['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Colorado Health Science Center, Denver, CO, USA. abbottmd@StemCellTransplants.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Benzimidazoles/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Chemical', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Topoisomerase Inhibitors']",2003/10/28 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/28 05:00'],"['2003/10/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/28 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.714 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2003 Sep;21(3):115-30. doi: 10.1002/hon.714.,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Topoisomerase Inhibitors)', 'P976261J69 (bisbenzimide ethoxide trihydrochloride)']",83,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,

Of these, the HOXB4 homeoprotein protein is of particular interests as it promotes the expansion of mouse HSCs without inducing the development of leukemia. To eliminate any deleterious effects that might be associated with stable HOXB4 gene transfer into human cells, we took advantage of the ability of HOX proteins to passively translocate through cell membranes. Here we show that when cultured on stromal cells genetically engineered to secrete HOXB4, human long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs) and nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD-SCID) mouse repopulating cells (SRCs) were expanded by more than 20- and 2.5-fold, respectively, over their input numbers. This expansion was associated with enhanced stem cell repopulating capacity in vivo and maintenance of pluripotentiality. This method provides a basis for developing cell therapy strategies using expanded HSCs that are not genetically modified.","['Amsellem, Sophie', 'Pflumio, Francoise', 'Bardinet, Dominique', 'Izac, Brigitte', 'Charneau, Pierre', 'Romeo, Paul-Henri', 'Dubart-Kupperschmitt, Anne', 'Fichelson, Serge']","['Amsellem S', 'Pflumio F', 'Bardinet D', 'Izac B', 'Charneau P', 'Romeo PH', 'Dubart-Kupperschmitt A', 'Fichelson S']","[""Institut Cochin, Departement d'Hematologie, INSERM U567, CNRS UMR 8104, Universite Paris 5, Maternite Port-Royal, 123, Bd de Port-Royal, 75014 Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20031026,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2003/10/28 05:00,2004/01/08 05:00,['2003/10/28 05:00'],"['2003/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2003/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/10/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/nm953 [doi]', 'nm953 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2003 Nov;9(11):1423-7. doi: 10.1038/nm953.

There are no publications on the effect that MSCs have on cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells, effector cells vital for the graft-versus-leukemia effect. METHODS: Cytotoxic T cells were primed in mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) against irradiated stimulator lymphocytes, and irradiated third-party MSCs were added at different time points. The CTLs were collected, and their cytotoxic potential was analyzed in a chromium-release assay against the same stimulator cells as in the MLC. Purified NK cells were mixed with irradiated MSCs, and the lysis was measured in chromium-release assay against K562 target cells. RESULTS: We found that MSCs inhibited CTL-mediated lysis by 70% if added at the beginning of the 6-day MLC. The lysis was not affected on day 3 or in the cytotoxic phase. Furthermore, MSCs inhibited the formation of cytotoxic lymphocytes when the cells were separated in a transwell system, which indicates that the effect is mediated by a soluble factor. NK cell-mediated lysis of K562 cells was not inhibited by MSCs. MSCs did not induce proliferation of allogeneic lymphocytes, and they were not lysed by allogeneic CTLs or NK cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that MSCs escape recognition by CTLs and alloreactive NK cells, and inhibit the formation of cytotoxic T cells by secreting a soluble factor, but that they do not interfere with CTLs and NK cell lysis.","['Rasmusson, Ida', 'Ringden, Olle', 'Sundberg, Berit', 'Le Blanc, Katarina']","['Rasmusson I', 'Ringden O', 'Sundberg B', 'Le Blanc K']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.

Among the anticarcinogenic mechanisms that have been revealed for ITCs is the inhibition of cell proliferation. We report that exposure of cancer cells to either allyl-ITC (AITC), benzyl-ITC (BITC), or phenethyl-ITC (PEITC) for only 3 h was long enough for the inhibition of cell growth, based on a comparison of IC50 values; regardless of the origin of cancer cells; and even in drug-resistant cells that overexpressed multidrug resistance associated protein-1 (MRP-1) or P-glycoprotein-1 (Pgp-1). In contrast, the inhibitory effect of another ITC, sulforaphane (SF), on these cells was highly time dependent. The finding that some ITCs could inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells in a largely time-independent manner is significant because ITCs that enter the human body are rapidly cleared through urinary excretion. Using human promyelocytic leukemia HL60/S as model cells, and focusing on AITC and BITC, we found that these ITCs modulated multiple cellular targets involved in proliferation, including the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of multiple caspases, arrest of cell cycle progression, and induction of differentiation. Again, only a 3-h incubation of the cells with the ITCs was enough to exert their full effect on these targets. Taken together, our findings suggest that selected ITCs can rapidly initiate growth inhibition of cancer cells by simultaneously modulating multiple cellular targets, and their antiproliferative activity may be largely unaffected by their metabolism and disposition in vivo.","['Zhang, Yuesheng', 'Tang, Li', 'Gonzalez, Veronica']","['Zhang Y', 'Tang L', 'Gonzalez V']","['Arizona Cancer Center and Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA. yuesheng.zhang@roswellpark.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*biosynthesis', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokines, CC/*biosynthesis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Isothiocyanates/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/pathology', 'Models, Chemical', 'Time Factors']",2003/10/28 05:00,2004/06/03 05:00,['2003/10/28 05:00'],"['2003/10/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/28 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2003 Oct;2(10):1045-52.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '139568-96-0 (Ccl6 protein, mouse)']",,,,"['R01 CA080962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA80962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Tissue-specific expression of particular chemokines also influences tumor growth and metastasis. Here, the CC chemokine pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine (PARC)/CCL18 was measured in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Surprisingly, PARC immunoreactivity was consistently detected in plasma from healthy donors. After purification to homogeneity, the presence of intact PARC (1-69) and processed PARC (1-68) in normal human plasma was confirmed by sequence and mass spectrometry analysis. Furthermore, PARC serum levels were significantly increased in children with T-ALL and prepreB-ALL compared to control serum samples, whereas serum levels in AML and preB-ALL patients were not significantly different from controls. In contrast, the hemofiltrate CC chemokine-1 (HCC-1)/CCL14 was not found to be a biomarker in any of these patients' strata, whereas the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) was significantly decreased in AML and prepreB-ALL. Stimulated leukocytic cell lines or lymphoblasts from patients produced IL-8/CXCL8 or macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha/CCL3) but not PARC, not even after IL-4 or IL-10 treatment. However, PARC was produced by superantigen or IL-4 stimulated monocytes co-cultured with lymphocytes or lymphoblastic cells. Serum PARC levels thus constitute a novel leukemia marker, possibly reflecting tumor/host cell interactions in the circulation.","['Struyf, Sofie', 'Schutyser, Evemie', 'Gouwy, Mieke', 'Gijsbers, Klara', 'Proost, Paul', 'Benoit, Yves', 'Opdenakker, Ghislain', 'Van Damme, Jo', 'Laureys, Genevieve']","['Struyf S', 'Schutyser E', 'Gouwy M', 'Gijsbers K', 'Proost P', 'Benoit Y', 'Opdenakker G', 'Van Damme J', 'Laureys G']","['Laboratories of Molecular Immunology, Rega Institute, University of Leuven, Minderbroedersstraat 10, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokines, CC/*biosynthesis/*blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/blood']",2003/10/28 05:00,2003/12/06 05:00,['2003/10/28 05:00'],"['2003/10/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)63564-X [pii]', '10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63564-X [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2003 Nov;163(5):2065-75. doi: 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63564-X.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CCL18 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)']",,,,,,,,,PMC1892433,,,,,

In order to develop realistic and long-lasting therapeutic approaches for some skin disorders, gene transfer to these critical cells must be obtained. While efficient retroviral ex vivo targeting and transgene integration in human keratinocytes is tightly dependent on proliferation, transferring genetic information to quiescent cells in culture also presents advantages, including the possibility of targeting putative dormant epidermal stem cells. In the present study we compared the efficiency of transduction achieved with a third-generation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-based lentiviral vector to that obtained with a Moloney murine leukemia oncoretroviral vector (MLV) on proliferating and quiescent human keratinocytes growing in vitro in standard Rheinwald and Green cultures as well as in confluent organotypic cultures. Each viral vector contained the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a reporter gene. The lentiviral vector, but not the MLV vector, led to EGFP expression both in nondividing and proliferating epidermal cell populations in vitro. This feature was clearly evident when direct targeting of human keratinocytes, forming part of the epidermal component of an organotypic skin culture, was attempted. Keratinocytes modified by both MLV and the lentiviral vector allowed long-term regeneration of genetically engineered human skin on the backs of immunodeficient nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency disorders (NOD/SCID) mice. However, EGFP transgene expression in the context of the MLV (long-terminal repeat [LTR]-driven) or lentiviral vector (cytomegalovirus [CMV]-driven) demonstrated clear differences both in quantitative terms and in the in vivo localization pattern.","['Serrano, Fernando', 'Del Rio, Marcela', 'Larcher, Fernando', 'Garcia, Marta', 'Munoz, Evangelina', 'Escamez, Maria Jose', 'Munoz, Marta', 'Meana, Alvaro', 'Bernad, Antonio', 'Jorcano, Jose Luis']","['Serrano F', 'Del Rio M', 'Larcher F', 'Garcia M', 'Munoz E', 'Escamez MJ', 'Munoz M', 'Meana A', 'Bernad A', 'Jorcano JL']","['Department of Immunology and Oncology, Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia, 28040 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/*metabolism', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Mice', 'Regeneration', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', '*Transduction, Genetic']",2003/10/28 05:00,2004/06/24 05:00,['2003/10/28 05:00'],"['2003/10/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/28 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/104303403322495089 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2003 Nov 1;14(16):1579-85. doi: 10.1089/104303403322495089.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe an improved vector targeting method that does not depend on the use of a known cell-targeting ligand. It entails screening a library of constitutively produced retroviruses with random amino acid substitutions in the cell-targeting region of the envelope proteins for their ability to mediate gene delivery to a target cell. By screening such a library on the ras-transformed 143B human cell line, we have isolated an envelope protein that preferentially targets 143B cells and 293T cells expressing the SV40 T antigen via a novel, unidentified receptor. Furthermore, retroviruses expressing the library-derived envelope protein can be concentrated by centrifugation. This is the first demonstration of a novel concept in vector targeting: the selection of productive retroviral entry via an alternate receptor with modified cellular tropism in the absence of a known cell-targeting moiety. The method is, in principle, applicable even to cells that have not been well characterized, and therefore potentially suitable for targeting many diverse cell types.","['Bupp, Keith', 'Roth, Monica J']","['Bupp K', 'Roth MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, 675 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, NJ 08854-5635, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,IM,"['Cell Line', '*Gene Targeting', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics', 'Ligands', 'Peptide Library', 'Plasmids', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",2003/10/28 05:00,2004/06/24 05:00,['2003/10/28 05:00'],"['2003/10/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/28 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/104303403322495061 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2003 Nov 1;14(16):1557-64. doi: 10.1089/104303403322495061.,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,,,"['R01 CA 49932/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 DK 60197/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

For this it is important to enhance the transduction efficiency, and this can be achieved by various means, mainly technical development of transduction procedures and use of different vectors and vector pseudotypes. We analyzed the transduction efficiency of an HIV-1 vector encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a marker gene and pseudotyped with the envelopes of MLV-A, MLV-10A1, GaLV, RD114, and VSV for human primary T lymphocytes in comparison to an MLV vector pseudotyped with the same envelopes. Pseudotyping of the MLV vector with the envelopes of 10A1 and GaLV resulted in efficient transduction of preactivated human primary T lymphocytes (32.4% and 32.7% CD3+/GFP+ cells, respectively) while MLV-A (14.0%), RD114 (8.8%), and VSV (1.5%) envelopes were less efficient when using titrated vector stocks equilibrated to a multiplicity of infection of 1. In contrast, the HIV-1 vectors pseudotyped with these envelope proteins transduced preactivated T lymphocytes with similar efficiency (approx. 20% CD3+/GFP+ cells). Thereby, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte subpopulations were transduced at equivalent levels. The similar performance of the different HIV-1 vector pseudotypes may be due in part to the similar half-lives of the vector particles.

The cells studied included the human leukemia cell lines HL-60 (undifferentiated and differentiated into macrophage-like and polymorphonuclear-like cells), Jurkat and Raji, and thymocytes and macrophages from rat primary cultures. The oxidative burst was assessed by nitroblue tetrazolium reduction. AA increased the oxidative burst until an optimum AA concentration was reached and the burst decreased thereafter. In the leukemia cell lines, optimum concentration ranged from 200 to 400 microM (up to 16-fold), whereas in rat cells it varied from 10 to 20 microM. Initial rates of superoxide generation were high, decreasing steadily and ceasing about 2 h post-treatment. The continuous presence of AA was not needed to stimulate superoxide generation. It seems that the NADPH oxidase system participates in AA-stimulated superoxide production in these cells since the oxidative burst was stimulated by NADPH and inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide, diphenyleneiodonium and superoxide dismutase. Some of the effects of AA on the oxidative burst may be due to its detergent action. There apparently was no contribution of other superoxide-generating systems such as xanthine-xanthine oxidase, cytochromes p-450 and mitochondrial electron transport chain, as assessed by the use of inhibitors. Eicosanoids and nitric oxide also do not seem to interfere with the AA-stimulated oxidative burst since there was no systematic effect of cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase or nitric oxide synthase inhibitors, but lipid peroxides may play a role, as indicated by the inhibition of nitroblue tetrazolium reduction promoted by tocopherol.","['Pompeia, C', 'Cury-Boaventura, M F', 'Curi, R']","['Pompeia C', 'Cury-Boaventura MF', 'Curi R']","['National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD 21702, USA. pompeiac@ncifcrf.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20031022,Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Free Radical Scavengers/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Leukocytes/*drug effects/physiology', 'Male', 'NADPH Oxidases/pharmacology', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium', 'Rats', '*Respiratory Burst', 'Superoxide Dismutase/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2003/10/25 05:00,2004/02/03 05:00,['2003/10/25 05:00'],"['2003/10/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0100-879X2003001100013 [pii]', '10.1590/s0100-879x2003001100013 [doi]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2003 Nov;36(11):1549-60. doi: 10.1590/s0100-879x2003001100013.

A strong rationale exists for the use of retinoids in cancer treatment and chemoprevention based on preclinical, epidemiological, and early clinical findings. Despite the success of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA)-based differentiation therapy in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the broad promise of retinoids in the clinic has not yet been realized. In addition to the expected limited activity of any single therapeutic agent, translation of retinoid activities from the laboratory to the clinic has met with intrinsic or acquired retinoid resistance. Evidence suggests that solid tumors develop intrinsic resistance to retinoids during carcinogenesis. In contrast, relapse of APL is often associated with acquired resistance to retinoid maturation induction. This review discusses what is known about retinoid resistance mechanisms in cancer therapy and chemoprevention. Strategies to overcome this resistance will be discussed, including combination therapy with other differentiation-inducing, cytotoxic or chromatin-remodeling agents, as well as the use of receptor-selective and nonclassical retinoids. Opportunities exist in the post-genomic era to bypass resistance to classical retinoids by identifying target genes and associated pathways that directly mediate the antineoplastic effects of retinoids. In this regard, the retinoids are useful pharmacological tools to reveal important pathways targeted in cancer therapy and chemoprevention.","['Freemantle, Sarah J', 'Spinella, Michael J', 'Dmitrovsky, Ethan']","['Freemantle SJ', 'Spinella MJ', 'Dmitrovsky E']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH 03755, USA. sarah.freemantle@dartmouth.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoids/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2003/10/25 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/25 05:00'],"['2003/10/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206936 [doi]', '1206936 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Oct 20;22(47):7305-15. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206936.,"['0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",162,,,"['R01 CA062275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 87546/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 62275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 CA 75154-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

High levels of Pyst2-L mRNA were expressed in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral leukocytes from nine AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. BM from healthy individuals expressed very low levels of Pyst2-L. Whereas high levels of Pyst2-L mRNA and protein were detected in several leukemia cell lines, Pyst2-L mRNA was detected neither in 33/34 samples of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) nor in leukocyte fractions enriched with CD34+ cells. Certain solid tumor and lymphoblastoid cell lines expressed high levels of Pyst2-L mRNA. In view of the association of Pyst2-L to MAPK signaling cascades, we tested if cell activation, a process involving MAPK signaling, influences Pyst2-L expression. Indeed, activation of T cells and endothelial cells increased Pyst2-L in these cells. Furthermore, TPA, a known MAPK activator, induces the expression of both Pyst2-L mRNA as well as the Pyst2-L protein in leukemia cells. This induction was partially inhibited by PD098059, an Mek1/2-specific inhibitor. Based on the results of this and previous studies, we hypothesize that the high levels of Pyst2-L detected in the active state of AML and ALL diseases and in other types of cancer reflect an altered MAPK signaling pathway in such malignant processes. This alteration may be the result of a failed attempt to counter the constitutive activation of MAPK in transformed cells or alternatively, may represent the activated state of such cells.","['Levy-Nissenbaum, Orlev', 'Sagi-Assif, Orit', 'Kapon, Dina', 'Hantisteanu, Shay', 'Burg, Tamar', 'Raanani, Pia', 'Avigdor, Abraham', 'Ben-Bassat, Isaac', 'Witz, Isaac P']","['Levy-Nissenbaum O', 'Sagi-Assif O', 'Kapon D', 'Hantisteanu S', 'Burg T', 'Raanani P', 'Avigdor A', 'Ben-Bassat I', 'Witz IP']","['Department of Cell Research and Immunology, George S Wise Faculty of Life Sciences, Tel-Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dual-Specificity Phosphatases', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/pathology', 'Leukocytes/enzymology/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Up-Regulation']",2003/10/25 05:00,2003/12/06 05:00,['2003/10/25 05:00'],"['2003/10/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206971 [doi]', '1206971 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Oct 23;22(48):7649-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206971.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (DUSP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Dual-Specificity Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that OLIG2 abolishes complex formation between a transcriptional coactivator p300 and a transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which is activated by astrocytic differentiation-inducing cytokines, such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The enforced expression of OLIG2 in neuroepithelial cells inhibits the LIF-induced astrocytic differentiation. We also show that the OLIG2 protein in the nuclei of neural precursor cells disappears in accordance with astrocytic differentiation during culture with LIF. Together, these results reveal a novel molecular function of OLIG2 on the astrocyte development.

To investigate cell cycle effects of GC in the absence of obscuring apoptotic events, we used human CCRF-CEM leukemia cells protected from cell death by transgenic bcl-2. GC treatment arrested these cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle due to repression of cyclin D3 and c-myc. Cyclin E and Cdk2 protein levels remained high, but the kinase complex was inactive due to increased levels of bound p27(Kip1). Conditional expression of cyclin D3 and/or c-myc was sufficient to prevent GC-induced G1 arrest and p27(Kip1) accumulation but, importantly, did not interfere with the induction of apoptosis. The combined data suggest that repression of both, c-myc and cyclin D3, is necessary to arrest human leukemia cells in the G1 phase of the cell division cycle, but that neither one is required for GC-induced apoptosis.","['Ausserlechner, M J', 'Obexer, P', 'Bock, G', 'Geley, S', 'Kofler, R']","['Ausserlechner MJ', 'Obexer P', 'Bock G', 'Geley S', 'Kofler R']","['Institute of Pathophysiology, Division of Molecular Pathophysiology, University of Innsbruck, Medical School, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.

Using a cutoff level of 3.5 x 10(-4) leukemic cells pre-ASCT, 12 patients (39%) were stratified to MRD high-risk group and 19 (61%) into MRD low-risk group. During follow-up, all patients who were in the high-risk group relapsed at a median time of 7 months; in the low-risk group, five patients relapsed at a median time of 11 months and 14 remained in remission for 56 (range 7-80) months (P=0.00004).

A total of 150 clonal TCR and TAL1 gene rearrangements were identified in the 37 patients at diagnosis. In 65% of cases all rearrangements and in 27% of cases most rearrangements found at diagnosis were preserved at relapse. Two children with unusually late T-ALL recurrences displayed completely different TCR gene rearrangement sequences between diagnosis and relapse. This indicates that a proportion of very late T-ALL recurrences might represent second T-ALL. Specifically, 88% of clonal rearrangements identified at diagnosis in truly relapsed T-ALL were preserved at relapse. This is significantly higher as compared to previously studied precursor-B-ALL ( approximately 70%). Thus, from biological point of view, immunogenotype of T-ALL is more stable as compared with precursor-B-ALL. The overall stability of TCR gene rearrangements was higher in adult T-ALL (97%) than in childhood T-ALL (86%). Based on the stability of TCR gene rearrangements, we propose a strategy for PCR target selection (TCRD+TAL1 --> TCRB --> TCRG), which probably allows reliable minimal residual disease detection in all T-ALL patients.","['Szczepanski, T', 'van der Velden, V H J', 'Raff, T', 'Jacobs, D C H', 'van Wering, E R', 'Bruggemann, M', 'Kneba, M', 'van Dongen, J J M']","['Szczepanski T', 'van der Velden VH', 'Raff T', 'Jacobs DC', 'van Wering ER', 'Bruggemann M', 'Kneba M', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'Child', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Recurrence']",2003/10/25 05:00,2004/02/06 05:00,['2003/10/25 05:00'],"['2003/10/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403081 [doi]', '2403081 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Nov;17(11):2149-56. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403081.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Histological examination with appropriate immunostaining led to the diagnosis of specific cutaneous lesions of acute monoblastic leukemia. Several hemograms with peripheral blood smears were normal, bone marrow smear demonstrated an important blastic infiltration on one site and a discrete infiltration on another. Cutaneous lesions disappeared with chemotherapy. DISCUSSION: Specific cutaneous lesions may be isolated during acute leukemia, and called aleukemic leukemia cutis.

Multilevel models were used to assess the change in metabolites from baseline levels at subsequent follow-up. RESULTS: At 20 weeks, MR spectroscopy showed a significant reduction (P <.05) of mean N-acetylaspartate to choline ratio and increase in mean choline to creatine ratio (P <.05) in the children given high-dose methotrexate. This decline in N-acetylaspartate to choline ratio subsequently reversed and increased, possibly because of normal age-related brain maturation. Seventeen of 21 (81%) children showed metabolite changes at MR spectroscopy, while five of 22 (23%) showed white matter changes at MR imaging at 20 weeks. One more child developed white matter changes at 32 weeks. The associated changes resolved or reduced with time. CONCLUSION: MR spectroscopy demonstrated metabolite changes in the brain after high-dose methotrexate treatment in the absence of structural white matter abnormalities at MR imaging. MR spectroscopy might thus be a more sensitive method of monitoring the effects of high-dose methotrexate in the brain.","['Chu, Winnie C W', 'Chik, Ki-Wai', 'Chan, Yu-Leung', 'Yeung, David K W', 'Roebuck, Derek J', 'Howard, Robert G', 'Li, Chi-Kong', 'Metreweli, Constantine']","['Chu WC', 'Chik KW', 'Chan YL', 'Yeung DK', 'Roebuck DJ', 'Howard RG', 'Li CK', 'Metreweli C']","['Department of Diagnostic Radiology and Organ Imaging, Medical Physics Div, Chinese Univ of Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hosp, 30-32 Ngan Shing St, Shatin, Hong Kong SAR, China. winnie@med.cuhk.edu.hk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20031023,United States,Radiology,Radiology,0401260,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain/*pathology', '*Brain Chemistry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Longitudinal Studies', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', '*Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Prospective Studies']",2003/10/25 05:00,2004/01/13 05:00,['2003/10/25 05:00'],"['2003/10/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1148/radiol.2293021550 [doi]', '2293021550 [pii]']",ppublish,Radiology. 2003 Dec;229(3):659-69. doi: 10.1148/radiol.2293021550.

Results from overexpression of human and mouse 5T4 cDNA in cell lines are consistent with it having an influence on adhesion, shape and motility. We show that murine embryonic stem cell lines are 5T4 negative but that there is rapid up regulation of protein and transcripts upon differentiation, including derivatives of each primary germ layer, as evidenced by cell surface FACS, western and RT-PCR analyses. The kinetics of differentiation and 5T4 expression are closely correlated, with early events linking 5T4 expression to changes in motility and morphology. Comparison of 5T4 expression with other ES cell transcript (Oct 3/4; Rex-1) and antigen markers (Forsmann, SSEA-1) establishes 5T4 as a useful marker for the non-destructive detection of early differentiation of ES cells. For example, 'undifferentiated' ES phenotype defined as SSEA-1 positive and 5T4 negative is seven times more efficient at chimera formation than SSEA-1-positive/5T4-positive cells. Thus, 5T4 glycoprotein expression is associated with early differentiative events of ES cells involving altered motility, and it has useful practical consequences for assessing ES potency and studying similar processes in development and metastasis.","['Ward, Christopher M', 'Barrow, Katie', 'Woods, Andrew M', 'Stern, Peter L']","['Ward CM', 'Barrow K', 'Woods AM', 'Stern PL']","['Immunology Group, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Christie Hospital NHS Trust, Wilmslow Road, Manchester M20 4BX, UK. cward@picr.man.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Forssman Antigen/immunology', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Organic Cation Transport Proteins/metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Trophoblasts/cytology/metabolism']",2003/10/25 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2003/10/25 05:00'],"['2003/10/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2003/10/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1242/jcs.00767 [doi]', '116/22/4533 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2003 Nov 15;116(Pt 22):4533-42. doi: 10.1242/jcs.00767.,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Organic Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (solute carrier family 22 (organic cation transporter), member 3)', '0 (trophoblastic glycoprotein 5T4, human)', '9013-60-9 (Forssman Antigen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we investigated the AT islands in the FRA16B fragile site region for their possible roles in the organization of DNA on the nuclear matrix. The FRA16B AT island nominally spans approximately 3 kb of mostly >90% A/T DNA. In silico analysis indicates that this domain exhibits characteristics of nuclear matrix attachment regions (MARs): an exceptionally intense computed 'MAR potential' and profound duplex destabilization and flexibility. FRA16B repeats specifically bind to isolated nuclear matrices, which indicates their in vitro MAR function. This binding is several-fold greater than that of a known MAR in the c-myc gene. AT islands in fragile sites FRA16B and FRA16D are significantly more abundant in CEM cells that are hypersensitive to bizelesin compared to normal WI-38 cells. FRA16B overabundance in CEM is due to an approximately 10-fold expansion of FRA16B repeats. The expanded FRA16B minisatellites in CEM cells preferentially localize to the nuclear matrix-associated DNA indicating their in vivo MAR function. The unexpanded repeats in WI-38 cells localize to the loop DNA. The c-myc MAR is also matrix-associated in CEM cells while localizing to loop DNA in WI-38 cells. These results are the first to demonstrate that AT islands in fragile sites can function as MARs both in vitro and in vivo. The ability of FRA16B-mediated MAR sites to rearrange depending on the repeat expansion status could be relevant to both genomic instability of cancer cells and their sensitivity to AT-island targeting drugs.","['Jackson, Jennifer A', 'Trevino, Alex V', 'Herzig, Maryanne C', 'Herman, Terence S', 'Woynarowski, Jan M']","['Jackson JA', 'Trevino AV', 'Herzig MC', 'Herman TS', 'Woynarowski JM']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas Health Science Center, 14960 Omicron Drive, San Antonio, TX 78245, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,IM,"['AT Rich Sequence/*genetics', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Fragility/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/genetics', 'DNA/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Sequence, Unstable/*genetics', 'Duocarmycins', 'Genes, myc/genetics', 'Globins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Minisatellite Repeats/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Matrix/*metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Urea/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2003/10/25 05:00,2003/12/10 05:00,['2003/10/25 05:00'],"['2003/10/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/gkg832 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Nov 1;31(21):6354-64. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkg832.,"['0 (Duocarmycins)', '0 (Indoles)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'L0O9OBI87E (bizelesin)']",,,,,,,,['GENBANK/U78799'],PMC275474,,,,,

Transgenic mice overexpressing LIF in the developing pituitary have altered pituitary differentiation with expansion of corticotropes, maintenance of Rathke's cleft cysts, and suppression of all other pituitary cell types. Affymetrix GeneChips were used to identify modulators of LIF effects in corticotrope (AtT-20) and somatolactotrope (GH(3)) cells. In addition to genes known to respond to LIF in corticotrope cells [e.g. suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3), signal transducer and activator of transcription-3, SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-1, and proopiomelanocortin (POMC)], corticotrope-specific changes were also observed for genes involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, transcription factors, signaling molecules, and expressed sequence tags. Two transcription factors identified, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)-inducible factor (GIF), dose-dependently induced expression of the rat POMC promoter when overexpressed in AtT-20 cells. LIF further induced POMC transcription with C/EBPbeta, but not with GIF. C/EBPbeta also induced expression of the SOCS-3 promoter that was further enhanced by cotreatment with LIF. However, GIF did not affect SOCS-3 expression. These results indicate that C/EBPbeta and GIF are downstream effectors of LIF corticotrope action. LIF also stimulates the expression of inhibitors of its actions, such as SOCS-3 and SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-1. alpha(2)-HS-glycoprotein (AHSG)/fetuin, a secreted protein that antagonizes bone TGFbeta/bone morphogenic protein signaling, was induced by LIF in a signal transducer and activator of transcription-3-dependent fashion. Pretreatment with AHSG/fetuin blocked LIF-induced expression of the POMC promoter independently of SOCS-3. Thus, using GeneChips, C/EBPbeta and GIF have been identified as novel mediators and AHSG/fetuin as an inhibitor of LIF action in corticotropes.","['Abbud, Rula A', 'Kelleher, Robert', 'Melmed, Shlomo']","['Abbud RA', 'Kelleher R', 'Melmed S']","['Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20031023,United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,IM,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Blood Proteins/genetics/pharmacology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Glycolysis', 'Growth Hormone/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Pituitary Gland/chemistry/cytology/*metabolism', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin/*genetics', 'Prolactin/biosynthesis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Rats', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transfection', 'alpha-2-HS-Glycoprotein']",2003/10/25 05:00,2004/02/26 05:00,['2003/10/25 05:00'],"['2003/10/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1210/en.2003-0897 [doi]', 'en.2003-0897 [pii]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2004 Feb;145(2):867-80. doi: 10.1210/en.2003-0897.

Prior FLC use has been associated with an increasing incidence of invasive aspergillosis in these patients. We hypothesized that prior exposure of Aspergillus fumigatus to FLC could result in altered in vitro susceptibility of this fungus to other, more active triazoles. Thus, we performed serial passages of conidia of 10 clinical isolates of A. fumigatus (all itraconazole [ITC] susceptible) on FLC-containing yeast agar glucose plates. The MICs and minimal fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) of amphotericin B, FLC, ITC, and voriconazole (VRC) for A. fumigatus conidia were measured following four passages on FLC-containing medium according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards microdilution method. Serial passages on FLC-containing plates resulted in a fourfold increase in the MFCs (but not the MICs) of ITC for nine isolates. The attenuated ITC fungicidal activity against A. fumigatus following FLC preexposure was medium independent and was also observed against FLC-preexposed A. fumigatus hyphae with the viability staining FUN-1 dye. Moreover, FLC preexposure of A. fumigatus conidia resulted in an analogous increase in the MFCs (but not the MICs) of VRC. Our findings suggest that preexposure of A. fumigatus to FLC attenuates the in vitro fungicidal activity of subsequent ITC use against it. This phenotypic adaptation is not captured by a routine MIC determination but requires MFC measurement. The in vivo significance of this in vitro phenomenon requires further investigation.","['Liu, Wei', 'Lionakis, Michail S', 'Lewis, Russell E', 'Wiederhold, Nathan', 'May, Gregory S', 'Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P']","['Liu W', 'Lionakis MS', 'Lewis RE', 'Wiederhold N', 'May GS', 'Kontoyiannis DP']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas M.

Tumor-suppressor protein-death associated protein kinase and interferon regulatory factor 1 were overexpressed in LSCs, but not in normal HSC. Due to a predominantly G0 cell-cycle status, LSCs may not be responsive to conventional chemotherapeutic agents, compared with leukemia blasts. It is proposed that surviving LSCs are a major contributing factor to leukemic relapse. Although LSC population is likely to be drug-resistant, quiescent LSCs are preferentially susceptible to apoptosis induction while sparing normal HSC, with the appropriate stimulus such as proteasome inhibitor MG-132. This article reviewed the data emerging from the study of LSCs, and elucidated the distinct cellular and molecular characteristics of the LSC population, which may shed new light on AML therapy and leukemogenesis study.","['Cui, Jiu-Wei', 'Zhang, Xue-Min', 'Wang, Guan-Jun']","['Cui JW', 'Zhang XM', 'Wang GJ']","['Department of Hematology, the First Clinical Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,"['Cell Count', 'Cell Cycle', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis']",2003/10/25 05:00,2004/04/16 05:00,['2003/10/25 05:00'],"['2003/10/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2003)05-0549-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2003 Oct;11(5):549-52.,,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In conclusion, the expression of LRP mRNA can predict the treatment outcome and prognosis for acute myelocytic leukemia, prognosis was even worse in LRP and MRP linked expression cases, therefore, LRP was an important resistant factor, determination of LRP and MRP expression can help us to evaluate the prognosis and choose chemotherapy program.","['Chi, Zuo-Hua', 'Liu, Zhen', 'Sun, Chen', 'Zhao, Hong-Guo', 'Liu, Jin-Lan']","['Chi ZH', 'Liu Z', 'Sun C', 'Zhao HG', 'Liu JL']","['Institute of Hematology, Jinan University Medical College, Guangzhou 510630, China. chizuohua@hotmail.com']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/*genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles/*genetics']",2003/10/25 05:00,2004/04/16 05:00,['2003/10/25 05:00'],"['2003/10/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2003)05-0472-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2003 Oct;11(5):472-5.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that all samples typically presented many microspeckle signals throughout the nucleus before treatment. The redistribution occurred as early as on the second day after As4S4 treatment, which revealed loss of microspeckles with the presentation of a few large speckles. Anti-PML staining also emerged in the perinuclear cytoplasm. At last, microspeckles and large speckles all disappeared.

The lack of blast cells within cell suspension obtained for test may be the result of bone marrow disorder (aplastic anaemia, preleukaemic cytopenia) or technical pitfall. The changed expression of determinants on blastic cells observed as weak expression or overexpression or atypical combination of determinants requires a careful interpretation. In the diagnosis of rare types of acute leukaemia (e.g. erythroleukaemia, megakaryoblastic leukaemia, mixed lineage or undifferentiated leukaemia) the additional monoclonal antibodies beyond routine set are needed.

The problems of immunophenotyping in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are frequently associated with obtaining a representative material e.g. surgical tumour biopsy, lymph node.

Particularly, the assessment of early response to remission induction treatment has high prognostic value and enables more reliable definition of low-risk and high-risk patient groups. This forms the basis for treatment modification in new treatment protocols. The predictive value of MRD monitoring is particularly clear after first relapse. It enables recognition of low-risk patients with low MRD levels (probability of relapse-free survival (RFS) of 86%), whereas high MRD levels in high-risk patients are predictive of dismal outcome (probability of RFS of 0%).

Using an ES cell line transgenic for green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression under control of the Oct4 promoter, we were able to simultaneously track the responses of live Oct4-GFP-positive (ES) and -negative (differentiated) fractions to LIF, serum, and other growth factors. Our findings show that, in addition to inhibiting differentiation of undifferentiated cells, the administration of LIF resulted in a distinct dose-dependent survival and proliferation advantage, thus enabling the long-term propagation of undifferentiated cells. Competitive responses from the differentiated cell fraction could only be elicited upon addition of serum, fibroblast growth factor-4 (FGF-4), or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). The growth factors did not induce additional differentiation of ES cells, but rather they significantly improved the proliferation of already differentiated cells. Our analyses show that, by adjusting culture conditions, including the type and amount of growth factors or cytokines present, the frequency of media exchange, and the presence or absence of serum, we could selectively and specifically alter the survival, proliferation, and differentiation dynamics of the two subpopulations, and thus effectively control population outputs. Our findings therefore have important applications in engineering stem cell culture systems to predictably generate desired stem cells or their derivatives for various regenerative therapies.","['Viswanathan, Sowmya', 'Benatar, Tania', 'Mileikovsky, Maria', 'Lauffenburger, Douglas A', 'Nagy, Andras', 'Zandstra, Peter W']","['Viswanathan S', 'Benatar T', 'Mileikovsky M', 'Lauffenburger DA', 'Nagy A', 'Zandstra PW']","['Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, University of Toronto, Room 407, 4 Taddle Creek Road, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3G9, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tissue Engineering/*methods', '*Transcription Factors']",2003/10/24 05:00,2004/07/29 05:00,['2003/10/24 05:00'],"['2003/10/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bit.10799 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2003 Dec 5;84(5):505-17. doi: 10.1002/bit.10799.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Thus, LDE may be used as a vehicle for drugs directed against neoplastic cells. Indeed, we subsequently showed that when carmustine is associated with LDE the toxicity of the drug is significantly reduced in patients with advanced cancers. The aim of the present study was to verify whether LDE may be taken up by multiple myeloma cells and whether patients with multiple myeloma respond to treatment with LDE associated with carmustine. METHODS: A total of 131 consecutive volunteer patients with recently diagnosed multiple myeloma classified as clinical stage IIIA had their plasma lipid profile determined. LDE plasma kinetics were performed in 14 of them. Cell uptake of LDE and the cytotoxicity of carmustine associated with the emulsion were evaluated in a multiple myeloma cell line. A pharmacokinetic study of LDE-carmustine was performed in three patients. Finally, an exploratory clinical study of LDE-carmustine (carmustine dose 180 mg/m(2) body surface every 4 weeks) was performed in seven untreated multiple myeloma patients. RESULTS: LDL cholesterol was lower in the 131 multiple myeloma patients than in healthy controls and the fractional clearance rate (FCR, in units per minute) in the 14 multiple myeloma patients was twice that in 14 paired healthy control subjects. Moreover, entry of LDE into multiple myeloma cells was shown to be mediated by LDL receptors. Taken together, these findings indicate that LDE may target multiple myeloma. The exploratory clinical study showed that gammaglobulin decreased by 10-70% (mean 36%) after three cycles and by 25-75% (mean 44%) after six cycles. Furthermore, there was amelioration of symptoms in all patients. Cholesterol concentrations increased after treatment, suggesting that the treatment resulted in at least partial destruction of neoplastic cells with receptor upregulation. Side effects of the treatment were negligible. CONCLUSIONS: Because it targets multiple myeloma and, when associated with an antineoplastic agent, produces therapeutic responses in patients with fewer side effects, LDE has the potential for use as a drug vehicle in the treatment of the disease.","['Hungria, Vania T M', 'Latrilha, Maria C', 'Rodrigues, Debora G', 'Bydlowski, Sergio P', 'Chiattone, Carlos S', 'Maranhao, Raul C']","['Hungria VT', 'Latrilha MC', 'Rodrigues DG', 'Bydlowski SP', 'Chiattone CS', 'Maranhao RC']","['Hematology and Hemotherapy Section, Santa Casa Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20031022,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*administration & dosage/blood/therapeutic use', 'Carmustine/*administration & dosage/blood/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cholesterol/*administration & dosage/blood/metabolism', 'Drug Carriers/administration & dosage/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Emulsions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Lipids/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging']",2003/10/24 05:00,2004/02/05 05:00,['2003/10/24 05:00'],"['2003/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2003/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-003-0692-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2004 Jan;53(1):51-60. doi: 10.1007/s00280-003-0692-y.

Certain damage signals release Bmf, which then binds prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins and triggers apoptosis. Here, two novel isoforms of human Bmf, Bmf-II and Bmf-III, were identified and cloned from cDNA derived from B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells. Bmf-II and Bmf-III were characterized as two splice variants, lacking the BH3 domain but retaining the DLC2 binding domain. Bmf (here called Bmf-I) expression in HeLa cells induced apoptosis and reduced colony formation in contrast to Bmf-II and Bmf-III, which had no effect on apoptosis and instead increased colony formation. While bmf-I mRNA was expressed in many cell types, expression was higher in B lymphoid cells and bmf-II and bmf-III were mainly detected in B-CLL and normal B cells. bmf-I mRNA was upregulated in normal and leukemic B cells, while bmf-III mRNA was downregulated only in B-CLL cells by serum deprivation.

Since TEL-AML1 has been reported to induce cell cycle retardation and thus may influence somatic recombination, we analyzed 214 TEL-AML1-positive ALL by PCR for rearrangements of the immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes. As a control group, 174 childhood BCP ALL without a TEL-AML1 were used. The majority of TEL-AML1-positive leukemias had a higher number of Ig/TCR rearrangements than control ALL. They also had a more mature immunogenotype characterized by their high frequency of complete IGH, IGK-Kde, and TCRG rearrangements. While IGK-Kde and TCRG were more frequently rearranged on both alleles at higher age, IGH and TCRD rearrangements decreased in their incidence along with a decrease in biallelic IGH rearrangements. This suggests that the recombination process continues in these leukemias leading to ongoing rearrangements and possibly also deletions of antigen receptor genes. We here provide first evidence that somatic recombination of antigen receptor genes is affected by the TEL-AML1 fusion, and that further age-related differences are probably caused by the longer latency period of the prenatally initiated TEL-AML1-positive leukemias in older children.","['Hubner, S', 'Cazzaniga, G', 'Flohr, T', 'van der Velden, V H J', 'Konrad, M', 'Potschger, U', 'Basso, G', 'Schrappe, M', 'van Dongen, J J M', 'Bartram, C R', 'Biondi, A', 'Panzer-Grumayer, E R']","['Hubner S', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Flohr T', 'van der Velden VH', 'Konrad M', 'Potschger U', 'Basso G', 'Schrappe M', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Bartram CR', 'Biondi A', 'Panzer-Grumayer ER']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderspital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology']",2003/10/24 05:00,2004/02/11 05:00,['2003/10/24 05:00'],"['2003/10/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403182 [doi]', '2403182 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Jan;18(1):84-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403182.,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In asymptomatic carriers and HAM patients, HTLV-1 infection leads to a vigorous cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) response mainly directed to the regulatory Tax protein. In contrast, initial studies showed that anti-HTLV-1 CTL activities were not reproductively detected in ATLL patients, neither ex vivo, nor after in vitro restimulation. To better understand this discrepancy, we explored the anti-HTLV-1 CD8+ T-cell response of eight ATLL patients by using in vitro restimulated or freshly isolated CD8+ T cells. In all the ATLL patients, we found that mitogenic activation allowed the induction of CD8+ T cells able to lyse autologous HTLV-1-infected cells and/or to produce IFNgamma in response to Tax peptides. In contrast, only a minority of the patients possessed CD8+ cells able to respond ex vivo to the same epitopes. These findings indicate that although a restimulatable anti-HTLV-1 CTL activity persists during ATLL, the specific ex vivo response is not constantly maintained. This provides definitive evidence that the CD8+ T-cell response to HTLV-1 is affected by ATLL development and reveals that a major defect concerns the generation and/or the functionality of CD8+ effectors.","['Arnulf, B', 'Thorel, M', 'Poirot, Y', 'Tamouza, R', 'Boulanger, E', 'Jaccard, A', 'Oksenhendler, E', 'Hermine, O', 'Pique, C']","['Arnulf B', 'Thorel M', 'Poirot Y', 'Tamouza R', 'Boulanger E', 'Jaccard A', 'Oksenhendler E', 'Hermine O', 'Pique C']","[""Service d'Hematologie and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, UMR 8603, Hopital Necker, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromium/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/analysis', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/biosynthesis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/classification/*immunology/virology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",2003/10/24 05:00,2004/02/11 05:00,['2003/10/24 05:00'],"['2003/10/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403176 [doi]', '2403176 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Jan;18(1):126-32. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403176.,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0R0008Q3JB (Chromium)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High expression of VLA-4 is required for homing of HPC and HCC, whereas downregulation of these molecules is required for successful mobilization of HPC and HCC. Upregulation and activation of the SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling is required for homing of HPC and HCC, whereas disruption of the SDF-1 signaling is required for mobilization of HPC and HCC. Hence, mobilizations of HPC and HCC occur concurrently. It is proposed that drug resistance evolves as a result of repeated cycles of chemotherapy. Following each cycle of chemotherapy, HCC lose adhesion molecules and SDF-1 signaling. Surviving cells, released from tumor sites, circulate until re-expression of adhesion molecules and CXCR4 occurs, then homing to stroma of distal tissues occurs. Cytokines secreted by cells in the new microenvironment induce proliferation and drug resistance of HCC. This process is amplified in each cycle of chemotherapy resulting in disease progression. A novel model for treatment is proposed in which circulating HCC are the target for clinical intervention, and concurrent treatment with chemotherapy and antilineage-specific antibodies will result in abrogation of the 'vicious cycle' of conventional anticancer therapy.","['Gazitt, Y']",['Gazitt Y'],"['University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX 78284, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/physiology', 'Cell Movement/*physiology', 'Chemokines/physiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/metabolism/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', '*Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'Receptors, CXCR4/physiology', '*Signal Transduction']",2003/10/24 05:00,2004/02/11 05:00,['2003/10/24 05:00'],"['2003/10/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403173 [doi]', '2403173 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Jan;18(1):1-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403173.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",186,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alterations in nfkappab or ikappaB genes are documented in some hematologic neoplasias, while in others dysfunction in NF-kappaB/Rel-activating signaling pathways can be recognized. The prosurvival properties of NF-kappaB/Rel appear to rely on the induced expression of molecules (caspase inhibitors, Bcl2 protein family members, etc.), which interfere with the apoptosis pathway. Constitutive NF-kappaB/Rel activity in some hematologic malignancies could be advantageous for neoplastic clone expansion by counteracting stress stimuli (consumption of growth factors and metabolites) and immune system-triggered apoptosis; it is furthermore likely to play a central role in determining resistance to therapy. Based on this evidence, NF-kappaB/Rel-blocking approaches have been introduced in antineoplastic strategies. The identification of NF-kappaB/Rel target genes relevant for survival in specific neoplasias is required in order to address tailored therapies and avoid possible detrimental effects due to widespread NF-kappaB/Rel inhibition.

In this work, we have examined iNOS expression in normal B lymphocytes and B-CLL cells in pro- and antiapoptotic conditions. Our results demonstrate: (1) The existence of a new splice variant characterized by a complete deletion of exon 14 (iNOS 13-16(14del)), which was preferentially detected in normal B lymphocytes and may represent an isoform that could play a role in the regulation of enzyme activity. (2) The existence of another alternatively spliced iNOS mRNA transcript involving a partial deletion of the flavodoxin region (iNOS 13-16(neg)) was correlated to a decreased B-CLL cell viability. The 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoradenine or fludarabine (F-ara) treatment induced iNOS 13-16(neg) transcript variants, whereas IL-4 enhanced both the transcription of variants, including these exons (iNOS 13-16(pos)), and the expression of a 122 kDa iNOS protein. These results suggest that in B-CLL, a regulation process involving nitric oxide (.- NO) levels could occur by a post-transcriptional mechanism mediated by soluble factors.

Drug resistance mechanisms in infant ALL, however, remain unknown. Possibly, multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins like P-glycoprotein, MDR-associated protein (MRP1), lung resistance-related protein (LRP/MVP) and the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) play a role. Accordingly, we measured the mRNA levels of these proteins in infants (n=13) and non-infants (n=13) with ALL, using quantitative RT-PCR. Infants expressed 2.4-fold less BCRP mRNA (P=0.009) than non-infants with ALL. MDR1, MRP1 and LRP/MVP expression did not differ between both groups. MDR gene expression levels did not correlate to prednisolone, vincristine, daunorubicin or Ara-C cytotoxicity, except for BCRP expression, which correlated with resistance to Ara-C (Rs=0.53, P=0.012), suggesting that Ara-C might be a BCRP substrate. However, culturing patients ALL cells in the presence of the BCRP inhibitor Ko143 had no effect on Ara-C sensitivity. Inhibiting Bcrp1 in the Mdr1a-, Mdr1b- and Mrp1-deficient and Bcrp1-overexpressing mouse cell line Mef3.8/T6400, also did not modulate Ara-C cytotoxicity.

Intervening in aberrant signaling pathway provides a rational approach for in vivo targeting of AML cells. Constitutive NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity was observed in 16 of 22 (73%) investigated AML cases and was, in general, associated with resistance to spontaneous apoptosis. Indeed, inhibition of NF-kappaB activity by the NF-kappaB inhibitor SN-50 peptide resulted in enhanced chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. In the majority of cases, constitutive NF-kappaB activity was mediated by a Ras/PI3 kinase (PI3-K)/protein kinase B (PKB)-mediated pathway. The PI3-K inhibitor Ly294002 and the Ras inhibitor L-744832 both inhibited PKB phosphorylation and NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity. The constitutive activation of Ras GTP-ase was caused by mutations in the gene encoding for N-Ras in 29% of the cases. The constitutive NF-kappaB activity could so far not be ascribed to the autocrine production of growth factors or to mutations in the Flt3 receptor, since anti-GM-CSF, -IL-1, -IL6, -TNFalpha or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1296 did not affect the NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity. The present study demonstrates that Ras activation is an important pathway for triggering the NF-kappaB pathway in AML cells.","['Birkenkamp, K U', 'Geugien, M', 'Schepers, H', 'Westra, J', 'Lemmink, H H', 'Vellenga, E']","['Birkenkamp KU', 'Geugien M', 'Schepers H', 'Westra J', 'Lemmink HH', 'Vellenga E']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Growth Substances/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/genetics/*metabolism', 'Methionine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Protein p21(ras)/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2003/10/24 05:00,2004/02/11 05:00,['2003/10/24 05:00'],"['2003/10/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403145 [doi]', '2403145 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Jan;18(1):103-12. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403145.,"['0 (Chromones)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (L 744832)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Oncogene Protein p21(ras))']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, review of hereditary colorectal cancer case reports reveals occasional description of CALS on physical exam. METHODS: We describe the colonic and extracolonic phenotype in a family with CALS and early onset colorectal neoplasia (adenomas and/or cancer) and review 23 additional families reported in the literature. RESULTS: Among the 24 families, 32/59 (54.2%) individuals had colorectal adenomas diagnosed at a mean age of 15.7 +/- 1.1 (SE) years (range 5-38 years). The majority (24/32, 75.0%) of persons at first colorectal examination had oligopolyposis (< 100 polyps) versus polyposis (> or = 100 polyps). Forty-two of 59 (71.2%) individuals were affected with colorectal cancer, diagnosed at a mean age of 31.9 +/- 2.7 years (range 5-70 years). A brain tumor was found in 28/59 (47.5%) affected individuals (4 families with 2 or more cases) with an overall mean age of diagnosis of 16.5 +/- 1.2. Lymphoma and/or leukemia was found in 8/24 (33.3%) families (one family with 3 cases). Two families had mutation of the mismatch repair gene, hPMS2 (1 with homozygous germline mutation), while two carried homozygous germline mutations of another mismatch repair gene, hMLH1. CONCLUSIONS: Cafe-au-lait spots with early onset colorectal neoplasia may identify families with a variant of HNPCC characterized by oligopolyposis, glioblastoma at young age, and lymphoma. This variant may be caused by homozygous mutation of the mismatch repair genes, such as hPMS2 or hMLH1.","['Trimbath, J D', 'Petersen, G M', 'Erdman, S H', 'Ferre, M', 'Luce, M C', 'Giardiello, F M']","['Trimbath JD', 'Petersen GM', 'Erdman SH', 'Ferre M', 'Luce MC', 'Giardiello FM']","['Department of medicine, The John Hopkins Hereditary Colorectal Cancer Registry, 550 N.

Retrovirus vector expression was found to be similar in all phases of the cell cycle and, in contrast to some other virus promoters shown previously to be upregulated by G(2)/M arrest, Moloney murine leukaemia virus LTR-driven expression was upregulated neither by G(2)/M growth arrest nor by G(1)/S growth arrest. In contrast, cultures enriched for S phase cells produced more infectious virions, apparently by modulation of stages consequent to provirus expression. In terms of retrovirus transduction, limitations appear to be slow progression through the cell cycle and short half-life of the virus. Synchronization of cells prior to mitosis can increase transduction efficiency. Cell cycle modulation can be used to modify retrovirus vector production and transduction and can allow short transduction periods.","['Dolnikov, Alla', 'Wotherspoon, Simon', 'Millington, Michelle', 'Symonds, Geoff']","['Dolnikov A', 'Wotherspoon S', 'Millington M', 'Symonds G']","[""School of Physiology and Pharmacology, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia and Children's Cancer Institute, Randwick, Sydney, NSW 2031, Australia."", ""Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, St Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst, NSW 2010, Australia."", 'Johnson and Johnson Research Laboratories, The Australian Technology Park, Eveleigh, NSW 1430, Australia.', 'Department of Biotechnology, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2053, Australia.', ""School of Physiology and Pharmacology, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia and Children's Cancer Institute, Randwick, Sydney, NSW 2031, Australia."", ""Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, St Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst, NSW 2010, Australia."", ""Department of Medicine, St Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst, NSW 2010, Australia."", ""School of Physiology and Pharmacology, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia and Children's Cancer Institute, Randwick, Sydney, NSW 2031, Australia."", ""Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, St Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst, NSW 2010, Australia."", 'Johnson and Johnson Research Laboratories, The Australian Technology Park, Eveleigh, NSW 1430, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'G2 Phase', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Mitosis', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/*growth & development', '*Transduction, Genetic', '*Virus Cultivation', 'Virus Integration']",2003/10/24 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/24 05:00'],"['2003/10/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/vir.0.19099-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2003 Nov;84(Pt 11):3131-3141. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.19099-0.,,,,,,,,10.1099/vir.0.19099-0 [doi],,,,,,,

This epigenetic therapy counteracts the effects of nuclear corepressors, causing a DNA conformation that facilitates RA-induced gene transcription and cell differentiation. In an effort to improve delivery of each drug, we have synthesized retinoyloxymethyl butyrate (RN1), a mutual prodrug of both RA and butyric acid. RN1 targets both drugs to the same cells or cellular compartments to achieve differentiation at lower concentrations than using RA and NaB alone. In an RA-resistant cell line, which is not responsive to RA and NaB given together at the same concentration, RN1 inhibited growth substantially. This growth inhibition is caused by an increase in apoptosis and a minimal induction of differentiation, rather than the more complete granulocytic differentiation as seen in the RA-sensitive cell line. The different phenotypes induced by RN1 in RA-sensitive versus RA-resistant cells are reflected by altered patterns of gene expression. In addition to acute promyelocytic leukemia cells, RN1 induces apoptosis of other RA-resistant leukemic cell lines with blocked transcriptional pathways, but not normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RN1, therefore, is a novel retinoid that may be more widely active in hematologic malignancies than RA alone.","['Mann, Koren K', 'Rephaeli, Ada', 'Colosimo, April L', 'Diaz, Zuanel', 'Nudelman, Abraham', 'Levovich, Inesa', 'Jing, Yongkui', 'Waxman, Samuel', 'Miller, Wilson H Jr']","['Mann KK', 'Rephaeli A', 'Colosimo AL', 'Diaz Z', 'Nudelman A', 'Levovich I', 'Jing Y', 'Waxman S', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Lady Davis Institute/SMBD Jewish General Hospital, Center for Translational Research in Cancer, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Butyrates/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', '*Prodrugs', 'Tretinoin/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/10/24 05:00,2004/06/25 05:00,['2003/10/24 05:00'],"['2003/10/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2003 Oct;1(12):903-12.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (retinoyloxymethyl butyrate)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,['CA85748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of the two previously studied cohorts (Groups 1 and 2) confirmed the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the multiplex assay with regard to these two translocations. Additionally, however, in the ""negative"" Group (Group 2) the assay revealed three unanticipated translocations (CBFbeta-MYH11, BCR-ABL, and MLL-AF4), two of which were confirmed on cytogenetics. Analysis of the prospective cohort demonstrated that the assay was cost-effective and amenable to standard laboratory practice, with an identically sensitive MRD detection rate to that of our laboratory-developed tests. Virtually all of the results obtained were consistent with the phenotype and karyotype by conventional methods.

While DCs derived from CD34(+) progenitor cells also showed strong NDRG2 expression, the corresponding mRNA expression was absent in other cell lines including monocytes, B cells, and NK cells. The inhibition of DC differentiation by dexamethasone or vitamin D(3) treatment down-regulated the expression of the NDRG2 gene in DCs. In addition, gene expression was induced in a myelomonocytic leukemia cell line, which is capable of differentiating into DCs in cytokine-conditioned culture. The level of NDRG2 gene expression in DCs was significantly higher than that of other members of the NDRG gene family. Finally, in contrast to the stable NDRG2 expression in CD40-stimulated DCs, the induction of DC maturation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in the down-regulation of NDRG2 gene expression. This down-regulation is likely to be due to a modification and subsequent destabilization of NDRG2 mRNA, because co-treating with actinomycin D and LPS significantly blocked this LPS effect. Taken together, our results indicate that NDRG2 is expressed during the differentiation of DCs, and that NDRG2 gene expression is differentially regulated by maturation-inducing stimuli.","['Choi, Seung-Chul', 'Kim, Kwang Dong', 'Kim, Jong-Tae', 'Kim, Jae-Wha', 'Yoon, Do-Young', 'Choe, Yong-Kyung', 'Chang, Yong-Suk', 'Paik, Sang-Gi', 'Lim, Jong-Seok']","['Choi SC', 'Kim KD', 'Kim JT', 'Kim JW', 'Yoon DY', 'Choe YK', 'Chang YS', 'Paik SG', 'Lim JS']","['Laboratory of Cell Biology, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, 52 Eoeun-dong, Yuseong-gu, 305-333 Daejeon, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2003/10/24 05:00,2003/12/10 05:00,['2003/10/24 05:00'],"['2003/10/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0014579303010305 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(03)01030-5 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2003 Oct 23;553(3):413-8. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(03)01030-5.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NDRG2 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New applications for the analysis of dynamic cellular properties demand sampling methods with sufficient temporal resolution to accurately measure these processes. In particular, intracellular signaling pathways involving many enzymes can be modulated on subsecond time scales. We have developed a technique to rapidly lyse an adherent mammalian cell using a single electrical pulse followed by efficient loading of the cellular contents into a capillary. Microfabricated electrodes were designed to create a maximum voltage drop across the flattened cell's plasma membrane at a minimum interelectrode voltage. The influence of the interelectrode distance, pulse duration, and pulse strength on the rate of cell lysis was determined. The ability to rapidly lyse a cell and collect and separate the cellular contents was demonstrated by loading cells with Oregon Green and two isomers of carboxyfluorescein. All three fluorophores were detected with a separation efficiency comparable to that of standards. Parallel comparison of electrical lysis to that produced by a laser-based lysis system revealed that the sampling efficiencies of the two techniques were comparable. Rapid cell lysis by an electrical pulse may increase the application of capillary electrophoresis to the study of cellular dynamics requiring fast sampling times.","['Han, Futian', 'Wang, Yan', 'Sims, Christopher E', 'Bachman, Mark', 'Chang, Ruisheng', 'Li, G P', 'Allbritton, Nancy L']","['Han F', 'Wang Y', 'Sims CE', 'Bachman M', 'Chang R', 'Li GP', 'Allbritton NL']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of California, Irvine, California 92697, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Fractionation/*instrumentation/*methods', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Electrodes', 'Electrolysis', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary/instrumentation/*methods', 'Fluoresceins', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Rats', 'Time Factors']",2003/10/24 05:00,2004/07/20 05:00,['2003/10/24 05:00'],"['2003/10/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/ac0341970 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2003 Aug 1;75(15):3688-96. doi: 10.1021/ac0341970.,"['0 (Fluoresceins)', '3301-79-9 (6-carboxyfluorescein)']",,,,['CA91216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluates the utility of routine medical survey applied to benzene-exposed workers by analyzing the hematological, immunological, and cytogenetic assay results. METHODS: The results of a previous study of hematological, immunological, and cytogenetic assays in benzene-exposed workers (up to 15 ppm) are used to discuss medical surveillance program by defining the relationship between various benzene exposure concentrations and toxic endpoints. RESULTS: Exposure to benzene concentration lower than 5 ppm does not produce any abnormal hematological measurements. For benzene cumulative exposure above 100 (ppm-years), some blood indices [mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), band neutrophils] show significant differences in comparison to the control group. The incidence of dicentric chromosomes was higher and the level of B-lymphocytes was lower even with workers exposed to 5 ppm of benzene; correlation with exposure indicators was not found. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that peripheral blood indices, although not sensitive enough, are still the most suitable parameters in a health surveillance program applied to benzene-exposed workers. B-lymphocytes could be a promising indicator of the benzene-induced damage. Cytogenetic tests did not prove to be suitable. Further investigation of useful screening tests for health surveillance program of benzene-exposed workers is still required.","['Bogadi-Sare, Ana', 'Zavalic, Marija', 'Turk, Rajka']","['Bogadi-Sare A', 'Zavalic M', 'Turk R']","['Croatian Institute of Occupational Health, Division for Occupational Diseases and Industrial Toxicology, Zagreb, Croatia. hzmr@hzmr.hr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,IM,"['Adult', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Humans', 'Industry', 'Mass Screening/*methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Occupational Health', 'Population Surveillance/*methods', 'Shoes']",2003/10/23 05:00,2004/03/16 05:00,['2003/10/23 05:00'],"['2003/10/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.10296 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2003 Nov;44(5):467-73. doi: 10.1002/ajim.10296.,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

Insertional activation at the FLI-1 locus is an early event in F-murine leukemia virus-induced erythroleukemia. Consistent with its essential role in erythroid transformation, enforced expression of FLI-1 in primary erythroblasts strongly impairs the response of these cells to erythropoietin (Epo), a cytokine essential to erythropoiesis. We show here that point mutations in the ETS domain that abolished FLI-1 binding to specific DNA elements (ETS-binding sites) suppressed the ability of FLI-1 to transform erythroblasts. The exchange of the entire ETS domain (DNA binding domain) of FLI-1 for that of PU.1 changed the DNA binding specificity of FLI-1 for that of PU.1 and impaired FLI-1 transforming properties. In contrast, ETS domain swapping mutants that maintained the DNA binding specificity of FLI-1 did not affect the ability of FLI-1 to transform erythroblasts. Deletion and swapping mutants that failed to inhibit the DNA binding activity of FLI-1 but impaired its transcriptional activation properties were also transformation-defective.

Reactive oxygen metabolites, ceramide (synthesized de novo and as a product of sphingomyelin cycle), and caspases have been implicated as potential mediators of cell death. Their mechanistic relationship remains to be elucidated. The presence and activation of executor caspase-3 has been found to be regulated during both TNF-induced apoptosis and necrosis on their early stages. TNF-induced cell damage, suggesting the induction of both, apoptosis and necrosis, depended on the cell cycle. Necrosis induced by TNF was inhibited by denitrophenol (DNP). Pretreatment of these cells with exogenous bacterial sphingomyelinase (SMase) potentiates TNF-alpha induced apoptosis only, suggesting the role of ceramide from sphingomyelin cycle in TNF signaling pathways of apoptosis. DNP was found to initiate necrosis after SMase and TNF common action. The role of ceramide synthesis in enhanced ceramide generation in response to oxidant stress was shown using inhibitor of ceramide synthase--fumonisin B1. Its effect was found to be modulated by mitochondrial chain respiration inhibitors. Monoclonal antibodies to TNF-alpha receptors R1 and R2 exhibit the more high level of necrosis compared with TNF and both regulated by DNP and phospholipase A2. TNF-R2 effect was not found previously. CONCLUSION: Ceramide synthesis and sphingomyelin breakdown, caspase activation and reactive oxygen metabolites production are required for the TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis and necrosis which may be regulated dependently on cell cycle. TNF-initiated necrosis seems to be the disrupted apoptotic program and may be classified as aponecrosis.","['Martynova, E A', 'Poddubskaia, E V', 'Polosukhina, E P', 'Klimova, S V']","['Martynova EA', 'Poddubskaia EV', 'Polosukhina EP', 'Klimova SV']","['State Institute of Nutrition, RAMS, Ustinsky proezd 2/14, Moscow, 109240 Russia. eamartinova@lycos.com']",['rus'],['Journal Article'],,Russia (Federation),Biomed Khim,Biomeditsinskaia khimiia,101196966,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/biosynthesis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Ceramides/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dinitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Electron Transport/drug effects', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fumonisins/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Necrosis', 'Oxidoreductases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/metabolism', 'Sphingomyelins/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Uncoupling Agents/pharmacology']",2003/10/23 05:00,2004/02/24 05:00,['2003/10/23 05:00'],"['2003/10/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/23 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biomed Khim. 2003 Jan-Feb;49(1):35-45.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Fumonisins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Uncoupling Agents)', '3ZZM97XZ32 (fumonisin B1)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.3.1.- (dihydroceramide desaturase)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,TNF-indutsiruemyi apoptoz i nekroz v kletkakh mieloleikoza HL-60 reguliruetsia reaktivnymi metabolitami kisloroda v zavisimosti ot fazy kletochnogo tsikla.,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it has become clear that this mode of therapy does not eradicate the malignancy in many patients and its benefit is largely due to the immune mediated graft versus malignancy effect. This has led to development of alternative strategy to utilize a less intensive preparative regimen pre-transplantation that provides sufficient immunosuppression to achieve engraftment of an allogeneic stem cell graft, thus allowing the evolution of a graft versus malignancy effect post-transplantation. Since September 1999, we had carried out 10 cases of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation: one case of aplastic anaemia, four cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first remission, and five cases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase. The preparative regimen was non-myeloablative comprising Fludarabine with Cyclophosphamide or Busulphan. Recovery from transplantation was rapid with no or brief period of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Engraftment was established by determining donor's short tandem repeats in the recipient's bone marrow at day 30, 60 and 100 post-transplantation. Seven cases (70%) show partial or complete donor's chimerism by day 30 indicating successful engraftment. No treatment mortality was noted at day 100. Graft versus host disease was generally limited. Up to the date of reporting, two patients with CML had graft failure, one was successfully re-transplanted later. Two patients with AML had since relapsed and passed away. The others remain alive and well. The cost of transplantation on average was estimated to be about a quarter of that using a myeloablative regimen. It appears that this treatment strategy is a promising approach for the management of blood disorders.","['Leong, C F', 'Cheong, S K', 'Fadilah, S A', 'Ainoon, O', 'Hamidah, N H']","['Leong CF', 'Cheong SK', 'Fadilah SA', 'Ainoon O', 'Hamidah NH']","['Clinical Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Services, MAKNA-HUKM Cancer Institute, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Malaysia,Med J Malaysia,The Medical journal of Malaysia,0361547,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*therapy', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2003/10/23 05:00,2003/11/07 05:00,['2003/10/23 05:00'],"['2003/10/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/23 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med J Malaysia. 2003 Jun;58(2):229-35.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the significant improvement in the overall outcome, disease progression after transplantation remains the major cause of treatment failure. With longer follow-up, therapy-related myelodysplasia/acute myelogenous leukemia is becoming an important cause of treatment failure. The prognosis for these 2 groups of patients is very poor. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is a potential curative treatment for these patients. However, the outcome with conventional myeloablative alloSCT after failed autoSCT is typically poor because of high transplant-related mortality. In an attempt to reduce the treatment-related toxicity, we studied a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen followed by alloSCT for patients with progressive disease or therapy-related myelodysplasia/acute myelogenous leukemia after autoSCT. This report describes the outcomes of 28 patients with hematologic malignancies who received a reduced-intensity alloSCT after having treatment failure with a conventional autoSCT. Fourteen patients received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant from a related donor and 14 from an unrelated donor. The conditioning regimen consisted of low-dose (2 Gy) total body irradiation with or without fludarabine in 4 patients and the combination of melphalan (140 mg/m(2)) and fludarabine in 24. Cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil were used for posttransplantation immunosuppressive therapy, as well as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, in all patients. All patients engrafted and had >90% donor chimerism on day 100 after SCT. Currently, 13 patients (46%) are alive and disease free, 7 patients (25%) developed disease progression after alloSCT, and 8 (32%) died of nonrelapse causes. Day 100 mortality and nonrelapse mortality were 25% and 21%, respectively. With a median follow-up of 24 months for surviving patients, the 2-year probabilities of overall survival, event-free survival, and relapse rates were 56.5%, 41%, and 41.9%, respectively. Six patients (21%) developed grade III to IV acute GVHD. Among 21 evaluable patients, 15 (67%) developed chronic GVHD. We conclude that (1) reduced-intensity alloSCT is feasible and has an acceptable toxicity profile in patients who have previously received autoSCT and that (2) although follow-up was short, a durable remission may be achieved in some patients who would otherwise be expected to have a poor outcome.","['Fung, H C', 'Cohen, S', 'Rodriguez, R', 'Smith, D', 'Krishnan, A', 'Somlo, G', 'Sahebi, F', 'Senitzer, D', ""O'Donnell, M R"", 'Stein, A', 'Snyder, D S', 'Spielberger, R', 'Bhatia, R', 'Falk, P', 'Molina, A', 'Nademanee, A', 'Parker, P', 'Kogut, N', 'Popplewell, L', 'Vora, N', 'Margolin, K', 'Forman, S J']","['Fung HC', 'Cohen S', 'Rodriguez R', 'Smith D', 'Krishnan A', 'Somlo G', 'Sahebi F', 'Senitzer D', ""O'Donnell MR"", 'Stein A', 'Snyder DS', 'Spielberger R', 'Bhatia R', 'Falk P', 'Molina A', 'Nademanee A', 'Parker P', 'Kogut N', 'Popplewell L', 'Vora N', 'Margolin K', 'Forman SJ']","['Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Kaiser Permanente-City of Hope BMT Program, City of Hope Cancer Center, 1500 E.

Although not statistically significant, neutrophil recovery data in the adjusted model suggested a similar effect in the HD-ASCT group, with faster engraftment times at absolute neutrophil counts >500/microL (median, 9.2 versus 12 days; HR, 1.6; CI, 0.69-3.5; P =.29) and absolute neutrophil counts >1000/microL (median, 9.5 versus 12 days; HR, 1.3; CI, 0.56-2.8; P =.58). Subjects who received HD-ASCT required fewer red blood cell transfusions (4.0 versus 9.8 units; P =.01).

A successful method for the ex vivo treatment of donor T cells to limit their GVHD potential while retaining GVL activity would have broad clinical applications for patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for malignant diseases. We hypothesized that donor lymphocyte infusions treated with fludarabine, an immunosuppressive nucleoside analog, would have reduced GVHD potential in a fully major histocompatibility complex-mismatched C57BL/6 --> B10.BR mouse BMT model. Recipients of fludarabine-treated donor lymphocyte infusions (F-DLI) had significantly reduced GVHD mortality, reduced histopathologic evidence of GVHD, and lower inflammatory serum cytokine levels than recipients of untreated DLI. Combined comparisons of GVHD incidence and donor-derived hematopoietic chimerism indicated that F-DLI had a therapeutic index superior to that of untreated DLI. Furthermore, adoptive immunotherapy of lymphoblastic lymphoma using F-DLI in the C57BL/6 --> B10.BR model demonstrated a broad therapeutic index with markedly reduced GVHD activity and preservation of GVL activity compared with untreated allogeneic T cells. Fludarabine exposure markedly reduced the CD4+CD44(low)-naive donor T-cell population within 48 hours of transplantation and altered the relative representation of cytokine-producing CD4+ T cells, consistent with T-helper type 2 polarization. However, proliferation of fludarabine-treated T cells in allogeneic recipient spleens was equivalent to that of untreated T cells. The results suggest that fludarabine reduces the GVHD potential of donor lymphocytes through effects on a CD4+CD44(low) T-cell population, with less effect on alloreactive T cells and CD4+CD44(high) memory T cells that are able to mediate GVL effects. Thus, F-DLI represents a novel method of immune modulation that may be useful to enhance immune reconstitution among allograft recipients with reduced risk of GVHD while retaining beneficial GVL effects.","['Giver, Cynthia R', 'Montes, Richard O', 'Mittelstaedt, Stephen', 'Li, Jian-Ming', 'Jaye, David L', 'Lonial, Sagar', 'Boyer, Michael W', 'Waller, Edmund K']","['Giver CR', 'Montes RO', 'Mittelstaedt S', 'Li JM', 'Jaye DL', 'Lonial S', 'Boyer MW', 'Waller EK']","['Hematology/Oncology Department, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, 1639 Pierce Drive, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology/methods', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', '*Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*drug effects', 'Histocompatibility', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/analysis', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/*methods', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2003/10/22 05:00,2004/06/25 05:00,['2003/10/22 05:00'],"['2003/10/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/22 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/s1083-8791(03)00229-5 [doi]', 'S1083879103002295 [pii]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2003 Oct;9(10):616-32. doi: 10.1016/s1083-8791(03)00229-5.,"['0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,"['K12 GM000680/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '5K12 GM 00680/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 60647/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 74364-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

It was previously found that the human promyelocyte leukemia cells HL-60 (TP53 negative) that had been exposed to ionizing radiation at doses up to 10 Gy were arrested in the G(2) phase for a period of 24 h. The radioresistance of HL-60 cells that were exposed to low dose-rate gamma irradiation of 3.9 mGy/min, which resulted in a pronounced accumulation of the cells in the G(2) phase during the exposure period, increased compared with the radioresistance of cells that were exposed to a high dose-rate gamma irradiation of 0.6 Gy/min. The D(0) value (i.e. the radiation dose leading to 37% cell survival) for low dose-rate radiation was 3.7 Gy and for high dose-rate radiation 2.2 Gy. In this study, prevention of G(2) phase arrest by caffeine (2 mM) and irradiation of cells with low dose-rate irradiation in all phases of the cell cycle proved to cause radiosensitization (D(0)=2.2 Gy). The irradiation in the presence of caffeine resulted in a second wave of apoptosis on days 5-7 post-irradiation.

Most clinical efforts have incorporated cytokine-based therapy. The presumption has been that the cytokines may trigger a host immune response against the renal cancer. Only IFN-alpha and high-dose IL-2 seemed to have positive effects on patient outcomes. IFN has prolonged the lives of patients by a few months, and high-dose IL-2 is capable of inducing very prolonged remissions (>5 yr) for a small number of patients. Nephrectomy in the presence of metastatic disease has been established as an effective procedure for select patients, providing palliation and prolonging survival. Finally, enthusiasm has focused on the use of nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation and donor leukocyte infusion for the induction of graft versus tumor effects. Early results are both provocative and promising. A number of agents that target the critical gene products downstream from pVHL and hypoxia-inducible factor-1, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, PDGF, EGF receptor, and TGF-alpha, have recently become available. The new agents are capable of inhibiting specific cellular targets, and the biologic characteristics of clear cell carcinoma of the kidney support their application. If the correct targets are carefully selected for inhibition in tumors in which the targets are present (clear cell histologic features and loss of VHL expression), then results should resemble those others have observed with targeted therapy, such as the use of STI-571 (Gleevec; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ) for treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors or anti-HER2/neu (Herceptin; Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) for treatment of breast cancer.","['Sosman, Jeffrey A']",['Sosman JA'],"['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA. jeff.sosman@vanderbilt.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Am Soc Nephrol,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,9013836,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma, Clear Cell/genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Cell Hypoxia/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit', 'Kidney Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein']",2003/10/22 05:00,2004/04/09 05:00,['2003/10/22 05:00'],"['2003/10/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/22 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.asn.0000091589.10594.66 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Soc Nephrol. 2003 Nov;14(11):2695-702. doi: 10.1097/01.asn.0000091589.10594.66.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (VHL protein, human)']",62,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First-line high-dose chemotherapy might be able to improve the result. This analysis reports toxicity and long-term results of a large phase I/II study of sequential high-dose etoposide, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (VIP) in patients with advanced germ cell tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 1993 and November 1999, 221 patients with either Indiana ""advanced disease"" (n = 39) or IGCCCG ""poor prognosis"" criteria (n = 182) received one cycle of VIP followed by three to four sequential cycles of high-dose VIP chemotherapy plus stem cell support, every 3 weeks, at six consecutive dose levels. RESULTS: Dose limiting toxicity occurred at level 8 (100 mg/m2 cisplatinum, 1750 mg/m2 etoposide, 12 g/m2 ifosfamide) with grade 4 mucositis (three of eight patients), grade 3 CNS toxicity (one of eight patients), grade 4 renal toxicity (one of eight patients), and prolonged granulocytopenia (one of eight patients). After 4-year median follow-up, progression-free survival and disease-specific survival rates in the poor prognosis subgroup were 69% and 79% at 2 years and 68% and 73% at 5 years, with 76% for gonadal/retroperitoneal versus 67% for mediastinal primaries. Severe toxicity included treatment related death (4%), treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (1%), long-term impared renal function (3%), chronic renal failure (1%), and persistent grade 2-3 neuropathy (5%). CONCLUSION: Repetitive cycles of high-dose VIP with peripheral stem cell support can be successfully applied in a multicenter setting. Dose level 6 with cisplatin 100 mg/m2, etoposide 1500 mg/m2, and ifosfamide 10 g/m2 is recommended for further investigation in randomized trials.

In this study, we first determined precisely at what stage apoptotic cells are phagocytosed by macrophages, and then examined the subsequent cytokine production. Phagocytosis was confirmed by flow cytometry and confocal laser microscopy, whereas the subsequent response was examined by ELISA and RT-PCR for quantitative and semiquantitative measurement of the protein and mRNA levels of cytokines, respectively. Even the cell populations containing very early apoptotic cells, such as IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 cells cultured in the absence of IL-2 for 4 h and a murine leukemic cell line, P388 cells, treated with etoposide for 5 h, were phagocytosed by macrophages. Although the cell populations containing the very early apoptotic cells used in this study were FITC-Annexin V-negative and did not show a decrease in cell size as compared with untreated cells, they showed a very small increase in phosphatidylserine on the cell surface, as detected with Cy3-Annexin V, and a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating that the cell populations had already started the apoptotic process. Phagocytosis of such populations containing very early apoptotic cells was inhibited by phospho-L-serine much more significantly than Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser. In addition, macrophages hardly produced either proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines after phagocytosis, thus being an almost null response. These results are contrary to the generally accepted concept that the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells leads to the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting instead that cells starting to undergo apoptosis are quickly phagocytosed by macrophages without any inflammation in vivo.","['Kurosaka, Kahori', 'Takahashi, Munehisa', 'Watanabe, Naoko', 'Kobayashi, Yoshiro']","['Kurosaka K', 'Takahashi M', 'Watanabe N', 'Kobayashi Y']","['Department of Biomolecular Science, Faculty of Science, Toho University, Funabashi, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Kupffer Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Leukemia P388', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/cytology/immunology', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/cytology/immunology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects/*immunology', 'Phosphoserine/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Time Factors']",2003/10/22 05:00,2004/01/31 05:00,['2003/10/22 05:00'],"['2003/10/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/22 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.171.9.4672 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2003 Nov 1;171(9):4672-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.171.9.4672.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', 'AC6UDA2MFC (arginyl-glycyl-aspartyl-serine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BCL1 leukemia growing in syngenic Balb/c mice was selected as a tumor model system. B1 mAb recognising the idiotype of surface IgM on BCL1 cells was used as a targeting moiety. Both B1 mAb and doxorubicin were conjugated to HPMA copolymer carrier by aminolysis through a tetrapeptidic Gly-Phe(D,L)-Leu-Gly spacer to ensure the intracellular delivery and controlled release of the drug. B1 mAb-targeted conjugate was shown to possess strictly tumor-specific binding capacity to target BCL1 cells in vitro. A similar conjugate, but containing human nonspecific Ig (HuIg) instead of B1 mAb, failed to bind to BCL1 cells. In vitro, B1 mAb-targeted conjugate demonstrated 40-fold higher cytotoxic effect than nontargeted or human nonspecific Ig-containing HPMA copolymer-bound doxorubicin. Conjugate targeted with B1 mAb was also shown to bind to target BCL1 cells in vivo. B1 mAb-targeted conjugate was shown to be more efficient in the treatment of established BCL1 leukemia than free doxorubicin, nontargeted and human nonspecific Ig-containing conjugate. Antibody-targeted polymeric drugs are thus promising conjugates for cancer treatment.","['Kovar, M', 'Mrkvan, T', 'Strohalm, J', 'Etrych, T', 'Ulbrich, K', 'Stastny, M', 'Rihova, B']","['Kovar M', 'Mrkvan T', 'Strohalm J', 'Etrych T', 'Ulbrich K', 'Stastny M', 'Rihova B']","['Department of Immunology and Gnotobiology, Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Videnska 1083, 142 20 Prague 4, Czech Republic. makovar@biomed.cas.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,IM,"['Acrylamides/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/analysis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/analysis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hydrogels/chemistry', 'Immunoconjugates/blood/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/mortality', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/chemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Reticulocyte Count', 'Spleen/chemistry', 'Survival Rate']",2003/10/22 05:00,2004/06/15 05:00,['2003/10/22 05:00'],"['2003/10/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/22 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0168365903003407 [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-3659(03)00340-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2003 Oct 30;92(3):315-30. doi: 10.1016/s0168-3659(03)00340-7.,"['0 (Acrylamides)', '0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hydrogels)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '171714-74-2 (N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide co-polymer-doxorubicin conjugate)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, treatment is often palliative for the majority of cancer patients. Transformed cells respond poorly to chemotherapy mainly due to the development of the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype. Response to treatment does not generally result in complete remission and disease cure is uncommon for patients presenting with advanced stage cancer. Successful treatment of cancer requires a clearer understanding of chemotherapeutic resistance. Here, we examine what is known of one of the most extensively studied mechanisms of cellular drug resistance. The human multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) is associated with expression of p-glycoprotein (Pgp). A transmembrane protein, Pgp acts as an efflux pump and reduces intracellular drug levels and thus its effectiveness as an antitumor agent. The precise mechanism of transcriptional regulation has been unclear due to the complex regulatory nature of the gene. It has become increasingly apparent that trans-activation or genetic amplification is by no means the only mechanism of activation. Consequently, alternative pathways have received more attention in the area of epigenetics to help explain transcriptional competence at a higher level of organization. The goal of this article is to highlight important findings in the field of methylation and explain how they impinge on MDR1 gene regulation. In this review, we cover the current information and postulate that epigenetic modification of MDR1 chromatin influences gene transcription in leukaemia. Finally, we explore transcriptional regulation and highlight recent progress with engineered ZFP's (zinc finger proteins).","['Baker, Emma K', 'El-Osta, Assam']","['Baker EK', 'El-Osta A']","['The Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct, Baker Medical Research Institute, Epigenetics in Human Health and Disease Laboratory, Second Floor, Commercial Road, Prahran, Victoria 3181, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics', 'Chromatin/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Genes, MDR/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics']",2003/10/22 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/22 05:00'],"['2003/10/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/22 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0014482703003422 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-4827(03)00342-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2003 Nov 1;290(2):177-94. doi: 10.1016/s0014-4827(03)00342-2.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",197,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Catalase and bathocuproine inhibited the DNA damage, indicating the involvement of H2O2 and Cu(I). NADH enhanced catechins plus Cu(II)-induced 8-oxodG formation in calf thymus DNA, suggesting the redox cycle between catechins and their corresponding quinones, the oxidized forms of catechins. The DNA-damaging ability of epicatechin is stronger than that of catechin, possibly due to the greater turnover frequency of the redox cycle. The difference in their redox properties could be explained by their redox potentials estimated form an ab initio molecular orbital calculation. The present study demonstrated that catechins could induce metal-dependent H2O2 generation during the redox reactions and subsequently damage to cellular and isolated DNA. Therefore, it is reasonably considered that green tea catechins may have the dual function of anticarcinogenic and carcinogenic potentials.","['Oikawa, Shinji', 'Furukawaa, Ayako', 'Asada, Hideyuki', 'Hirakawa, Kazutaka', 'Kawanishi, Shosuke']","['Oikawa S', 'Furukawaa A', 'Asada H', 'Hirakawa K', 'Kawanishi S']","['Department of Environmental and Molecular Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, Edobashi 2-174, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Free Radic Res,Free radical research,9423872,IM,"['Animals', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Catechin/*metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Copper/chemistry', 'Cytosine/chemistry', 'DNA/*chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Indicators and Reagents/pharmacology', 'Models, Chemical', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Phenanthrolines/pharmacology', 'Phosphates/pharmacology', 'Quinones/chemistry', '*Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Thymine/chemistry', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2003/10/22 05:00,2004/03/26 05:00,['2003/10/22 05:00'],"['2003/10/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/22 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1071576031000150751 [doi]'],ppublish,Free Radic Res. 2003 Aug;37(8):881-90. doi: 10.1080/1071576031000150751.,"['0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Phenanthrolines)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9THP2V94FX (bathocuproine)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'QR26YLT7LT (Thymine)', 'SE337SVY37 (sodium phosphate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a variety of model systems, the works of a number of laboratories have converged on a hypothesis where the correction of 1 or 2 signaling defects can revert tumor cells to a normal phenotype, both in vivo and in culture, even when the tumor cells possess multiple genetic and epigenetic lesions.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum creatinine levels of 35 patients (15 female, 20 male, median age 40.5 years, range 17-60 years) after TBI alone and of 23 patients (eight female, 15 male, median age 47, range 16-58 years) after TBI with additional RIT were determined between 10/1997 and 11/1999. TBI was performed by external-beam radiotherapy in six fractions over 3 days with renal doses of 12 Gy in the TBI-alone group and 6 Gy in the group with additional RIT. The mean kidney dose due to the (188)Re-radiolabeled antibody was estimated to be 8.3 Gy (2.3-11.6 Gy). RESULTS: Within 12 months after treatment, creatinine levels increased from 77 mmol/l (SD +/- 11) to 89 mmol/l (SD +/- 20) for TBI alone and from 78 mmol/l (SD +/- 13) to 144 mmol/l (SD +/- 52) for combined TBI and RIT. CONCLUSION: Despite a 50% reduction of the external-beam contribution to the kidney dose, the application of approximately 10 GBq (188)Re-labeled anti-CD66 monoclonal antibody with a calculated renal dose of 8.3 Gy (range 2.3-11.5 Gy) led to renal toxicity, as reported previously. In the absence of a positive dose-response relationship for the (188)Re-labeled antibody, the observation may be explained by an underestimation of the biologically effective dose and the inaccuracy of the dose determination at the glomerular level.","['Rottinger, Erwin M', 'Bartkowiak, Detlef', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Wennauer, Roman', 'Dohr, Dagmar']","['Rottinger EM', 'Bartkowiak D', 'Bunjes D', 'Wennauer R', 'Dohr D']","['Department of Radiotherapy, University Hospital Ulm, Germany. radiooncology.department@medizin.uni-ulm.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

Recently, combinations of different therapeutic strategies (based on mechanisms of apoptosis, differentiation and cytotoxicity) have significantly increased survival. To further improve outcome, we studied the potential efficacy of boosting the patient's immune response using specific immunotherapy. In an animal model of acute promyelocytic leukemia, we developed a DNA-based vaccine by fusing the human promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor-alpha (PML-RARA) oncogene to tetanus fragment C (FrC) sequences. We show for the first time that a DNA vaccine specifically targeted to an oncoprotein can have a pronounced effect on survival, both alone and when combined with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). The survival advantage is concomitant with time-dependent antibody production and an increase in interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). We also show that ATRA therapy on its own triggers an immune response in this model. When DNA vaccination and conventional ATRA therapy are combined, they induce protective immune responses against leukemia progression in mice and may provide a new approach to improve clinical outcome in human leukemia.","['Padua, Rose Ann', 'Larghero, Jerome', 'Robin, Marie', 'le Pogam, Carol', 'Schlageter, Marie-Helene', 'Muszlak, Sacha', 'Fric, Jan', 'West, Robert', 'Rousselot, Philippe', 'Phan, Thi Hai', 'Mudde, Liesbeth', 'Teisserenc, Helene', 'Carpentier, Antoine F', 'Kogan, Scott', 'Degos, Laurent', 'Pla, Marika', 'Bishop, J Michael', 'Stevenson, Freda', 'Charron, Dominique', 'Chomienne, Christine']","['Padua RA', 'Larghero J', 'Robin M', 'le Pogam C', 'Schlageter MH', 'Muszlak S', 'Fric J', 'West R', 'Rousselot P', 'Phan TH', 'Mudde L', 'Teisserenc H', 'Carpentier AF', 'Kogan S', 'Degos L', 'Pla M', 'Bishop JM', 'Stevenson F', 'Charron D', 'Chomienne C']","[""LBCH INSERM E0-03, U462 & U396, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, AP-HP 75010, Paris, France. rose.padua@kcl.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20031019,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/genetics/*immunology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/drug effects/genetics/*immunology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Vaccines, DNA/*immunology/pharmacology']",2003/10/21 05:00,2004/01/08 05:00,['2003/10/21 05:00'],"['2003/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2003/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/10/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/nm949 [doi]', 'nm949 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2003 Nov;9(11):1413-7. doi: 10.1038/nm949.

Whereas Notch enhances tumorigenesis, E2A suppresses it. However, whether and how Notch and E2A interact functionally in an integrative mechanism for regulating neoplastic transformation remains to be understood. It has been shown that Notch3-induced T-cell leukaemia is abrogated by the inactivation of pTalpha/pre-T-cell antigen receptor (pre-TCR). We report here that Notch3-induced transcriptional activation of pTalpha/pre-TCR is responsible for the downregulation of E2A DNA binding and transcriptional activity. Further, the E2A messenger RNA and protein levels remain unaltered but the E2A inhibitor Id1 expression is augmented in thymocytes and T lymphoma cells derived from Notch3 transgenic mice. The increase in Id1 expression is achieved by pre-TCR-induced extracellular-signalling-regulated kinase 1/2. These observations support a model in which the upregulation of pre-TCR signalling seems to be the prerequi-site for Notch3-induced inhibition of E2A, thus leading to the development of lymphoma in Notch3 transgenic mice.","['Talora, Claudio', 'Campese, Antonio F', 'Bellavia, Diana', 'Pascucci, Monica', 'Checquolo, Saula', 'Groppioni, Manuela', 'Frati, Luigi', 'von Boehmer, Harald', 'Gulino, Alberto', 'Screpanti, Isabella']","['Talora C', 'Campese AF', 'Bellavia D', 'Pascucci M', 'Checquolo S', 'Groppioni M', 'Frati L', 'von Boehmer H', 'Gulino A', 'Screpanti I']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Experimental Medicine and Pathology, University La Sapienza, Viale Regina Elena 324, 00161 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20031017,England,EMBO Rep,EMBO reports,100963049,IM,"['Animals', 'Down-Regulation', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch3', 'Receptor, Notch4', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2003/10/21 05:00,2004/07/28 05:00,['2003/10/21 05:00'],"['2003/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2003/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2003/10/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.embor.embor7400013 [doi]', 'embor7400013 [pii]']",ppublish,EMBO Rep. 2003 Nov;4(11):1067-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.embor.embor7400013.

A heart and smooth muscle-specific SRF co-activator, myocardin, has been shown to be required for cardiac development and smooth muscle differentiation. However, no such co-factors of SRF have been identified in the skeletal myogenic differentiation program. Myocardin and the related transcription factor megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 (MKL1/MAL/MRTF-A) can strongly potentiate the activity of SRF. Here we report the cloning of the third member of the myocardin/MKL family in humans, MKL2. MKL2 binds to and activates SRF similar to myocardin and MKL1. To determine the role of these factors in skeletal myogenic differentiation we used a dominant negative MKL2 to show that the MKL family of proteins is required for skeletal myogenic differentiation. Expression of the dominant negative protein in C2C12 skeletal myoblasts blocked the differentiation-induced expression of the SRF target genes skeletal alpha-actin and alpha-myosin heavy chain and blocked differentiation of the myoblasts to myotubes in vitro. C2C12 cells express both MKL1 and MKL2, but not myocardin, implicating MKL1 and/or MKL2 in the requirement for skeletal myogenic differentiation. MKL1 was predominantly cytoplasmic in C2C12 cells, with a small amount in the nucleus, however, no movement of MKL1 to the nucleus was observed upon differentiation.","['Selvaraj, Ahalya', 'Prywes, Ron']","['Selvaraj A', 'Prywes R']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, 1212 Amsterdam Avenue, New York, NY 10027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20030814,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal/chemistry/*cytology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism/physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Serum Response Factor/*metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism/physiology', '*Transcriptional Activation']",2003/10/21 05:00,2004/01/06 05:00,['2003/10/21 05:00'],"['2003/10/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M305679200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)82731-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Oct 24;278(43):41977-87. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M305679200.

It contains two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic tail and recruits phosphatases upon phosphorylation. Here we show that both ITIM are required for full inhibition of cellular responses and optimal phosphatase recruitment. Mutation of the C-terminal ITIM still allows partial inhibition of the cytotoxic activity of the NK-like YT.2C2 cells, while mutation of the N-terminal ITIM completely abolishes this inhibitory activity. In contrast, in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells, both mutants of LAIR-1 are partially effective. This is reflected in phosphorylation of these mutants in the different cell types upon pervanadate treatment. However, in both YT.2C2 cells and RBL cells, only the mutant containing the N-terminal ITIM recruits Src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP-2), while the mutant containing the C-terminal ITIM does not. In RBL cells the mutant containing only the N-terminal ITIM also binds SHP-1, although to a lesser extent than wild-type LAIR-1. We find that in Jurkat T cells Lck is required for the association of SHP-1 with LAIR-1. Co-expression with Lck in 293T cells leads to phosphorylation of both wild-type LAIR-1 and the mutant containing only the N-terminal ITIM, while the mutant lacking this ITIM is not phosphorylated. These results indicate that Lck, or another Src family kinase, is essential for the consecutive phosphorylation of the N- and C-terminal ITIM. Our data imply that the N-terminal ITIM is dominant in LAIR-1 signaling, but that both ITIM contribute to an optimal inhibitory function.","['Verbrugge, Annelies', 'Ruiter Td, Talitha de', 'Clevers, Hans', 'Meyaard, Linde']","['Verbrugge A', 'Ruiter Td Td', 'Clevers H', 'Meyaard L']","['Department of Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Lundlaan 6, 3584 EA Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 2', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgG/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Immunologic/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/analysis', 'src Homology Domains', 'src-Family Kinases/chemistry/metabolism']",2003/10/21 05:00,2004/07/03 05:00,['2003/10/21 05:00'],"['2003/10/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/21 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/intimm/dxg134 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Immunol. 2003 Nov;15(11):1349-58. doi: 10.1093/intimm/dxg134.,"['0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We next prepared transfectants expressing various chimeric TL molecules with mouse or human MHC class I as well as chimeric TL tetramers with recombinant proteins produced by insect cells, and demonstrated that chimeric TL whose alpha3 domain was replaced by that of H-2K(b), but not of HLA-A2, was sufficient for binding and activation of TL-specific CTL. These results indicate that TL-specific CTL recognize predominantly their alpha1/alpha2 domain as an epitope(s) and that the binding activity to the murine CD8 of the alpha3 domain of H-2K(b) is sufficient to induce their CTL activity, although it is known to be weaker than that of TL, but stronger than that of HLA.

CASE SUMMARIES: Three children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia presenting with hyperuricemia received rasburicase as a single intravenous dose just prior to the start of chemotherapy. This was followed by rapid reduction of serum uric acid levels within 24 hours, which remained low throughout induction therapy while allopurinol and hydration therapy without urinary alkalinization ensued. Subclinical tumor lysis was evidenced by the appearance of hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia in all cases and hyperkalemia in 1 patient. These abnormalities were transient, and each patient's renal function gradually improved from pretreatment baseline without requiring dialysis. DISCUSSION: Our experience suggests that hyperuricemia in children at risk for tumor lysis can be managed with a briefer regimen of rasburicase than the recommended 5- to 7-day course. CONCLUSIONS: A shorter course of rasburicase treatment, including single-dose injection, is feasible and will improve the cost-effectiveness profile of the otherwise expensive compound.","['Lee, Anselm C W', 'Li, Chak H', 'So, Kwan T', 'Chan, Regina']","['Lee AC', 'Li CH', 'So KT', 'Chan R']","['Department of Paediatrics, Tuen Mun Hospital, New Territories, Hong Kong, China. aclee@graduate.hku.hk']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Hyperuricemia/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Urate Oxidase/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Uric Acid/blood']",2003/10/21 05:00,2004/03/06 05:00,['2003/10/21 05:00'],"['2003/10/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/21 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1345/aph.1D111 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2003 Nov;37(11):1614-7. doi: 10.1345/aph.1D111.,"['08GY9K1EUO (rasburicase)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', 'EC 1.7.3.3 (Urate Oxidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test whether this apparent protection from leukocyte invasion might be an inherent feature of the valve endothelium, leukocyte adhesion molecule expression and function were analyzed in human pulmonary valve endothelial cells (HPVEC). Use of cultured HPVEC allowed delineation of the potential contribution of functional adhesion molecules from the contribution of hemodynamic forces exerted on the leaflet surface in vivo METHODS AND RESULTS: HPVEC express E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 in response to the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) similarly to other types of cultured human endothelial cells. In a static cell adhesion assay, E-selectin-mediated adhesion of HL-60 cells, a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, and U937 cells, a human monocytic cell line, was determined in cells treated with TNF-alpha for 5 h. After 24 h of TNF-alpha, adhesion of U937 cells to HPVEC was mediated primarily by VCAM-1, consistent with the high expression of VCAM-1 and diminished expression of E-selectin at 24 h. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that HPVEC express functional leukocyte adhesion molecules in vitro and suggest that cardiac valve endothelium is competent to initiate leukocyte adhesion. Thus, other factors, such as the hemodynamic forces exerted on the valve, may contribute to the apparent protection from inflammatory cell infiltration in vivo.","['Dvorin, Evan L', 'Jacobson, Joel', 'Roth, Stephen J', 'Bischoff, Joyce']","['Dvorin EL', 'Jacobson J', 'Roth SJ', 'Bischoff J']","[""Department of Surgery, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,J Heart Valve Dis,The Journal of heart valve disease,9312096,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Boston', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/drug effects/*physiology', 'Child', 'Child Welfare', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'E-Selectin/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft Rejection/metabolism/physiopathology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Welfare', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'P-Selectin/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Pulmonary Valve/*cytology', 'Skin/cytology', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis/drug effects']",2003/10/21 05:00,2004/04/28 05:00,['2003/10/21 05:00'],"['2003/10/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/21 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Heart Valve Dis. 2003 Sep;12(5):617-24.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (P-Selectin)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",,,,"['R01 HL060490/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL060490-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL60490/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC2810620,,['NIHMS168404'],,,

E4.5 gene encodes for a 4 kb mRNA expressed in various tissues and has an open reading frame of 531 amino acids. The predicted E4.5 protein shows strong homology with the human regulator of chromosome condensation (RCC1) protein, the principal GTP exchange factor for Ran protein. The E4.5 protein contains a BTB domain in its N-terminus, a protein-protein interaction motif. Therefore, we propose that E4.5 is a new member of the RCC1-related guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) family with potent interaction with other proteins and unknown function. Until now, no tumor suppressor genes have been mapped in the 13q14.3 minimal deleted region (MDR) in patients with CLL. It has been proposed that loss of the 13q14.3 MDR may contribute to lymphoid neoplasia by altering the expression/function of genes located on 13q14.3 outside the MDR.

Nevertheless, the interaction between STI571 and other antileukaemic drugs such as hydroxyurea, interferon alpha or cytarabine have also been investigated in order to further improve its effectiveness. In this study we have tried to answer the question if the combination of STI571 with purine nucleoside analogues (PNAs)- cladribine (2-CdA) and fludarabine (F-ara-A) intensifies the antiproliferative effect on granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (CFU-GM) from patients with CML as well as from normal persons. Our studies were based on the method of semisolid CFU-GM cultures in vitro. We added STI571 or PNAs singly to the culture, each of the drugs at three concentrations, as well as in combinations of the concentrations used. We showed that STI571 (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 microM) used alone inhibited the colony growth of CML CFU-GM, as compared to CFU-GM derived from normal donors (p = 0.03; p = 0.0004; p = 0.0001). We also observed that STI571 used together with 2-CdA (5,10 and 20 microM) or F-ara-A (0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 microM) at all the combinations significantly inhibited the colony growth of CML CFU-GM, as compared either to the control or to STI571 used alone (p < 0.05). In addition, the differences between CML and normal CFU-GM colony growth inhibition after the use of the combination of the highest concentrations of STI571 either with 2-CdA or F-ara-A were statistically significant (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively). In conclusion, STI571 used together with both the PNAs had an additive effect on CML CFU-GM cells. However, further experimental and clinical studies concerning the usefulness of these combinations in the treatment of CML patients seem warranted.","['Korycka, Anna', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Korycka A', 'Robak T']","['Department of Haematology, Medical University of Lodz, Copernicus Memorial Hospital, 62 Pabianicka Str, 93-513 Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",2003/10/21 05:00,2004/03/24 05:00,['2003/10/21 05:00'],"['2003/10/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/21 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190309178779 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Sep;44(9):1549-55. doi: 10.3109/10428190309178779.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This approach entails high cure rates, while ensures less long term toxicity with avoidance of laparotomy. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a brief course of Adriamycin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine (ABVD) chemotherapy followed by limited field radiotherapy (RT) in favorable clinical stage (CS) I and IIA HD. Forty patients, aged 17-68 (median 34) years, with favorable CS I and IIA HD, without bulky mediastinal disease, have been treated with 4-6 (median 4) cycles of ABVD plus limited field RT. Twenty seven (67%) patients received 4 cycles of chemotherapy, while 13 received 5-6 cycles. Thirty five (87%) patients received limited field RT with dose 24-36 Gy and five (13%) received extended field with 36-46 Gy. All patients responded completely to chemotherapy. One patient experienced a relapse two months after the end of therapy. All patients are alive; 39 in continuous complete remission. With a median follow-up period of 44 months (range 18-101) the actuarial overall and progress free survival was 100 and 97% at 5 years. We did not observe any case of secondary leukemia or solid tumor. Pulmonary toxicity was mild in cases of mediastinal irradiation. Considering the short follow-up time and the small number of patients, the combination of a brief course of ABVD plus regional RT is a very efficacious treatment of favorable CS I and IIA HD with mild toxicity. However, long term survival data are needed, which could give confident answers regarding the risk of late therapy related complications, particularly second malignancies.","['Karmiris, T D', 'Grigoriou, E', 'Tsantekidou, M', 'Spanou, E', 'Mihalakeas, H', 'Baltadakis, J', 'Apostolidis, J', 'Pagoni, M', 'Karakasis, D', 'Bakiri, M', 'Mitsouli, C', 'Harhalakis, N', 'Nikiforakis, E']","['Karmiris TD', 'Grigoriou E', 'Tsantekidou M', 'Spanou E', 'Mihalakeas H', 'Baltadakis J', 'Apostolidis J', 'Pagoni M', 'Karakasis D', 'Bakiri M', 'Mitsouli C', 'Harhalakis N', 'Nikiforakis E']","['Department of Hematology-Lymphomas, Evangelismos Hospital, 45-47 Ipsilantou Street, Athens 106 76, Greece. tdkarmir@otenet.gr']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/mortality/pathology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2003/10/21 05:00,2004/03/24 05:00,['2003/10/21 05:00'],"['2003/10/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/21 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190309178774 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Sep;44(9):1523-8. doi: 10.3109/10428190309178774.,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ABVD protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This represents 4-log depletion of T-cells. The median time to achieve a neutrophil count of 0.5 x 10(9)/l was 15 days and to achieve a platelet count of 50 x 10(9)/l was 20 days. Only four patients developed acute GVHD at a median of 41 days but this was exclusively mild grade I cutaneous disease and settled with oral steroids. Four patients, all of whom had AML, relapsed or progressed after transplant at a median of 161 (range 109-311) days. One of these had been transplanted in early relapse (9% blasts) whilst another was in second remission. The remaining 10 patients are alive and well. The median progression free survival for the whole population is 69% at 686 days.

Responders experienced hematologic improvements with increased hemoglobin and platelet counts resulting in temporary transfusion independence. In AML, partial responses--defined as reduction of the leukemic blast cell infiltration of at least 50% in BM--occurred in four of 20 patients after one month of thalidomide administration in a previous phase I/II study. Additionally, we observed a long-term response in one AML patient of more than 20 months, meanwhile fulfilling the criteria of complete remission. The decrease in leukemic blast infiltration in BM of responders was accompanied by a significant reduction of the microvessel density. Overall adverse events caused by the drug consisted mainly of fatigue, constipation, skin rash and polyneuropathy with a tolerable dose of 200-400 mg p.o. per day.

Recent long-term follow-up studies on PV and ET patients receiving PB have facilitated the definition of the risk of late transformation into myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM) or acute leukemia (AL). This report gives an overview of the treatment with PB in patients with PV and ET focusing on clinical activity, administration dose and schedule, toxicity, impact on short- and long-term complications. From our experience and from the data reported in the literature the high clinical activity of PB in both PVand ET becomes evident. This drug allows, within 3 months, to attain a response in more than 90% of patients, without clinically relevant toxicities. The 10-years risk of thrombosis of patients treated with PB is about 15%, similar to that registered with hydroxyurea, the most widely used agent in PVand ET. The antiproliferative activity of PB on bone marrow megakaryocytes seems of particular value in lowering the occurrence of post-PV and post-ET MMM, whose risk (< 4% at 10 years) is the lowest registered with available treatments. The 10-year risk of acute leukemia with PB is 5% in PVand 3% in ET, which is only slightly higher than that expected as a natural evolution of the disease.

These cells have demonstrated higher proliferative and cytolytic activities in comparison to the reported CD3-CD56+ lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells that are essentially activated natural killer (NK) cells. CIK cells are non-MHC-restricted in target cell recognition and killing. We have shown the feasibility of generating CIK cells from a series of marrow samples of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) collected at diagnosis. At maturity, the CIK cells exhibit potent cytotoxicity against autologous AML targets as well as allogeneic myeloid leukemia cells, regardless of the HLA types of these targets. This observed cytotoxicity is not entirely due to NK cells as prior pre-absorption of the NK cells cytolytic activities does not abolish the subsequent cytotolytic activities against leukemic targets. It has also been reported by others that CIK cells are cytolytic against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, both in vitro and in the SCID mouse tumor model. In a mouse transplant model across MHC barrier, the CIK cells generated from the donor do not induce graft vs. host disease as observed for unfractionated donor splenocytes. In comparison to untreated control mice, the infusion of CIK cells results in the prolonged survival of murine leukemia-bearing mice. CIK cells also express CD94, part of the NK receptor comprising of CD94-NKG2 heterodimer. However, only low level of the killer immunoglobulin-like receptors are expressed by the CIK cells. In addition, as reported for the classical CTL, CIK cells could interact with dendritic cells (DC) to result in the enhancement of cytotolytic activities against tumor cells. The characteristic biological properties of the CIK cells would, therefore, enable them to be exploited for anti-leukemic therapy.","['Linn, Y C', 'Hui, Kam M']","['Linn YC', 'Hui KM']","['Singapore General Hospital, Outram Road, Singapore and National Cancer Centre, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Animals', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'CD56 Antigen/analysis', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects/immunology', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/transplantation', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/*immunology/transplantation', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2003/10/21 05:00,2004/03/24 05:00,['2003/10/21 05:00'],"['2003/10/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/21 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190309178764 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Sep;44(9):1457-62. doi: 10.3109/10428190309178764.,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",37,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunological evaluation by flow cytometry (FCM) is one of the most attractive approaches to this. The present review summarizes the historical development of this approach over the last 20 years, and shows that current methodology is based on the existence of leukemia-associated patterns of derangement in antigen expression with respect to normal differentiation or location of occurrence. Recent clinical studies are summarized which proved that FCM is applicable to more than 90% of patients with ALL and gives prognostic information comparable to polymerase chain-reaction (PCR)-based technology. Ongoing efforts based on parallel application of both technologies are explained which are designed to clarify which approach bears the best cost-relevance ratio in order to be broadly used in the future for risk assessment and tailoring of treatment modalities. Concluding perspectives relate to further technical developments like usage of peripheral blood (PB) instead of bone marrow (BM), absolute quantification, or strategic placement of investigative time-points, which may allow to simplify the MRD approach and thus augment it's economic efficiency.","['Dworzak, Michael N', 'Panzer-Grumayer, Eva R']","['Dworzak MN', 'Panzer-Grumayer ER']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St Anna Kinderspital, Kinderspitalgasse 6, A-1090 Vienna, Austria. dworzak@ccri.univie.ac.at""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods/trends', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2003/10/21 05:00,2004/03/24 05:00,['2003/10/21 05:00'],"['2003/10/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/21 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190309178763 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Sep;44(9):1445-55. doi: 10.3109/10428190309178763.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",84,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In previous reports, the alcohol metabolite of IDA, 4-demethoxydaunorubicinol (idarubicinol, or IDOL), had cytotoxic activity and the ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. For this reason, the Pediatric Oncology Group conducted a Phase 2 trial of IDA for children with recurrent or progressive brain tumors. Ninety-one eligible children were entered on this study, with ages ranging from 3 months to 19 years. Patients were stratified by tumor types into 6 categories: stratum 1, low-grade astrocytoma; stratum 2, malignant glioma (glioblastoma multiforme and anaplastic astrocytoma); stratum 3, medulloblastoma; stratum 4, brainstem glioma; stratum 5, ependymoma; and stratum 6, miscellaneous malignant tumors not included in the previous diagnoses. IDA(18 mg/m2) was infused over 4 h and followed by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) beginning day 5 after infusion of IDA. G-CSF was continued until blood cell count recovery. Cycles were repeated at approximately 21-day intervals until patients developed progressive disease or had completed 6 cycles with stable or improved disease. Pharmacokinetic plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected from a subset of these patients. Response was poor in all strata. Most patients developed progressive disease; however, in 21 patients with medulloblastoma there was 1 partial response, and 6 patients had stable disease (SD) that in 4 patients lasted more than 20 weeks. Grades 3/4 hematopoietic toxicities were the most common toxic events, and 14 infection-related events resulted in hospitalization of patients. Only 1 patient developed reduced cardiac function. The systemic clearance data for IDA and IDOL were nearly identical to those published on patients with leukemia, and the plasma elimination of the IDOL metabolite was substantially longer than that of the parent drug IDA. The peak CSF:plasma ratios of IDA and IDOL were very low. The overall response rates to IDA were disappointing despite periods of prolonged SD in nearly a fourth of the patients. We conclude from this data and from that in nonhuman primates that it is unlikely that IDA, daunomycin, or other related anthracyclines will be useful for treating primary CNS tumors.","['Dreyer, ZoAnn E', 'Kadota, Richard P', 'Stewart, Clinton F', 'Friedman, Henry S', 'Mahoney, Donald H', 'Kun, Larry E', 'McCluggage, Charles W', 'Burger, Peter C', 'Kepner, James', 'Heideman, Richard L']","['Dreyer ZE', 'Kadota RP', 'Stewart CF', 'Friedman HS', 'Mahoney DH', 'Kun LE', 'McCluggage CW', 'Burger PC', 'Kepner J', 'Heideman RL']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Texas Children's Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicina, Houston, TX 77030, USA. zdreyer@bcm.tmc.edu""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",,England,Neuro Oncol,Neuro-oncology,100887420,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Male']",2003/10/21 05:00,2003/12/13 05:00,['2003/10/21 05:00'],"['2003/10/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/21 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1215/S115285170200056X [doi]'],ppublish,Neuro Oncol. 2003 Oct;5(4):261-7. doi: 10.1215/S115285170200056X.,['ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)'],,['Pediatric Oncology Group'],,,,,,,PMC1920677,,,,,

We have previously shown that human dendritic cells transduced with an adeno-associated virus vector encoding the fusion region of the b3a2 splice variant (p210(b3a2)) of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein elicit specific T-cell responses in vitro. Two cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones generated in this fashion displayed restriction with previously unreported HLA alleles. The first, T1/B9, was CD4(+) and restricted by DRB5*0101 (autologous) or DRB1*1101 (allogeneic). The minimum cytotoxic epitope (MCE) binding to DRB5*0101 for this clone was identified as FKQSSKALQ, overlapping the p210(b3a2) fusion point (boldface). The MCE of DRB1*1101 for this clone differed from DRB5*0101, but also included the fusion point. The clonality of CTL T1/B9 was verified by analyses of TCRalpha/beta chain usage and DNA sequence analyses. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a single clone recognizing both DRB5*0101 and DRB1*1101. The other CTL clone, T1/33, was CD8+ and recognized HLA-B*3501 or B*3503 complexed with an MCE, RPVASDFEP, derived from the c-abl sequence in proximity to the p210(b3a2) fusion point. K562 cells transfected with plasmids encoding HLA-DRA + B5*0101, B*3501, or B*3503 but not controls expressing DRA + DRB1*1501 were lysed by cognate CTL clones, confirming that DRB5*0101 and B*3501/3 could present p210(b3a2) joining region epitopes via endogenous processing. The identification of three additional HLA alleles (DRB5*0101, B*3501, and B*3503) presenting the p210(b3a2) fusion-region antigen will broaden the application of vaccine strategies for targeting CML cells. The findings of single CTL clones cross-recognizing autologous (DRB5*0101 or B*3501) and allogeneic (DRB1*1101 or B*3503) HLA alleles presenting BCR-ABL fusion-region epitopes implies the potential separation of graft-versus-leukemia from graft-versus-host effects.","['Sun, Ji-Yao', 'Senitzer, David', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Chatterjee, Saswati', 'Wong, K K Jr']","['Sun JY', 'Senitzer D', 'Forman SJ', 'Chatterjee S', 'Wong KK Jr']","['Division of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center and Beckman Research Institute, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20031017,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', '*Antigen Presentation', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/genetics', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*immunology', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*immunology', 'HLA-DRB1 Chains', 'HLA-DRB5 Chains', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2003/10/18 05:00,2004/01/15 05:00,['2003/10/18 05:00'],"['2003/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2003/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/10/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-003-0415-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2003 Dec;52(12):761-70. doi: 10.1007/s00262-003-0415-6.

After a section on methodological aspects, they described the importance of urine sediment examination in various diseases of the urinary tract. These included bladder B-lymphoma, systemic histoplasmosis, urate nephropathy, Fabry disease, myeloma cast nephropathy, giant cell arteritis, and lupus nephritis. The significance of 'decoy cells' in the urine as a marker of polyomavirus BK reactivation was also discussed, both in renal transplantation and other conditions such as solitary pancreas transplantation, chronic lymphatic leukaemia, and HIV infection. In the section devoted to urine sediment changes caused by drugs the authors dealt with leukocyturia induced by indinavir, and crystalluria, which can follow amoxycillin and acyclovir administration. Finally, they reported on the utility and limits of flow cytometry for the automated analysis of urine sediments.

Much of the toxicity is a direct consequence of the intensity of the conditioning regimen. It has gradually been recognized that the conditioning regimen is important but not critical for the success of transplantation, particularly in the less aggressive hematologic malignancies. The graft-versus-malignancy effect, that is, the recognition of residual cancer cells by the T cells of the donor, is a critical component of the transplantation process. RECENT FINDINGS: This effect has been emphasized over high-dose therapy by using less intensive, and therefore less toxic conditioning regimens, thus allowing the graft-versus-malignancy effect to predominate. Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens have allowed the application of transplantation to older patients and to patients with underlying medical problems that preclude full-dose transplantation. SUMMARY: Although the long-term results of this type of approach have not yet been defined, it appears to be effective in diseases such as chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and low-grade lymphomas that are not intrinsically very aggressive. Although the therapy appears to be valuable, concerns about delayed immune reconstitution and graft-versus-host disease remain.","['Antin, Joseph H']",['Antin JH'],"['Stem Cell Transplantation Program, Dana-Faber Cancer Institute, Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Brigham, MA, USA. jantin@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['*Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2003/10/18 05:00,2004/07/28 05:00,['2003/10/18 05:00'],"['2003/10/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00062752-200311000-00008 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2003 Nov;10(6):440-4. doi: 10.1097/00062752-200311000-00008.,,44,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AT heterozygotes have a population frequency of about 1%, and although not manifesting any overt clinical symptoms, they have an increased mortality, mainly because of cancer and ischemic heart disease. We and others have described a mature T lymphocyte population with an altered T cell receptor surface expression (""TCR variant"") that reactivates the recombination activating genes (RAG) and is expanded in the blood of patients with AT. In view of the known role of V(D)J recombination in the onset of tumorigenic translocations, we proposed that the increased RAG activity was responsible for the predisposition of AT homozygotes to develop mature-type T leukemia/lymphoma. In the present report, we used cytofluorimetry to quantify the TCR variant population and the memory/naive T-cell compartments in the blood of AT heterozygotes compared with AT patients and controls. We assessed the expression of different recombinase genes through RT-PCR/oligotyping and cytofluorometric analysis and searched for rearrangement intermediates by ligase-mediated PCR in T-cell lines from four heterozygous carriers. We found the TCR variant population was increased on average 2x in AT heterozygotes (vs 10x in homozygotes) compared with controls, and naive CD4(+) T lymphocytes were reduced on average 0.5x (vs 0.1x in homozygotes). We were able to demonstrate recombinase gene expression in all four heterozygous T-cell lines, and rearrangement intermediates, indicative of ongoing V(D)J recombination, in two. These rearrangements were compatible with V-gene replacement, a mechanism of receptor editing described for Ig and TCRalpha genes, to our knowledge not previously documented for TCRbeta. In conclusion, we found that RAG reactivation and secondary V(D)J rearrangements, potential risk factors of mature-type leukemia in AT homozygotes, also take place in AT heterozygous carriers and might place this large population fraction at an increased risk of leukemia/lymphoma.","['Lantelme, Erica', 'Turinetto, Valentina', 'Mantovani, Stefania', 'Marchi, Antonietta', 'Regazzoni, Silvia', 'Porcedda, Paola', 'De Marchi, Mario', 'Giachino, Claudia']","['Lantelme E', 'Turinetto V', 'Mantovani S', 'Marchi A', 'Regazzoni S', 'Porcedda P', 'De Marchi M', 'Giachino C']","['Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Orbassano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia/*genetics/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Heterozygote', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Recombinases', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology']",2003/10/18 05:00,2003/11/07 05:00,['2003/10/18 05:00'],"['2003/10/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.lab.0000092228.51605.6a [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Invest. 2003 Oct;83(10):1467-75. doi: 10.1097/01.lab.0000092228.51605.6a.,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Recombinases)', '128559-51-3 (RAG-1 protein)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we show that the absence of MHC class II expression in leukemic T cells was due to a lack of expression of CIITA, whereas in T-lymphoma cells, expression of CIITA correlated with expression of MHC class II. Interestingly, activation of a CIITA-promoter (P)III-reporter construct was not affected in leukemic T cells. This revealed that the absence of endogenous CIITA expression was not caused by a lack of transcription factors critical for CIITA-PIII activation but suggests the involvement of an epigenetic silencing mechanism. Subsequent analysis showed that the lack of human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) expression correlated with hypermethylation of CIITA-PIII in leukemic T-cell lines and in primary T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and a T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL). Treatment of leukemic T-cell lines with a demethylation agent showed re-expression of CIITA-PIII and HLA-DRA. Furthermore, in vitro methylation of CIITA-PIII and subsequent assessment of CIITA-PIII activity in Jurkat leukemic T cells resulted in reduction of constitutive and CREB-1 (cyclic adenosine monophosphate [cAMP]-response element binding protein 1)-induced promoter activity.

Brd2 is a nuclear-localized transcription factor kinase that is most closely related to TATA box binding protein-associated factor, 250 kDa (TAF(II)250) and the Drosophila developmental protein female sterile homeotic. Constitutive expression of BRD2 in the lymphoid compartment increases cyclin A transcription, ""priming"" transgenic B cells for proliferation. Mice stochastically develop an aggressive B-cell lymphoma with the features of B-1 cells, including CD5 and surface IgM expression. The B-cell lymphoma is monoclonal for immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and is phenotypically stable. The lymphoblasts are very large and express a transcriptome that is similar to human non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Both a wild-type BRD2 transgene and a kinase-null point mutant drive lymphomagenesis; therefore we propose that, rather than kinase activity, Brd2-mediated recruitment of E2 promoter binding factors (E2Fs) and a specific histone acetyltransferase to the cyclin A promoter by both types of transgene is a mechanistic basis for neoplasia.

The biology of AML is incompletely understood, but much data indicates that older patients have a more biologically diverse and chemotherapy resistant form of AML that is quite different from that seen in the younger patients. Approximately 60% of AML cases are in patients greater than 60 years of age, so the predominant burden is in older patients. This problem will be magnified in the future, because the US population is both growing and aging. When one examines the treatment outcomes of older AML patients over the last three decades, there is little progress in long-term survival. Nine major published randomized placebo controlled trials of myeloid growth factors given during induction for AML have been conducted. All of these trials with one exception demonstrated no significant impact on the clinical outcomes of complete response (CR) rate, disease-free, and overall survival. However, the duration of neutropenia was consistently and uniformly reduced by the use of growth factor in all nine of these trials. Because of the favorable impact of the colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) on resource use, antibiotic days, hospital days, etc., it can be more economical and beneficial to use CSFs in AML than to withhold use. The overall dismal outlook for the older AML patient can only be altered by clinical trials with new therapeutic agents. New cellular and molecularly targeted agents are entering clinical trials and bring hope for progress to this area of cancer therapy.","['Godwin, John E', 'Smith, Scott E']","['Godwin JE', 'Smith SE']","['Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Loyola University Chicago, 2160 South First Avenue, Maywood, IL 60153, USA. jgodwin@lumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/etiology/mortality', 'Survival Analysis']",2003/10/18 05:00,2004/07/09 05:00,['2003/10/18 05:00'],"['2003/10/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1040842803001938 [pii]', '10.1016/j.critrevonc.2003.04.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2003 Oct 15;48(Suppl):S17-26. doi: 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2003.04.007.,['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)'],57,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the absence of pseudogenes and the level and stability of the CG expression, three genes were finally selected: Abelson (ABL), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), and beta-glucuronidase (GUS). A multicenter prospective study on normal (n=126) and diagnostic leukemic (n=184) samples processed the same day has established reference values for the CG expression. A multicenter retrospective study on over 250 acute and chronic leukemia samples obtained at diagnosis and with an identified FG transcript confirmed that the three CGs had a stable expression in the different types of samples. However, only ABL gene transcript expression did not differ significantly between normal and leukemic samples at diagnosis. We therefore propose to use the ABL gene as CG for RQ-PCR-based diagnosis and MRD detection in leukemic patients. Overall, these data are not only eligible for quantification of fusion gene transcripts, but also for the quantification of aberrantly expressed genes.","['Beillard, E', 'Pallisgaard, N', 'van der Velden, V H J', 'Bi, W', 'Dee, R', 'van der Schoot, E', 'Delabesse, E', 'Macintyre, E', 'Gottardi, E', 'Saglio, G', 'Watzinger, F', 'Lion, T', 'van Dongen, J J M', 'Hokland, P', 'Gabert, J']","['Beillard E', 'Pallisgaard N', 'van der Velden VH', 'Bi W', 'Dee R', 'van der Schoot E', 'Delabesse E', 'Macintyre E', 'Gottardi E', 'Saglio G', 'Watzinger F', 'Lion T', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Hokland P', 'Gabert J']","['Department of Hematological Biology, Institute Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Archives', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Europe', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reference Values', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods/standards', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2003/10/17 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/10/17 05:00'],"['2003/10/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403136 [doi]', '2403136 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Dec;17(12):2474-86. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403136.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The abnormal expression was returned back to the normal levels as soon as these patients reconstituted their hematopoiesis following transplantation of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells. The aims of this study were: (1) to define population(s) of cells overexpressing FGFR-3, and (2) to determine the expression of FGFR-3 during the clinical course of the disease. We show that the vast majority of FGFR-3 transcripts as well as FGFR-3 protein arise from CD34+ BCR-ABL+ cells. Although increased levels of FGFR-3 were found in majority of late chronic phase patients treated with interferon alpha or hydroxyurea, the expression of FGFR-3 was always lowered following treatment with BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571. Compared to unstimulated cells, high levels of FGFR-3 were also identified in CD34+ cells from granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized blood stem cell harvests from healthy donors, suggesting a potential growth factor-dependent basis for elevated expression of FGFR-3 in CML. These findings have implications for the involvement of FGFR-3 in malignant hematopoiesis and depict FGFR-3 tyrosine kinase in CD34+ leukemic cells as a possible target for tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Dvorak, P', 'Dvorakova, D', 'Doubek, M', 'Faitova, J', 'Pacholikova, J', 'Hampl, A', 'Mayer, J']","['Dvorak P', 'Dvorakova D', 'Doubek M', 'Faitova J', 'Pacholikova J', 'Hampl A', 'Mayer J']","['Department of Molecular Embryology, Institute of Experimental Medicine, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology/*physiopathology', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/*genetics']",2003/10/17 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/10/17 05:00'],"['2003/10/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403152 [doi]', '2403152 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Dec;17(12):2418-25. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403152.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the juxtamembrane domain and mutations in the second tyrosine kinase domain of the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene represent the most frequent genetic alterations in AML. However, such mutations per se appear to be insufficient for leukemic transformation. To evaluate whether both AML1 and FLT3 mutations contribute to leukemogenesis, we analyzed mutations of these genes in AML M0 subtype in whom AML1 mutations were predominantly observed. Of 51 patients, eight showed a mutation in the Runt domain of the AML1 gene: one heterozygous missense mutation with normal function, five heterozygous frameshift mutations and two biallelic nonsense or frameshift mutations, resulting in haploinsufficiency or complete loss of the AML1 activities. On the other hand, a total of 10 of 49 patients examined had the FLT3 mutation. We detected the FLT3 mutation in five of eight (63%) patients with AML1 mutation, whereas five of 41 (12%) without AML1 mutation showed the FLT3 mutation (P=0.0055). These observations suggest that reduced AML1 activities predispose cells to the acquisition of the activating FLT3 mutation as a secondary event leading to full transformation in AML M0.","['Matsuno, N', 'Osato, M', 'Yamashita, N', 'Yanagida, M', 'Nanri, T', 'Fukushima, T', 'Motoji, T', 'Kusumoto, S', 'Towatari, M', 'Suzuki, R', 'Naoe, T', 'Nishii, K', 'Shigesada, K', 'Ohno, R', 'Mitsuya, H', 'Ito, Y', 'Asou, N']","['Matsuno N', 'Osato M', 'Yamashita N', 'Yanagida M', 'Nanri T', 'Fukushima T', 'Motoji T', 'Kusumoto S', 'Towatari M', 'Suzuki R', 'Naoe T', 'Nishii K', 'Shigesada K', 'Ohno R', 'Mitsuya H', 'Ito Y', 'Asou N']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Frameshift Mutation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2003/10/17 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/10/17 05:00'],"['2003/10/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403160 [doi]', '2403160 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Dec;17(12):2492-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403160.,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify the target antigen of these T cells, we constructed a synthetic peptide library dedicated to bind HLA DPw4, and identified a mimicry epitope recognized by the T-cell clone. With this epitope, the recognition motif of the T-cell clone was deduced and a peptide of human synaptojanin 2 (Syn 2) was identified that stimulated the HCL-reactive T-cell clone. Both Northern and Western blot analyses showed that Syn 2 expression was increased in HCL samples compared to other B cells. Besides, the Syn 2-expressing cell line AML193, with the introduced restrictive HLA-DPw4 molecules, was recognized by the HCL-specific T-cell clone. These results indicate that Syn 2 is a target of autoreactive HCL-specific T cells.

We observed an upregulation of the TNFR apoptosis-inducing ligand Fas, and in contrast to CD40L-induced protection, an enhancement of lymphoma sensitivity to Fas-induced apoptosis. LIGHT triggering increased lymphoma cell recognition in a mixed lymphocyte response. In conclusion, LIGHT-mediated triggering renders B-cell lymphomas more immunogenic and sensitive to apoptosis, without inducing proliferation. Since LIGHT triggering also enhances the functions of T-lymphocytes and dendritic cells, it could be a unique way to restore an efficient cancer control by its pleiotropic effects on immune effectors and tumor cells.","['Costello, R T', 'Mallet, F', 'Barbarat, B', 'Schiano De Colella, J-M', 'Sainty, D', 'Sweet, R W', 'Truneh, A', 'Olive, D']","['Costello RT', 'Mallet F', 'Barbarat B', 'Schiano De Colella JM', 'Sainty D', 'Sweet RW', 'Truneh A', 'Olive D']","['Centre Lutte Contre Cancer, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'CD40 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/immunology', 'Cell Death/immunology', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*genetics', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 14', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",2003/10/17 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/10/17 05:00'],"['2003/10/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403175 [doi]', '2403175 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Dec;17(12):2500-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403175.,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 14)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (TNFRSF14 protein, human)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test the role of telomerase in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we expressed the telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene, a dominant-negative hTERT (DN-hTERT) (D868A, D869A) gene, or a gene encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP) in the leukemia cell line K562 and in primary AML cells from different patients, using retroviral vectors. Cells transduced with hTERT exhibited elevated levels of telomerase activity compared to GFP controls, whereas cells expressing DN-hTERT had decreased telomerase activity. K562 populations transduced with DN-hTERT showed reduced clonogenicity, telomere dysfunction and increased numbers of apoptotic cells compared to GFP- or hTERT-transduced cells. Two of four clones transduced with DN-hTERT died after 30 and 53 population doublings, respectively. Transduced AML cells were tested in primary colony-forming unit (CFU) and suspension culture assays. Relative to hTERT- and GFP-transduced controls, AML cells transfected with DN-hTERT produced fewer CFU and showed lower engraftment after transplantation into sublethally irradiated beta(2)-m(-/-) nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice. We conclude that telomerase is limiting the growth of the leukemic cell line K562 and primary AML progenitor cells.

We now use microarray analysis to identify patterns of gene expression in BLIN-3 that may modulate MLL/AF4 oncogenesis and contribute to the retention of normal B-lineage developmental characteristics. Comparison of 6815 expressed genes in BLIN-3 with published microarray data on leukemic blasts from t(4;11) patients indicated that BLIN-3 was unique in lacking the expression of certain HOX-A cluster genes. These results were validated by RT-PCR showing no expression of HOX A7 or HOX A9 in BLIN-3.

To examine whether the activation of tyrosine kinases occurs in factor-independent mutants in vivo, the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from 14 factor-independent mutants of a GM-CSF-dependent cell line (TF-1) were analysed. These mutants did not secrete any growth-stimulating activity for TF-1 cells, suggesting that activation of intracellular signaling rather than an autocrine stimulation by secreted growth factors is responsible for their factor-independent growth. In 11 out of 14 GM-CSF-independent mutants analysed, a constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 60 kDa was detected, which was subsequently identified as p60(c-Src). The kinase activity of p60(c-Src) was increased up to 12-fold in these mutants, which was at least in part due to overexpression of the c-src gene on the RNA and protein level. The Src substrate Sam68 showed an increased phosphorylation in mutants with high Src activity, suggesting that p60(c-Src) triggers downstream signaling in these cells. Treatment of the factor-independent mutants with the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 resulted in a reduced proliferation, demonstrating that Src kinases are essential for these cells for maximal proliferation. Further analysis of factor-independent mutants with low or undetectable Src activity revealed a constitutive phosphorylation of the common beta chain of the GM-CSF receptor and STAT5. Our data indicate an increase in the expression and total activity of endogenous p60(c-Src) in several GM-CSF-independent TF-1 mutants, further underlining the role of Src in the process of autonomous growth of hematopoietic cells.","['Horn, Stefan', 'Meyer, Johann', 'Stocking, Carol', 'Ostertag, Wolfram', 'Jucker, Manfred']","['Horn S', 'Meyer J', 'Stocking C', 'Ostertag W', 'Jucker M']","['Zentrum fur Experimentelle Medizin, Institut fur Biochemie und Molekularbiologie I, Zellulare Signaltransduktion, Universitatsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mutagenesis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/10/17 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/17 05:00'],"['2003/10/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206856 [doi]', '1206856 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Oct 16;22(46):7170-80. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206856.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src))']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Simultaneous exposure (24 h) of U937 myelomonocytic leukemia cells to 100 nM flavopiridol and 300 nM MG-132 resulted in a marked increase in mitochondrial injury (cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO release, loss of deltaPsi(m)), caspase activation, and synergistic induction of cell death, accompanied by a marked decrease in clonogenic potential. Similar effects were observed with other proteasome inhibitors (e.g., Bortezomib (VELCADE trade mark bortezomib or injection), lactacystin, LLnL) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (e.g., roscovitine), as well as other leukemia cell types (e.g., HL-60, Jurkat, Raji). In U937 cells, synergistic interactions between MG-132 and flavopiridol were associated with multiple perturbations in expression/activation of signaling- and survival-related proteins, including downregulation of XIAP and Mcl-1, activation of JNK and p34(cdc2), and diminished expression of p21(CIP1). The lethal effects of MG-132/flavopiridol were not reduced in leukemic cells ectopically expressing Bcl-2, but were partially attenuated in cells ectopically expressing dominant-negative caspase-8 or CrmA. Flavopiridol/proteasome inhibitor-mediated lethality was also significantly diminished by agents and siRNA blocking JNK activation. Lastly, coadministration of MG-132 with flavopiridol resulted in diminished DNA binding of NF-kappaB. Notably, pharmacologic interruption of the NF-kappaB pathway (e.g., by BAY 11-7082, PDTC, or SN-50) or molecular dysregulation of NF-kappaB (i.e., in cells ectopically expressing an IkappaBalpha super-repressor) mimicked the actions of proteasome inhibitors in promoting flavopiridol-induced mitochondrial injury, JNK activation, and apoptosis. Together, these findings indicate that proteasome inhibitors strikingly lower the apoptotic threshold of leukemic cells exposed to pharmacologic CDK inhibitors, and suggest that interruption of the NF-kappaB cytoprotective pathway and JNK activation both play key roles in this phenomenon. They also raise the possibility that combining proteasome and CDK inhibitors could represent a novel antileukemic strategy.","['Dai, Yun', 'Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Grant, Steven']","['Dai Y', 'Rahmani M', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Anisomycin/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Boronic Acids/pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Leupeptins/*pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2003/10/17 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/17 05:00'],"['2003/10/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206863 [doi]', '1206863 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Oct 16;22(46):7108-22. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206863.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '6C74YM2NGI (Anisomycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",,,,"['CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Strategies to help define the optimal therapeutic usage of rituximab are being assessed, including first-line and maintenance or extended therapy, and the combination of rituximab with chemotherapy in indolent NHL. Emerging data suggest that earlier use may yield higher response rates, extended therapy can prolong remission, and the addition of rituximab to chemotherapy can increase clinical and molecular remission rates when compared with those achieved using chemotherapy alone.

To evaluate whether bone marrow microenvironment is altered by chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and to determine its contribution to postchemotherapy anemia, we investigated the ability of stroma from children receiving maintenance chemotherapy for ALL to support hematopoiesis. Long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMC) were established with bone marrow cells either from ALL children under therapy (n = 24) or from control subjects (n = 19). Nonadherent cells and colony forming units-granulocytic monocytic (CFU-GM) output in LTBMC did not differ between patients and controls. In contrast, burst forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) numbers were lower in patient LTBMC (p = 0.013). Co-cultures of normal CD34+ cells and preformed patient or control stromas showed significantly reduced hematopoietic supportive capabilities of patient stromas: both CFU-GM and BFU-E were reduced (p = 0.002 and 0.046, respectively). In addition, supernatants (SN) of patients' LTBMC inhibited normal BFU-E growth compared with SN of normal LTBMC. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 levels were increased in patient cultures (p = 0.0039) and inversely correlated with BFU-E produced in LTBMC (r = -0.36, p = 0.04). Neutralization of TGF-beta1 significantly increased the BFU-E output of patient LTBMC (p = 0.0078). In contrast, macrophage inflammatory peptide (MIP)-1alpha levels were lower in SN of patients compared with controls (p = 0.015). Thus, chemotherapy for ALL induces functional deregulation within bone marrow stromal cells with an increase in the growth-inhibiting factor TGF-beta1, together with a decrease in MIP-1alpha, which might contribute to hematopoietic toxicity.","['Corazza, Francis', 'Hermans, Christophe', 'Ferster, Alina', 'Fondu, Pierre', 'Demulder, Anne', 'Sariban, Eric']","['Corazza F', 'Hermans C', 'Ferster A', 'Fondu P', 'Demulder A', 'Sariban E']","['Laboratory of Hematology, Brugmann University Hospital, 1020 Brussels, Belgium. francis.corazza@ulb.ac.be']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20031015,United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,IM,"['Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL3', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/immunology', 'Mercaptopurine/adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Stromal Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1']",2003/10/17 05:00,2004/08/04 05:00,['2003/10/17 05:00'],"['2003/10/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1203/01.PDR.0000099773.71438.91 [doi]', '01.PDR.0000099773.71438.91 [pii]']",ppublish,Pediatr Res. 2004 Jan;55(1):152-8. doi: 10.1203/01.PDR.0000099773.71438.91.

In most cases this results in fusion of the N terminus of Nup98 to the DNA binding domain of a homeodomain transcription factor. The prototype of these fusions, Nup98-HOXA9, is associated with human AML and induces AML in mouse models. To understand the mechanisms by which Nup98-HOXA9 causes AML, we expressed it in myeloid cells and identified its target genes using high density oligonucleotide microarrays. The analysis was performed in triplicate and was confirmed by quantitative real time PCR. Of the 102 Nup98-HOXA9 target genes identified, 92 were up-regulated, and only 10 were down-regulated, suggesting a transcriptional activation function. A similar analysis of wild-type HOXA9 revealed 13 target genes, 12 of which were up-regulated, and 1 was down-regulated. In contrast, wild-type Nup98 had no effect on gene expression, demonstrating that the HOXA9 DNA binding domain is required for gene regulation. Co-transfection experiments using a luciferase reporter linked to the promoter of one of the Nup98-HOXA9 target genes confirmed up-regulation at the transcriptional level by Nup98-HOXA9 but not by either HOXA9 or Nup98.

High birth weight is one of the few birth-related factors that has been associated with childhood leukemia, albeit not consistently. The authors conducted a meta-analysis of studies of the association between birth weight and childhood leukemia risk. Study-specific odds ratios for leukemia were calculated, using a cutoff at 4,000 g of birth weight. The authors also evaluated whether the association between birth weight and leukemia followed a log-linear dose-response-like pattern. They calculated summary estimates using weighted averages of study-specific odds ratios from dichotomous and trend analyses. Eighteen studies (published between 1962 and 2002) were included, encompassing 10,282 children with leukemia. Children weighing 4,000 g or more at birth were at higher risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia than children weighing less (odds ratio (OR) = 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17, 1.37). Furthermore, data were consistent with a dose-response-like effect (OR = 1.14/1,000-g birth weight increase, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.20). Studies of acute myeloid leukemia indicated a similar increase in risk for children weighing 4,000 g or more at birth (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.73, 2.20) and a dose-response-like effect (OR = 1.29/1,000 g, 95% CI: 0.80, 2.06), but results varied across studies. Our findings support a relation between birth weight and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk and emphasize the need for additional studies of the biologic mechanisms underlying this association.","['Hjalgrim, Lisa Lyngsie', 'Westergaard, Tine', 'Rostgaard, Klaus', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Melbye, Mads', 'Hjalgrim, Henrik', 'Engels, Eric A']","['Hjalgrim LL', 'Westergaard T', 'Rostgaard K', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Melbye M', 'Hjalgrim H', 'Engels EA']","['Department of Epidemiology Research, Danish Epidemiology Science Center, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.

Rotenone-induced apoptosis is considered to contribute to its anticancer effect and the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). We demonstrated that rotenone induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, DNA ladder formation, in human cultured cells, HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia) and BJAB cells (B-cell lymphoma). Flow cytometry showed that rotenone induced H2O2 generation, followed by significant changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim). Caspase-3 activity increased in HL-60 cells in a time-dependent manner. These apoptotic events were delayed in HP100 cells, an H2O2-resistant clone of HL-60, confirming the involvement of H2O2 in apoptosis. Expression of anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, in BJAB cells drastically inhibited DeltaPsim change and DNA ladder formation but not H2O2 generation, confirming the participation of mitochondrial dysfunction in apoptosis. NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitors prevented H2O2 generation and DNA ladder formation. These results suggest that rotenone induces O2(-)-derived H2O2 generation through inhibition of NADH dehydrogenase complex and/or activation of NAD(P)H oxidase, and H2O2 generation causes the disruption of mitochondrial membrane in rotenone-induced apoptosis.","['Tada-Oikawa, Saeko', 'Hiraku, Yusuke', 'Kawanishi, Michiko', 'Kawanishi, Shosuke']","['Tada-Oikawa S', 'Hiraku Y', 'Kawanishi M', 'Kawanishi S']","['Department of Environmental and Molecular Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, 2-174 Edobashi, -Tsu-shi, Mie, 514-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Insecticides/*pharmacology', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'NADH Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidases/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Rotenone/*pharmacology']",2003/10/17 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/17 05:00'],"['2003/10/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0024320503008063 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lfs.2003.06.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2003 Nov 7;73(25):3277-88. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2003.06.013.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Insecticides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '03L9OT429T (Rotenone)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.99.3 (NADH Dehydrogenase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neutropenia and its complications, including febrile neutropenia (FN), remain the major dose-limiting toxicity of systemic cancer chemotherapy. Although under-reported, FN often occurs early in the course of chemotherapy and contributes substantially to the morbidity, mortality, and cost of treatment. The risk of FN and its complications are associated with treatment intensity, age, and various comorbidities. Myeloid growth factors (MGFs) have been used effectively in a variety of clinical settings to prevent or treat FN and assist patients receiving dose-intensive chemotherapy with or without stem cell support. A meta-analysis of the available randomized controlled trials has confirmed the efficacy of prophylactic MGFs. The cost of these agents, along with their large-scale clinical use, has prompted several economic investigations. Economic models based on measures of resource use derived from randomized controlled trials have provided estimates of expected treatment costs, along with FN risk threshold estimates for the cost-saving use of prophylactic MGF. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential value of targeting MGFs toward patients at greatest risk based on accurate and valid predictive models. Although an emerging role has become apparent for MGFs in managing adult leukemia and supporting high-dose therapy with stem cell transplantation in adults, their value in the support of children in these settings remains unclear. Continuing clinical and economic evaluation, along with an updating of clinical practice guidelines because of rapid technologic and clinical advances, is encouraged.","['Lyman, Gary H', 'Kuderer, Nicole M']","['Lyman GH', 'Kuderer NM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Rochester and the James P.

The molecular mechanisms by which bound HK promotes cell survival are not yet fully understood. Our studies relying on the purified mitochondrial outer membrane protein VDAC (voltage-dependent anion channel), isolated mitochondria or cells in culture suggested that the anti-apoptotic activity of HK-I occurs via modulation of the mitochondrial phase of apoptosis. In the present paper, a direct interaction of HK-I with bilayer-reconstituted purified VDAC, inducing channel closure, is demonstrated for the first time. Moreover, HK-I prevented the Ca(2+)-dependent opening of the mitochondrial PTP (permeability transition pore) and release of the pro-apoptotic protein cytochrome c. The effects of HK-I on VDAC activity and PTP opening were prevented by the HK reaction product glucose 6-phosphate, a metabolic intermediate in most biosynthetic pathways. Furthermore, glucose 6-phosphate re-opened both the VDAC and the PTP closed by HK-I. The HK-I-mediated effects on VDAC and PTP were not observed using either yeast HK or HK-I lacking the N-terminal hydrophobic peptide responsible for binding to mitochondria, or in the presence of an antibody specific for the N-terminus of HK-I. Finally, HK-I overexpression in leukaemia-derived U-937 or vascular smooth muscle cells protected against staurosporine-induced apoptosis, with a decrease of up to 70% in cell death. These results offer insight into the mechanisms by which bound HK promotes tumour cell survival, and suggests that its overexpression not only ensures supplies of energy and phosphometabolites, but also reflects an anti-apoptotic defence mechanism.","['Azoulay-Zohar, Heftsi', 'Israelson, Adrian', 'Abu-Hamad, Salah', 'Shoshan-Barmatz, Varda']","['Azoulay-Zohar H', 'Israelson A', 'Abu-Hamad S', 'Shoshan-Barmatz V']","['Department of Life Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva 84105, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Glucose-6-Phosphate/pharmacology', 'Hexokinase/metabolism/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Ion Channels/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Porins/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Voltage-Dependent Anion Channels']",2003/10/17 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/10/17 05:00'],"['2003/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2003/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2003/10/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1042/BJ20031465 [doi]', 'BJ20031465 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2004 Jan 15;377(Pt 2):347-55. doi: 10.1042/BJ20031465.,"['0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore)', '0 (Porins)', '0 (Voltage-Dependent Anion Channels)', '56-73-5 (Glucose-6-Phosphate)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (Hexokinase)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",,,,,,,,,PMC1223882,,,,,

Its biological activities are shared by IL-6-family of cytokines such as leukemia inhibitory factor and oncostatin M. When IL-6 binds to IL-6R, the IL-6/IL-6R complex then associates with gp130, the common signal transducer of cytokines related to IL-6. IL-6R does not have to be expressed on the cell surface for IL-6 signaling because soluble form of IL-6R (sIL-6R) can bind to IL-6 and function through gp130. Increased levels of IL-6 and sIL-6R have been demonstrated in both serum and intestinal tissues of the patients with active Crohn's disease. In animal model studies, anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibody (mAb) successfully prevented intestinal inflammation and systemic wasting disease by suppressing adhesion molecule expression by vascular endothelium. It also reduced colonic expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-1beta, and interferon gamma mRNA without affecting the production of transforming growth factor beta, IL-10, and IL-4. Moreover, the treatment displayed therapeutic efficacy against established colitis through the induction of lamina propria T-cell apoptosis.

We report that the ZAP-70 PTK contains predominately phosphoserine in normal T lymphocytes as well as in Jurkat T leukemia cells. We have identified one site of phosphorylation as Ser-520 and find this site to be important for the recruitment and activation of ZAP-70 in T cells. Mutant ZAP-70-S520A had reduced ability to autophosphorylate and to mediate antigen receptor-induced interleukin 2 gene activation and was not enriched at the plasma membrane. These defects were rescued by addition of a myristylation signal to the N terminus of ZAP-70-S520A to force its plasma membrane and lipid raft localization. We conclude that phosphorylation of ZAP-70 at Ser-520 plays an important role in the correct localization of ZAP-70 and in priming ZAP-70 for its acute recruitment and activation upon antigen receptor ligation.","['Yang, Yaoming', 'Villain, Patricia', 'Mustelin, Tomas', 'Couture, Clement']","['Yang Y', 'Villain P', 'Mustelin T', 'Couture C']","['Program of Signal Transduction, Burnham Institute, La Jolla, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Serine/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase']",2003/10/16 05:00,2003/12/05 05:00,['2003/10/16 05:00'],"['2003/10/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.23.21.7667-7677.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2003 Nov;23(21):7667-77. doi: 10.1128/MCB.23.21.7667-7677.2003.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",,,,"['AI53585/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI035603/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI35603/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI48032/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI053585/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI048032/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC207614,,,,,

Although presumed to regulate transcription, its target genes are largely unknown. We show here that a nuclear complex containing TAL1, its DNA-binding partner E47, zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, LIM domain protein LMO2, and LIM domain-binding protein Ldb1 transactivates the protein 4.2 (P4.2) gene through two E box GATA elements in its proximal promoter. Binding of this complex to DNA was dependent on the integrity of both E box and GATA sites and was demonstrated to occur on the P4.2 promoter in cells. Maximal transcription in transiently transfected cells required both E box GATA elements and expression of all five components of the complex. This complex was shown, in addition, to be capable of linking in solution double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the two P4.2 E box GATA elements. This DNA-linking activity required Ldb1 and increased with dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. In contrast, enforced expression in MEL cells of dimerization-defective mutant Ldb1, as well as wild-type Ldb1, significantly decreased E box GATA DNA-binding activities, P4.2 promoter activity, and accumulation of P4.2 and beta-globin mRNAs. These studies define a physiologic target for a TAL1- and GATA-1-containing ternary complex and reveal a positive role for Ldb1 in erythroid gene expression and differentiation.","['Xu, Zhixiong', 'Huang, Suming', 'Chang, Long-Sheng', 'Agulnick, Alan D', 'Brandt, Stephen J']","['Xu Z', 'Huang S', 'Chang LS', 'Agulnick AD', 'Brandt SJ']","['Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Blood Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Regulator', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/10/16 05:00,2003/12/05 05:00,['2003/10/16 05:00'],"['2003/10/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.23.21.7585-7599.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2003 Nov;23(21):7585-99. doi: 10.1128/MCB.23.21.7585-7599.2003.,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (LDB1 protein, human)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Ldb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (erythrocyte membrane band 4.2 protein)']",,,,"['R01 HL049118/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL49118/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 MH61406/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC207591,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation between race/ethnicity and survival in a large, population-based analysis of incident ALL cases in the United States. DESIGN, POPULATION, AND SETTING: This study included 4952 individuals diagnosed with ALL between 1973 and 1999 at age 19 years or younger. ALL cases were identified from 9 population-based registries of the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival probabilities were compared among white, black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaskan Native children. Kaplan-Meier curves and proportional hazard ratios from Cox regression analysis were calculated, accounting for treatment era (1973-1982, 1983-1989, and 1990-1999), age at diagnosis (<1, 1-9, and 10-19 years), and sex. RESULTS: Although overall 5-year survival probabilities improved with each successive treatment era, differences according to race/ethnicity persisted. For 1990-1999, 5-year survival was 84% for white children, 81% for Asian/Pacific Islander children, 75% for black children, and 72% for both American Indian/Alaskan Native children and Hispanic children. The largest difference by race/ethnicity was observed among children diagnosed between ages 1 and 9 years. Compared with white children, after adjusting for treatment era, age at diagnosis, and sex, children of black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaskan Native descent had hazard ratios of 1.50 (95% CI, 1.0-2.2; P =.03), 1.83 (95% CI, 1.4-2.4; P<.001), and 1.90 (95% CI, 0.8-4.6; P =.16). CONCLUSIONS: Black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaskan Native children with ALL have worse survival than white and Asian/Pacific Islander children, even in the contemporary treatment era. Future work must delineate the social and biological factors, including any differences in pharmacokinetics associated with chemotherapeutic agents, that account for disparities in outcome.","['Kadan-Lottick, Nina S', 'Ness, Kirsten K', 'Bhatia, Smita', 'Gurney, James G']","['Kadan-Lottick NS', 'Ness KK', 'Bhatia S', 'Gurney JG']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Yale University, New Haven, Conn, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,IM,"['Adolescent', 'African Americans/statistics & numerical data', 'Asian Americans/statistics & numerical data', 'Asians', 'Blacks', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hispanic or Latino/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Indians, North American/statistics & numerical data', 'Infant', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*ethnology/genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'SEER Program', 'Survival Analysis', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Whites/statistics & numerical data']",2003/10/16 05:00,2003/10/24 05:00,['2003/10/16 05:00'],"['2003/10/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1001/jama.290.15.2008 [doi]', '290/15/2008 [pii]']",ppublish,JAMA. 2003 Oct 15;290(15):2008-14. doi: 10.1001/jama.290.15.2008.,,,,,,['JAMA. 2003 Oct 15;290(15):2061-3.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical outcomes of therapy for black and white children with ALL treated at a single institution. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A retrospective analysis of 412 children and adolescents (68 black, 338 white, and 6 other race) with newly diagnosed ALL who were treated consecutively at a pediatric cancer center in Memphis, Tenn. Patients were enrolled from December 1991 to July 1998 in successive Total Therapy studies regardless of race, ethnicity, or ability to pay and received risk-directed therapy according to stringent criteria. INTERVENTIONS: All patients received the same intensive, remission-induction therapy followed by 120 weeks of risk-assigned postremission therapy that included reinduction treatment, pulses of high-dose methotrexate, and early intensification of intrathecal chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Event-free and overall survival rates for black and white children were estimated by the method of Kaplan and Meier and compared with the Mantel-Haenszel test and by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, adjusting for known prognostic factors. RESULTS: The 68 black children were significantly more likely than the 338 white children to have higher-risk prognostic features, including an initial leukocyte count greater than 100 x 10(3)/ microL, a T-cell immunophenotype, and the t(1;19) chromosomal translocation with E2A-PBX1 fusion, and were less likely to have hyperdiploid blast cells, a favorable prognostic factor in childhood ALL. However, the clinical outcomes for these 2 cohorts were not significantly different: 5-year event-free and overall survival rates were 80.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70.3%-91.1%) and 86.2% (95% CI, 77.2%-95.2%) for black children vs 79.4% (95% CI, 74.7%-84.1%) and 85.0% (95% CI, 80.9%-89.1%) for white children. Ten-year results also were comparable, but the CIs were wide because of the small numbers of patients who had been followed up for 10 years or more. The lack of a racial effect on the long-term outcome of therapy was still apparent in a multivariate Cox regression analysis, adjusting for sex, age, presenting leukocyte count, leukemic cell DNA index, immunophenotype, and central nervous system status. CONCLUSION: With equal access to effective antileukemic therapy, black and white children with ALL can expect the same high rate of cure.","['Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Sandlund, John T', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Rivera, Gaston K', 'Howard, Scott C', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Razzouk, Bassem I', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Behm, Frederick G', 'Downing, James R', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Evans, William E']","['Pui CH', 'Sandlund JT', 'Pei D', 'Rivera GK', 'Howard SC', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Razzouk BI', 'Hudson MM', 'Cheng C', 'Raimondi SC', 'Behm FG', 'Downing JR', 'Relling MV', 'Evans WE']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA. ching-hon.pui@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Blacks', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Whites']",2003/10/16 05:00,2003/10/24 05:00,['2003/10/16 05:00'],"['2003/10/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1001/jama.290.15.2001 [doi]', '290/15/2001 [pii]']",ppublish,JAMA. 2003 Oct 15;290(15):2001-7. doi: 10.1001/jama.290.15.2001.,,,,,"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['JAMA. 2003 Oct 15;290(15):2061-3.

The newer generation murine stem cell virus retroviral vector (MSCV) lacks many of the repressive cis-acting DNA sequences identified in Moloney murine leukemia virus but remains sensitive to transcriptional silencing in various cell types. To determine the contribution of cytosine methylation to MSCV silencing, we mutated CpG dinucleotides located in the MSCV long terminal repeat (LTR) that are clustered in the U3 region and directly spanning the transcription start site in the R region. Effects of the CpG mutations on MSCV silencing were assessed in murine embryonic stem cells. An analysis of numerous clonal proviral integrants showed that mutation of CpGs in both clusters eliminated proviral integrants that were completely silenced. Variegated expression was shown to represent a substantial component of intraclonal silencing and was independent of the presence of CpGs in the LTR. Treatment of transduced cells with 5-azadeoxycytidine delayed establishment of the silenced state but had only a modest effect on expression of some proviral integrants at late times post-transduction. These results are direct evidence for a causal contribution of DNA methylation in the LTR to MSCV silencing and define the promoter region CpGs as a repressive element in embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, distinct mechanisms are suggested for establishment and maintenance of the silenced proviral state.","['Swindle, C Scott', 'Kim, Hyung G', 'Klug, Christopher A']","['Swindle CS', 'Kim HG', 'Klug CA']","['Department of Microbiology, Division of Development and Clinical Immunology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama 35294, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20031014,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates/*genetics', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Stem Cells/virology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2003/10/16 05:00,2004/03/05 05:00,['2003/10/16 05:00'],"['2003/10/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M309128200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)52785-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Jan 2;279(1):34-41. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M309128200.

By comparing gene expression patterns in primary p53-/- MEFs acutely infected with the v-Abl retrovirus, v-Abl-transformed MEF clones, and v-Abl-transformed MEF clones treated with Abl kinase inhibitor STI 571, we have identified additional genetic alterations associated with v-Abl transformation.

To characterize time trends in the age- and sex-specific incidence of childhood acute leukemia during the last 20 years in the Nordic countries, we analyzed a large set of population-based data from the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO) in their acute leukemia database covering a population of approximately 5 million children aged 0-14 years. METHODS: Temporal trends in acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia incidence rates overall and for acute lymphoblastic leukemia immunophenotypes and for specific age groups were analyzed by Poisson regression adjusting for age, sex, and country. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: We identified 1595 girls and 1859 boys diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia between January 1, 1982, and December 31, 2001, and 260 girls and 224 boys diagnosed with de novo acute myeloid leukemia between January 1, 1985, and December 31, 2001. No statistically significant change was seen in the overall incidence rate for acute lymphoblastic leukemia during the 20-year study (annual change = 0.22%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.36% to 0.80%). The incidence rate of B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia remained unchanged (annual change = 0.30%, 95% CI = -0.57% to 1.18%) from January 1, 1986, through December 31, 2001. A somewhat lower incidence in the first years of the study period indicated an early increasing incidence of B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia that corresponded to a simultaneous decreasing incidence of unclassified acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Incidences of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (annual change = 1.55%, 95% CI = -1.14% to 4.31%) and acute myeloid leukemia (annual change = 0.58%, 95% CI = -1.24% to 2.44%) were stable during the study period. CONCLUSION: Incidences of acute myeloid leukemia overall, acute lymphoblastic leukemia overall, and specific acute lymphoblastic leukemia immunophenotypes have been stable in the Nordic countries over the past two decades.","['Hjalgrim, Lisa Lyngsie', 'Rostgaard, Klaus', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Soderhall, Stefan', 'Kolmannskog, Svein', 'Vettenranta, Kim', 'Kristinsson, Jon', 'Clausen, Niels', 'Melbye, Mads', 'Hjalgrim, Henrik', 'Gustafsson, Goran']","['Hjalgrim LL', 'Rostgaard K', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Soderhall S', 'Kolmannskog S', 'Vettenranta K', 'Kristinsson J', 'Clausen N', 'Melbye M', 'Hjalgrim H', 'Gustafsson G']","['Department of Epidemiology Research, Danish Epidemiology Science Centre, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark. lih@ssi.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Iceland/epidemiology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries/epidemiology', 'Sex Distribution']",2003/10/16 05:00,2003/10/30 05:00,['2003/10/16 05:00'],"['2003/10/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/djg064 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2003 Oct 15;95(20):1539-44. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djg064.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings were demonstrated at protein and mRNA levels using flow cytometry and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR technique and were verified by digital confocal microscopy and Northern blotting. Thymus-expressed chemokine, a ligand for CCR9, selectively induced T-ALL CD4+ T-cell chemotaxis and adhesion. Interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-4, together, down-regulated the expression and functions of CCR9 in T-ALL CD4+ T cells including chemotaxis and adhesion. It was also demonstrated that IL-2 and IL-4, together, internalized CCR9 on T-ALL CD4+ T cells and subsequently inhibited functions of CCR9 in these cells. Thymus-expressed chemokine mRNA was highly expressed in CD4+ T cells, involving lymph node and skin in T-ALL patients, and was expressed at moderate levels in lymph node and skin tissues in T-CLL patients. Our findings may provide new clues to understanding various aspects of T-ALL CD4+ T cells, such as functional expression of CCR9-thymus-expressed chemokine receptor-ligand pairs as well as the effects of IL-2 and IL-4, which may be especially important in cytokine/chemokine environment for the pathophysiological events of T-ALL CD4+ T-cell trafficking.","['Qiuping, Zhang', 'Qun, Li', 'Chunsong, Hu', 'Xiaolian, Zhang', 'Baojun, Huang', 'Mingzhen, Yang', 'Chengming, Lao', 'Jinshen, He', 'Qingping, Gao', 'Kejian, Zhang', 'Zhimin, Sun', 'Xuejun, Zhang', 'Junyan, Liu', 'Jinquan, Tan']","['Qiuping Z', 'Qun L', 'Chunsong H', 'Xiaolian Z', 'Baojun H', 'Mingzhen Y', 'Chengming L', 'Jinshen H', 'Qingping G', 'Kejian Z', 'Zhimin S', 'Xuejun Z', 'Junyan L', 'Jinquan T']","['Department of Immunology, Medical College, Wuhan University, Dong Hu Road 115, Wuchang 430 071, Wuhan, P.R.

Presently, there is no effective therapy for ATL. A murine model of ATL was produced by introducing leukemic cells (MET-1) from an ATL patient into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice. The MET-1 cells are activated T cells that express CD2, CD3, CD4, CD25, CD122, and CD52. We evaluated the efficacy of Campath-1H (alemtuzumab; a humanized monoclonal antibody directed to CD52), alone and in combination with humanized anti-Tac (HAT) directed to CD25 (interleukin 2 receptor alpha) or with MEDI-507 directed to CD2. We observed that four weekly treatments with 4 mg/kg HAT significantly prolonged survival of MET-1-bearing mice. However, the survival of mice receiving 4 weeks of 4 mg/kg Campath-1H was significantly longer than that of the group receiving four weekly treatments with HAT (P < 0.001). Treatment with Campath-1H for 4 weeks led to a striking prolongation of the survival of MET-1 ATL-bearing mice that was comparable with that of tumor-free nontreated controls. Using Fc receptor (FcR) gamma(-/-) mice, we found that FcRgammas on polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes are required for Campath-1H-mediated tumor killing in vivo. These results demonstrate that Campath-1H has therapeutic efficacy on ATL in vivo in that the life span of the Campath-1H treatment group was comparable with that of mice that did not receive a tumor or therapy. The main tumor killing mechanism with Campath-1H in vivo involves FcRgamma-containing receptors (e.g., FcRgammaIII) on polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages that mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or trigger cross-linking induced apoptosis. This study provides support for a clinical trial of Campath-1H in the treatment of patients with T-cell leukemias and lymphomas.","['Zhang, Zhuo', 'Zhang, Meili', 'Goldman, Carolyn K', 'Ravetch, Jeffrey V', 'Waldmann, Thomas A']","['Zhang Z', 'Zhang M', 'Goldman CK', 'Ravetch JV', 'Waldmann TA']","['Metabolism Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute/NIH, Building 10, Room 4N115, 10 Center Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892-1374, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/immunology/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glycoproteins/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Random Allocation', 'Receptors, IgG/genetics/immunology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2003/10/16 05:00,2003/12/04 05:00,['2003/10/16 05:00'],"['2003/10/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/16 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Oct 1;63(19):6453-7.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resistance toward imatinib develops frequently in advanced-stage Philadelphia-positive leukemia, and is even observed in chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. Point mutations within the BCR-ABL kinase domain emerged as a major mechanism of resistance toward imatinib. Mutations occur at positions that determine specific contacts of imatinib to the ATP-binding site. We aimed to examine whether pyrido-pyrimidine-type kinase inhibitors were capable of inhibiting both wild-type and mutant forms of BCR-ABL. We screened 13 different pyrido-pyrimidine with cells expressing wild-type and mutant BCR-ABL. All of the substances specifically suppressed the Bcr-Abl dependent phenotype and inhibited Bcr-Abl kinase activity with higher potency than imatinib. Two of the most active compounds were PD166326 and SKI DV-M016. Interestingly, these compounds suppressed the activation loop mutant Bcr-Abl H396P as effectively as wild-type Bcr-Abl. In addition, nucleotide-binding loop mutations (Y253H, E255K, and E255V) were selectively and potently inhibited. In contrast, T315I, a mutant located at a position that makes a direct contact with imatinib, was not affected. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that unlike imatinib, pyrido-pyrimidine inhibitors bind Bcr-Abl regardless of the conformation of the activation loop. We conclude that pyrido-pyrimidine-type kinase inhibitors are active against different frequently observed kinase domain mutations of BCR-ABL that cause resistance toward imatinib. Resistance as a consequence of selection of mutant BCR-ABL by imatinib may be overcome using second-generation kinase inhibitors because of their higher potency and their ability to bind Bcr-Abl irrespective of the conformation of the activation loop.","['von Bubnoff, Nikolas', 'Veach, Darren R', 'Miller, W Todd', 'Li, Wanqing', 'Sanger, Jana', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Bornmann, William G', 'Clarkson, Bayard', 'Duyster, Justus']","['von Bubnoff N', 'Veach DR', 'Miller WT', 'Li W', 'Sanger J', 'Peschel C', 'Bornmann WG', 'Clarkson B', 'Duyster J']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Technical University of Munich, Trogerstrasse 32, D-81675 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Point Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2003/10/16 05:00,2003/12/04 05:00,['2003/10/16 05:00'],"['2003/10/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/16 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Oct 1;63(19):6395-404.,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (PD 166326)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,"['P01 CA064593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA058530-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Certain chemical agents can force some tumor cells to resume their differentiation program and undergo cell cycle arrest, an approach termed differentiation therapy. Mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells represent an important cell culture model system for investigating the principles of differentiation therapy. MEL cells are malignant erythroblasts that are blocked from differentiating into mature erythroid cells because of inappropriate expression of the transcription factor PU.1, which binds to and represses GATA-1, a key transcriptional stimulator of red blood cell differentiation. We report here that the block to differentiation in MEL cells can be overcome by providing the cells with additional GATA-1.

To investigate whether expression of PTEN is involved in MDM2-mediated chemoresistance, we examined a set of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines for the expression of PTEN and sensitivity to doxorubicin. Testing 9 ALL cell lines selected for wild-type p53 phenotype and uniformly high levels of MDM2 expression, we initially demonstrated that cell lines with high levels of PTEN expression were sensitive to doxorubicin, whereas lines lacking PTEN expression were generally resistant. Forced expression of PTEN in a PTEN-negative and doxorubicin-resistant ALL line (EU-1) resulted in decreased cell growth and enhanced sensitivity to doxorubicin. Examining the cellular localization of MDM2, we confirmed that the majority of MDM2 is localized in the nucleus in PTEN-negative doxorubicin-sensitive ALL cells, whereas MDM2 is expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm in either PTEN-positive or PTEN-transfected cells. Furthermore, by coimmunoprecipitaton and cotransfection assays, we found that PTEN physically binds p53 in vitro as well as in vivo. Binding of PTEN to p53 attenuated MDM2-mediated p53 inhibition. These results suggest that PTEN inhibits MDM2 and protects p53 through both p13k/Akt-dependent and -independent pathways. Furthermore, loss of PTEN can result in resistance to apoptosis by activating MDM2-mediated antiapoptotic mechanism.","['Zhou, Muxiang', 'Gu, Lubing', 'Findley, Harry W', 'Jiang, Rong', 'Woods, William G']","['Zhou M', 'Gu L', 'Findley HW', 'Jiang R', 'Woods WG']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Emory University School of Medicine, 2040 Ridgewood Drive N.E., Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. mzhou@emory.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'DNA Damage', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism']",2003/10/16 05:00,2003/12/04 05:00,['2003/10/16 05:00'],"['2003/10/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/16 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Oct 1;63(19):6357-62.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",,,,['CA 82323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Taken together with the in situ hybridization analysis indicating that expression of SCL was downregulated in the central nervous system in BMP-depleted embryos, the proximal sequence of SCL consists of a stage-dependent and BMP signaling-dependent control element.","['Sanada, Takahito', 'Park, Mae-ja', 'Araki, Ai', 'Gotoh, Masanori', 'Izutsu, Yumi', 'Maeno, Mitsugu']","['Sanada T', 'Park MJ', 'Araki A', 'Gotoh M', 'Izutsu Y', 'Maeno M']","['Graduate School of Science and Technology, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/*physiology', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'Xenopus', '*Xenopus Proteins']",2003/10/16 05:00,2003/12/18 05:00,['2003/10/16 05:00'],"['2003/10/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X03019028 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2003.09.135 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2003 Oct 31;310(4):1160-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2003.09.135.,"['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TAL1 protein, Xenopus)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Xenopus Proteins)', '0 (bmp4 protein, Xenopus)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Investigation of expression of TAP and its clinical significance in childhood acute leukemia will be helpful to clarify pathogenesis and to develop immunotherapy strategy. METHODS: RT-PCR analysis was used to detect the expression of TAP1 and TAP2 in leukemia cells from bone marrow in 34 inpatients with primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 15 inpatients with relapsed ALL, 20 inpatients with acute medullary leukemia (AML), and 20 surgical inpatients without systematic disorders as control. And then,the absorbance (A) values of expanded bands were measured by digital imaging analyzer and relative A values were worked out based on A value of GAPDH (positive inside control). RESULTS: The relative A values of TAP1(0.448+/-0.167 and 0.169+/-0.021,respectively) and TAP2(0.196+/-0.180 and 0.112+/-0.020, respectively) in primary ALL group and relapsed ALL group were lower than those in control group (P< 0.01). The A values of LMP2, LMP7, and PA28alpha (991.4+/-532.7, 686.3+/-663.8, and 2022.3+/-1622.3, respectively) in relapsed ALL group were lower than those in control group (P less than 0.01,0.01 and 0.05, respectively). The A value of LMP2 in relapsed group was lower than that in control (P< 0.01). The A values of LMP7 for the cases with no remission and relapse were both lower than that for the cases with constant complete remission in primary ALL group (P< 0.01). The relative A value of TAP2 in AML group was lower than that in control group (P< 0.05). The relative A value of TAP1 in relapsed ALL group was lower than that in primary ALL group (P< 0.05). In primary ALL group, the relative A value of TAP1 (0.215+/-0.159) for cases with relapse (6/34 cases) was lower than that (0.462+/-0.189) for those with constant complete remission (24/34 cases) (P< 0.05). CONCLUSION: There exists decreased expression of TAP in both childhood ALL and AML, which probably contributes to the escape of leukemia cells from immune surveillance. Decreased expression of TAP1 subunit is probably related to the relapse of ALL.","['Xie, Jian-Jun', 'Hu, Ya-Mei', 'Lu, You-Yong', 'Li, Zhi-Gang', 'Gong, Wen-Yu', 'Yu, Su-Ming', 'Sun, Jing']","['Xie JJ', 'Hu YM', 'Lu YY', 'Li ZG', 'Gong WY', 'Yu SM', 'Sun J']","['The 304th Hospital of PLA, Beijing, 100037, P R China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 3', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics/physiology', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Protein Subunits', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",2003/10/16 05:00,2010/06/18 06:00,['2003/10/16 05:00'],"['2003/10/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [medline]', '2003/10/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['1000467X2003101062 [pii]'],ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2003 Oct;22(10):1062-5.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 3)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TAP1 protein, human)', '145892-13-3 (TAP2 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, IFN-alpha can only induce about 70-80% of the patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) to get hematological remission. The mechanism by which various CML cases respond differently to IFN-alpha is still unclear. METHODS: (1)The effects of IFN-alpha in different concentrations (100, 500, 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000 U/ml) on growth of the two CML cell lines were detected by MTT assay,semisolid colony formation and trypan-blue staining for the cells in liquid culture. (2)The cell apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry(FCM),fluorescence microscopy and gel electrophoresis analysis for DNA fragmentation in 48 hours after IFN-alpha (1,000 U/ml) induction of both KT-1/A3 and K562 cells. (3)The expression levels of bcr/abl chimeric genes were analyzed by relative quantitative RT-PCR at 48 hours after cultivation of both KT-1/A3 and K562 cells with IFN-alpha in 1,000 U/ml. RESULTS: (1)The growth inhibition of KT-1/A3 cells was dose-dependent in IFN-alpha from the concentration of 100 U/ml to 10,000 U/ml. (2)Having been induced with IFN-alpha in 1000 U/ml for 48 hours, the apoptosis rate of KT-1/A3 cells raised from 3.29% to 11.8% and the expression level of bcr/abl chimeric gene in this cell line declined to 66.7% as compared with those of the control. (3)The growth and apoptosis rate as well as bcr/abl gene expression level of K562 cells were not significantly affected by IFN-alpha.

We evaluated the antiinflammatory effect of retrovirally transfected H-PGDS in order to investigate the role of H-PGDS in monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystal-induced acute inflammation. METHODS: Expression of endogenous PGDS in a murine air-pouch model of MSU crystal-induced acute inflammation was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. H-PGDS complementary DNA (cDNA) was retrovirally transfected into C57BL/6J fibroblasts, and the cells were designated as C57-PGDS cells. Production of prostaglandins by C57-PGDS cells was measured by enzyme immunoassay. The effect of C57-PGDS cells on crystal-induced inflammation was investigated. RESULTS: Injection of the crystals caused a rapid decrease in H-PGDS expression by infiltrating cells and by the soft tissues around the air pouches. In contrast, expression of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2) as well as cellular infiltration were significantly increased during the early stage of inflammation. C57-PGDS cells, but not control cells, produced an increased amount of PGD(2) in vitro, but suppressed production of PGE(2). Injection of C57-PGDS cells into air pouches inhibited cellular infiltration and MIP-2 and IL-1beta expression. CONCLUSION: In this murine air-pouch model of MSU crystal-induced inflammation, retrovirally transfected H-PGDS cDNA could reduce cellular infiltration, at least partly by inhibiting MIP-2 and IL-1beta. These findings suggest that gene therapy with H-PGDS may be useful for treating inflammatory diseases.","['Murakami, Yousuke', 'Akahoshi, Tohru', 'Hayashi, Izumi', 'Endo, Hirahito', 'Hashimoto, Atsushi', 'Kono, Shizuka', 'Kondo, Hirobumi', 'Kawai, Shinichi', 'Inoue, Matsuhisa', 'Kitasato, Hidero']","['Murakami Y', 'Akahoshi T', 'Hayashi I', 'Endo H', 'Hashimoto A', 'Kono S', 'Kondo H', 'Kawai S', 'Inoue M', 'Kitasato H']","['Kitasato University School of Medicine, Sagamihara, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Arthritis, Gouty/immunology/*therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CXCL2', 'Chemokines/genetics', 'Crystallization', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Interleukin-1/genetics', 'Intramolecular Oxidoreductases/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Lipocalins', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Prostaglandin D2/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Uric Acid/chemistry/*immunology']",2003/10/15 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/15 05:00'],"['2003/10/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/art.11271 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2003 Oct;48(10):2931-41. doi: 10.1002/art.11271.,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL2)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Cxcl2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipocalins)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', '60203-57-8 (9-deoxy-delta-9-prostaglandin D2)', 'EC 5.3.- (Intramolecular Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 5.3.99.2 (prostaglandin R2 D-isomerase)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed including 41 patients treated between August 1997 and June 2002. Twenty patients received allogeneic transplants (AG) and 21 received autologous transplants (AT). RESULTS: The mean age of AG patients was 8.9 +/- 5.4 years. Twelve patients were male. Stem cell sources were: bone marrow in 12 patients; peripheral blood in five; and unrelated cord blood in three. The diseases were acute lymphoid leukemia in seven patients; acute myeloid leukemia in four; chronic myeloid leukemia in two; myelodysplastic syndrome in two; Burkitt's lymphoma in one; severe combined immunodeficiency in one; Chediaki-Higashi syndrome in one; Fanconi anemia in one; and aplastic anemia in one. One patient developed grade II acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), and three patients had grade IV GVHD. Three patients developed chronic GVHD. In all of them, the cell source was peripheral blood. Survival in this group was 70.0 +/- 10.3%. The main cause of death was GVHD in three patients and sepsis in another three. All deaths occurred before day 100. One of the patients who received unrelated cord blood is alive 3.5 years after the transplantation. In AG patients, mean age was 8.7 +/- 4.3 years. Eleven patients were male. The stem cell sources were: peripheral blood in 16; bone marrow in three; and peripheral blood + bone marrow in two. The diseases were: Wilms' tumor in five patients; Ewing's sarcoma family tumors in four; neuroblastoma in three; Hodgkin's disease in three; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in one; rhabdomyosarcoma in two; neuroectodermic tumor of the central nervous system in two; acute myeloid leukemia in one. Survival in this group was 59.4 +/- 11.7%. Five patients died due to tumor relapse, two patients due to sepsis and one patient died in remission 20 months after bone marrow transplantation due to infection. In the whole group, the most common toxicities were vomiting, mucositis, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Infections were recorded in 58.5% of the patients.

We previously demonstrated that human Jurkat T lymphoma cells represent a valid model of LIF gene expression. This study was designed to identify regions critical for LIF promoter activation in Jurkat cells. METHODS: Luciferase constructs under the control of different portions of the human LIF promoter were transfected into Jurkat cells, and promoter activity was determined by luminometry. Similar experiments were performed with constructs bearing mutations in the putative ETS binding regions in the LIF promoter. RT-PCR, Western blot and gelshift experiments were performed to study expression and DNA binding of ETS factors in lymphoid cells. RESULTS: With the exception of the shortest construct not including the putative ETS binding sites, all wildtype LIF promoter constructs were strongly inducible by phorbol ester/ionomycin. In contrast, the mutant constructs were significantly less inducible. Cotransfection of the wild-type constructs with ETS expression vectors resulted in significant enhancement of promoter activity. ets-1 and ets-2 mRNA and protein were shown to be expressed in Jurkat cells. Gelshift experiments revealed that proteins present in nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells specifically bind to both artificial ETS consensus sites and ETS binding sites present in the LIF promoter. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that binding of ETS transcription factors to the ETS binding sites in the human LIF promoter is critical for its inducibility in response to T cell activators. ETS transcription factors thus play an important functional role within the endocrine-immune network.","['Bamberger, Ana-Maria', 'Jenatschke, Susanne', 'Schulte, Heinrich M', 'Ellebrecht, Iring', 'Beil, Frank Ulrich', 'Bamberger, Christoph M']","['Bamberger AM', 'Jenatschke S', 'Schulte HM', 'Ellebrecht I', 'Beil FU', 'Bamberger CM']","['Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany. bamberger@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Switzerland,Neuroimmunomodulation,Neuroimmunomodulation,9422763,IM,"['Binding Sites/genetics', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*genetics', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', '*Repressor Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Transfection']",2003/10/15 05:00,2004/03/25 05:00,['2003/10/15 05:00'],"['2002/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2003/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/10/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1159/000072964 [doi]', '72964 [pii]']",ppublish,Neuroimmunomodulation. 2004;11(1):10-9. doi: 10.1159/000072964.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ERF protein, human)', '0 (ETS1 protein, human)', '0 (ETS2 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,"['Copyright 2004 S.

We found that Daxx binds to the E1B 55-kDa protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen. The two proteins interact through their C termini. Mutation of three potential phosphorylation sites (S489/490 and T494 to alanine) within the E1B 55-kDa protein did not affect its interaction with Daxx, although such mutations were previously shown to inhibit E1B's ability to repress p53-dependent transcription and to enhance transformation. In addition to their coimmunoprecipitation in 293 extracts, purified Daxx interacted with the E1B 55-kDa protein in vitro, indicating their direct interaction. In 293 cells, Daxx colocalized with the E1B 55-kDa protein within discrete nuclear dots, where p53 was also found. Such structures were distinct from PML (promyelocytic leukemia protein) bodies, and it appeared that Daxx was displaced from PML bodies. Thus, the Daxx concentration was diminished in dots with a prominent presence of PML and vice versa. Indeed, PML overexpression led to dramatic redistribution of Daxx from p53-E1B 55-kDa protein complexes to PML bodies. Additionally, expression of the E1B 55-kDa protein in Saos2 osteosarcoma cells reduced the number of PML bodies. Our data suggest that E1B and PML compete for available Daxx in the cell. Surprisingly, Daxx significantly augmented p53-mediated transcription and the E1B 55-kDa protein eliminated this effect. Thus, it is likely that the E1B 55-kDa protein sequesters Daxx and p53 in specific nuclear locations, where p53 cannot activate transcription. One consequence of the Daxx-E1B interaction might be an alteration of normal interactions of Daxx, PML, and p53, which may contribute to cell transformation.","['Zhao, Lisa Y', 'Colosimo, April L', 'Liu, Yue', 'Wan, Yanping', 'Liao, Daiqing']","['Zhao LY', 'Colosimo AL', 'Liu Y', 'Wan Y', 'Liao D']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology and Shands Cancer Center, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida 32610-0235, USA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adenovirus E1B Proteins/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2003/10/15 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/15 05:00'],"['2003/10/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.21.11809-11821.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Nov;77(21):11809-21. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.21.11809-11821.2003.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adenovirus E1B Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,,,"['R01 CA092236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA92236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC229361,,,,,

Gag-FP chimeras budded from cells to produce fluorescent spots, which passed through the same pore-size filters and sedimented at the same velocity as authentic MLV. N-terminal myristylation of Gag-FPs was necessary for particle formation unless wild-type Gag was coexpressed. By labeling nonmyristylated Gag with yellow FP and wild-type Gag with cyan FP, we could quantitate the coincorporation of two proteins into single particles. This experiment showed that nonmyristylated Gag was incorporated into mixed particles at approximately 50% the efficiency of wild-type Gag. Mutations that inhibit Gag-Gag interactions (K. Alin and S. P. Goff, Virology 216:418-424, 1996; K. Alin and S. P. Goff, Virology 222:339-351, 1996) were then introduced into the capsid (CA) region of Gag-FPs. The mutations P150L and R119C/P133L inhibited fluorescent particle formation by these Gag-FPs, but Gag-FPs containing these mutations could be efficiently incorporated into particles when coexpressed with wild-type Gag. When these mutations were introduced into nonmyristylated Gag-FPs, no incorporation into particles in the presence of wild-type Gag was detected. These data suggest that two independent mechanisms, CA interactions and membrane association following myristylation, cooperate in MLV Gag assembly and budding.","['Andrawiss, Mariam', 'Takeuchi, Yasuhiro', 'Hewlett, Lindsay', 'Collins, Mary']","['Andrawiss M', 'Takeuchi Y', 'Hewlett L', 'Collins M']","['Department of Immunology and Molecular Pathology, Windeyer Institute of Medical Science, University College London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Capsid/chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Products, gag/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Spodoptera', 'Virion/*metabolism', '*Virus Assembly']",2003/10/15 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/10/15 05:00'],"['2003/10/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.21.11651-11660.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Nov;77(21):11651-60. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.21.11651-11660.2003.,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (yellow fluorescent protein, Bacteria)']",,,,,,,,,PMC229285,,,,,

CLL has been divided into distinct groups based on whether somatic hypermutation has occurred in the variable region of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus or alternatively if the cells express higher levels of the CD38 protein. We have analyzed the proteome of 12 cases of CLL (six mutated (M-CLL) and six unmutated (UM-CLL) immunoglobulin heavy-chain loci; seven CD38-negative and five CD38-positive) using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Statistical evaluation using principal component analysis indicated significant differences in patterns of protein expression between the cases with and without somatic mutation. Specific proteins indicated by principal component analysis as varying between the prognostic groups were characterized using mass spectrometry. The levels of F-actin-capping protein beta subunit, 14-3-3 beta protein, and laminin-binding protein precursor were significantly increased in M-CLL relative to UM-CLL. In addition, primary sequence data from tandem mass spectrometry showed that nucleophosmin was present as several protein spots in M-CLL but was not detected in UM-CLL samples, suggesting that several post-translationally modified forms of nucleophosmin vary between these two sample groups. No specific differences were found between CD38-positive and -negative patient samples using the same approach. The results presented show that proteomic analysis can complement other approaches in identifying proteins that may have potential value in the biological and diagnostic distinction between important clinical subtypes of CLL.","['Cochran, Duncan A E', 'Evans, Caroline A', 'Blinco, David', 'Burthem, John', 'Stevenson, Freda K', 'Gaskell, Simon J', 'Whetton, Anthony D']","['Cochran DA', 'Evans CA', 'Blinco D', 'Burthem J', 'Stevenson FK', 'Gaskell SJ', 'Whetton AD']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Proteomics Facility, Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20031013,United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,IM,"['14-3-3 Proteins/metabolism', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Microfilament Proteins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proteome/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Laminin/metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",2003/10/15 05:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2003/10/15 05:00'],"['2003/10/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2003/10/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/mcp.M300055-MCP200 [doi]', 'S1535-9476(20)34686-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2003 Dec;2(12):1331-41. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M300055-MCP200.

The most widely used tests for differential expression of genes are essentially univariate. Such tests disregard the multidimensional structure of microarray data. Multivariate methods are needed to utilize the information hidden in gene interactions and hence to provide more powerful and biologically meaningful methods for finding subsets of differentially expressed genes. The objective of this paper is to develop methods of multidimensional search for biologically significant genes, considering expression signals as mutually dependent random variables. To attain these ends, we consider the utility of a pertinent distance between random vectors and its empirical counterpart constructed from gene expression data. The distance furnishes exploratory procedures aimed at finding a target subset of differentially expressed genes. To determine the size of the target subset, we resort to successive elimination of smaller subsets resulting from each step of a random search algorithm based on maximization of the proposed distance. Different stopping rules associated with this procedure are evaluated. The usefulness of the proposed approach is illustrated with an application to the analysis of two sets of gene expression data.","['Szabo, Aniko', 'Boucher, Kenneth', 'Jones, David', 'Tsodikov, Alexander D', 'Klebanov, Lev B', 'Yakovlev, Andrei Y']","['Szabo A', 'Boucher K', 'Jones D', 'Tsodikov AD', 'Klebanov LB', 'Yakovlev AY']","['Huntsman Cancer Institute and Department of Oncological Sciences, University of Utah, 2000 Circle of Hope, Salt Lake City, UT 84112-5550, USA. aniko.szabo@hci.utah.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Biostatistics,"Biostatistics (Oxford, England)",100897327,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Computer Simulation', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', '*Multivariate Analysis', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*statistics & numerical data', 'Probability', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",2003/10/15 05:00,2004/06/18 05:00,['2003/10/15 05:00'],"['2003/10/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/biostatistics/4.4.555 [doi]', '4/4/555 [pii]']",ppublish,Biostatistics. 2003 Oct;4(4):555-67. doi: 10.1093/biostatistics/4.4.555.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we describe a mutational library approach to dissect functional domains of the envelope protein involving a retroviral vector, which expresses both the envelope protein of Akv murine leukemia virus (MLV) and the neomycin phosphotransferase II (Neo) selection marker from the same transcript. Envelope expression was achieved by inserting an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) between the neo and the env genes. We found the structure of the linker between the IRES element and env to be critical for sufficient envelope expression. This vector functions as a replication competent mini-virus in a culture of NIH 3T3 derived semi-packaging cells that express the viral Gag and Pol proteins. Titers comparable to those of wild type virus were achieved by this system. To test this vector system, we created a random mutational library of Arg 85 and Asp 86 in the first variable region of Akv envelope protein. Homologous amino acids to Asp 86 in Moloney and Friend murine leukemia viruses are thought to be directly involved in receptor binding. Subsequent selection of mutants capable of infecting murine NIH 3T3 cells indicated that the wild type aspartic acid or another hydrophilic residue at position 86 is an important determinant for envelope function.","['Bahrami, Shervin', 'Jespersen, Thomas', 'Pedersen, Finn Skou', 'Duch, Mogens']","['Bahrami S', 'Jespersen T', 'Pedersen FS', 'Duch M']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Aarhus, C.F.

The benzo[d]isothiazole compounds showed a marked cytotoxicity (CC(50)=4-9 microM) against the human CD4(+) lymphocytes (MT-4) that were used to support HIV-1 growth. For this reason, the most cytotoxic compounds of this series were evaluated for their antiproliferative activity against a panel of human cell lines derived from haematological and solid tumors. The results highlighted that all the benzo[d]isothiazole derivatives inhibited the growth of leukaemia cell lines, whereas only one of the above mentioned compounds (1e) showed antiproliferative activity against two solid tumor-derived cell lines.","['Vicini, Paola', 'Geronikaki, Athina', 'Incerti, Matteo', 'Busonera, Bernadetta', 'Poni, Graziella', 'Cabras, Carla Alba', 'La Colla, Paolo']","['Vicini P', 'Geronikaki A', 'Incerti M', 'Busonera B', 'Poni G', 'Cabras CA', 'La Colla P']","['Dipartimento Farmaceutico Universita degli Studi Parma, Parco Area delle Scienze 27/A, 43100 Parma, Italy. pvicni@ipruniv.cce.unipr.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-HIV Agents/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Anti-Infective Agents/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Benzothiazoles', 'Cattle', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'HIV-1/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mycobacterium/drug effects', 'Schiff Bases/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/virology', 'Thiazoles/*chemical synthesis/*chemistry/*pharmacology']",2003/10/15 05:00,2004/04/21 05:00,['2003/10/15 05:00'],"['2003/10/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0968089603004930 [pii]', '10.1016/s0968-0896(03)00493-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2003 Nov 3;11(22):4785-9. doi: 10.1016/s0968-0896(03)00493-0.,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Schiff Bases)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'G5BW2593EP (benzothiazole)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have linked an increasing number of mutations in the RTKs to the pathogenesis of both acute and chronic leukaemia. For example, the FLT3 receptor, a RTK class III, is the most commonly mutated gene in acute myeloid leukaemia, while c-kit mutations are strongly linked to the development of mast cell malignancy.

Clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of epoetin alfa in patients with cancer-related anemia (including patients with hematologic malignancies) and hemoglobin levels < or =10 g/dL.

AML1 contains a highly evolutionally conserved domain called the Runt domain, responsible for both DNA binding and heterodimerization with the partner protein, CBFbeta. AML1 is widely expressed in all hematopoietic lineages, and regulates the expression of a variety of hematopoietic genes. Numerous studies have shown that AML is a critical regulator of hematopoietic development. In addition, AML1 and CBFbeta are frequent targets for chromosomal translocation in human leukemia. Translocations lead to the generation of fusion proteins, which play a causative role for the development of leukemia, primarily by inhibiting AML1 function. Point mutations that impair AML1 function are also associated with familial and sporadic leukemias. Loss of AML1 function is thus implicated in a number of leukemias through multiple pathogenic mechanisms. However, AML1-related translocations or haploinsufficiency of AML1 are not immediately leukemogenic in animal models, suggesting that additional genetic events are required for the development of full-blown leukemia.","['Kurokawa, Mineo', 'Hirai, Hisamaru']","['Kurokawa M', 'Hirai H']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo113-8655, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Animals', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2003/10/15 05:00,2004/08/07 05:00,['2003/10/15 05:00'],"['2003/10/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/10/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2003.tb01364.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2003 Oct;94(10):841-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2003.tb01364.x.,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",50,,,,,,,,,,,,,
