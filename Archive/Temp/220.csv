Although conserved structural elements are likely to perform these functions in all retroviral matrix proteins, invariant motifs are not evident at the primary sequence level and three-dimensional structures have been available for only the primate lentiviral matrix proteins. We have therefore used NMR spectroscopy to determine the structure of the matrix protein from human T-cell leukemia virus type II (HTLV-II), a member of the human oncovirus subclass of retroviruses. A total of 577 distance restraints were used to build 20 refined models that superimpose with an rmsd of 0.71 A for the backbone atoms of the structured regions. The globular HTLV-II matrix structure is composed of four alpha-helices and a 3(10) helix. Exposed basic residues near the C terminus of helix II form a putative membrane binding surface which could act in concert with the N-terminal myristoyl group to anchor the protein on the viral membrane surface. Clear structural similarities between the HTLV-II and HIV-1 matrix proteins suggest that the topology and exposed cationic membrane binding surface are likely to be conserved features of retroviral matrix proteins.","['Christensen, A M', 'Massiah, M A', 'Turner, B G', 'Sundquist, W I', 'Summers, M F']","['Christensen AM', 'Massiah MA', 'Turner BG', 'Sundquist WI', 'Summers MF']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Utah, Salt Lake City 84132, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'HIV-1/chemistry/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/chemistry/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*chemistry/genetics', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*chemistry/classification/pathogenicity', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Species Specificity', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/*chemistry/genetics']",1996/12/20 00:00,1996/12/20 00:01,['1996/12/20 00:00'],"['1996/12/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/20 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(96)90700-7 [pii]', '10.1006/jmbi.1996.0700 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 1996 Dec 20;264(5):1117-31. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.1996.0700.,['PDB/1JVR'],"['AI30917/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI37524/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 77 second malignancies occurred. There were significantly raised risks of stomach [standardized incidence ratio (SIR)=4.0], lung (SIR=3.8), bone (SIR=26.5), soft tissue (SIR=16.9) and non-melanoma skin (SIR=3.9) cancers, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (SIR=4.6), and acute and non-lymphocytic leukaemia (SIR=31.3), with a relative risk of 3.3 for all second cancers other than non-melanoma skin cancer. Solid cancer risk was raised to a similar extent in patients treated only with radiotherapy (SIR=2.6, P<0.001), only with chemotherapy (SIR=2.1, P=0.08) and with both (SIR=3.1, P<0.001). Leukaemia risk was raised only in those receiving chemotherapy, whether alone or with radiotherapy. The relative risk for solid cancers was much greater in patients who were younger at first treatment (trend P<0.001), whereas leukaemia risk was greatest for those first treated at ages 25-44. For solid cancers (P<0.001) but not leukaemia (P=0.05) there was a strong gradient of greater relative risks at younger attained ages. The relative risk of second cancers overall was 27.5 at ages under 25 and 2.0 at ages 55 and above. Leukaemia and solid cancer risks in patients treated with chlorambucil, vinblastine, procarbazine and prednisone (ChlVPP) were not significantly greater than those in patients treated with mustine, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisone (MOPP). Number of cycles of chemotherapy was significantly related to risk of leukaemia (P<0.001), and there was a trend in the same direction for solid cancers (P=0.07). The study adds to evidence that alkylating chemotherapy may increase the risk of solid cancers, and that ChlVPP does not provide a less carcinogenic alternative to MOPP chemotherapy. The very large relative risks found for solid cancers at young attained ages and in patients treated when young may have important implications as, in the long term, the majority of second malignancies after Hodgkin's disease are solid cancers. The risks of solid malignancies need clarification by larger collaborative epidemiological studies.","['Swerdlow, A J', 'Barber, J A', 'Horwich, A', 'Cunningham, D', 'Milan, S', 'Omar, R Z']","['Swerdlow AJ', 'Barber JA', 'Horwich A', 'Cunningham D', 'Milan S', 'Omar RZ']","['Epidemiological Monitoring Unit, Department of Epidemiology & Population Sciences, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHIVPP protocol', 'MOPP protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chlorambucil/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*complications/therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Procarbazine/therapeutic use', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Vinblastine/therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1997.19 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1997;75(1):116-23. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1997.19.,,,PMC2222705,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that primary murine bone marrow cells transduced ex vivo with a recombinant HOX11-containing retrovirus, MSCV-HOX11, gave rise to cell lines at high frequency having characteristics of early myeloid cells. Cell lines were also established from the bone marrow and spleen of transplant recipients sacrificed 5 months after engraftment with MSCV-HOX11-transduced bone marrow cells. These latter lines, which exhibited a more differentiated myelomonocytic phenotype, harbored proviruses encoding a smaller HOX11 protein. None of the mice that received HOX11-expressing bone marrow cells or myeloid cell lines developed leukemia during 6-month observation periods. Here, we report that two bone marrow transplant recipients eventually developed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia-like malignancies at 7 and 12 months posttransplant, indicating that progression to a fully malignant state required additional mutations. One tumor synthesized full-length HOX11 whereas the other expressed the smaller version of the protein. The smaller HOX11 protein suffered a carboxyl-terminal truncation. We subsequently constructed MSCV-based retroviral vectors expressing deleted forms of HOX11 and identified an amino-terminal region that was dispensible for generation of myeloid cell lines having a similar phenotype as those induced by full-length HOX11. We thus conclude that regions near the amino and carboxyl termini of HOX11 are not essential for transforming function, nor do they appear to determine the lineage or stage of differentiation of the target cell for transformation.","['Hawley, R G', 'Fong, A Z', 'Reis, M D', 'Zhang, N', 'Lu, M', 'Hawley, T S']","['Hawley RG', 'Fong AZ', 'Reis MD', 'Zhang N', 'Lu M', 'Hawley TS']","['Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tlx1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, Homeobox/*physiology', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/01/15 00:00,1997/01/15 00:01,['1997/01/15 00:00'],"['1997/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1997 Jan 15;57(2):337-45.,['GENBANK/S38742'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To obtain information on the characteristics of the polyamine uptake system in L1210 leukemia cells, we have applied computational chemistry techniques to the study of relationships between structure and function of 57 polyamine analogues. Ki values of polyamine analogues, derived from competitive inhibition of [3H]spermidine transport into L1210 cells, were chosen as the measure of biological activity. Using comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA), a model was constructed to relate molecular structure with biological activity. The model was based on 4 monocationic, 8 dicationic, 14 tricationic, and 20 tetracationic polyamine analogues with a range of Ki values for the inhibition of [3H]spermidine uptake of 0.97-521 microM. The CoMFA model successfully predicted the inhibitory potency of 11 polyamines that had not previously been tested for polyamine uptake inhibitory activity. The 11 values predicted were within 33 +/- 62% of the actual Ki values. The test group included aziridinyl diamines, acetylated spermidines, two new oxazolidinonyl spermidines, monoaziridinyl spermidines, and a diaziridinyl spermine. Several of the compounds from this test group have been shown to have anticancer activity in mice. Consistent with the CoMFA model, certain basic functional groups, such as aziridines that have pKa values in the range of 6-7, seem to interact with the polyamine transporter in a cationic form. The results suggest that the CoMFA model is useful in drug design strategies as a predictive tool for the discovery of new anticancer agents that utilize a polyamine transporter for cellular uptake.","['Li, Y', 'MacKerell, A D Jr', 'Egorin, M J', 'Ballesteros, M F', 'Rosen, D M', 'Wu, Y Y', 'Blamble, D A', 'Callery, P S']","['Li Y', 'MacKerell AD Jr', 'Egorin MJ', 'Ballesteros MF', 'Rosen DM', 'Wu YY', 'Blamble DA', 'Callery PS']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Maryland, Baltimore 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Polyamines)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Models, Chemical', 'Polyamines/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Spermidine/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1997/01/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1997/01/15 00:00'],"['1997/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1997/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1997 Jan 15;57(2):234-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparison of the effects of taxol and its analogue, taxotere, indicates that taxotere is capable of inducing bcl2 phosphorylation and apoptotic cell death at 100-fold lower concentrations than taxol. Induction of cancer cell death through phosphorylation of bcl2 thus provides an opportunity not only for more refined targeting of therapeutic drugs but for understanding of an important pathway leading to apoptosis. Phosphorylation of bcl2 in drug-treated cancer cells occurs in G2-M, the phase of the cell cycle in which this class of drugs is active. No induction of bcl2 phosphorylation occurs in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells that overexpress bcl2 but are blocked at G0-G1. Thus, prevention of polymerization or depolymerization of cellular microtubules by this class of cancer therapeutic drugs causes phosphorylation of bcl2, abrogating the normal antiapoptotic function of bcl2 and initiating the apoptotic program in the cycling cancer cells; these results are consistent with a normal physiological role of bcl2 as ""guardian of microtubule integrity.""","['Haldar, S', 'Basu, A', 'Croce, C M']","['Haldar S', 'Basu A', 'Croce CM']","['Kimmel Cancer Center, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Chronic Disease', 'Docetaxel', 'G2 Phase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Microtubules/*drug effects', 'Paclitaxel/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*drug effects/metabolism/physiology', '*Taxoids', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1997/01/15 00:00,1997/01/15 00:01,['1997/01/15 00:00'],"['1997/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1997 Jan 15;57(2):229-33.,,['CA39860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nramp1 expression is restricted to reticuloendothelial organs and peripheral blood leukocytes, where the protein may function as a membrane transporter of an as yet to be identified substrate. To identify the human blood cell type(s) expressing NRAMP1 mRNA and determine how Nramp1 expression is regulated in these cells, we have examined separated populations of peripheral blood leukocytes and in vitro cell lines. We observed that polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are the major site of NRAMP1 expression, followed to a lesser degree by monocytes (MN). Migration of MN to tissues (alveolar macrophages) or maturation in vitro (long-term culture) was associated with a higher level of NRAMP1 expression compared with blood MN. Northern analyses of RNA from model cultured cells showed absence of NRAMP1 expression in transformed cell lines from either erythroid or lymphoid T or B lineages as well as progenitors of the monocyte/macrophage pathway (KG1, U937, THP1), and the HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia. Induction of differentiation of HL-60 cells toward either the monocyte/macrophage (vitamin D3, phorbol ester) or the granulocyte pathways (DMF, DMSO), as measured by induction of IL8-Rb, c-FMS, and CD14 marker gene expression, was concomitant with a strong induction of NRAMP1 expression.

We investigated whether exposure to ceramides is sufficient to induce apoptosis in human leukemia cells and, if so, what the characteristics of this form of apoptosis might be. Treatment of the acute lymphoblastic T-cell line CEM-C7H2 with short- and medium-chain ceramide analogs (C2-, C6-, and C8-ceramide) resulted in apoptosis, whereas the inactive C2-dihydroceramide had no effect on cell survival. Induction of apoptosis was relatively slow (approximately 40% after 24 h) and required high concentrations of ceramide analogs (40-100 microM). To investigate a possible involvement of interleukin 1-beta-converting enzyme (ICE) or ICE-related proteases, we treated CEM-C7H2 sublines constitutively expressing the vaccinia virus protease inhibitor crmA with ceramide analogs. Although such cells were completely resistant to apoptosis induced by antibodies to the Apo-1/Fas surface receptor (a form of apoptosis known to be inhibitable by CrmA), they were not protected from ceramide-induced cell death. In contrast, tetracycline-regulated overexpression of Bcl-2 protected CEM-C7H2 sublines stably transfected with corresponding constructs from ceramide-induced apoptosis. Thus, in these human leukemia cells, ceramides induce a relatively slow death response that can be prevented by Bcl-2, but is independent of CrmA-inhibitable proteases. These characteristics distinguish ceramide-induced from other forms of apoptosis, such as Apo-1/Fas-induced cell death where ceramide production has been causally implicated.","['Geley, S', 'Hartmann, B L', 'Kofler, R']","['Geley S', 'Hartmann BL', 'Kofler R']","['Institute for General and Experimental Pathology, Division of Molecular Pathophysiology, University of Innsbruck, Medical School, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Serpins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '96282-35-8 (interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspase 1', 'Ceramides/*pharmacology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*physiology', 'Serpins/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Viral Proteins', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",1997/01/02 00:00,1997/01/02 00:01,['1997/01/02 00:00'],"['1997/01/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/02 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-5793(96)01284-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(96)01284-7 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1997 Jan 2;400(1):15-8. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(96)01284-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although EGCG did not directly inhibit the production of GM-CSF, it did inhibit the effect of TNF-alpha or TPA, both of which stimulated AML cells to produce GM-CSF.

A recently identified mammalian scaffold protein, AKAP79, controls the location of two broad-specificity kinases and a phosphatase. RESULTS: We have identified and characterized another mammalian scaffold protein which coordinates the location of protein kinase A and protein kinase C. We isolated a cDNA encoding a 250 kDa A-skinase anchoring protein (AKAP) called gravin, which was originally identified as a cytoplasmic antigen recognized by myasthenia gravis sera. Sequence homology to proteins that are known to bind protein kinase C suggests that gravin also binds this kinase. Studies of binding in vitro show that residues 1526-1780 of gravin bind the regulatory subunit (RII) of protein kinase A with high affinity, and residues 265-556 bind protein kinase C. Gravin expression in human erythroleukemia cells can be induced with phorbol ester, resulting in the detection of a 250 kDa RII- and PKC-binding protein. Immunolocalization experiments show that gravin is concentrated at the cell periphery and is enriched in filopodia. Gravin staining is coincident with an AKAP detected by an in situ RII-overlay assay, and a PKA-gravin complex can be isolated from human erythroleukemia cells. CONCLUSIONS: We present biochemical evidence that gravin forms part of a signaling scaffold, and propose that protein kinases A and C may participate in the coordination of signal transduction events in the filopodia of human erythroleukemia cells.","['Nauert, J B', 'Klauck, T M', 'Langeberg, L K', 'Scott, J D']","['Nauert JB', 'Klauck TM', 'Langeberg LK', 'Scott JD']","['Vollum Institute, 3181 S.W.

Implications in apoptosis.,2452-8,"Ceramide is now recognized as an intracellular lipid signal mediator, which induces various kinds of cell functions including apoptosis. Ceramide-induced apoptosis was reported to be blocked by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, but its mechanism remained unclear. Therefore, we investigated whether ceramide has any effects on PKC in the induction of apoptosis. We here report that N-acetylsphingosine (synthetic membrane-permeable ceramide) induced translocation of PKC-delta and -epsilon isozymes from the membrane to the cytosol within 5 min in human leukemia cell lines. Treatment with sphingomyelinase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or anti-Fas antibody, all of which can induce apoptosis by generating natural ceramide, similarly induced cytosolic translocation of PKC-delta and -epsilon. In Fas-resistant cells anti-Fas antibody did not induce cytosolic translocation of PKC-delta and -epsilon because of no generation of ceramide, whereas N-acetylsphingosine induced apoptosis with cytosolic translocation of PKC-delta and -epsilon. Furthermore, both 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate and a nonspecific kinase inhibitor, staurosporine, prevented ceramide-induced apoptosis by inhibiting cytosolic translocation of PKC-delta and -epsilon. These data suggest that cytosolic translocation of PKC-delta and -epsilon plays an important role in ceramide-mediated apoptosis.","['Sawai, H', 'Okazaki, T', 'Takeda, Y', 'Tashima, M', 'Sawada, H', 'Okuma, M', 'Kishi, S', 'Umehara, H', 'Domae, N']","['Sawai H', 'Okazaki T', 'Takeda Y', 'Tashima M', 'Sawada H', 'Okuma M', 'Kishi S', 'Umehara H', 'Domae N']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Clinical Sciences for Pathological Organs, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin-kawaramachi, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCD protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCE protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-epsilon)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Ceramides/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-delta', 'Protein Kinase C-epsilon', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/immunology']",1997/01/24 00:00,1997/01/24 00:01,['1997/01/24 00:00'],"['1997/01/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/24 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.4.2452 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)78525-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Jan 24;272(4):2452-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.4.2452.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present evidence demonstrating that the gene encoding ECP is regulated in an analogous fashion and that an intronic enhancer element functioning in both genes is a consensus binding sequence for the transcription factor NFAT-1. Our initial results demonstrate that one or more nuclear proteins isolated from human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells bind specifically at this consensus site (5'-GGAGAA-3') within the intron of the EDN gene and that disruption of this sequence reduced the characteristic 20-30-fold increase in reporter gene activity observed with the tandem EDN promoter/exon 1/intron construct to background levels. The NFAT-1 consensus site in the ECP gene differs from that found in the EDN gene by a single nucleotide (5'-GGAGAG-3'); the conversion of the 3' G to an A resulted in a further enhancement of the reporter gene activity supported by the ECP promoter/exon 1/intron construct.

In this report, we demonstrate that the active form of NF-AT1 is also present in the nuclei of HTLV-I-transformed T cells that express the Tax protein.

B-CLL cells bound normally to vascular endothelium, but binding to IL-1-activated endothelium was significantly lower than that of normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. Cytokine enhancement of L-selectin expression was not accomplished by changes in binding to vascular endothelium.

Cloning and characterization of an alternative signaling subunit conferring OSM-specific receptor activation.,32635-43,"Oncostatin M (OSM) is a cytokine whose structural and functional features are similar to other members of the interleukin (IL)-6 family of cytokines (IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), granulocyte colonystimulating factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and cardiotrophin-1), many of which utilize gp130 as a common receptor subunit. A biologically active OSM receptor has been previously described that consists of a heterodimer of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and gp130. This LIFR.gp130 complex is also a functional receptor for LIF. We have cloned and characterized an alternative subunit (OSMRbeta) for an OSM receptor complex (a heterodimer of gp130 and OSMRbeta) that is activated by OSM but not by LIF. The signaling capability of specific receptor subunit combinations was analyzed by independent assays measuring cell proliferation or induction of acute phase protein synthesis. Our results demonstrate that both LIF and OSM cause tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the gp130.LIFR combination, but the gp130.OSMRbeta complex is activated by OSM only. OSM-induced cellular responses, initiated through low affinity binding to gp130, are mediated by two heterodimeric receptor complexes that utilize alternative signal transducing subunits that confer different cytokine specificities to the receptor complex.","['Mosley, B', 'De Imus, C', 'Friend, D', 'Boiani, N', 'Thoma, B', 'Park, L S', 'Cosman, D']","['Mosley B', 'De Imus C', 'Friend D', 'Boiani N', 'Thoma B', 'Park LS', 'Cosman D']","['Immunex Corporation, Seattle, Washington 98101, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', '*Lymphokines', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Cytokine/chemistry/classification/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/12/20 00:00,1996/12/20 00:01,['1996/12/20 00:00'],"['1996/12/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/20 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.51.32635 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)78758-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Dec 20;271(51):32635-43. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.51.32635.,['GENBANK/U60805'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their clinical presentation is variable. The atypical mycobacteria are difficult to culture and thus diagnosis can be difficult to establish. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and mycolic acid analysis have recently been used for mycobacterial species identification, but are not routinely used. Risk factors for cutaneous atypical mycobacterial infection include (1) immunodepression due to HIV infection, lymphoma, leukemia or immunosuppressive therapy. Immunodepression is responsible for the emergence of cutaneous infections by a large variety of atypical mycobacterial species, particularly in industrialized countries. (2) The natural environment is directly responsible for the emergence of cutaneous infections but a small number of atypical mycobacterial species including M. marinum in Europe and North America, and M. ulcerans in the tropics. (3) The medical environment when sterilization is inadequate is also not uncommonly responsible. Clinical features are rarely specific for mycobacterial species, and thus analysis of factors relevant to treatment is more important than species classification. We describe environmental forms (Buruli ulcer caused by M. ulcerans is endemic in the tropics, and swimming pool granuloma which is the aquatic form of M. marinum infection), opportunist forms caused by various species in immunodepressed hosts and iatrogenic and accidental forms mostly due to M. fortiutum and M. chelonei.

Indeed, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine itself have been shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication in vitro, hydroxychloroquine being proposed as a potential useful adjunctive therapy in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. On the other hand, chloroquine has been reported to enhance the replication of Semliki forest and encephalomyocarditis viruses in a mouse model. In an attempt to elucidate Cq effect on retroviral replication, we have studied the effect of various concentrations of chloroquine in vitro (0.1 nmol/l to 25 mumol/l) on Friend retrovirus (FV)-infected fibroblasts of mice and in vivo (2 to 30 mg/kg) on FV-infected mice. No reduction in the number of virus foci was found in chloroquine-treated fibroblasts cultures. In chloroquine treated-infected mice, no differences were observed in the spleen weights, except an increase at 10 mg/kg. A decrease in splenocyte virus titer was only observed at 10 and 30 mg/kg. No differences in the median survival time was observed up to 30 mg/kg.

Selective eradication of these cells in vitro can be achieved by combined treatment with antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides ([S]ODNs) specifically targeted to this oncogene (bcr/abl [S]ODNs) and a suboptimal (for use as a single agent) dose of mafosfamide (the in vitro active form of cyclophosphamide). PURPOSE: We evaluated the ability of bcr/abl antisense [S]ODNs, alone or subsequent to treatment with a single injection of cyclophosphamide, to suppress the leukemic process induced in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice by Philadelphia cells (i.e., primary CML-blast crisis [CML-BC] cells). In addition, we studied potential mechanisms that might explain the efficacy of the bcr/abl antisense [S]ODN-mafosfamide combination against Philadelphia cells in vitro. METHODS: The effects of treating leukemic mice with cyclophosphamide (25 mg/kg body weight; 25% of the dose required to eradicate evidence of leukemia in SCID mice) and/or bcr/abl antisense [S]ODNs were assessed by analysis of survival, by examination of bone marrow for the presence of leukemia cells (using a colony formation assay or using coupled reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction to screen for bcr/abl messenger RNA), and by examination of a variety of tissues for the presence of infiltrating leukemia cells. The induction of apoptosis (a cell death program) in vitro in primary CML-BC cells following treatment with bcr/abl antisense [S]ODNs plus or minus prior treatment with mafosfamide was monitored by use of a commercial assay. Relative cellular uptake of [S]ODNs by CML-BC cells treated in vitro with or without prior treatment with mafosfamide was determined by use of confocal microscopy and flow cytometry (for fluorescent [S]ODNs) or by use of blotting techniques that employed radioactively labeled probes (for extracted, unlabeled [S]ODNs). Levels of specific proteins in treated and untreated cells were determined by use of western blotting methods. Reported P values are two-sided. RESULTS: The disease process in leukemic mice was retarded substantially by combination treatment with cyclophosphamide and specific bcr/abl antisense [S]ODNs (P < .001, relative to treatment with specific antisense [S]ODNs alone, cyclophosphamide alone, or cyclophosphamide plus nonspecific [i.e., control] antisense [S]ODNs); 50% of the mice treated with cyclophosphamide and specific antisense [S]ODNs appeared to be cured of leukemia. The combination treatment was associated with increased induction of apoptosis. In addition, cellular uptake of bcr/abl antisense [S]ODNs appeared to be increased twofold to sixfold by prior treatment with mafosfamide. This increased uptake of [S]ODNs was associated with enhanced suppression of p210bcr/abl protein levels. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Combination therapy with antisense [S]ODNs targeted to specific oncogenes and less toxic doses of anticancer drugs may represent a rational strategy to purpose for the treatment of human leukemias.","['Skorski, T', 'Nieborowska-Skorska, M', 'Wlodarski, P', 'Perrotti, D', 'Hoser, G', 'Kawiak, J', 'Majewski, M', 'Christensen, L', 'Iozzo, R V', 'Calabretta, B']","['Skorski T', 'Nieborowska-Skorska M', 'Wlodarski P', 'Perrotti D', 'Hoser G', 'Kawiak J', 'Majewski M', 'Christensen L', 'Iozzo RV', 'Calabretta B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Kimmel Cancer Institute, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'DNA Probes', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*therapeutic use', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thionucleotides/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/01/15 00:00,1997/01/15 00:01,['1997/01/15 00:00'],"['1997/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/89.2.124 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1997 Jan 15;89(2):124-33. doi: 10.1093/jnci/89.2.124.,,"['CA39481/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA46782/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1997 Jan 15;89(2):107-8.

The aim of this study was to identify possible brain perfusion defects caused by different types of treatment and their association with abnormalities in cerebral MRI and neuropsychological and clinical neurological findings. METHODS: Twenty-five consecutive children with ALL at the cessation of chemotherapy or after 1 yr were included. All of the children were given intravenous and intrathecal methotrexate for central nervous system therapy, 13 of them received cranial radiation therapy. Brain SPECT, cerebral MRI, clinical neurological and neuropsychological evaluations were performed. RESULTS: Eleven of the 25 patients (44%) had brain perfusion defects in SPECT, eight of whom were treated with chemotherapy alone, and three received cranial irradiation. Two patients had small bilateral white matter changes on MRI; their brain SPECT scans were abnormal, although the findings were not related. Impairment of neuropsychological functioning was found in 86% of the patients tested. No significant difference between the patients with abnormal and normal SPECT were found. Those patients with abnormal SPECT were younger than those with normal SPECT and had received more frequent intravenous methotrexate infusions. CONCLUSION: Brain SPECT detected perfusion defects that had occurred after treatment for childhood ALL. These defects may be related to frequent administration of a combination of intravenous and intrathecal methotrexate and/or young age.","['Harila-Saari, A H', 'Ahonen, A K', 'Vainionpaa, L K', 'Paakko, E L', 'Pyhtinen, J', 'Himanen, A S', 'Torniainen, P J', 'Lanning, B M']","['Harila-Saari AH', 'Ahonen AK', 'Vainionpaa LK', 'Paakko EL', 'Pyhtinen J', 'Himanen AS', 'Torniainen PJ', 'Lanning BM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Oulu University Central Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Organotechnetium Compounds)', '0 (Oximes)', '3B744AG22N (Technetium Tc 99m Exametazime)', 'H25WJA31XE (technetium Tc 99m bicisate)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Brain/*blood supply/diagnostic imaging/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation/adverse effects', '*Cysteine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Neurologic Examination', 'Organotechnetium Compounds', 'Oximes', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Technetium Tc 99m Exametazime', '*Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Nucl Med. 1997 Jan;38(1):82-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From 6 months after BLV-inoculation to sheep which were previously infected with BIV, the numbers of lymphocytes expressing a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) of bovine leukosis were increased compared to those of a sheep inoculated with BLV alone.

Many factors have been cited to be probable determinants of prognosis. To compare the prognostic determinants of childhood ALL in developed Western countries and developing African countries, a review of published data was carried out. Both an electronic and manual search were undertaken. The manual search was confined to four leading African journals. All articles were subjected to an eligibility criteria. The proportions of six prognostic factors were either extracted from the original publications or calculated from available published data. A pooled proportion was computed and 95% confidence intervals calculated and compared. Eleven articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. One article with nineteen study subjects was available on black African population. Six articles from developed countries were excluded. The proportions of children below the age of two years or above the age of nine years constituted 26% (CI = 0.24,0.28) and 37% (CI = 0.15,0.59) in developed countries and the Black African population respectively. There was a statistically significant higher population of children with high total WBC count in African children compared to developed countries. Proportions for other factors in developed countries and developing countries respectively were as follows: T-cell immunophenotype (17% and 60%), FAB-L2, L3 (15% and 83%), CNS involvement (5% and 13%) and mediastinal shadows on CXR (8% and 13%).

In three independent experiments comprising ducks inoculated with uncloned and/or molecularly cloned ALV-C, we found that after the elimination of primary post-hatching viraemia, reviraemia could be detected in 60-70% of infected animals. Based on the course of viraemia, the individual ducks were assigned to four different groups: Group I (no reviraemia), Group II (one transient reviraemic period), Group III (one persistent reviraemic period), Group IV (fluctuating reviraemia). In comparison to sera from ducks included in Group I and/or II, a significant decrease in neutralizing activity of sera from animals comprised in Group III and/or IV was observed. Two out of four reviraemic viruses were not neutralized by antiserum against ALV-C, instead their infectivity was enhanced. Long-term follow-up of the cell-associated virus revealed that its rescuability by cocultivation with chicken embryo fibroblasts fluctuated in about 50% of animals. In the reviraemic phase of infection, integrated proviruses could be detected by Southern blotting in a majority of tissues examined. Our data document that many features recognized in lentiviruses are valid also for oncoviruses transmitted to heterologous hosts and substantiate further the suitability of ALV-C-infected ducks as a model for studying persistent retroviral infection.","['Geryk, J', 'Machon, O', 'Hak, R', 'Trejbalova, K', 'Hejnar, J', 'Plachy, J', 'Karakoz, I', 'Svoboda, J']","['Geryk J', 'Machon O', 'Hak R', 'Trejbalova K', 'Hejnar J', 'Plachy J', 'Karakoz I', 'Svoboda J']","['Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Czech Republic,Folia Biol (Praha),Folia biologica,0234640,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Avian Leukosis/blood/immunology/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Ducks/embryology', 'Kinetics', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Viremia/*virology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Folia Biol (Praha). 1996;42(5):245-55.,,['1 R03 TW00155-01A1/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE SUMMARY: A 33-year-old female patient with chronic granulocytic leukemia was treated with epsilon-ACA for approximately 3.5 months for thrombocytopenic bleeding. The initial dosage was 4 g po q6h. One month after an increase in dosage to 5 g po 14h the patient developed severe lower extremity myalgia and marked weakness. Laboratory investigations revealed an elevated creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and myoglobinemia. Epsilon-ACA was thought to be the causative agent and was discontinued. The patient received intravenous fluids to minimize renal damage due to myoglobin. Serum enzyme concentrations did not return to normal. The patient died of a central nervous system hemorrhage 1 week after the epsilon-ACA was discontinued. DISCUSSION: There were 31 cases of epsilon-ACA-induced myopathies published in the literature (MEDLINE) from 1972 to June 1995. Of these, 10 cases were reviewed. In all cases, patients received epsilon-ACA in doses ranging from 16 to 36 g/d for more than 28 days. Clinical findings varied from extreme muscle weakness to myopathic changes in electromyelograms. All patients recovered following discontinuation of epsilon-ACA. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term therapy with high-dose epsilon-ACA may produce muscle weakness or rhabdomyolysis. Patients who require long-term, high-dose epsilon-ACA therapy should be monitored for myoglobinuria and changes in serum CK, LDH, and AST, for myoglobinemia, for decreases in muscle strength, and/or for myalgia. Significant changes in these parameters compared with baseline values should suggest a need to discontinue epsilon-ACA therapy.","['Seymour, B D', 'Rubinger, M']","['Seymour BD', 'Rubinger M']","['Penner Express Pharmacy, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Antifibrinolytic Agents)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.3.2 (Creatine Kinase)', 'U6F3787206 (Aminocaproic Acid)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aminocaproic Acid/*adverse effects', 'Antifibrinolytic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood', 'Creatine Kinase/blood', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Rhabdomyolysis/*chemically induced/*metabolism', 'Thrombocytopenia/drug therapy']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/106002809703100109 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 1997 Jan;31(1):56-8. doi: 10.1177/106002809703100109.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Myocyte hypertrophy was induced specifically by PGF2 alpha. Myocytes exposed to this prostanoid in culture increased in size and protein content. The contractile fibrils within the cells became organized into parallel arrays, and the cells tended to cluster and beat spontaneously. PGF2 alpha also induced the expression of c-fos, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), and alpha-skeletal actin in these cells. The effects of PGF2 alpha were compared with several known cardiac myocyte hypertrophy factors (phenylephrine, endothelin-1, leukemia inhibitory factor, cardiotrophin-1, and angiotensin II). PGF2 alpha was found to be intermediate in potency among the factors but induced a level of ANF production that was approximately 10-fold higher than any of the other effectors. Responsiveness to PGF2 alpha was not limited to neonatal cardiocytes. Ventricular myocytes isolated from adult rats also responded specifically to PGF2 alpha with a morphological change similar to that observed with phenylephrine and by producing ANF. In rats, chronic administration of fluprostenol, a potent agonist analogue of PGF2 alpha, resulted in a dose-dependent increase in heart weight- and ventricular weight-to-body weight ratios. The amount of PGF2 alpha extractable from the hearts of rats with cardiac hypertrophy induced by myocardial infarction was also found to be greater than that in sham-operated control rats. These results indicate that PGF2 alpha may play an important role in inducing cardiac hypertrophy.","['Lai, J', 'Jin, H', 'Yang, R', 'Winer, J', 'Li, W', 'Yen, R', 'King, K L', 'Zeigler, F', 'Ko, A', 'Cheng, J', 'Bunting, S', 'Paoni, N F']","['Lai J', 'Jin H', 'Yang R', 'Winer J', 'Li W', 'Yen R', 'King KL', 'Zeigler F', 'Ko A', 'Cheng J', 'Bunting S', 'Paoni NF']","['Department of Cardiovascular Research, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, California 94080, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['0 (Prostaglandins)', '0 (Prostaglandins F, Synthetic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1WS297W6MV (Phenylephrine)', '358S7VUE5N (fluprostenol)', '85637-73-6 (Atrial Natriuretic Factor)', 'B7IN85G1HY (Dinoprost)']",IM,"['Aging/physiology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Atrial Natriuretic Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cardiomegaly/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dinoprost/*pharmacology', 'Heart/*drug effects/*growth & development', 'Male', 'Myocardial Infarction/metabolism', 'Myocardium/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenylephrine/pharmacology', 'Prostaglandins/pharmacology', 'Prostaglandins F, Synthetic/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Time Factors']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajpheart.1996.271.6.H2197 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1996 Dec;271(6 Pt 2):H2197-208. doi: 10.1152/ajpheart.1996.271.6.H2197.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we report that inhibition of the K+ channel activity by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) suppressed ML-1 cell proliferation, as measured by DNA synthesis. Cell cycle mapping indicated that ML-1 cells were arrested in G1 phase after 24-h treatment with 4-AP. Blockade of ML-1 cells at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle with aphidicolin revealed that ML-1 cells past the G1 checkpoint were capable of entering S phase and synthesizing DNA independently of the channel blockade. ML-1 cell differentiation, measured by CD14 marker protein expression, revealed that the effect of 4-AP was to cause growth arrest and that it did not cause differentiation. Dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein accompanied inhibition of ML-1 cell proliferation and suggested that suppression of K+ channel activity by 4-AP is associated with retinoblastoma protein-mediated G1 arrest in ML-1 cells. Moreover, we found that ML-1 cell volume increased 35 +/- 7% after 4-AP treatment, which could be an early event triggering inhibition of ML-1 cell proliferation. These findings suggest that a 4-AP-sensitive K+ channel may play an important role in the transduction of mitogenic signals in ML-1 cells.","['Xu, B', 'Wilson, B A', 'Lu, L']","['Xu B', 'Wilson BA', 'Lu L']","['Department of Physiology, Wright State University, School of Medicine, Dayton, Ohio 45435, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['0 (Potassium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', 'BH3B64OKL9 (4-Aminopyridine)']",IM,"['4-Aminopyridine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', '*Potassium Channel Blockers', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajpcell.1996.271.6.C2037 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1996 Dec;271(6 Pt 1):C2037-44. doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.1996.271.6.C2037.,,['GM-46834/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the poor response to ATRA and development of fever, a side effect of ATRA, G-CSF and prednisolone were administrated together with ATRA.

This led to the initial false assumption of HLA identity for the patient and her two sisters. However, assignment of haplotypes revealed one sister to be HLA identical with the patient and the other sister to be a one-haplotype five-antigen match with the patient, mismatching for one DRB1 allele.

Etoposide phosphate is water soluble and is rapidly converted in vivo to etoposide by endogenous phosphatases. Because it is water soluble, etoposide phosphate can be administered in volumes much smaller than those required with etoposide therapy, permitting rapid intravenous administration in the outpatient setting. We recently reported the results of a phase I study using etoposide phosphate on a bolus, daily x 5 schedule. Like others, we demonstrated that etoposide phosphate has pharmacokinetic properties virtually identical to those of etoposide. Our dose-finding study indicated that etoposide phosphate can be used in doses up to 100 mg/m2/d x 5 every 3 weeks in patients who have not had extensive prior chemotherapy, and that a dose of 75 mg/m2 would be appropriate for patients who had undergone multiple prior therapies or who had prior radiotherapy. The dose-limiting toxicity was neutropenia. Paclitaxel, a microtubule-stabilizing agent, is active against a variety of solid and hematopoietic malignancies that overlap with those against which etoposide is active. Because the mechanisms of action of these two agents differ, it is logical to suppose that the combination of the two agents might produce some additive effect when used to treat cancers that respond to both individual agents. We therefore undertook a phase I study using paclitaxel as a 3-hour infusion in combination with a 5-minute infusion of etoposide phosphate daily x 3 every 21 days. We used the 3-hour paclitaxel schedule because it has been shown to be less myelotoxic than longer infusions at the same doses. Our goal in this ongoing study is to determine the maximum tolerated doses of the two drugs in combination, to determine the toxicities of the regimen, and to assess its anticancer activity.","['Brooks, D J', 'Alberts, D S']","['Brooks DJ', 'Alberts DS']","['Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona Health Sciences Center, Tucson, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '528XYJ8L1N (etoposide phosphate)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Paclitaxel/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1996 Dec;23(6 Suppl 13):30-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We decided to use cardioxane in patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemias (AML) who have previously been treated with DNR doses above 500 mg/m2. Seven patients with relapsed AML received cardioxane 30 min before DNR or mitozantrone (MTZ) in doses 8-13x higher than DNR or 40-60x higher than MTZ. Two patients received anthracyclines cumulative doses corresponding to more than 1300 mg/m2 and 1000 mg/m2 of DNR, respectively, without any signs of cardiac toxicity.

The aim of the present study was to analyze the proportion of acute leukemia patients (both with lymphoid and myeloid leukemias) in which the immunological detection of leukemia-associated phenotypes was convenient for the distinction of leukemic and normal cells. For this purpose we have studied the blast cells from 186 acute leukemia patients at diagnosis with a large panel of monoclonal antibodies by flow cytometry using double staining combinations. From aberrant phenotypes on blast cells we followed lineage infidelity (coexpression of myeloid markers in lymphoid leukemia cells and vice versa, as well as the simultaneous expression of both, T and B cell markers in one lymphoid blast cell) and asynchronous marker expression (simultaneous expression of early and late markers in one cell). One hundred and five of the 186 acute leukemia cases analyzed (56%) showed the presence of leukemia-associated phenotypes. In 41 of the 90 ALL cases followed (46%) and in 40 of the 96 AML cases studied (42%) lineage infidelity was observed. Asynchronous antigen expression was detected in 24 followed cases (13%). Evaluation of the cell marker density by means of calibration microbeads demonstrated abnormal mean channel immunofluorescence and molecules of equivalent soluble fluorescein for CD8 in two patients with T cell malignancies at diagnosis. Abnormal CD8 density might thus represent a characteristic feature of malignant CD8-positive T cell clone. Quantitative marker evaluation therefore seems to be another important mean for the detection of aberrant phenotypes on leukemia cells suitable for the detection of minimal residual disease.","['Babusikova, O', 'Glasova, M', 'Konikova, E', 'Kusenda, J']","['Babusikova O', 'Glasova M', 'Konikova E', 'Kusenda J']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Blast Crisis/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Child', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*immunology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 1996;43(6):367-72.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To learn more about its antitumor effect we tested BS RNase on the growth of 16 cell lines derived from patients with various hematological malignancies. The cells of lymphoid origin were generally more susceptible to BS RNase, administered in the range of concentrations from 2 to 100 micrograms/ml, than the myeloid ones. RNaseA used at the same concentrations did not exert any inhibitory effect. The inhibitory effect of BS RNase persisted in cultured cells after three times wash in complete medium and cell recultivation in fresh medium free of BS RNase. Four cell lines were very little sensitive (KG-1 and U-937) or resistant (JOK and NAMALWA) to BS RNase regardless of their origin. The in vivo antitumor effect of BS RNase was tested on human prostate carcinoma transplanted to athymic nude mice. The daily dose of BS RNase (0.25 mg/20 g) was administered for three weeks except weekends (15 doses) by three different ways (intraperitoneally-i.p., subcutaneously-s.c. and intratumorally-i.t.). Whereas i.p. administration was ineffective, s.c. administration significantly reduced size of the tumors and i.t. administration abolished half of the tumors in treated mice.

Antigenic cross-linking of the Fc epsilon R1 on mast cells results in secretion of allergic mediators and induction of immediate early and cytokine genes. Here we examine the role of Ras in coupling the Fc epsilon R1 to transcriptional regulation. The transcription factors Elk-1, an immediate early gene regulator and the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), in the context of the IL-4 gene, are identified as Ras targets in mast cells. Ras mediates diverse effects via its diverse effector pathways, which may include other members of the Ras GTPase family such as RhoA and Rac-1. We observe that Elk-1 and NFAT are targeted by distinct Ras effector pathways in mast cells. Activation of the ""classical"" Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ ERK cascade is necessary and sufficient for Fc epsilon R1 induction of Elk-1. Ras function is required, but not sufficient for Fc epsilon R1 induction of NFAT. However, activation or inhibition of Ras markedly shifts the antigen dose-response for Fc epsilon R1 induction of NFAT. The effector pathway for Ras activation of NFAT is not Raf-1/MEK. We identify that the Rac-1 GTPase is critical in Fc epsilon R1 regulation of NFAT, acting either in parallel with or as an effector of Ras. These data place Ras in a crucial position in mast cells, regulating disparate nuclear targets. Moreover, we identify that two GTPases, Ras and Rac-1, are important regulators of NFAT, and therefore of cytokine expression in mast cells.","['Turner, H', 'Cantrell, D A']","['Turner H', 'Cantrell DA']","['Lymphocyte Activation Laboratory, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Elk1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Elk1 protein, rat)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ets-Domain Protein Elk-1)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mast Cells/immunology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'ets-Domain Protein Elk-1', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",1997/01/06 00:00,1997/01/06 00:01,['1997/01/06 00:00'],"['1997/01/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.185.1.43 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1997 Jan 6;185(1):43-53. doi: 10.1084/jem.185.1.43.,,,PMC2196099,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cloning of 10 different serine proteases and a carboxypeptidase A from various rat mast cell populations.,13-29,"Two of the major rat mast cell proteases, rat mast cell protease 1 (RMCP-1) and RMCP-2, have for many years served as important phenotypic markers for studies of various aspects of mast cell (MC) biology. However, except for these proteases only fragmentary information has been available on the structure and complexity of proteases expressed by different subpopulations of rat MCs. To address these questions, cDNA libraries were constructed from freshly isolated rat peritoneal MCs and from the rat mucosal MC line RBL-1. cDNA clones for 10 different serine proteases (RMCP-1-10), and the MC carboxypeptidase A were isolated and characterized. Six of these proteases have not been isolated previously. Based on their protease content, three separate subpopulations of MCs were identified. Connective tissue MCs (CTMCs) from the ear and peritoneum express the chymases RMCP-1 and -5, the tryptases RMCP-6, and -7 and the carboxypeptidase A. However, based on a large difference in the level of expression of RMCP-7, CTMCs of these two organs may be regarded as two separate subpopulations. RMCP-2 and the three closely related proteases of the RMCP-8 subfamily were identified as the major mucosal MC proteases in rat. In contrast to what has been reported for human MCs, no expression of cathepsin G or cathepsin G-like proteases was detected in any of the rat MC populations. To determine mRNA frequencies for the various proteases expressed by normal tissue MCs, an unamplified peritoneal MC cDNA library was screened with a panel of mono-specific cDNA probes. These results showed that peritoneal MCs are highly specialized effector cells with mRNA frequencies for the major proteases in the range of several percent of the total mRNA pool.","['Lutzelschwab, C', 'Pejler, G', 'Aveskogh, M', 'Hellman, L']","['Lutzelschwab C', 'Pejler G', 'Aveskogh M', 'Hellman L']","['Department of Medical Immunology and Microbiology, University of Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tpsb2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.- (Carboxypeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.17.1 (Carboxypeptidases A)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (chymase 2)', 'EC 3.4.21.39 (Chymases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tpsab1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tpsab1 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tpsb2 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carboxypeptidases/*biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Carboxypeptidases A', 'Chymases', 'Connective Tissue', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*enzymology', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mammals', 'Mast Cells/cytology/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Peritoneum', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tryptases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/01/06 00:00,1997/01/06 00:01,['1997/01/06 00:00'],"['1997/01/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.185.1.13 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1997 Jan 6;185(1):13-29. doi: 10.1084/jem.185.1.13.,"['GENBANK/U67907', 'GENBANK/U67908', 'GENBANK/U67909', 'GENBANK/U67910', 'GENBANK/U67911', 'GENBANK/U67912', 'GENBANK/U67913', 'GENBANK/U67914', 'GENBANK/U67915']",,PMC2196094,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the prevalence of late cardiotoxicity in patients treated with lower anthracycline doses and related this to survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Echocardiograms were performed in 50 normal children and 120 relapse-free ALL survivors 6.2 +/- 2.0 years after the end of cumulative daunorubicin doses of 90 mg/m2 (n = 40), 180 mg/m2 (n = 40), or 270 mg/m2 (n = 40) on UKALL X pilot (1982 to 1984) or UKALL X (1985 to 1989) protocols. Age at treatment onset was 4.7 +/- 2.8 years. Cardiac abnormalities were reviewed in light of the UKALL X 5-year disease-free survival rates of 57% (95% confidence interval [CI], 51% to 63%), 61% to 62% (95% CI, 56% to 68%), and 71% (95% CI, 66% to 76%) for the groups that received 90, 180, and 270 mg/m2 of daunorubicin, respectively. RESULTS: ALL survivors had reduced LV fractional shortening (FS) compared with normal (32.3% +/- 4.4% v 35.9% +/- 4.2%, P < .005), which was accounted for by increased LV end-systolic stress (49.4 +/- 13.5 v 42.2 +/- 9.1 g/cm2, P < .001), whereas LV contractility independent of loading conditions was normal for the group as a whole. Of 27 patients (23%) with cardiac abnormalities, 25 (21%) had increased end-systolic stress, whereas only two (2%) had reduced contractility. The proportion with cardiac abnormality was similar in the three dose groups. Anthracycline dose, age at treatment, sex, follow-up duration, growth hormone, pubertal status, hemoglobin level, and total WBC count at presentation were not predictive of increased LV end-systolic stress. CONCLUSION: There was a reduced incidence and severity of cardiac abnormalities with the lower anthracycline dose protocols (90 to 270 mg/m2) studied compared with previous reports in which subjects had received moderate anthracycline doses (approximately 300 to 550 mg/m2). Cumulative anthracycline dose within the range 90 to 270 mg/m2 did not relate to cardiac abnormalities. This suggests that there may be no safe anthracycline dose to avoid late cardiotoxicity, but reinforces the use of the protocol that affords best survival within the dose range studied.","['Sorensen, K', 'Levitt, G', 'Bull, C', 'Chessells, J', 'Sullivan, I']","['Sorensen K', 'Levitt G', 'Bull C', 'Chessells J', 'Sullivan I']","['Department of Cardiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children National Health Service Trust, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Heart Ventricles/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Survivors']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.1.61 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 Jan;15(1):61-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.1.61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further, using a case/control format based on multivariate analysis-derived predictors of survival, we evaluated the influence of splenectomy on survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1971 and 1993, 55 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia underwent splenectomy. They were compared with 55 fludarabine-treated patients who had been matched for age, serum albumin level, sex, hemoglobin level, Rai stage, number of prior therapies, and time from diagnosis. RESULTS: In the perioperative period, blood-product usage was modest, and common morbidities were limited to minor infections in 18% of the patients and pneumonia/atelectasis in 25%. Perioperative mortality was 9%. Deaths were related to septic complications in all cases and associated with a preoperative performance status > or = 2 (P = .05). The only predictor identified for hemoglobin and neutrophil increments was spleen weight (P < .05). No factors predictive of platelet increment were identified. The early death rate (within 30 days) and overall survival of splenectomy and control patients were not significantly different (P > .2). Among Rai stage IV patients, those who were splenectomized displayed a strong trend for improved overall survival (P = .15 by log-rank test). The 2-year actuarial survival rate of Rai stage IV patients was 51% +/- 9% in the splenectomy group and 28% +/- 9% in the control group. CONCLUSION: Splenectomy can be performed with modest morbidity, mortality, and resource utilization in patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia and significant cytopenias. The procedure results in major hematologic benefits in most patients, with hemoglobin and neutrophil increments correlated with spleen weight. Overall, the survival of splenectomized patients is equivalent to control patients. Thrombocytopenic patients (< 100 x 10(9)/L) are most likely to obtain hematologic benefit, and potentially enjoy improved survival. These patients would be suitable for a randomized study to establish definitively the role of splenectomy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Seymour, J F', 'Cusack, J D', 'Lerner, S A', 'Pollock, R E', 'Keating, M J']","['Seymour JF', 'Cusack JD', 'Lerner SA', 'Pollock RE', 'Keating MJ']","['Department of Clinical Haematology and Medical Oncology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['9034-51-9 (Hemoglobin A)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Hemoglobin A/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/mortality/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Morbidity', 'Organ Size', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Splenectomy/*adverse effects/mortality', 'Splenomegaly/pathology/surgery']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.1.52 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 Jan;15(1):52-60. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.1.52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients with acute leukemia not responsive to standard therapy were treated at eight dose levels of topotecan (2.5 mg/m2/d to 7.75 mg/m2/d). Topotecan was given as a 30-minute infusion daily with cytarabine 1 g/m2/d, both for 5 days. Using a flow-cytometric technique, the percent apoptotic cells in blood and bone marrow samples was determined, and the cell cycle distribution of the leukemic cells studied. RESULTS: Oropharyngeal mucositis was dose-limiting. The MTD of topotecan was 4.75 mg/m2/d for 5 days in high-risk patients and 7.0 mg/m2/d for 5 days in low-risk patients. The mean percent apoptotic cells in the peripheral blood reached a peak of 18.8%, a median of 48 hours following the first dose of topotecan. Patients with higher S-phase fractions, either before treatment or following cytarabine, were more likely to achieve bone marrow aplasia than those with lower S-phase fractions (P = .01 and P < .05, respectively). Clinical responses were seen in four of 39 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML; of whom 32 had received prior high-dose cytarabine), three of six with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and one of eight with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast phase (CML-BP). CONCLUSION: The recommended phase II dose of topotecan with intermediate-dose cytarabine is 4.75 mg/m2/d for high-risk patients and 7.0 mg/m2/d for low-risk patients.

Cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine [2-CdA]; Ortho Biotech, Raritan, NJ) is a newer purine analog with potent activity against indolent lymphoproliferative disorders. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated eight patients with cladribine 0.1 mg/kg/d for 7 days by continuous infusion or 0.14 mg/kg/d over 2 hours for 5 days, every 28 to 35 days, for a median of three courses (range, two to five). There were five men and three women, with a median age of 62 years and a median pretreatment duration of 6 months; four patients were previously untreated. RESULTS: All eight patients were assessable: five achieved a complete response with a median response duration of 14 months (range, 1+ to 55+), and three achieved a partial response with a median duration of 3 months (range, 1 to 3). Of four patients who achieved a complete response and in whom a peripheral-blood immunophenotypic analysis was performed, two had no circulating B-PLL cells and one had no residual disease on Southern blot analysis. Myelosuppression and infection were the major toxicities: three patients developed grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression, four had bacterial infections, and two had herpes zoster infections. CONCLUSION: In this small study of patients with de novo B-PLL, cladribine was an active agent that induced a high overall and complete response rate.

To determine the additional value of molecular monitoring during treatment for CML, we performed a prospective, sequential analysis using quantitative Southern blot monitoring of BCR gene rearrangements of blood and marrow samples from Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) study 8761. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-four previously untreated adults with chronic-phase CML who were enrolled onto CALGB 8761, a molecular-monitoring companion study to a treatment study for adults with chronic-phase CML (CALGB 9013). Treatment consisted of repetitive cycles of interferon alfa and low-dose subcutaneous cytarabine. Blood and marrow Southern blot quantitation of BCR gene rearrangements was compared with marrow cytogenetic analysis before the initiation of treatment and of specified points during therapy. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was performed to detect residual disease in patients who achieved a complete response by Southern blot or cytogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Quantitative molecular monitoring by Southern blot analysis of blood samples was found to be equivalent to marrow monitoring at all time points. Twelve of 62 (19%) follow-up samples studied by Southern blot analysis had a complete loss of BCR gene rearrangement in matched marrow and blood specimens. Southern blot monitoring of blood samples was also found to be highly correlated to marrow cytogenetic evaluation at all points, although there were four discordant cases in which Southern blot analysis of blood showed no BCR gene rearrangement, yet demonstrated from 12% to 20% Philadelphia chromosome-positive metaphase cells in the marrow. RT-PCR analysis detected residual disease in five of six patients in whom no malignant cells were detected using Southern blot or cytogenetic analyses. CONCLUSION: Quantitative Southern blot analysis of blood samples may be substituted for bone marrow to monitor the response to therapy in CML and results in the need for fewer bone marrow examinations. To avoid overestimating the degree of response, marrow cytogenetic analysis should be performed when patients achieve a complete response by Southern blot monitoring. This approach provides a rational, cost-effective strategy to monitor the effect of treatment of individual patients, as well as to analyze large clinical trials in CML.","['Stock, W', 'Westbrook, C A', 'Peterson, B', 'Arthur, D C', 'Szatrowski, T P', 'Silver, R T', 'Sher, D A', 'Wu, D', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Schiffer, C A', 'Bloomfield, C D']","['Stock W', 'Westbrook CA', 'Peterson B', 'Arthur DC', 'Szatrowski TP', 'Silver RT', 'Sher DA', 'Wu D', 'Le Beau MM', 'Schiffer CA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Department of Medicine, University of Illinois, Chicago, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/therapy', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prospective Studies', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.1.26 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 Jan;15(1):26-36. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.1.26.,,"['CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ST32DK07134-5/ST/OHS HRSA HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The EFS rate of patients less than 50 years verus > or = 50 years of age was 46% versus 34% (P = .03). Cox regression analysis showed that age was predictive for EFS (RR for patients 50 to 65 years, 1.4; P = .03). The actuarial RRM rate for these age groups was 7.4% versus 12.7% (P = .07), respectively. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age (odds ratio [OR] for patients 50 to 65 years, 1.9; P < .05) and period of transplantation (OR for most recent years [1991 to 1995], 0.6; P = .06) were the most predictive factors for RRM. CONCLUSION: Although age greater than 50 years is associated with an inferior outcome following autologous hematopoietic-cell transplantation, it does not appear to be warranted to limit this potentially curative procedure based solely on age. The upper age limit of high-dose therapy with autologous progenitor-cell and/ or bone marrow support remains to be defined.","['Kusnierz-Glaz, C R', 'Schlegel, P G', 'Wong, R M', 'Schriber, J R', 'Chao, N J', 'Amylon, M D', 'Hu, W W', 'Negrin, R S', 'Lee, Y', 'Blume, K G', 'Long, G D']","['Kusnierz-Glaz CR', 'Schlegel PG', 'Wong RM', 'Schriber JR', 'Chao NJ', 'Amylon MD', 'Hu WW', 'Negrin RS', 'Lee Y', 'Blume KG', 'Long GD']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University Medical Center, CA 94305-5290, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Hodgkin Disease/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.1.18 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 Jan;15(1):18-25. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.1.18.,,['P01-CA 49605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective review of all BMT patients undergoing FOB during a 4-year period. SETTING: A tertiary care university hospital. RESULTS: Three hundred five patients underwent BMT; 71 (23%) had FOB to assess pulmonary infiltrates. Allogeneic BMT recipients underwent FOB 3.37 times more often than autologous recipients (p < 0.001). Pathogens were identified in 31 (46%) patients undergoing FOB; bacteria were most commonly isolated although 86% of patients had received broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics. Therapy was changed in 20 (65%) patients when a microorganism was identified and in 9 (22%) with nondiagnostic results (p = 0.0026), but isolation of a presumed pathogen had no apparent effect on survival. There were 19 (27%) FOB complications, including bleeding in 8 (11%) patients and death in 2 (3%). Major complications were associated with prolonged prothrombin time (p = 0.006) and were more common (36% vs 14%; p < 0.05) in patients who had protected specimen brushing vs BAL alone. Mortality at 40 months in BMT patients not requiring FOB was 33% compared with 61% mortality in those undergoing FOB (p < 0.001); mortality was 96% in patients with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: FOB is diagnostically useful in the evaluation of some BMT patients with pulmonary complications and often influences therapy, although no impact on survival was clearly demonstrated. FOB should be performed only after benefits of the procedure are weighed carefully against its increased risk in this select population.","['Dunagan, D P', 'Baker, A M', 'Hurd, D D', 'Haponik, E F']","['Dunagan DP', 'Baker AM', 'Hurd DD', 'Haponik EF']","['Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Wake Forest University Medical Center, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Chest,Chest,0231335,,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Bronchoscopy', 'Female', 'Fiber Optic Technology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/surgery', 'Lung Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma/mortality/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications/*diagnosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0012-3692(15)46734-0 [pii]', '10.1378/chest.111.1.135 [doi]']",ppublish,Chest. 1997 Jan;111(1):135-41. doi: 10.1378/chest.111.1.135.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously we developed genetically simple derivatives of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) that can replicate in tissue culture independently of the BLV regulatory proteins, Tax and Rex, and the RIII and GIV open reading frames (K. Boris-Lawrie and H. M. Temin, J. Virol. 69:1920-1924, 1995). These derivatives are encoded on novel, hybrid retrovirus genomes that contain transcriptional control sequences of a simple retrovirus and gag-pol or env genes of the complex BLV. The first-generation simple BLV derivatives replicate as complementary viruses (coviruses) by using separate gag-pol or env genomes, and therefore virus spread is limited to cells that are infected with both covirus genomes. Here we describe a second-generation simple BLV derivative that is encoded on a single hybrid genome. We show the virus to be replication competent by successive passage on D17 target cells and by analysis of viral RNA and proteins in the infected cells. Furthermore, we evaluate the immunogenicity and infectivity of the simple BLV derivatives in a BLV animal model. Small groups of rats were injected either with virus-producing cells or with proviral DNA. Western immunoblot analysis revealed that antibodies against the major viral antigenic determinants are induced in response to either method of introduction and that seroconversion is sustained in most of the rats for at least 6 months (the duration of the study). The magnitudes of the antiviral responses were similar in rats infected with the first-generation simple BLV coviruses, the second-generation replication-competent derivative, or wild-type BLV. Wild-type BLV typically infects peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and the simple BLV derivatives were also found to infect PBMC as demonstrated by PCR amplification of proviral sequences and reverse transcriptase PCR amplification of viral RNA in treated rats. These results establish that simple BLV derivatives lacking tax and rex are infectious and immunogenic in rats. These viruses will be useful tools in comparative studies with BLV to evaluate the role of tax and rex in maintenance of virus load and in disease outcome.","['Boris-Lawrie, K', 'Altanerova, V', 'Altaner, C', 'Kucerova, L', 'Temin, H M']","['Boris-Lawrie K', 'Altanerova V', 'Altaner C', 'Kucerova L', 'Temin HM']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences and Center for Retrovirus Research, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210, USA. boris-lawrie.1@osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Dogs', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, Regulator', '*Genes, Viral', '*Genes, pX', '*Genome, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.2.1514-1520.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Feb;71(2):1514-20. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.2.1514-1520.1997.,,['R03-TW00065-03/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States'],PMC191208,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 5'-end joining step has never been investigated, either for retroviral integration or for any other transposition process. We have developed an assay for 5'-end joining in vivo and have examined the kinetics of 5'-end joining for Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV). The interval between 3'-end and 5'-end joining is estimated to be less than 1 h. This assay will be a useful tool for examining whether viral or host components mediate 5'-end joining.

Of particular interest were eight strains from Pygmies of remote areas of Cameroon and the Central African Republic (CAR), considered to be the oldest inhabitants of these regions. Eight long-term activated T-cell lines producing HTLV-1 gag and env antigens were established from peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures of HTLV-1 seropositive individuals, including three from Pygmies. A fragment of the env gene encompassing most of the gp21 transmembrane region was sequenced for the 58 new strains, while the complete long terminal repeat (LTR) region was sequenced for 9 strains, including 4 from Pygmies. Comparative sequence analyses and phylogenetic studies performed on both the env and LTR regions by the neighbor-joining and DNA parsimony methods demonstrated that all 22 strains from West and South Africa belong to the widespread cosmopolitan subtype (also called HTLV-1 subtype A). Within or alongside the previously described Zairian cluster (HTLV-1 subtype B), we discovered a number of new HTLV-1 variants forming different subgroups corresponding mainly to the geographical origins of the infected persons, Cameroon, Gabon, and Zaire. Six of the eight Pygmy strains clustered together within this Central African subtype, suggesting a common origin. Furthermore, three new strains (two originating from Pygmies from Cameroon and the CAR, respectively, and one from a Gabonese individual) were particularly divergent and formed a distinct new phylogenetic cluster, characterized by specific mutations and occupying in most analyses a unique phylogenetic position between the large Central African genotype (HTLV-1 subtype B) and the Melanesian subtype (HTLV-1 subtype C). We have tentatively named this new HTLV-1 genotype HTLV-1 subtype D. While the HTLV-1 subtype D strains were not closely related to any known African strain of simian T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (STLV-1), other Pygmy strains and some of the new Cameroonian and Gabonese HTLV-1 strains were very similar (>98% nucleotide identity) to chimpanzee STLV-1 strains, reinforcing the hypothesis of interspecies transmission between humans and monkeys in Central Africa.","['Mahieux, R', 'Ibrahim, F', 'Mauclere, P', 'Herve, V', 'Michel, P', 'Tekaia, F', 'Chappey, C', 'Garin, B', 'Van Der Ryst, E', 'Guillemain, B', 'Ledru, E', 'Delaporte, E', 'de The, G', 'Gessain, A']","['Mahieux R', 'Ibrahim F', 'Mauclere P', 'Herve V', 'Michel P', 'Tekaia F', 'Chappey C', 'Garin B', 'Van Der Ryst E', 'Guillemain B', 'Ledru E', 'Delaporte E', 'de The G', 'Gessain A']","[""Unite d'Epidemiologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Africa, Central', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Evolution, Molecular', '*Genes, env', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Sequence Analysis']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.2.1317-1333.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Feb;71(2):1317-33. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.2.1317-1333.1997.,"['GENBANK/L46600', 'GENBANK/L46601', 'GENBANK/L46602', 'GENBANK/L46603', 'GENBANK/L46604', 'GENBANK/L46606', 'GENBANK/L46607', 'GENBANK/L46608', 'GENBANK/L46609', 'GENBANK/L46610', 'GENBANK/L46611', 'GENBANK/L46612', 'GENBANK/L46613', 'GENBANK/L46614', 'GENBANK/L46615', 'GENBANK/L46616', 'GENBANK/L46617', 'GENBANK/L46618', 'GENBANK/L46619', 'GENBANK/L46620', 'GENBANK/L46621', 'GENBANK/L46622', 'GENBANK/L46623', 'GENBANK/L46624', 'GENBANK/L46625', 'GENBANK/L46626', 'GENBANK/L46627', 'GENBANK/L46628', 'GENBANK/L46629', 'GENBANK/L46630']",,PMC191187,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The T-cell lymphomagenic MuLV SL3-3 (SL3-3) also contains a c-Myb binding site adjacent to the Ets site. The presence of this Myb site distinguishes SL3 from most other MuLVs. We tested the importance of these two sites for the lymphomagenicity of SL3-3. Mutation of the Ets site had little effect on viral pathogenicity, as it only slightly extended the latency period to disease onset. In contrast, mutation of the Myb site strongly inhibited pathogenicity, as only a minority of the inoculated mice developed tumors in the two mouse strains that were tested. All tumors that were induced by either mutant appeared to be lymphomas, and no evidence for reversion of either mutation was detected. The effects of the Ets and Myb site mutations on transcriptional activity of the SL3 LTR were tested by inserting the viral enhancer sequences into a plasmid containing the promoter region of the c-myc gene linked to a reporter gene. Mutation the Myb site almost eliminated enhancer activity in T lymphocytes, while mutation of the Ets site had smaller effects. Thus, the effects of the enhancer mutations on transcriptional activity in T cells paralleled their effects on viral lymphomagenicity. The absence of the c-Myb site in the LTR enhancer of the weakly lymphomagenic MuLV, Akv, likely contributes to the low pathogenicity of this virus relative to SL3-3. However, Moloney MuLV also lacks the Myb site in its LTR, although it induces T-cell lymphomas with a potency similar to that of SL3-3. Thus, it appears that SL3-3 and Moloney MuLV evolved genetic determinants of T-cell lymphomagenicity that are, at least in part, distinct.","['Nieves, A', 'Levy, L S', 'Lenz, J']","['Nieves A', 'Levy LS', 'Lenz J']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*virology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.2.1213-1219.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Feb;71(2):1213-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.2.1213-1219.1997.,,"['CA13330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44822/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC191175,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, mutation of binding sites in the U3 repeat region for the AML1 transcription factor family (also known as core binding factor [CBF], polyomavirus enhancer binding protein 2 [PEBP2], and SL3-3 enhancer factor 1 [SEF1]) were found to strongly reduce the pathogenicity of SL3-3 (B. Hallberg, J. Schmidt, A. Luz, F. S. Pedersen, and T. Grundstrom, J. Virol. 65:4177-4181, 1991). We have now examined the few cases in which tumors developed harboring proviruses that besides the AML1 (core) site mutations carried second-site alterations in their U3 repeat structures. In three distinct cases we observed the same type of alteration which involved deletions of regions known to contain binding sites for nuclear factor 1 (NF1) and the addition of extra enhancer repeat elements. In transient-expression experiments in T-lymphoid cells, these new U3 regions acted as stronger enhancers than the U3 regions of the original viruses. This suggests that the altered proviruses represent more-pathogenic variants selected for in the process of tumor formation. To analyze the proviral alterations, we generated a series of different enhancer-promoter reporter constructs. These constructs showed that the additional repeat elements are not critical for enhancer strength, whereas the NF1 sites down-regulate the level of transcription in T-lymphoid cells whether or not the AML1 (core) sites are functional. We therefore also tested SL3-3 viruses with mutated NF1 sites. These viruses have unimpaired pathogenic properties and thereby distinguish SL3-3 from Moloney murine leukemia virus.","['Ethelberg, S', 'Hallberg, B', 'Lovmand, J', 'Schmidt, J', 'Luz, A', 'Grundstrom, T', 'Pedersen, F S']","['Ethelberg S', 'Hallberg B', 'Lovmand J', 'Schmidt J', 'Luz A', 'Grundstrom T', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular and Structural Biology, University of Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Core Binding Factors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.2.1196-1206.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Feb;71(2):1196-206. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.2.1196-1206.1997.,"['GENBANK/Y09129', 'GENBANK/Y09130', 'GENBANK/Y09131', 'GENBANK/Y09132', 'GENBANK/Y09133', 'GENBANK/Y09134', 'GENBANK/Y09135']",,PMC191173,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Replication was restored upon complementation with a synthetic gene designed to encode a complementary tRNA-like primer, but not with a noncomplementary tRNA-like molecule. The engineered primer was shown to be involved in both the initiation of first-strand synthesis and second-strand transfer.

The ability of Tax to transform cells is believed to depend on its transactivation of cellular-growth-regulatory genes. Expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is intimately linked to cell growth and DNA replication and repair. By testing a series of PCNA promoter deletion constructs, we have demonstrated that the PCNA promoter can be transactivated by Tax. The smallest construct that was activated did not include the ATF/CRE binding site at nucleotide -50, and mutations in the ATF/CRE element in the context of a larger promoter were still activated by Tax. In addition, a Tax mutant that is defective for activation of the CRE pathway retained the ability to activate the -397 promoter construct. When a series of linker scanner mutations that span the region from nucleotide -45 to -7 were assayed, mutations in and around a repeat sequence were found to abolish Tax transactivation. Multimerized copies of either half of the repeat were Tax responsive. A single protein complex was shown to bind specifically to the Tax-responsive region, and the binding of this complex was enhanced in the presence of Tax. These results demonstrate that the PCNA promoter contains a Tax-responsive element located between nucleotides -45 and -7 whose sequence is different from those of other, previously identified Tax-responsive elements.

Overall, these INs required specific LTR sequences for optimal catalysis of 3'-processing reactions, as opposed to strand transfer and disintegration reactions. It is of particular note that in strand transfer reactions the sites of integration were similar among the four INs. In the 3'-processing reaction, sequence specificity for each IN was traced to the three nucleotides proximal to the conserved CA. Reactions catalyzed by M-MuLV IN were additionally influenced by upstream regions. The nucleotide requirements for optimal catalysis differed for each IN. HIV-1 IN showed a broad range of substrate specificities, while HTLV-1 IN and HTLV-2 IN had more defined sequence requirements. M-MuLV IN exhibited greater activity with the heterologous LTR substrates than with its own wild-type substrate. This finding was further substantiated by the high levels of activity catalyzed by the IN on modified M-MuLV LTRs.

Instead, a smaller Nef-related product with an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa was associated with wild-type virions, indicating that packaging of Nef resulted in cleavage by the viral PR. The presence of the HIV-1 PR inhibitor A77003 during virus production prevented the appearance of the 18-kDa Nef product and caused an accumulation of full-length Nef in virion preparations. Nef associated with comparable efficiency with viral particles produced by the Gag polyproteins of HIV-1 and Moloney murine leukemia virus, indicating that no specific interaction with a virion component is required for the incorporation of Nef. The N-terminal 86 amino acids of Nef were sufficient for packaging into virions.

DNase I footprinting assays located a protein-binding site in the region of -64 to -34 bp from the transcriptional start site, and point mutation analysis confirmed the location of this cis-acting element, designated the let response element (LRE), and defined a binding motif. This LRE is distinct from binding sites for currently known transcription factors in the class I MHC gene promoter and is conserved in the promoters of human and murine MHC class I genes.

In the absence of model covariates, the data fit was characterized by considerable bias, as indicated by the plot of measured vs predicted ara-C concentrations. The fit of the data was greatly improved when the parameters total body clearance (CL), intercompartmental clearance (Q), and volumes of distribution of central (Vd1) and peripheral (Vd2) compartments were expressed as linear functions of the covariate product, AGE x SA. The final parameter estimates were: CL = 2.59 x AGE x SA 1/h, Q = 2.01 x AGE x SA 1/h, Vd1 = 0.48 x AGE x SA1, and Vd2 = 38.1 x AGE x SA1. The coefficients of variation of CL, Q, Vd1 and Vd2 were 83.79%, 12.08%, 40.0%, and 52.54%, respectively, indicating substantial interindividual variability. In separate NONMEM analyses, the PK of ara-C and its metabolite uracil arabinoside (ara-U) were modeled simultaneously in order to investigate whether the dependence of ara-C on patient age was due to increased deamination of ara-C to ara-U. The PK of ara-C were described by the two-compartment open model while the PK of ara-U were simultaneously described by the one-compartment open model. The conversion of ara-C to ara-U was modeled as a first-order kinetic process due to the relatively low concentrations of ara-C in plasma. These PPK analyses indicated that elimination of ara-C from the central compartment occurs primarily by its metabolic conversion to ara-U and that the rate of conversion of ara-C to ara-U increases with increasing patient age, which explains the higher ratios of ara-U to ara-C and, hence, the increased ara-C clearance observed in older children as compared to infants. We conclude that the NONMEM PPK methodology allowed the simultaneous analyses of data from different doses and dose regimens and explained phenomena that prior standard two-stage analyses could not.","['Periclou, A P', 'Avramis, V I']","['Periclou AP', 'Avramis VI']","[""Department of Pediatrics, University of Southern California, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, 90027, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '3083-77-0 (Arabinofuranosyluracil)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Arabinofuranosyluracil/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', '*Models, Biological']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050536 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1996;39(1-2):42-50. doi: 10.1007/s002800050536.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior studies have suggested that NDDP is a prodrug that exerts its biological activity through activation within the liposome bilayers containing dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) before in vivo administration. In order to understand the kinetics of the intraliposomal degradation/activation of different liposomal Pt complexes, we studied the effects of their structure, lipid composition, content of acidic phospholipids and size, and the effects of pH, temperature and the presence of residual chloroform on their stability, in vitro cytotoxicity, and in vivo antitumor activity. The following factors were found to enhance the intraliposomal degradation/activation of Pt complexes: (1) the size and spatial configuration of the Pt complex, (2) an acidic pH, (3) a high temperature, (4) the presence and amount of acidic phospholipids, and (5) the presence of residual chloroform. Liposome size did not affect the intraliposomal stability of different Pt complexes. Good inverse relationships between the extent of drug degradation and in vitro cytotoxicity and between the extent of drug degradation and in vivo antitumor potency were observed, thus confirming that the biological activity of these complexes is exerted through the intraliposomal formation of certain active intermediate(s). The only active intermediate that could be identified was cis-bis-dichloro-trans-R,R-1,2-diaminocyclohexane platinum(II) whose structure was confirmed by 1H, 13C, and 195Pt nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.","['Han, I', 'Khokhar, A R', 'Perez-Soler, R']","['Han I', 'Khokhar AR', 'Perez-Soler R']","['Department of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '113427-19-3 (bis-neodecanoato-1,2-diaminocyclohexaneplatinum(II))', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Carriers', 'Drug Stability', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Liposomes', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050533 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1996;39(1-2):17-24. doi: 10.1007/s002800050533.,,['CA 58342/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown SH2-containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 forms stable complexes with BCR-ABL and Grb2 in BCR-ABL-transformed cells (Tauchi, T., Feng, G. S., Shen, R., Song, H. Y., Donner, D., Pawson, T., and Broxmeyer, H. E. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 15381-15387). To elucidate the structural requirement of BCR-ABL for the interactions with SH2-containing signaling molecules, we examined a series of BCR-ABL mutants which include the Grb2 binding site-deleted BCR-ABL (1-63 BCR/ABL), the tetramerization domain-deleted BCR-ABL (64-509 BCR/ABL), and the SH2 domain-deleted BCR-ABL (BCR/ABL deltaSH2). These BCR-ABL mutants were previously shown to reduce the transforming activity in fibroblasts. We found that the tetramerization domain-deleted BCR-ABL did not induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 and the interactions of BCR-ABL, SHP-2, and Grb2. In vitro kinase assays have also shown that the tetramerization domain-deleted BCR-ABL mutant did not phosphorylate GST-SHP-2 in vitro. SHP-2 was co-immunoprecipitated with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in BCR/ABL p210-transformed cells; however, this interaction was not observed in the tetramerization domain-deleted BCR-ABL mutant. Therefore the tetramerization domain of BCR-ABL is essential for interactions of these downstream molecules.","['Tauchi, T', 'Miyazawa, K', 'Feng, G S', 'Broxmeyer, H E', 'Toyama, K']","['Tauchi T', 'Miyazawa K', 'Feng GS', 'Broxmeyer HE', 'Toyama K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Conformation', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', '*src Homology Domains']",1997/01/10 00:00,1997/01/10 00:01,['1997/01/10 00:00'],"['1997/01/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/10 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.2.1389 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)77620-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Jan 10;272(2):1389-94. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.2.1389.,,"['R01 HL46549/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL54037/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA36464/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we demonstrate that the Grb2 adapter protein, when expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, associates with four tyrosine-phosphorylated molecules (116, 76, 36, and 31 kDa) from lysates of stimulated RBL-2H3 cells. We show further that the 76-kDa protein is SLP-76, a hematopoietic cell-specific protein first identified as a Grb2-binding protein in T cells. Upon stimulation of the high affinity receptor for IgE, SLP-76 undergoes rapid tyrosine phosphorylation and associates with two additional tyrosine phosphoproteins of 62 and 130 kDa via the SH2 domain of SLP-76. Additional studies demonstrate that the SLP-76 SH2 domain also binds a protein kinase from stimulated RBL-2H3 cell lysates. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of SLP-76 requires Syk activity but is not dependent on Ca+2 mobilization. These data, together with our previous work documenting its role in T-cell activation, suggest that SLP-76 and the proteins with which it associates may play a fundamental role in coupling signaling events in multiple cell types in the immune system.","['Hendricks-Taylor, L R', 'Motto, D G', 'Zhang, J', 'Siraganian, R P', 'Koretzky, G A']","['Hendricks-Taylor LR', 'Motto DG', 'Zhang J', 'Siraganian RP', 'Koretzky GA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City 52246, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (Grb2 protein, rat)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (SLP-76 signal Transducing adaptor proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Syk Kinase', 'src Homology Domains']",1997/01/10 00:00,1997/01/10 00:01,['1997/01/10 00:00'],"['1997/01/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/10 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.2.1363 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)77616-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Jan 10;272(2):1363-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.2.1363.,,['R01GM 53256/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Role of basic helix-loop-helix proteins.,369-78,"The human beta-globin gene cluster is regulated in part by a distal locus control region that is required for opening a chromatin domain in erythroid cells and enhancing expression of the beta-like globin genes at the correct developmental stages. One part of the locus control region, called hypersensitive site 2 (HS2), functions as a strong enhancer. Matches to the consensus binding sites for basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins (E boxes) are well conserved within the HS2 core. We show that mutations of the HS2 core that alter an invariant E box cause a 3.5-fold reduction in enhancement of expression of an epsilon-globin reporter gene in transiently transfected K562 cells, both before and after induction. Mutations of the HS2 core that alter a less-highly conserved E box cause a more modest reduction in enhancement. Footprint analysis shows binding of erythroid nuclear proteins in vitro to the invariant E box as well as an adjacent CAC/GTG box. Probes containing the E box regions form sequence-specific complexes with proteins from both K562 and MEL nuclear extracts; these are disrupted by the same mutations that decrease enhancement. Some of these latter complexes contain known bHLH proteins, as revealed by specific loss of individual complexes when treated with antibodies against TAL1 and USF. Interaction between the E boxes and the bHLH proteins, as well as other binding proteins, could account for the role of these sites in enhancement by HS2.","['Elnitski, L', 'Miller, W', 'Hardison, R']","['Elnitski L', 'Miller W', 'Hardison R']","['Department of Biochemistry, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park 16802, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (USF1 protein, human)', '0 (Upstream Stimulatory Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Globins/*genetics', '*Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Upstream Stimulatory Factors']",1997/01/03 00:00,1997/01/03 00:01,['1997/01/03 00:00'],"['1997/01/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/03 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.272.1.369 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)78603-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Jan 3;272(1):369-78. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.1.369.,,"['R01 DK27635/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 LM05110/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 LM05773/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A study zone around each nuclear site was constructed from enumeration districts within 25 km. Expected numbers were calculated, adjusting for sex, age, and indices of deprivation and urban-rural residence. Six statistical tests were evaluated. Stone's maximum likelihood ratio (unconditional application) was applied as the main test for general increased incidence across a study zone. The linear risk score based on enumeration districts (conditional application) was used as a secondary test for declining risk with distance from each site. RESULTS: More cases were observed (O) than expected (E) in the study zones around Rosyth naval base (O/E 1.02), Chapelcross electricity generating station (O/E 1.08), and Dounreay reprocessing plant (O/E 1.99). The maximum likelihood ratio test reached significance only for Dounreay (P = 0.030). The linear risk score test did not indicate a trend in risk with distance from any of the seven sites, including Dounreay. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of a generally increased risk of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma around nuclear sites in Scotland, nor any evidence of a trend of decreasing risk with distance from any of the sites. There was a significant excess risk in the zone around Dounreay, which was only partially accounted for by the sociodemographic characteristics of the area. The statistical power of tests for localised increased risk of disease around a point source should be assessed in each new setting in which they are applied.","['Sharp, L', 'Black, R J', 'Harkness, E F', 'McKinney, P A']","['Sharp L', 'Black RJ', 'Harkness EF', 'McKinney PA']","['Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, University of Aberdeen, Foresterhill, Scotland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Models, Statistical', '*Nuclear Reactors', '*Power Plants', 'Scotland/epidemiology']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.53.12.823 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 1996 Dec;53(12):823-31. doi: 10.1136/oem.53.12.823.,,,PMC1128616,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of action of 4-HPR toxicity is unknown. 4-HPR induces apoptosis in leukemia- and lymphoma-derived cells, neuroblastoma, and small cell lung cancers. The present study was designed to investigate: (a) the mechanism of 4-HPR cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cells; and (b) correlate increased expression of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1) with induction of apoptosis. 4-HPR exposure to PC-3 cells in vitro was associated with apoptosis as evidenced by increased incidence of hypodiploid nuclei in propidium iodide fluorescence histograms and DNA fragmentation. An increase in the percentage of nuclei in the G1 phase of the cell cycle preceded induction of apoptosis. TGF beta 1-increased expression was noted in mRNA levels and in secretion of active TGF beta 1 into culture media. TGF beta 1 and TGF-beta receptor type II detected immunohistochemically were increased in 4-HPR-treated PC-3 cells. Furthermore, 4-HPR-induced cytotoxicity in PC-3 cells was abrogated by the addition of anti-TGF beta 1 antibody. In BT-20 cells, a 4-HPR-resistant breast carcinoma cell line, apoptosis was not observed after exposure to 4-HPR nor was TGF beta 1 expression enhanced in stained cells or in conditioned media. It is concluded that 4-HPR induces the expression of TGF beta 1 in association with the induction of apoptosis.","['Roberson, K M', 'Penland, S N', 'Padilla, G M', 'Selvan, R S', 'Kim, C S', 'Fine, R L', 'Robertson, C N']","['Roberson KM', 'Penland SN', 'Padilla GM', 'Selvan RS', 'Kim CS', 'Fine RL', 'Robertson CN']","['Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Female', 'Fenretinide/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1997 Jan;8(1):101-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The normal c-Myb protein is essential for hematopoietic development. Previous reports suggested that truncation of c-Myb is required for oncogenic transformation of avian myelomonocytic cells in culture. In this study, we demonstrate that constitutive expression of full-length c-Myb can transform avian myelomonocytic cells isolated from embryonic yolk sacs by using a strategy to enhance the efficiency of infection and/or expression of c-myb-containing viruses. c-Myb-transformed myelomonocytic cells display a different phenotype than cells transformed by v-MybAMV or other Myb mutants. c-Myb-transformed yolk sac cells are heterogeneous populations with characteristics of both the macrophage and granulocyte lineages. Our results demonstrate that constitutive expression of full-length c-Myb is sufficient to activate its oncogenic potential, but that the target cells for c-Myb are relatively rare and presumably quite immature.","['Fu, S L', 'Lipsick, J S']","['Fu SL', 'Lipsick JS']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University, California 94305-5324, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-myb)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Fibroblasts', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Granulocytes/*physiology', 'Monocytes/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins v-myb', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transfection/methods', 'Yolk Sac/cytology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1997 Jan;8(1):35-45.,,['R01 CA56509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early events in CD28 signaling include recruitment and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and activation of the protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), LCK and EMT. Recruitment and activation of PI3-kinase is known to be dependent upon phosphorylation of tyrosine 173 of the CD28 cytoplasmic tail contained within a YMNM motif. By contrast, little is known of which residues of the CD28 tail, including tyrosines, are required for the activation of PTKs. To address this we studied the ability of truncation mutants and tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution mutants of the CD28 cytoplasmic tail to activate LCK and EMT in Jurkat T leukemia cells. Our results indicate that 1) activation of EMT is partially dependent upon tyrosine 173 of the CD28 tail, although it does not require PI3-kinase activation; 2) activation of LCK is independent of CD28 cytoplasmic tail tyrosine residues; and 3) elements sufficient for the activation of both kinases are contained within the first half of the tail. In addition we studied the CD28 tail as a substrate for both PTKs in in vitro kinase assays. We demonstrate that EMT can phosphorylate all four tyrosines of the CD28 tail, in contrast to LCK, which phosphorylates only tyrosine 173. Together with evidence that in vivo, tyrosines other than tyrosine 173 become phosphorylated following CD28 stimulation, this finding suggests that, like LCK, one function of EMT during CD28 signaling is phosphorylation of the receptor.","['King, P D', 'Sadra, A', 'Teng, J M', 'Xiao-Rong, L', 'Han, A', 'Selvakumar, A', 'August, A', 'Dupont, B']","['King PD', 'Sadra A', 'Teng JM', 'Xiao-Rong L', 'Han A', 'Selvakumar A', 'August A', 'Dupont B']","['The Immunology Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (emt protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['CD28 Antigens/analysis/*drug effects/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/*immunology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/drug effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*drug effects/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tyrosine/analysis/*drug effects/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'src-Family Kinases/*drug effects/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1997/01/15 00:00,1997/01/15 00:01,['1997/01/15 00:00'],"['1997/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1997 Jan 15;158(2):580-90.,,"['CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09149/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of these mHag are restricted to hemopoietic cells, others show a broad tissue expression. Therefore, antileukemia reactivity is often associated with graft-vs-host disease. Here, we report the identification of a B cell leukemia-associated mHag, HB-1, recognized by a CD8+ CTL clone derived from peripheral blood of an acute lymphoblastic B cell leukemia patient who has been treated by HLA-matched bone marrow transplantation. Interestingly, the CTL clone that recognizes HB-1 exhibits specific cytotoxicity toward leukemic as well as EBV-transformed B cells, but not against untransformed B cells. Moreover, the CTL clone does not lyse PHA-stimulated T cell blasts, monocytes, and fibroblasts, indicating that HB-1 is mainly expressed by transformed B cells. Further analysis reveals that HB-1 is restricted by HLA-B44 (both B*4402 and B*4403) and that 28% of HLA-B44-positive individuals express HB-1. These findings demonstrate that leukemia-associated mHag with a restricted tissue distribution, such as HB-1, elicit CTL reactivity in vivo. These Ags are of potential use in immunotherapy against leukemia because they generate antileukemia reactivity that is not associated with graft-vs-host disease.","['Dolstra, H', 'Fredrix, H', 'Preijers, F', 'Goulmy, E', 'Figdor, C G', 'de Witte, T M', 'van de Wiel-van Kemenade, E']","['Dolstra H', 'Fredrix H', 'Preijers F', 'Goulmy E', 'Figdor CG', 'de Witte TM', 'van de Wiel-van Kemenade E']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B44 Antigen)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis/*immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Female', 'HLA-B Antigens/genetics', 'HLA-B44 Antigen', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*analysis/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Organ Specificity/immunology', 'Pedigree', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1997/01/15 00:00,1997/01/15 00:01,['1997/01/15 00:00'],"['1997/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1997 Jan 15;158(2):560-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The article presents a review of available methods for the detection of minimal residual disease in conjunction with ABMT, especially regarding their relative sensitivity and specificity.","['Jorgensen, H', 'Bukh, A', 'Hokland, P', 'Ellegaard, J', 'Madsen, P S', 'Hokland, M']","['Jorgensen H', 'Bukh A', 'Hokland P', 'Ellegaard J', 'Madsen PS', 'Hokland M']","['Institut for medicinsk mikrobiologi, Arhus Universitet, Barholin Bygningen, Arhus.']",['dan'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Sweden,Nord Med,Nordisk medicin,0401001,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytogenetics/methods', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nord Med. 1996 Dec;111(10):344-7.,,,,15,Diagnostik af minimal residual sygdom ved autolog knoglemarvstransplantation.,,,,,,,,,,,,

HAM/TSP and ATL occur infrequently among HTLV-I-infected individuals, and rarely develop in the same individual. To study host and viral factors involved in the induction, tissue tropism, as well as pathogenesis of HAM/TSP, peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 14 patients with HAM/TSP and from 9 controls were introduced into severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice by intraperitoneal injection. Mice were followed for up to 26 weeks. Human IgG was produced from 2 to 14 weeks after reconstitution in all animals. Thirty-two of 44 mice (72%) showed circulating human antibody against the major viral protein products of HTLV-I. Analysis of viral sequences by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) demonstrated HTLV-I sequences in 21/38 (55%) brains and in 7/17 (41%) spinal cords from HTLV-I-hu SCID mice. No animal had clinical evidence of neurological impairment or pathological findings similar to those seen in HAM/TSP. Seven mice who received PBL from Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-seropositive patients developed an intraperitoneal lymphoma. In 2 mice an infiltration of brain by a lymphoblastic tumor of B/T cell type was observed. By PCR, all the tumors were EBV-positive; HTLV-I sequences were detected in 5 of them.

A transient shifting of progenitor cells from extravascular sites into the circulation by chemopriming and/or cytokine treatment enables the collection by apheresis of a sufficient number of progenitor cells to guarantee engraftment. The addition of new cytokines (e.g., thrombopoietin) and large volume apheresis will increase peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) procurement efficiency, whereas the risk of concurrently mobilizing clonogenic tumor cells in patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies remains to be carefully evaluated. As compared with bone marrow (BM) progenitor cells, the use of PBPCs significantly shortens the recovery of WBC and platelets following transplantation. Most recently, successful allogeneic transplantation of PBPCs has been reported without increasing the incidence and severity of acute graft-versus-host-disease. Due to the more than one log higher number of lymphoid subsets contained in a PBPC allograft, one might expect a more pronounced graft-versus-leukemia effect in the transplant patient. Similar to BM cells, ex vivo manipulation of mobilized apheresis products is used or being developed (ultralight density percoll gradient, CD8 depletion, selection of graft facilitating cells, CD34+ cell purification and others). The transduction and long-term expression of marker genes and, most recently, therapeutic genes (e.g., MDR-1) in PBPCs have been successfully demonstrated by several groups in patients with hematologic malignancies and selected solid tumors. It is expected that, based on the easier procurement of hematopoietic stem cells and advantageous engraftment characteristics, PBPCs in both autologous and allogeneic transplant situations will eventually replace BM-derived progenitor cells.","['Korbling, M', 'Champlin, R']","['Korbling M', 'Champlin R']","['University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Hematology, Houston.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,,IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.140185 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1996 Mar;14(2):185-95. doi: 10.1002/stem.140185.,,,,72,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vehicle in an i.v. dosage form of PSC 833, [3'-keto-Bmt1]-[Val2]-cyclosporin, contains CreEL and has been presumed to have the potentiation of the reversal activity of PSC 833. To examine this possibility, we compared reversal activities of CreEL and PSC 833 against multidrug resistance (MDR) in vitro and in vivo. Both CreEL and PSC 833 inhibited P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux of [3H]vincristine from adriamycin-resistant myelogenous leukemia K562. The sensitization of multidrug-resistant cell lines to anticancer drugs by CreEL and PSC 833 was selective to MDR-related agents, suggesting a specific interference of the P-glycoprotein function by the two MDR modulators. The concentration-dependent activity of the modulators demonstrated that CreEL is at least 100 times less potent than PSC 833. The in vivo reversal effects of CreEL alone and PSC 833 in the vehicle were investigated in multidrug-resistant tumor-bearing mouse models. In vincristine-resistant P388 leukemia-bearing mice, neither i.v. nor i.p. administration of CreEL even at 1440 mg/kg enhanced the antitumor activity of adriamycin. The in vivo negligible activity of CreEL was confirmed in an HCT-15-bearing athymic mouse model. In contrast, PSC 833 significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of adriamycin in the in vivo models. The reversal activity of CreEL restricted to in vitro leads us to conclude that the vehicle containing CreEL did not potentiate the activity of PSC 833 in the tumor-bearing mouse models.","['Watanabe, T', 'Nakayama, Y', 'Naito, M', 'Oh-hara, T', 'Itoh, Y', 'Tsuruo, T']","['Watanabe T', 'Nakayama Y', 'Naito M', 'Oh-hara T', 'Itoh Y', 'Tsuruo T']","['Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Surface-Active Agents)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6D4M1DAL6O (cremophor EL)', 'PDC6A3C0OX (Glycerol)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Glycerol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Surface-Active Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-199611000-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1996 Nov;7(8):825-32. doi: 10.1097/00001813-199611000-00002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This effect is seen after [32P]orthophosphate and [35S]methionine labeling. Material suggesting the involvement of p210bcr-abl in high molecular weight complexes also appears using anti-Shc, anti-Grb2 and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. AG957 also acts in vitro to shift native p210bcr-abl in anti-p210bcr-abl or anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitates to higher molecular weight forms under conditions where the drug can also act as an antagonist of p210bcr-abl autokinase activity. Incubation with dithiothreitol inhibits the appearance of > 210 kDa forms of p210bcr-abl in the in vitro reaction. These results leads to the hypothesis that AG957 does not act simply as a reversible tyrosine kinase antagonist, but can alter the normal amounts and physical associations of molecules important in tyrosine kinase signaling.

Therefore optimal treatment is still questioned; presently there are no proven cures for CLL, but the natural history of the disease and the advanced age of the majority of patients makes prolongation of survival a reasonable therapeutic goal in most cases. The traditional therapeutic approach has been based on the activity of alkylating agents and corticosteroid, while patients resistant have been treated with nucleoside analogs. However, patients ultimately relapse and the choice of salvage therapy by conventional methods does not offer many chances. Particularly in younger patients, with poor prognostic factors, the therapeutic options may substantially change in the near future, based on alternative and innovative approaches aimed at achieving cure or long disease-free-survival.

Central to the budding process is the myristoylated viral core protein precursor Gag which, even in the absence of all other viral components, is capable of associating with the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane and assembling into extracellular virus-like particles. In this paper we have used heterologous, Semliki Forest virus-driven, expression of M-MuLV Gag to study the mechanism by which this protein is targeted to the cell surface. In pulse-chase experiments, BFA, monensin, and 20 degrees C block did not affect incorporation of Gag into extracellular particles thereby indicating that the secretory pathway is not involved in targeting of Gag to the cell surface. Subcellular fractionation studies demonstrated that newly synthesized Gag became rapidly and efficiently associated with membranes which had a density similar to that of plasma membrane-derived vesicles. Protease-protection studies confirmed that the Gag-containing membranes were of plasma membrane origin, since in crude cell homogenates, the bulk of newly synthesized Gag was protease-resistant as expected of a protein that binds to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Taken together these data indicate that targeting of M-MuLV Gag to the cell surface proceeds via direct insertion of the protein to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. Furthermore, since the membrane insertion reaction is highly efficient and specific, this suggests that the reaction is dependent on as-yet-unidentified cellular factors.","['Suomalainen, M', 'Hultenby, K', 'Garoff, H']","['Suomalainen M', 'Hultenby K', 'Garoff H']","['Department of Bioscience at Novum, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects/physiology', 'Brefeldin A', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Cold Temperature', 'Cyclopentanes/pharmacology', 'Endopeptidases', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/physiology', 'Gene Products, gag/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genome, Viral', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*chemistry/growth & development/ultrastructure', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Protein Precursors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Semliki forest virus/chemistry/genetics', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', '*Virus Replication']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.135.6.1841 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1996 Dec;135(6 Pt 2):1841-52. doi: 10.1083/jcb.135.6.1841.,,,PMC2133957,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these cytokines, I have focused on interferon (IFN) and granulocyte (G) or granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colony stimulating factor (CSF), which are currently the most useful cytokines, in this review. IFN-alpha has been approved for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), multiple myeloma and hairy cell leukemia. In addition, IFN-alpha has therapeutic potentials for low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cutaneous T cell lymphoma and adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma. Thus, IFN-alpha is one of the most useful and wide-ranging antitumor agents in hematological malignancies. Most striking effects have been studied in chronic phase CML. Cytogenetic responses are seen in 30-40% of the treated patients and a complete cytogenetic response can be seen in about 10%. Long-term survival can be expected in these patients. Considering the risk of graft-versus-host disease-associated mortality in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the category of treatment is difficult to choose in IFN-responsive patients. Elucidation of the antitumor mechanism of IFN, as a prototype for other biological response modifiers, may revolutionize cancer treatment. G- and GM-CSF (CSFs) have reduced the duration of neutropenia, incidence of infectious episodes and days of hospitalization following cancer chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation. CSFs have also been used to mobilize peripheral blood stem cells and to increase dose intensity of chemotherapeutic agents. Leukemic cells from many patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) have surface receptors for CSFs and may proliferate in response to CSFs. However, several randomized studies showed that CSFs can be used safely and effectively in augmenting neutrophil recovery in patients with AML when given after induction chemotherapy. Various trials have been made to prime leukemic cells by CSFs to make them more susceptible to chemotherapy, but no convincing evidence has been obtained.","['Ezaki, K']",['Ezaki K'],"['Department of Internal Medicine, Fujita Health University, School of Medicine, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/therapeutic use', 'Cytokines/*therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Interferons/therapeutic use']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0925571096004926 [pii]', '10.1016/s0925-5710(96)00492-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1996 Dec;65(1):17-29. doi: 10.1016/s0925-5710(96)00492-6.,,,,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent data suggest that, among patients transplanted for leukemia, NK cells can prevent or delay disease relapse by mediating a cytotoxic graft vs leukemia (GvL) response. Although the major mechanism by which NK cells mediate target cell lysis involves degranulation and release of cytolytic effector molecules (granzymes, proteoglycans, perforin), accumulating evidence suggests that NK cells possess additional pathways to mediate target cell killing. In fact, it is well recognized that recombinant cytokines such as IL-2 enhance the in vitro cytolytic activity of NK cells. In this study, we observed that the lytic activity mediated by resting and IL-2 activated NK cells against the same target cell appears to occur via two distinct pathways, as distinguished by their differential response to R-verapamil. Specifically, we observed that 25 microM R-verapamil inhibited the lytic activity of resting NK cells against K562 targets by approximately 50%. However, the lytic activity of IL-2 activated NK cells was unaffected by this concentration of R-verapamil. Additional studies suggested that the inhibitory effect of R-verapamil on NK cytotoxic activity was associated with its ability to prevent degranulation of cytotoxic granules. Specifically, R-verapamil inhibited BLT esterase release from resting but not IL-2 activated NK cells. These data suggest that IL-2 activated NK cells can promote target cell lysis by a pathway (possibly degranulation independent) distinct from that used by resting NK cells. We speculate that the target of R-verapamil on resting NK cells is P-glycoprotein (Pgp), an ABC transporter that we recently reported was expressed on NK cells and whose functional activity is known to be inhibited by R-verapamil.","['Markham, P N', 'Ellis, T M', 'Tambur, A R', 'Gebel, H M']","['Markham PN', 'Ellis TM', 'Tambur AR', 'Gebel HM']","[""Department of Immunology/Microbiology, Rush Medical Laboratories, Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois 60612, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/pharmacology', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/immunology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology']",1996/12/27 00:00,1996/12/27 00:01,['1996/12/27 00:00'],"['1996/12/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/27 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-199612270-00035 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1996 Dec 27;62(12):1883-8. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199612270-00035.,,['CA 57470/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eighty-five adults with advanced leukemia received high-dose thiotepa, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide as a preparative regimen in a prospective Phase II study. All donors were HLA-matched and related. Marrow (BMT) was used for 44 patients and filgrastim-mobilized blood stem cells (SCT) for 41 patients. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine (CsA) or FK506 with methotrexate (MTX) or methylprednisolone (MP). The median time to neutrophil recovery was earlier after SCT than after BMT (day 10 vs. 17, P<0.001), but this was due to the selective use of MTX only in the BMT patients. The risk of grades 2-4 GVHD was lower with FK506 than with CsA (16% vs. 45%, P=0.02) and was the same for SCT recipients as for BMT recipients (33% vs. 34%). Regimen-related toxicity was significantly lower after SCT than after BMT but did not differ between the FK506 and CsA patients. In comparison with those receiving the standard transplant (BMT with CsA and MTX), only the SCT recipients using FK506 and MP had a significantly higher survival at day 180 posttransplant (84% vs. 53%, P=0.014). In multivariate analyses, use of FK506 was associated with a lower risk of treatment-related mortality and a higher survival at day 180, while the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia was associated with a higher risk of treatment-related mortality.

A CD40 monoclonal antibody (mAb), recombinant (r) IL4, and the combination of the CD40 mAb and rIL4 all increased G-CSF production by GC B cells. The augmentation of G-CSF release correlated with the increased survival of GC B cells. rG-CSF rescued GC B cells from apoptosis, suggesting that the cytokine may be utilized in autocrine and/or paracrine ways. Neoplastic B cells from follicular center cell lymphoma patients, which are the counterparts of normal GC B lymphocytes, also released G-CSF spontaneously in culture.

To study the biological effects of Flt3-L on the Flt3-L responsive AML5 cell line, the retroviral vector L(Flt3-L)SN was constructed based on the vector LXSN, but containing the human Flt3-L cDNA transcriptionally regulated by the Mo-MLV LTR. High-titer amphotropic producer cells that generated 10(6) cfu/mL after shuttle packaging through ecotropic packaging cells were isolated. AML5 cells were cultured overnight with L(Flt3-L)SN retroviral supernatant, 8 micrograms/mL polybrene, and 100 U/mL G-CSF, and expanded 1 week in medium with G-CSF. Transduced cells were selected in medium containing 0.4 mg/mL G418 and then in medium with 1.0 mg/mL G418. Retroviral mediated gene transfer in G418-resistant cells was confirmed after amplification by PCR of neo-specific sequences in genomic DNA. Northern blot analysis demonstrated L(Flt3-L)SN mRNA expression. Soluble Flt3-L was undetectable (< 100 pg/mL) by ELISA assay of conditioned medium from transduced cells, but Flt3-L was detected on the surface of AML5 cells by FACS analysis. Cells were plated in colony assay with and without 100 ng/mL Flt3-L, 100 U/mL G-CSF, and the combination. Gene transfer or growth factor treatment increased somewhat the clonogenicity of the nontransduced AML5 cells. More strikingly, L(Flt3-L)SN and each growth factor combination greatly increased the size of the resultant colonies such that the size of colonies from AML5/Flt3-L cells without added growth factor approximated that of the AML5 cells stimulated by exogenous soluble Flt3-L. Moreover, MAP kinase activity in L(Flt3-L)SN-transduced cells cultured without soluble Flt3-L was increased to the level induced in control cells by soluble Flt3-L. These results indicate that retroviral mediated gene transfer and autologous expression of the Flt3-L enhances growth and intracellular signaling of AML5 cells, information that should be of value for studying the effects of Flt3-L on immature subsets of primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.","['Braun, S E', 'Aronica, S M', 'Ge, Y', 'Takahira, H', 'Etienne-Julan, M', 'Lu, L', 'Minden, M D', 'Lyman, S D', 'Broxmeyer, H E']","['Braun SE', 'Aronica SM', 'Ge Y', 'Takahira H', 'Etienne-Julan M', 'Lu L', 'Minden MD', 'Lyman SD', 'Broxmeyer HE']","['Walther Oncology Center, Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5121, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', '*Retroviridae', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1997 Jan;25(1):51-6.,,"['P01 HL 53586/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL 54037/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL 56416/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increase in O2(-)-producing capacity in MPD was also observed when other receptor-mediated agonists such as interleukin-8 and concanavalin A were used, but not when phorbol ester, a direct activator of protein kinase C, was used as the triggering agonist of O2- release. Priming effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) on chemotactic peptide-induced O2- release was observed in all patients with MPD and CMML, though fold enhancement of priming effects was much less in MPD compared with normal subjects. In addition, the priming effects of TNF were less than those of GM-CSF in 10 cases, whereas the priming effects of TNF were consistently and markedly greater than those of GM-CSF in normal subjects. Tyrosine phosphorylation of 42-kDa protein stimulated by G-CSF, GM-CSF, and TNF was observed in CML neutrophils to be identical to that in normal neutrophils.

While the transport phase of these children's care was not extraordinary, the development and management of the clinical issues might have been influenced by earlier interventions. Would the outcome of Case 1 have been different if the abnormal hematologic parameters demonstrated on the preoperative laboratory results had been further investigated? Would the institution of cerebral resuscitative measures before and during transport have offered this child a better chance of survival? Would the involvement of a specialized pediatric team earlier in the process have addressed some of those issues and would it have made a difference? Should the patient in case two have had cerebral resuscitative measures instituted at the referring hospital or during transport? In hindsight, this clearly would not have been useful or beneficial to the patient. But what if the initial CT interpretation of a brain tumor and increased intracranial pressure with ventricular ablation and midline shift had been correct? Should the transport team have suggested or instituted a different level of therapy with the information that was available at the time of transport? The patient in Case 3 had a dramatic presentation of his ALL. Were there signs and symptoms that should have alerted the referring hospital, transport command physician or transport team to the likely deterioration of that patient? If this patient had presented to a hospital a further distance away, would the impending cardiovascular collapse and respiratory failure have been anticipated or occurred during the transport? Would or should the mode of transport or team configuration have been altered? If this patient had deteriorated during the transport, would the transport team have had the skills to manage this potentially difficult airway? Should the patient in Case 4 have had antihypertensive medication started at the referring hospital or during the transport process? What are the guidelines for antihypertensive intervention in this situation? If antihypertensive therapy were instituted by the transport team, should this have affected time or mode of transport, or was it more prudent not to rock the boat by instituting interventional therapy? Is hypertension a different issue with a liver mass, as suspected at the time of referral, or with a nephrogenic tumor?

Anthropometric data, fat-free mass by impedance, energy intake, and resting energy expenditure (REE) were determined at diagnosis and on days 22, 36, and 71 of the treatment. Interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor were also measured. Fifteen healthy control subjects were matched for age and sex. Body weight and height and body composition were comparable at all times of the study, although three children were underweight at diagnosis (weight-for-height < 85% of French standards). Although two different methods were used for dietary recall in the two groups, energy intake expressed as a percentage of normal recommended values for age and sex was lower in patients than in control subjects (104 +/- 19%) on day 1 (47 +/- 32.1%) and day 22 (58 +/- 24%), but was comparable on day 36 (85 +/- 71%) and day 71 (85 +/- 48%). This low energy intake involved both carbohydrates and fats. Energy and carbohydrate intakes improved significantly during the study in patients. The nonprotein respiratory quotient (RQ) in patients was significantly lower than in control subjects (0.84 +/- 0.04) on day 1 (0.79 +/- 0.02) but was comparable on day 71. The REE of the patients on day 1 (5057.8 +/- 1588.4 kJ/24 h) and day 71 (4844.7 +/- 116.1 kJ/24 h) and of the control subjects (4313.8 +/- 823.5 kJ/24 h) was not significantly different. Cytokines remained undetectable on days 1, 36, and 71. The results showed that at the time of diagnosis and during this period of chemotherapy there was no evidence of raised REE. The poor intakes during the first month of chemotherapy were recent as shown by the parents' questionnaire responses and the absence of consequences in body composition. The transient decrease in RQ seemed to be an adaptative mechanism to the poor carbohydrate intake. No indication of undernutrition in the patients as a group was evident during the first 71 d of treatment although further long-term nutritional assessment is needed.","['Delbecque-Boussard, L', 'Gottrand, F', 'Ategbo, S', 'Nelken, B', 'Mazingue, F', 'Vic, P', 'Farriaux, J P', 'Turck, D']","['Delbecque-Boussard L', 'Gottrand F', 'Ategbo S', 'Nelken B', 'Mazingue F', 'Vic P', 'Farriaux JP', 'Turck D']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Clin Nutr,The American journal of clinical nutrition,0376027,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Anthropometry', 'Body Height/physiology', 'Body Weight/physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Energy Metabolism/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/blood', 'Interleukin-1/blood', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', '*Nutritional Status', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcn/65.1.95 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Nutr. 1997 Jan;65(1):95-100. doi: 10.1093/ajcn/65.1.95.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cows affected by enzootic bovine leukemia (EBL) showed a reduction of IgM-producing cells in the spleen and lymph nodes. Experimentally infected calves had lower levels of secretory IgM and a decrease in T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. The reduction in the amount of T cells was noticed mainly in cells bearing the CD4 markers. BLV-infected animals showed diminished responsiveness to newly encountered antigens. Cows naturally infected by BLV produced Igs with impaired structural or biological reactivity. The primary immune response was shown to be deficient in BLV-infected cows following vaccination with synthetic antigen. A marked shift in the proportion of PBL, especially of the CD5+ subset, was noticed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from BLV-infected cows secrete elevated levels of certain cytokines and contain increased levels of cytokine mRNA. High levels of cytokines are also found in the sera of BLV-infected cows compared to non-infected animals. A correlation was found between BLV infection and lack of spontaneous recovery from Trichophyton verrucosum infection. Moreover, some studies ascertained a significant association between the herd BLV infection status and disease incidence. The culling rate was higher and milk production lower in BLV-infected vs. BLV-free herds. It seems that BLV infection affects the immune system of a cow to such an extent that it ceases to be productive enough to be kept and, in most cases, the animal is culled before any symptoms of illness associated with persistent immunodeficiency become apparent.","['Trainin, Z', 'Brenner, J', 'Meirom, R', 'Ungar-Waron, H']","['Trainin Z', 'Brenner J', 'Meirom R', 'Ungar-Waron H']","['Department of Immunology, Kimron Veterinary Institute, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/immunology', 'Immune System/*pathology/*virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-2427(96)05706-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-2427(96)05706-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1996 Nov;54(1-4):293-302. doi: 10.1016/s0165-2427(96)05706-6.,,,,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A cancer control study of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB 9072).,152-60,"BACKGROUND: A diagnosis of cancer provides a teachable moment in which a physician can counsel or teach the patient. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B hypothesized that this teachable moment could also be used to encourage counseling of the patients' relatives who smoke. The authors' first study sought to determine the feasibility of such an intervention, the cooperation of the patients, and the compliance of relatives who were smokers. The long-range goal is to recruit by mail a large population of adult smokers into an intervention program and to assist them in quitting cigarette smoking. METHODS: Oncologists and their clinical research associates asked recently diagnosed cancer patients to identify their relatives who were smokers and assist in persuading them to quit. Consenting patients spoke to relatives and mailed them a personalized motivational leaflet along with a list of the benefits of quitting smoking. Intervention was continued only with relatives who were contacted in this manner. The participating physicians then wrote to the smokers, advising them to quit; enclosed with each physician's letter were the National Cancer Institute booklet ""Clearing the Air,"" which is about quitting smoking, and a questionnaire determining ""stage of change"" (the stage of the smoker's inaction or action regarding quitting smoking). After 6 months, a postintervention questionnaire was mailed to the relatives. RESULTS: Written consent was obtained from 89% of 144 eligible patients solicited. Eighty percent of patients involved in the study contacted relatives. Sixty-three percent of contacted relatives returned the first questionnaire and 40% answered the second. Nine percent of all contacted relatives reported having quit smoking after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention proved to be feasible and will lead to the next study, which will randomize relatives who smoke within a more intensive intervention over 12 months and compare the results with nonintervention controls.","['Schilling, A', 'Conaway, M R', 'Wingate, P J', 'Atkins, J N', 'Berkowitz, I M', 'Clamon, G H', 'DiFino, S M', 'Vinciguerra, V']","['Schilling A', 'Conaway MR', 'Wingate PJ', 'Atkins JN', 'Berkowitz IM', 'Clamon GH', 'DiFino SM', 'Vinciguerra V']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence 02903, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Family Health', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Motivation', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', '*Patient Participation', 'Pilot Projects', 'Program Development', 'Smoking/psychology', 'Smoking Cessation/*psychology', '*Smoking Prevention']",1997/01/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19970101)79:1<152::AID-CNCR22>3.0.CO;2-2 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19970101)79:1<152::aid-cncr22>3.0.co;2-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1997 Jan 1;79(1):152-60. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19970101)79:1<152::aid-cncr22>3.0.co;2-2.,,"['CA-31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-45418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-45808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results of a clinical phase II study.,59-68,"BACKGROUND: The current study was initiated to assess the efficacy and side effects of a timed sequential application of high dose cytosine arabinoside (AraC) in combination with mitoxantrone (S-HAM) in patients with refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Patients with refractory AML or ALL were eligible for S-HAM salvage therapy, which was comprised of AraC, 1 g/m2 or 3 g/m2 every 12 hours, on Days 1, 2, 8, and 9 and mitoxantrone, 10 mg/m2/day, given on Days 3, 4, 10, and 11. RESULTS: Of 22 fully evaluable patients, 14 patients (64%) achieved a complete remission whereas 5 patients (23%) succumbed to early death and 3 patients (14%) did not respond. Blood counts recovered at a median of 33.5 days after the start of treatment and complete remission was achieved after a median of 38 days. The median duration of complete remission was 4 months (range, 1-14 months) whereas overall survival time lasted for a median of 4.5 months (range, 1-30+ months). Treatment-associated toxicity was comprised predominantly of infection and diarrhea that reached World Health Organization Grades 3 and 4 in 64% and 32% of patients, respectively. Complementary pharmacokinetic evaluations of plasma AraC and AraU levels revealed no impact of initial AraC administration on the pharmacokinetics of subsequent AraC administrations and failed to demonstrate any evidence of self-potentiation. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical data show the S-HAM regimen to be a promising approach for the treatment of patients with advanced acute leukemias. However, further evaluation at earlier stages of treatment is needed.","['Kern, W', 'Schleyer, E', 'Unterhalt, M', 'Wormann, B', 'Buchner, T', 'Hiddemann, W']","['Kern W', 'Schleyer E', 'Unterhalt M', 'Wormann B', 'Buchner T', 'Hiddemann W']","['Georg-August-University, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction']",1997/01/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19970101)79:1<59::AID-CNCR9>3.0.CO;2-H [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1997 Jan 1;79(1):59-68.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently reported HLA-G transcription in peripheral blood leukocytes. In this work, we have investigated HLA-G transcription in hematopoietic stem cells, in different hematopoietic lineages and in malignant cells by using a RT-PCR technique. PCR amplification with primers specific to the exon 2 and the 3' untranslated region has enabled to detect HLA-G transcription in B and T cell populations. No transcription was found in CD34+ cells, in thymocytes, in polynuclear cells, in monocytes and in natural killer cells. Among the malignancies analyzed, HLA-G is transcribed in 2 of 13 cases of acute leukemia characterized by a monocytic contingent, in 3 of 6 CLL and in all the cases of B-NHL (n = 6). No HLA-G transcription was detected in myeloma (n = 2). The splicing type does not seem to be linked to a lymphocyte subpopulation nor to a malignant proliferation stage. These results suggest that HLA-G is a marker of mature lymphoid cells and may play an immunological function as a peptide presenting molecule. HLA-G transcription in some cases of malignancy might indicate a contribution to the tumoral progression by blocking natural killing reaction.","['Amiot, L', 'Onno, M', 'Renard, I', 'Drenou, B', 'Guillaudeux, T', 'Le Bouteiller, P', 'Fauchet, R']","['Amiot L', 'Onno M', 'Renard I', 'Drenou B', 'Guillaudeux T', 'Le Bouteiller P', 'Fauchet R']","[""Laboratoire d' Hematologie et de la biologie des cellules sanguines, Universite de Rennes I, France.""]",['eng'],"['Corrected and Republished Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-G Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)']",IM,"['HLA Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-G Antigens', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1399-0039.1996.tb02682.x [doi]'],ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 1996 Nov;48(5):609-14. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0039.1996.tb02682.x.,,,,,,,,,['Tissue Antigens. 1996 May;47(5):408-13.

All three compounds elevated the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), and caused degranulation in the presence of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a protein kinase C activator. The dose-dependency of each compound in the Ca2+ response was in good agreement with that in degranulation. TG and CPA also caused the release of LTC4 in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect was unaffected by TPA or calphostin C, a selective PKC inhibitor. DTBHQ, however, did not induce LTC4 release, and rather inhibited the antigen-induced release of LTC4. These results suggest [1] that both degranulation and LTC4 release caused by these compounds are dependent on their [Ca2+]i increasing effect, [2] that degranulation and LTC4 release are mediated via independent pathways following the Ca2+ response, and [3] that DTBHQ additionally prevents the synthesis of LTC4 possibly by inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase.","['Akasaka, R', 'Teshima, R', 'Ikebuchi, H', 'Sawada, J']","['Akasaka R', 'Teshima R', 'Ikebuchi H', 'Sawada J']","['Division of Biochemistry and Immunochemistry, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

The known members of the ICE/Ced-3 cysteine protease family are synthesized as proenzymes and require proteolytic processing to produce active, heterodimeric enzymes. The baculovirus protein P35 has recently been shown to inhibit several members of the ICE/Ced-3 cysteine protease family. The importance of ICE/Ced-3 cysteine proteases in programmed cell death prompted us to investigate the role of the apoptotic mediator, CPP32, in the glucocorticoid-mediated cell death pathway. Glucocorticoids induce growth inhibition and apoptosis in sensitive leukemic cell lines, immature thymocytes, and eosinophils. In this report, we demonstrate the enzymatic cleavage of proCPP32 to its active subunits in cells undergoing glucocorticoid-induced apoptotic cell death. Concurrently, in apoptotic cells, PARP, a 116-kilodalton (kDa) human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, is proteolytically cleaved to its signature 85-kDa fragment. The proteolytic processing of PARP (the nuclear DNA repair enzyme known to be cleaved in association with apoptosis) is catalyzed by members of the ICE/Ced-3 family. Importantly, stable transfection of the antiapoptotic baculovirus P35 inhibits glucocorticoid-induced apoptotic cell death, proteolytic processing of proCPP32, and cleavage of the 116kDa PARP. We conclude that activation of CPP32 is a critical event in glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and that this pathway is inhibited at or upstream of CPP32 by baculovirus P35. These data demonstrate that PARP cleavage occurs during glucocorticoid-induced apoptotic cell death and show that this proteolytic process is blocked by the expression of baculovirus P35, supporting a role for activation of the ICE/Ced-3-like cysteine protease during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis.","['Robertson, N M', 'Zangrilli, J', 'Fernandes-Alnemri, T', 'Friesen, P D', 'Litwack, G', 'Alnemri, E S']","['Robertson NM', 'Zangrilli J', 'Fernandes-Alnemri T', 'Friesen PD', 'Litwack G', 'Alnemri ES']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Helminth Proteins)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (inhibitor of apoptosis, Nucleopolyhedrovirus)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (ced-3 protein, C elegans)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Cell Division', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/physiology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Helminth Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Proteins/*physiology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1997 Jan 1;57(1):43-7.,,"['AI35035-03/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'DK44441-03/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to obtain evidence to support this proposition and to assess the functional importance of Arg 110, we carried out site directed mutagenesis of Arg 110 and replaced it with Lys, Ala, and Glu. The mutant enzymes were characterized with respect to their kinetic parameters, ability to bind template-primers, and the mode of DNA synthesis. All the three substitutions at 110 position resulted in severe loss of polymerase activity without any significant effect on the RNase H function. In spite of an approximately 1000-fold reduction in kcat of polymerase activity with three mutant enzymes, no significant reduction in the affinities for either template-primer or dNTP substrates was apparent. Mutant enzymes also did not exhibit significant sulfur elemental effect, implying that the chemical step, i.e., phosphodiester bond formation, was not defective. Examination of the mode of DNA synthesis by the mutant enzymes indicated a shift from processive to the distributive mode of synthesis. The mutants of R110 also displayed significant loss of pyrophosphorolysis activity. Furthermore, the time course of primer extension with mutant enzymes indicated severe reduction in the rates of addition of the first nucleotide and even further reduction in the addition of the second nucleotide. These results suggest that the rate limiting step for the mutant enzymes may be before and after the phosphodiester bond formation. Based on these results, we propose that Arg 110 of MuLV RT participates in the conformational change steps prior to and after the chemical step of polymerase reaction.","['Chowdhury, K', 'Kaushik, N', 'Pandey, V N', 'Modak, M J']","['Chowdhury K', 'Kaushik N', 'Pandey VN', 'Modak MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Medicine & Dentistry-New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arginine/chemistry', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Catalysis', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism']",1996/12/24 00:00,1996/12/24 00:01,['1996/12/24 00:00'],"['1996/12/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/24 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/bi961462l [doi]', 'bi961462l [pii]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1996 Dec 24;35(51):16610-20. doi: 10.1021/bi961462l.,,"['CA72821-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-36307/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, two models have been proposed for RNA dimer formation on the basis of results obtained in vitro with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA and Moloney murine leukemia virus RNA. It was first proposed that viral RNA dimerizes by forming an interstrand quadruple helix with purine tetrads. The second model postulates that RNA dimerization is initiated by a loop-loop interaction between the two RNA molecules. In order to better characterize the dimerization process of retroviral genomic RNA, we analyzed the in vitro dimerization of avian sarcoma-leukosis virus (ASLV) RNA using different transcripts. We determined the requirements for heterodimer formation, the thermal dissociation of RNA dimers, and the influence of antisense DNA oligonucleotides on dimer formation. Our results strongly suggest that purine tetrads are not involved in dimer formation. Data show that an autocomplementary sequence located upstream from the splice donor site and within a major packaging signal plays a crucial role in ASLV RNA dimer formation in vitro. This sequence is able to form a stem-loop structure, and phylogenetic analysis reveals that it is conserved in 28 different avian sarcoma and leukosis viruses. These results suggest that dimerization of ASLV RNA is initiated by a loop-loop interaction between two RNA molecules and provide an additional argument for the ubiquity of the dimerization process via loop-loop interaction.","['Fosse, P', 'Motte, N', 'Roumier, A', 'Gabus, C', 'Muriaux, D', 'Darlix, J L', 'Paoletti, J']","['Fosse P', 'Motte N', 'Roumier A', 'Gabus C', 'Muriaux D', 'Darlix JL', 'Paoletti J']","['Unite de Biochimie-Enzymologie, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique Unite de Recherche Associee 147, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Alpharetrovirus/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Dimerization', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/chemistry/genetics', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Viral/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Thermodynamics']",1996/12/24 00:00,1996/12/24 00:01,['1996/12/24 00:00'],"['1996/12/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/24 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/bi9613786 [doi]', 'bi9613786 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1996 Dec 24;35(51):16601-9. doi: 10.1021/bi9613786.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the factors responsible for early embryogenesis and implantation are incompletely understood, leukemia inhibitory factor may have an important role in early embryonic development and implantation. We set out to evaluate the production and modulation of leukemia inhibitory factor in the fallopian tube. STUDY DESIGN: We first investigated leukemia inhibitory factor messenger ribonucleic acid levels in fallopian tubes. We then investigated leukemia inhibitory factor messenger ribonucleic acid and protein production in tubal epithelial and stromal cell cultures. RESULTS: Leukemia inhibitory factor messenger ribonucleic acid is expressed in the fallopian tube with only slight variation during the menstrual cycle; however, it is markedly elevated in association with ectopic pregnancy. The level is higher in the tubal mucosa than in the remaining layers and is higher in the more distal segments of the fallopian tube. Estradiol and progesterone did not modulate leukemia inhibitory factor expression in epithelial or stromal cell cultures. Interleukin-1 alpha, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and transforming growth factor-beta enhanced leukemia inhibitory factor expression in epithelial and stromal cells, with transforming growth factor-beta 1 enhancing expression by fourfold in stromal cells. Epithelial cells secreted high levels of leukemia inhibitory factor compared with stromal cells (332 +/- 89 vs 25 +/- 42 pg/mg total protein). Yet stromal cells treated with transforming growth factor-beta alone or in combination with epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, as well as TNF-alpha alone or in combination with interleukin-1 alpha enhanced secretion of leukemia inhibitory factor at or above the levels found with epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that the high constitutive levels of leukemia inhibitory factor expressed in the ampullary portion of the fallopian tube may play a role in early embryonic development. Additionally, elevated expression with ectopic implantation and the marked induction of secretion in the tubal stroma by growth factors and cytokines suggest a link between inflammation, leukemia inhibitory factor, and tubal ectopic pregnancies.","['Keltz, M D', 'Attar, E', 'Buradagunta, S', 'Olive, D L', 'Kliman, H J', 'Arici, A']","['Keltz MD', 'Attar E', 'Buradagunta S', 'Olive DL', 'Kliman HJ', 'Arici A']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520-8063, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Obstet Gynecol,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,0370476,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Hormones)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Physiological Phenomena', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Epithelium/metabolism', 'Fallopian Tubes/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Hormones/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy, Ectopic/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9378(96)70114-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9378(96)70114-x [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1996 Dec;175(6):1611-9. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9378(96)70114-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incorporation level of the labeled methylamine into proteins of HL-60 and HepG2 cells did not increase after the transglutaminase had been induced.

For a representative set of organism classes (plants, mammalian cells, arthropods and aquatic invertebrates), the minimum appropriate storage conditions have been identified by screening storage temperatures at -196 degrees, -80 degrees, -20 degrees, +4 degrees, +20 degrees/25 degrees C for periods from 2 days to 4 weeks. For storage below 0 degree C, as a typical cryopreservative, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was used. For some samples, the addition of trehalose (as cryopreservative) and the use of a nitrogen atmosphere were investigated. After storage, the material was tested for vitality. The findings demonstrated that acceptable preservation can be achieved under higher storage temperatures than are typically applied. Small, dense cultured plant cells survive for 21 d when moderately cooled (+4 degrees to -20 degrees C); addition of trehalose enhances viability at -20 degrees C. For mammalian cells, the results show that human lymphocytes can be preserved for 3 d at 25 degrees C, 7 d at 4 degrees C and 28 d at -80 degrees C. Friend leukaemia virus transformed cells can be stored for 3 d at 25 degrees C, 14 d at 4 degrees C and 28 d at -80 degrees C.

The profile of cytokines produced by Th cells correlates with the type of effector cells induced during the immune response to foreign antigen. Th1 cells induce the cell-mediated immune response, while Th2 cells drive antibody production. Th cells are the preferential targets of human retroviruses. Infections with human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) result in the expansion of Th cells by the action of HTLV (adult T-cell leukemia) or the progressive loss of T cells by the action of HIV (AIDS). Both retrovirus infections impart a high-level activation state in the host immune cells as well as systemically. However, diverging responses to this activation state have contrasting effects on the Th-cell population. In HIV infection, Th-cell loss has been attributed to several mechanisms, including a selective elimination of cells by apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis in HIV infection is complex, with many different pathways able to induce cell death. In contrast, infection of Th cells with HTLV-1 affords the cell a protective advantage against apoptosis. This advantage may allow the cell to escape immune surveillance, providing the opportunity for the development of Th-cell cancer. In this review, we will discuss the impact of Th-cell activation and general immune activation on human retrovirus expression with a focus upon Th-cell function and the progression to disease.","['Copeland, K F', 'Heeney, J L']","['Copeland KF', 'Heeney JL']","['Department of Pathology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. copelndk@fhs.mcmaster.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Microbiol Rev,Microbiological reviews,7806086,['0 (Viral Proteins)'],IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology', 'Apoptosis', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*immunology', 'Disease Progression', 'HIV Infections/*immunology', 'HIV-1/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Th1 Cells/*immunology/*virology', 'Th2 Cells/*immunology/*virology', 'Viral Proteins/physiology']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mr.60.4.722-742.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,Microbiol Rev. 1996 Dec;60(4):722-42. doi: 10.1128/mr.60.4.722-742.1996.,,,PMC239461,370,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clonogenic enhancement of murine HPCs is not accompanied by alterations in GM-CSF receptor expression or ligand affinity and appears to be mediated via a p53-independent mechanism.

In studies on hairy cell leukaemia, a severe deficiency was found in the production of interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte CSF, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). Further studies on IL-6 at the mRNA and protein levels revealed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells and even hairy cells could be stimulated by interferon alpha (IFN alpha) to produce IL-6. It is interesting to speculate on the beneficial effects of IFN alpha therapy on the expansion of normal haematopoiesis and suppression or even elimination of malignant cells. Studies on a patient with angio-immunoblastic lymphadenopathy, another disease showing haematopoietic insufficiency, who developed severe aplastic anaemia, showed massive increases in IFN gamma and TNF alpha levels in serum; IL-6 and GM-CSF levels were below the limit of detection. These results correlated with an abnormal distribution of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in the patient's blood and were compatible with the suppressive effects of IFN gamma and TNF alpha on haematopoiesis.","['Schwarzmeier, J D']",['Schwarzmeier JD'],"['L.

Fanconi's anaemia is the most common congenital disorder and leukaemia occurs in at least 10% of cases. In acquired aplastic anaemia, a high incidence of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was noted in patients with aplastic anaemia, seemingly cured of their aplasia by antilymphocyte globulins (ALG). In a recent survey, the 10-year cumulative incidence rates were 9.6% for MDS, 6.6% for acute leukaemia (115-fold higher than in the general population). Biological evidence is provided by bone marrow morphology, as a certain degree of dysmyelopoiesis is not unusual in aplastic anaemia. Cytogenetic analyses in aplastic anaemia are scarce, but data have shown clonal cytogenetic abnormalities at diagnosis in otherwise typical aplastic anaemia. Recently, flow cytometry to assess the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) molecule defect in PNH has demonstrated that a significant proportion of patients with otherwise typical aplastic anaemia have, in fact, a GPI defect due to alterations within the PIG-A gene. Finally, aplastic anaemia patients were recently reported to have molecular evidence of clonal haematopoiesis; this must now be discussed in light of recent clonality studies in normal individuals. The clinical and biological evidence for a link between aplastic anaemia, PNH and hypoplastic leukaemia allows the generation of a model of aplastic anaemia as a possible pre-pre-leukaemic disorder.","['Socie, G']",['Socie G'],"['Service de Greffe de Moelle, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Eur J Haematol Suppl,European journal of haematology.

The diagnoses were as follows: 18 patients had Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 9 Hodgkin's disease, 24 multiple myeloma, 6 acute leukemia, 27 breast cancer, and 4 patients had solid tumors of different types. During the course of LV-LPs, 20 liters (1) of blood were processed at a median flow-rate of 85 ml/min (CS 3000 Baxter) and 130 ml/min (COBE Spectra), respectively. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were collected following granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-supported cytotoxic chemotherapy. A 31% and 21% mean decrease in the platelet and white blood count was noted at the end of the LV-LPs when compared with the pre-leukapheresis values. The aphereses were well tolerated without adverse effects. The level of circulating CD34+ cells was closely related to the number of CD34+ cells contained in the respective leukapheresis product (R = 0.89, P < 0.001). Compared with 270 patients who underwent 838 regular 10 1 LPs, the yield of CD34+ cells/kg was almost two-fold greater (4.84 +/- 0.63 x 10(6) [Mean +/- SEM] vs. 2.60 +/- 0.16 x 10(6), P < 0.001). The antigenic profile of CD34+ cells was assessed in 54 separate products collected on the occasion of 27 LV-LPs following the processing of 10 1 and 20 1, respectively. The intra-individual comparison included differentiation- as well as lineage-associated markers (CD38, Thy-1, c-kit, CD33, CD45RA). No difference in the subset composition was observed between the first and second product, arguing against a preferential release of particular CD34+ cell subsets during the procedure. As shown by molecular biological or immunocytochemical examination, the likelihood of harvesting malignant cells using large-volume aphereses was not increased in comparison with regular leukaphereses. Single harvests of > or = 2.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg could be obtained in 74% of the patients, compared with 52% in case of regular LPs. As the majority of patients were autografted with more than 2.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg following high-dose therapy, hematological recovery in general was rapid and not related to the type of apheresis product used. Considering patient comfort and savings in resource utilization, large-volume leukaphereses have become the standard procedure for PBSC collection in our center.","['Murea, S', 'Goldschmidt, H', 'Hahn, U', 'Pforsich, M', 'Moos, M', 'Haas, R']","['Murea S', 'Goldschmidt H', 'Hahn U', 'Pforsich M', 'Moos M', 'Haas R']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Apher,Journal of clinical apheresis,8216305,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*therapy']",1996/01/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1098-1101(1996)11:4<185::AID-JCA3>3.0.CO;2-7 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1098-1101(1996)11:4<185::AID-JCA3>3.0.CO;2-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Apher. 1996;11(4):185-94. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1098-1101(1996)11:4<185::AID-JCA3>3.0.CO;2-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such motifs form part of numerous NF-AT-binding sites of lymphokine promoters, including the interleukin 4 (IL-4) promoter. NF-AT factors share short homologous peptide sequences in their DNA-binding domain with NF-kappa B factors and bind to certain NF-kappa B sites. It has been shown that HMG I(Y) proteins enhance NF-kappa B binding to the interferon beta promoter and virus-mediated interferon beta promoter induction. We show that HMG I(Y) proteins exert an opposite effect on the DNA binding of NF-AT factors and the induction of the IL-4 promoter in T lymphocytes. Introduction of mutations into a high-affinity HMG I(Y)-binding site of the IL-4 promoter, which decreased HMG I(Y)-binding to a NF-AT-binding sequence, the Pu-bB (or P) site, distinctly increased the induction of the IL-4 promoter in Jurkat T leukemia cells. High concentrations of HMG I(Y) proteins are able to displace NF-ATp from its binding to the Pu-bB site. High HMG I(Y) concentrations are typical for Jurkat cells and peripheral blood T lymphocytes, whereas E14 T lymphoma cells and certain T helper type 2 cell clones contain relatively low HMG I(Y) concentrations. Our results indicate that HMG I(Y) proteins do not cooperate, but instead compete with NF-AT factors for the binding to DNA even though NF-AT factors share some DNA-binding to DNA even though NF-AT factors share some DNA-binding properties with NF-kB factors. This competition between HMG I(Y) and NF-AT proteins for DNA binding might be due to common contacts with minor groove nucleotides of DNA and may be one mechanism contributing to the selective IL-4 expression in certain T lymphocyte populations, such as T helper type 2 cells.","['Klein-Hessling, S', 'Schneider, G', 'Heinfling, A', 'Chuvpilo, S', 'Serfling, E']","['Klein-Hessling S', 'Schneider G', 'Heinfling A', 'Chuvpilo S', 'Serfling E']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, University of Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (High Mobility Group Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '124544-67-8 (HMGA1a Protein)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/biosynthesis', 'HMGA1a Protein', 'HeLa Cells', 'High Mobility Group Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",1996/12/24 00:00,1996/12/24 00:01,['1996/12/24 00:00'],"['1996/12/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/24 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.26.15311 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Dec 24;93(26):15311-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.26.15311.,,,PMC26401,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examine the intranuclear distribution of SV40 large T-antigen (SV40T), the p53 tumor suppressor protein (p53), and PML in a conditionally immortalized cell line, IDH4. In IDH4 cells, the expression of SV40T is regulated by a dexamethasone (Dex)-driven promoter. Withdrawal of Dex results in down-regulation of SV40T and growth arrest, whereas addition of Dex to the growth-arrested cells results in up-regulation of SV40T and proliferation. In proliferating IDH4 cells, SV40T is concentrated in nuclear dots that are also positive for p53. Many of these dots are juxtaposed to PML positive structures but do not colocalize with them. After removal of Dex, SV40T-p53 dots gradually disappear, while the PML structures remain. Induction of SV40T in nonproliferating IDH4 cells causes a coordinated redistribution of SV40T and p53. The immunostaining for SV40T and p53 is first weak, then strong with a homogeneous distribution, and 3-4 days later becomes dot-like again. This reappearance of SV40T-p53 dots coincides with the recovery of proliferation in restimulated IDH4 cells. Also, the p53 pattern correlates with the SV40T pattern with regard to both morphology and intensity during both suppression and induction of SV40T. Taken together, our data suggest that (i) the level of p53 is coregulated with the level of SV40T in a dose-dependent fashion; (ii) the formation of SV40T-p53 nuclear dots correlates with the transformed phenotype; (iii) the SV40T-p53 dots localize preferentially to the neighborhood of PML bodies which are already present in normal cells.","['Jiang, W Q', 'Szekely, L', 'Klein, G', 'Ringertz, N']","['Jiang WQ', 'Szekely L', 'Klein G', 'Ringertz N']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, 171 77, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming/*metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism/virology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Humans', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Phenotype', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Simian virus 40/immunology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1996/12/15 00:00,1996/12/15 00:01,['1996/12/15 00:00'],"['1996/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(96)90374-2 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1996.0374 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1996 Dec 15;229(2):289-300. doi: 10.1006/excr.1996.0374.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PML protein is localized in the nucleus on a specific domain of unknown function (PML nuclear bodies, NB) previously detected with autoimmune sera from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). These bodies are nuclear matrix-associated and all of their identified components (PML, Sp100, and NDP52) are sharply upregulated by interferons. We show that autoantibodies against both PML and Sp100 are usually associated in sera with multiple nuclear dot anti-nuclear antibodies and demonstrate that PML is an autoantigen, not only in PBC, but also in other autoimmune diseases. In APL, the PML/RARalpha fusion interferes with both the retinoic acid (RA) response and PML localization on nuclear bodies, but the respective contribution of each defect to leukemogenesis is unclear. RA induces the terminal differentiation of APL blasts, yielding to complete remissions, and corrects the localization of NB antigens. Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) also induces remissions in APL, seemingly through induction of apoptosis. We show that in APL, As2O3 leads to the rapid reformation of PML bodies. Thus, both agents correct the defect in NB antigen localization, stressing the role of nuclear bodies in the pathogenesis of APL.","['Andre, C', 'Guillemin, M C', 'Zhu, J', 'Koken, M H', 'Quignon, F', 'Herve, L', 'Chelbi-Alix, M K', 'Dhumeaux, D', 'Wang, Z Y', 'Degos, L', 'Chen, Z', 'de The, H']","['Andre C', 'Guillemin MC', 'Zhu J', 'Koken MH', 'Quignon F', 'Herve L', 'Chelbi-Alix MK', 'Dhumeaux D', 'Wang ZY', 'Degos L', 'Chen Z', 'de The H']","[""Service d'Immunologie Biologique and Service d'hepatologie et Gastro-enterologie, CHU Henri Mondor, Creteil Cedex, 94010, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antibodies, Antinuclear)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Antinuclear', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases/drug therapy/*genetics', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/etiology/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/immunology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/immunology', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1996/12/15 00:00,1996/12/15 00:01,['1996/12/15 00:00'],"['1996/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014482796903687 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1996.0368 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1996 Dec 15;229(2):253-60. doi: 10.1006/excr.1996.0368.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the analysis was to find out whether combining those factors with the most important clinical prognostic factor (blast cell count) can improve the prognostic value (relapse-free interval). Univariate analysis shows that protein kinase D (PKC), Fos, P-glycoprotein (P-170) and glutathione S-transferase-pi (GST-pi) are significant prognostic factors independent of blast cell count (PBC) for the relapse-free intervals of children with ALL. The presence of the proteins Fos, PKC, P-170 and GST-pi was not independent within the patient population. The multivariate analysis showed that in combination with PBC and PKC, both P-170 and GST-pi have only limited prognostic influence.

METHODS: The study was conducted at the National Cancer Institute in Bogota, Colombia. Untreated ALL patients under 16 years of age were divided into two groups: a historical control cohort (HC) of 141 patients treated with conventional chemotherapy and an intensive chemotherapy cohort (IC) of 130 patients treated with a modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster protocol (m-BFM). Patients were clinically classified into risk categories for relapse, and followed through July 31, 1995. Disease-free survival (DFS) curves were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared by the log rank test. RESULTS: Therapy groups had similar clinical baseline characteristics. Nonresponse rate to induction was higher in the HC group (16.3%) than in the IC cohort (7.6%) (P = 0.047), but deaths during induction were more frequent among m-BFM patients (13.8%) than in the HC group (6.4%) (P = 0.064). Bone marrow relapses after complete remission were less common in the IC group than in the HC group (19.4% and 45.9%, respectively; P = 0.0001), but central nervous system relapses showed no difference (12.8% in the HC and 16.3% under IC; P = 0.6). The DFS rates at 10 years were higher for the IC group, regardless of the baseline risk. CONCLUSIONS: IC reduces the frequency of relapses in ALL children in developing countries, when compared to previous therapy. A highly effective therapy such as m-BFM seems to be the most important predictor of outcome in children.","['Buendia, M T', 'Terselich, G', 'Lozano, J M', 'Viscaino, M P']","['Buendia MT', 'Terselich G', 'Lozano JM', 'Viscaino MP']","['Pediatric Oncology Section, National Cancer Institute, Bogota, Colombia.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1997/02/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199702)28:2<108::AID-MPO4>3.0.CO;2-O [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199702)28:2<108::aid-mpo4>3.0.co;2-o [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1997 Feb;28(2):108-16. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199702)28:2<108::aid-mpo4>3.0.co;2-o.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Still there is a paucity of long-term data. With the improving cure rate, the quality of life and avoidance of second cancers have become important concerns. We evaluated 596 children and adolescents with ALL on Cancer and Leukemia Group B 7611 (CALGB 7611) who were randomized between 1976 and 1979 to receive intermediate-dose methotrexate (IDM) plus intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX) or cranial radiation (CRT) plus IT MTX. After 10 additional years of follow-up, the pattern and significance of the results reported in 1983 are confirmed. IDM offered better hematologic protection (P < 0.0006), better testicular protection (P = 0.002), but CRT offered better central nervous system (CNS) protection (P < 0.0001). The retrieval rate for the 231 patients who relapsed while on therapy or within 6 months of elective cessation of therapy is 20 +/- 5%. For the 33 patients who relapsed more than 6 months after cessation of therapy, the retrieval rate is 49 +/- 10%. For all patients, the 12-year event-free survival was 37 +/- 3.6% and the overall survival was 49 +/- 3.5%. There were two cases of second malignancies reported in 3,502 person-years of survival. Both occurred following salvage therapy. There was no evidence of an excessive number of second primaries over the general population of children. There were no reported instances of clinical cardiopathy. After a median follow-up of 11 years, there have been no reports of cardiopathy and no evidence of an increased risk of second cancers in children treated on CALGB 7611.

DESIGN: An ecological study comparing cancer incidence and mortality, 1972-1990, in nine municipalities, three of which surround the TV towers and six of which are further away from the towers. (TV radiofrequency radiation decreases with the square of the distance from the source.) Cancer incidence and mortality data were obtained from the then Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health. Data on frequency, power, and period of broadcasting for the three TV towers were obtained from the Commonwealth Department of Communications and the Arts. The calculated power density of the radiofrequency radiation in the exposed area ranged from 8.0 microW/cm2 near the towers to 0.2 microW/cm2 at a radius of 4km and 0.02 microW/cm2 at 12 km. SETTING: Northern Sydney, where three TV towers have been broadcasting since 1956. OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate ratios for leukaemia and brain tumour incidence and mortality, comparing the inner with the outer areas. RESULTS: For all ages, the rate ratio for total leukaemia incidence was 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.40). Among children, the rate ratio for leukaemia incidence was 1.58 (95% CI, 1.07-2.34) and for mortality it was 2.32 (95% CI, 1.35-4.01). The rate ratio for childhood lymphatic leukaemia (the most common type) was 1.55 (95% CI, 1.00-2.41) for incidence and 2.74 (95% CI, 1.42-5.27) for mortality. Brain cancer incidence and mortality were not increased. CONCLUSION: We found an association between increased childhood leukaemia incidence and mortality and proximity to TV towers.","['Hocking, B', 'Gordon, I R', 'Grain, H L', 'Hatfield, G E']","['Hocking B', 'Gordon IR', 'Grain HL', 'Hatfield GE']","['Bruce Hocking and Associates, Melbourne, VIC.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Med J Aust,The Medical journal of Australia,0400714,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'New South Wales/epidemiology', 'Radio Waves/*adverse effects', '*Television']",1996/12/02 00:00,1996/12/02 00:01,['1996/12/02 00:00'],"['1996/12/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/02 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.5694/j.1326-5377.1996.tb138661.x [doi]'],ppublish,Med J Aust. 1996 Dec 2-16;165(11-12):601-5. doi: 10.5694/j.1326-5377.1996.tb138661.x.,,,,,,['Med J Aust. 1996 Dec 2-16;165(11-12):599-600.

Suzuki, Jpn. J. Exp. Med. 45:473-478, 1975). Despite complete resistance to ecotropic MuLV infection in mice carrying the Fv-4 gene, it is known that cells carrying the resistance gene in tissue culture do not always show resistance as extensive as that in vivo (H. Yoshikura and T. Odaka, JNCI 61:461-463, 1978). To investigate the immunological effect on resistance in vivo, we introduced the Fv-4 gene into BALB/c nude mice (Fv-4-/- nude[nu/nu]) by mating them with Fv-4 congenic BALB/c mice (Fv-4r/r nude+/+) and examined the susceptibility of the F2 progeny to F-MuLV. All BALB/c nude mice without the Fv-4 gene (Fv-4-/- nude[nu/nu]) were permissive to F-MuLV and developed erythroleukemia within 2 weeks after virus inoculation. The BALB/c nude mice with the Fv-4 gene (Fv-4r/r nude[nu/nu]) did not develop leukemia, and no or little virus was detected in the spleen 7 weeks after virus inoculation. The resistance to F-MuLV was dominant in (Fv-4 congenic BALB/c x BALB/c nude) F1 mice with the Fv-4r/- nude(nu/+) genotype as strictly as in (Fv-4 congenic BALB/c x BALB/c) F1 mice with the Fv-4r/- nude+/+ genotype. However, almost all BALB/c nude mice with the Fv-4r/- nude(nu/nu) genotype developed the disease within 7 weeks, and the virus was detected in all of their spleens even in the mice without leukemia. These results show that the resistance caused by the Fv-4 gene is recessive in nude mice and dominant in BALB/c mice. Some immunological effects, perhaps cell-mediated immunity, may play important roles in the resistance to F-MuLV infection in vivo in addition to the dosage effect of the Fv-4 product.","['Higo, K', 'Kubo, Y', 'Iwatani, Y', 'Ono, T', 'Maeda, M', 'Hiai, H', 'Masuda, T', 'Kuribayashi, K', 'Zhang, F', 'Lamin, T Y', 'Adachi, A', 'Ishimoto, A']","['Higo K', 'Kubo Y', 'Iwatani Y', 'Ono T', 'Maeda M', 'Hiai H', 'Masuda T', 'Kuribayashi K', 'Zhang F', 'Lamin TY', 'Adachi A', 'Ishimoto A']","['Department of Viral Oncology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Susceptibility/*immunology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/growth & development/*immunology', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/virology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology/virology', 'Spleen/*immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology/virology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.1.750-754.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Jan;71(1):750-4. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.1.750-754.1997.,,,PMC191112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although much attention has focused on the mechanisms of cell proliferation and transformation by these viruses, experiments on the apoptotic process have yielded conflicting data in in vitro cell culture. Experimental infection of sheep with BLV proviruses offers the opportunity to analyze apoptosis in vivo. Here, we show that BLV-infected peripheral mononuclear cells, cultivated ex vivo, are protected from spontaneous programmed cell death. Moreover, the virus is able to specifically interfere with the apoptotic program of infected B lymphocytes. Strongly attenuated mutant proviruses that harbor deletions in the G4 and/or R3 genes also decrease the global susceptibility to apoptosis at levels similar to those obtained with the wild-type virus. In addition, cell culture supernatants from wild-type and mutant viruses can prevent uninfected cells from undergoing programmed cell death. These observations demonstrate that the R3 and G4 genes are not required to maintain both direct and indirect protection against apoptosis. They also imply that the level of programmed cell death observed ex vivo is independent of the amounts of proviruses in the animals. The failure of these cells to undergo apoptosis might be related to the pathogenesis induced by BLV.","['Dequiedt, F', 'Hanon, E', 'Kerkhofs, P', 'Pastoret, P P', 'Portetelle, D', 'Burny, A', 'Kettmann, R', 'Willems, L']","['Dequiedt F', 'Hanon E', 'Kerkhofs P', 'Pastoret PP', 'Portetelle D', 'Burny A', 'Kettmann R', 'Willems L']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Animal Physiology, Faculty of Agronomy, Gembloux, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Cattle', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/blood/*immunology', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/*immunology', 'Sheep']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.1.630-639.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Jan;71(1):630-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.1.630-639.1997.,,,PMC191094,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a syncytium formation assay consisting of a coculture of HTLV-1-bearing cells and target cells, mature gp46 and gp21 proteins each inhibited syncytium formation induced by HTLV-1-bearing cells. Experiments with 125I-labeled proteins showed that 125I-gp46 bound specifically with MOLT-4 target cells even in the presence of large amounts of gp21, whereas 125I-gp21 binding to target cells was completely blocked in the presence of large amounts of gp46. These observations suggest that HTLV-1 envelope proteins in syncytium formation interact with at least two components, which are located close to each other on the cell membrane. We isolated two components from MOLT-4 cell lysate, using Sepharose 4B columns coupled with peptides corresponding to amino acids 197 to 216 and 400 to 429, respectively, of the envelope protein. One is a trypsin digestion-sensitive component of approximately 34 to 35 kDa, which interacts specifically with gp46. The other is a nonprotein component, which interacts with gp21. This component was destroyed by sodium periodate oxidation and was partitioned into the methanol-chloroform phase. These observations suggest that these two components play an important role in HTLV-1 entry into target cells via membrane fusion.","['Sagara, Y', 'Ishida, C', 'Inoue, Y', 'Shiraki, H', 'Maeda, Y']","['Sagara Y', 'Ishida C', 'Inoue Y', 'Shiraki H', 'Maeda Y']","['Fukuoka Red Cross Blood Center, Chikushino, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (gp21 protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",IM,"['Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, env/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Giant Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/virology', 'Trypsin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.1.601-607.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Jan;71(1):601-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.1.601-607.1997.,,,PMC191090,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In avian sarcoma and leukemia viruses (ASLV), PR forms the C-terminal domain of Gag. Based on the properties of a mutation (cs22) in the cleavage site between the upstream NC domain and the PR domain, the proteolytic liberation of PR previously was inferred to be essential for processing of Gag and Pol proteins. To study this process in more detail, we have analyzed the effects that several mutations at the NC-PR cleavage site have on proteolytic processing in virus-like particles expressed in COS and quail cells. Mutant Gag proteins carrying the same mutations also were synthesized in vitro and tested for processing with purified PR. In both types of studies, N-terminal sequencing of the liberated PR domain was carried out to exactly identify the site of cleavage. Finally, synthetic peptides corresponding to the mutant proteins were assessed for the ability to act as substrates for PR. The results were all consistent and led to the following conclusions. (i) In vivo, if normal processing between NC and PR is prevented by mutations, limited cleavage occurs at a previously unrecognized alternative site three amino acids downstream, i.e., in PR. This N-terminally truncated PR is inactive as an enzyme, as inferred from the global processing defect in cs22 and a similar mutant. (ii) In Gag proteins translated in vitro, purified PR cleaves this alternative site as rapidly as it does the wild-type site. (iii) Contrary to previously accepted rules describing retroviral cleavage sites, an isoleucine residue placed at the P1 position of the NC-PR cleavage site does not hinder normal processing. (iv) A proline residue placed at the P2 position in this cleavage site blocks normal processing.","['Schatz, G', 'Pichova, I', 'Vogt, V M']","['Schatz G', 'Pichova I', 'Vogt VM']","['Section of Biochemistry, Molecular and Cell Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/genetics/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'Endopeptidases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.1.444-450.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Jan;71(1):444-50. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.1.444-450.1997.,,['CA-20081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC191070,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few sequences have been isolated, and those which have been reported are all highly divergent when compared to the retroviruses known to be harbored by mammals and birds. Here we show that retroviruses with significant homology to the human endogenous retrovirus type I (HERV-I) are present within the genomes of fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals and that they may well be widespread within many vertebrates. Phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences strongly supported the inclusion of viruses from each of these vertebrate classes into one monophyletic group. This analysis also demonstrated that the HERV-I-related viruses are more closely related to retroviruses belonging to the murine leukemia virus genus than to members of the other retroviral genera. The presence of HERV-I-related retroviruses in so many disparate vertebrate hosts suggests that other endogenous human retroviruses may also have a much wider distribution than is currently appreciated.","['Martin, J', 'Herniou, E', 'Cook, J', ""Waugh O'Neill, R"", 'Tristem, M']","['Martin J', 'Herniou E', 'Cook J', ""Waugh O'Neill R"", 'Tristem M']","['Department of Biology, Imperial College, Ascot, Berkshire, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Birds/virology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA, Viral', 'Fishes/virology', 'Humans', 'Marsupialia/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics', 'Reptiles/virology', 'Retroviridae/classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.1.437-443.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Jan;71(1):437-43. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.1.437-443.1997.,"['GENBANK/Y07807', 'GENBANK/Y07808', 'GENBANK/Y07809', 'GENBANK/Y07810']",,PMC191069,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutation of the middle TRE1 resulted in the greatest reduction in basal activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis demonstrated that the protein complexes bound to each of the three TRE1 sequences were not identical. The complexes formed with the TATA-distal and middle TRE1s were dependent on the core cyclic AMP response element (CRE) found in all three TRE1s, while the cellular transcription factor Sp1 bound the TATA-proximal TRE1 in a CRE-independent manner. Sp1 binding produced a footprint on the viral LTR which covered the 5' region of the proximal TRE1. Mixing experiments demonstrated that the bindings of CREB and Sp1 to the proximal TRE1 were mutually exclusive. Sp1 was able to activate transcription both from the complete LTR and from the proximal TRE1 alone.

Establishment of persistent reovirus infections of MEL cells was not associated with a significant cytopathic effect despite the presence of high titers of infectious virus in the cultures (>10(5) PFU/ml of culture lysate). Maintenance of persistently infected MEL-cell cultures was associated with coevolution of mutant viruses and cells. Mutant viruses produced greater yields than the parental wild-type (wt) strains in MEL cells cured of persistent infection and in cells treated with ammonium chloride, a weak base that blocks viral disassembly. Mutant cells supported growth of wt infectious subvirion particles, which are disassembly intermediates generated in vitro by treatment of virions with chymotrypsin, substantially better than growth of wt virions. These findings indicate that viral and cellular mutations selected during maintenance of persistently infected MEL-cell cultures affect acid-dependent proteolysis of virions during entry into cells. We also found that wt infectious subvirion particles produce greater yields than wt virions in wt MEL cells, which suggests that inefficient viral disassembly in MEL cells favors establishment of persistent infection. Therefore, steps in reovirus replication leading to viral disassembly appear to be critical determinants of the capacity of MEL cells to support both establishment and maintenance of persistent reovirus infections.","['Wetzel, J D', 'Chappell, J D', 'Fogo, A B', 'Dermody, T S']","['Wetzel JD', 'Chappell JD', 'Fogo AB', 'Dermody TS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '01Q9PC255D (Ammonium Chloride)']",IM,"['Ammonium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/pharmacology', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/*virology', 'L Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/blood', 'Mammalian orthoreovirus 3/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Mammals/virology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Rabbits', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virus Latency']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.1.299-306.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Jan;71(1):299-306. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.1.299-306.1997.,,['AI32539/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],PMC191051,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Until very recently, the lack of an HTLV-1 infectivity assay precluded the determination of the HTLV-1 protein domains required for infectivity. Here, we describe an assay which allows the quantitative evaluation of HTLV-1 cell-to-cell transmission in a single round of infection. Using this assay, we demonstrate that in this system, cell-to-cell transmission is at least 100 times more efficient than transmission with free viral particles. We have examined 46 surface (SU) glycoprotein mutants in order to define the amino acids of the HTLV-1 SU glycoprotein required for full infectivity. We demonstrate that these amino acids are distributed along the entire length of the SU glycoprotein, including the N-terminus and C-terminus regions, which have not been previously defined as being important for HTLV-1 glycoprotein function. For most of the mutated glycoproteins, the capacity to mediate cell-to-cell transmission is correlated with the ability to induce formation of syncytia. This result indicates that the fusion capacity is the main factor responsible for infectivity mediated by the HTLV-1 SU envelope glycoprotein, as is the case for other retroviral glycoproteins. However, other factors must also intervene, since two of the mutated glycoproteins were correctly fusogenic but could not mediate cell-to-cell transmission. Existence of this phenotype shows that capacity for fusion is not sufficient to confer infectivity, even in cell-to-cell transmission, and could suggest that postfusion events involve the SU.","['Delamarre, L', 'Rosenberg, A R', 'Pique, C', 'Pham, D', 'Dokhelar, M C']","['Delamarre L', 'Rosenberg AR', 'Pique C', 'Pham D', 'Dokhelar MC']","['URA 1156 CNRS, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Giant Cells', 'Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Mutagenesis', 'Protein Precursors/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virion/metabolism']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.71.1.259-266.1997 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Jan;71(1):259-66. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.1.259-266.1997.,,,PMC191046,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated the adhesive properties of APL cells for the endothelium and the extracellular matrix, their motility and the effect of ATRA on these functions. Blasts from 7 APL patients adhered to resting and IL-1-activated endothelium, to the same degree as normal PMN. Adhesion was partially mediated by ICAM-1 and, for IL-1-activated endothelium, by VCAM-1 and E-selectin. These cells showed less adhesiveness for the matrix than PMN, although they maintained the same substrate preference: they adhered to fibronectin and thrombospondin, but not to laminin and type-IV collagen. Exposure to ATRA in vitro (1 microM for 48 to 96 hr) increased the adhesiveness of APL cells; this effect was particularly evident in the case of sub-endothelial matrix and fibronectin. A similar increment in adhesiveness was observed when comparing cells from 2 patients before and after treatment with ATRA. APL cells migrated in response to fMLP and motility was increased by ATRA. In conclusion, APL cells were less adhesive to the matrix than PMN, but treatment with ATRA considerably enhanced their adhesive properties. This could be important in determining the efflux of leukemic cells from the bone marrow and their tissue infiltration during ATRA therapy.","['Taraboletti, G', 'Borsotti, P', 'Chirivi, R G', 'Vergani, V', 'Falanga, A', 'Barbui, T', 'Giavazzi, R', 'Rambaldi, A']","['Taraboletti G', 'Borsotti P', 'Chirivi RG', 'Vergani V', 'Falanga A', 'Barbui T', 'Giavazzi R', 'Rambaldi A']","['Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/*drug effects', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'E-Selectin/physiology', 'Endothelium/physiopathology', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/physiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1997/01/06 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/01/06 00:00'],"['1997/01/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/01/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19970106)70:1<72::AID-IJC11>3.0.CO;2-F [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19970106)70:1<72::aid-ijc11>3.0.co;2-f [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1997 Jan 6;70(1):72-7. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19970106)70:1<72::aid-ijc11>3.0.co;2-f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient represents the 4th reported CLL case with this translocation. The CLL cells could be infected and immortalized by the indigenous and by the prototype B958 virus in vitro. The T-cell markers were not detectable on the established lines. In all experiments the immortalized lines originated from the CLL cells. Their preferential emergence over virus-infected normal B cells may be coupled to the high expression of the bcl-2 gene due to the translocation. In spite of the sensitivity of CLL cells to EBV infection in vitro, no EBNA-positive cells were detected in the ex vivo population. In vitro, we could generate cytotoxic function in T-lymphocyte cultures which acted on autologous EBV-infected CLL cells. Therefore we assume that if such cells emerged in vivo they were eliminated by the T-cell response.","['Avila-Carino, J', 'Lewin, N', 'Tomita, Y', 'Szeles, A', 'Sandlund, A', 'Mosolits, S', 'Mellstedt, H', 'Klein, G', 'Klein, E']","['Avila-Carino J', 'Lewin N', 'Tomita Y', 'Szeles A', 'Sandlund A', 'Mosolits S', 'Mellstedt H', 'Klein G', 'Klein E']","['Microbiology and Tumor Biology Center, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.

At the present, there is a broad use of growth factors. Most studies have been done with G-CSF and GM-CSF, their beneficial effects are proven regarding improvement of hematopoietic recovery after chemotherapy. This results in a marked reduction of infectious risks and a shortening of drug- and radiation-induced myelosuppression. CSFs are most important in mobilizing peripheral blood progenitor cells [PBPC] and have allowed high dose therapy to be given to patients who would not have been able to undergo conventional bone marrow transplantation.

HMBA action involves modulation of factors regulating G1 to S phase progression, including a decrease in the G1 cyclin-dependent kinase 4 accumulation of underphosphorylated retinoblastoma protein, and an increase in the level of both retinoblastoma protein and the related protein, p107. In turn, p107 complexes with transcription factors such as E2F and, presumably, inhibits transcriptional activity of these factors for genes whose products are required for DNA synthesis.

Benzene exposure was evaluated by expert review of the detailed data on occupational exposures generated by case-control interviews. RESULTS: No association was found between HCL and employment in a job exposed to benzene (odds ratio (OR) 0.9 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.6-1.3)). The sample included 125 subjects, 34 cases (15%), and 91 controls (21%) who had been exposed to benzene, as individually assessed by the experts, for at least one hour a month during one of their jobs. Benzene exposure was not associated with a risk of HCL (OR 0.8 (0.5-1.2)). No trend towards an increase in OR was detected for increasing exposures, the percentage of work time involving exposure to > 1 ppm, or the duration of exposure. No findings suggested a particular risk period, when the OR associated with the time since first or last exposure, or since the end of exposure, were examined.

METHODS: Literature review and epidemiological evaluation. RESULTS: Seven epidemiological studies have been conducted on the risk of cancer among adults in relation to residential exposure to power frequency magnetic fields. Leukaemia was positively associated with magnetic fields in three case-control studies. The other two case-control studies and two cohort studies did not show such a link. Brain tumours and breast cancer have rarely been examined by these studies. Based on the epidemiological results, the analysis of the role of chance and bias, and the criteria for causal inferences, it seems that the evidence is not strong enough to support the putative causal relation between residential exposure to magnetic fields and adult leukaemia, brain tumours, or breast cancer. Inadequate statistical power is far more a concern than selection bias, information bias, and confounding in interpreting the results from these studies, and in explaining inconsistencies between studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our reviews suggested that the only way to answer whether residential exposure to magnetic fields is capable of increasing the risks of adult cancers is to conduct more studies carefully avoiding methodological flaws, in particular small sample size. We also suggested that the risk of female breast cancer should be the object of additional investigations, and that future studies should attempt to include information on exposure to magnetic fields from workplaces as well as residential exposure to estimate the effects of overall exposure to magnetic fields.","['Li, C Y', 'Theriault, G', 'Lin, R S']","['Li CY', 'Theriault G', 'Lin RS']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,,IM,"['Bias', 'Brain Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Housing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.53.8.505 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 1996 Aug;53(8):505-10. doi: 10.1136/oem.53.8.505.,,,PMC1128532,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunoblot analysis of cells using a pan-cadherin serum, directed against the conserved carboxyl-terminus of cadherins, revealed a major band of 130 kDa and a minor one of 135 kDa. The 130 kDa cadherin was also recognized by anti-N-cadherin antibodies. A human N-cadherin cDNA probe hybridized to a 4.3 kb mRNA isolated from cells immunologically positive for N-cadherin. Sequencing of the cDNA fragments isolated from the cells revealed a N-cadherin sequence. Cell surface expression of N-cadherin was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence staining of the cells. Immunoblot and Northern blot analyses also revealed the presence of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and gamma-catenin (plakoglobin) in these cell lines. Immunoprecipitation with anti-N-cadherin antibodies and subsequent immunoblot analysis with anti-catenin antibodies revealed that N-cadherin is associated with alpha- and beta-catenins, a prerequisite for cadherins to be functional.

During Glu/NMDA-mediated apoptosis the levels of the intracellular anti-apoptotic agents Bc1-2 and glutathione dropped by more than 50%. Flupirtine completely abolished this reduction of Bc1-2 and glutathione level at a concentration of 10 microM. In the presence of 3 microM flupirtine a > 6-fold increase of the Bc1-2 (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2) level was observed in hNT neurons. At the same concentration, the intracellular level of glutathione increased to 200%.

The RTI antibody inhibited the binding of RT to the template-primer (BI antibody), and directly reacted with the RT-template-primer complex and inhibited enzymatic activity (PI antibody). The RTI antibody interfered with formation of the RT-template-primer complex suggesting that it recognized the antigenic site involved in template-primer binding of RT molecules. Since deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) blocked inhibition of the RT activity by the PI antibody, the antigenic site recognized by the PI antibody may be closely related to the dNTP binding site. The seropositivities of the BI and PI antibodies were 84.6% and 91.2%, respectively, in HIV-1-infected individuals; healthy individuals, HTLV-I-positive individuals, autoimmune disease patients and leukemia patients were all seronegative.

We introduced modifications to a standard proliferation protocol, and for the first time report antigen specific proliferation in BLV infected animals with persistent lymphocytosis (a benign proliferation of B lymphocytes). Serum (autologous, heterologous or fetal) but not medium was a major factor contributing to spontaneous proliferation. Spontaneous proliferation was strongly serum concentration dependent and reducing serum to 0.5-1% resulted in decreased background proliferation and development of a functional assay. Addition of indomethacin (3-6 micrograms/ml) further increased antigen specific responses not only from persistently lymphocytotic but also from lymphosarcoma animals. Thus, this modified proliferation protocol can be used in infections where background proliferation hinders evaluation of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells.","['Orlik, O', 'Splitter, G A']","['Orlik O', 'Splitter GA']","['Department of Animal Health and Biomedical Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cattle', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*microbiology', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Depletion']",1996/12/15 00:00,1996/12/15 00:01,['1996/12/15 00:00'],"['1996/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022175996001780 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-1759(96)00178-0 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1996 Dec 15;199(2):159-65. doi: 10.1016/s0022-1759(96)00178-0.,,['R01 CA59127/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytokine-induced killing of AML blasts was inhibited by monocytes, recovered from peripheral blood by counterflow centrifugal elutriation. Histamine, at concentrations exceeding 0.1 microM, abrogated the monocyte-induced inhibition of NK cells; thereby, histamine and IL-2 or histamine and IFN-alpha synergistically induced NK cell-mediated destruction of AML blasts. The effect of histamine was completely blocked by the histamine H2-receptor (H2R) antagonist ranitidine but not by its chemical control AH20399AA. Catalase, a scavenger of reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM), reversed the monocyte-induced inhibition of NK cell-mediated killing of blast cells, indicating that the inhibitory signal was mediated by products of the respiratory burst of monocytes.

TNF-alpha was produced only in 1 case. No statistical difference was seen in all the productions obtained from other than promyelocytic acute leukemic cells, both with and without ATRA addition. However, it is noteworthy that the production of IL-6 was more than twice as high in ANLL non-APL than in APL cases.

In univariate survival analysis, significant differences were found according to BM pattern (p < 0.05), the presence of nodules being a favorable prognostic sign. In multivariate survival analysis in a model including age, clinical stage, BM pattern, BM lymphocytosis, WBC and sex, only age and stage but not BM pattern or BM lymphocytosis had independent prognostic significance. In stage A, progression-free survival was significantly longer in patients with nodular than in patients with non-nodular bone-marrow pattern. The overall survival of these patients, however, did not differ, possibly owing to the prompt and prolonged treatment given to most patients at the time of progression to stage B or C.

To facilitate our understanding of biological functions and functional domains, we isolated rat cDNA clones encoding the rat homolog of human CD30 from a cDNA library of a rat T-cell line, TARL-2. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA showed 73% homology with that of human CD30. The deduced rat CD30 protein consisted of 493 amino acids with an M(r) of 59 160 and contained a single transmembrane domain. It lacked the second repeat of the cysteine-rich motif in the extracellular domain found in human CD30. The amino acid sequence showed 51.8 and 61.2% identity with the cysteine-rich and the cytoplasmic domains, respectively. In the cytoplasmic domain, however, the amino acid sequence was highly conserved in about 100 residues near the C-terminus showing 77.7% identity, whereas the rest of the cytoplasmic domain showed 45.2% identity. This conservation suggests the functional importance of this region. Comparison with the recently reported mouse CD30 revealed 83.7% conservation of the amino acid sequence and a common structure of the extracellular domain which lacks the second cysteine-rich motif. Northern blots revealed a 3.4-kb mRNA in the PHA-activated spleen cells and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-infected rat T-cell lines, whereas smaller transcripts of 2.3 kb were found in the lung. A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against GST-fusion protein of the cytoplasmic domain detected bands with an apparent M(r) of 80 kDa and 100- 110 kDa expressed in TARL-2 and spleen cells. Transient overexpression of rat CD30 in TARL-2 cells activated HIV LTR in a NF-kappa B site-dependent manner, indicating that CD30 signals activate NF-kappa B. The chromosomal location of the gene was identified by fluorescence in situ hybridisation at 5q36.2, and appeared to correspond to human 1p36, where human CD30 has been mapped. The identification and characterization of the rat counterpart of human CD30 will facilitate studies of the biological function of this molecule.","['Aizawa, S', 'Satoh, H', 'Horie, R', 'Ito, K', 'Choi, S H', 'Takeuchi, H', 'Watanabe, T']","['Aizawa S', 'Satoh H', 'Horie R', 'Ito K', 'Choi SH', 'Takeuchi H', 'Watanabe T']","['Department of Pathology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Ki-1 Antigen)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cysteine/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/*chemistry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Ki-1 Antigen/*chemistry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transfection/genetics']",1996/12/05 00:00,1996/12/05 00:01,['1996/12/05 00:00'],"['1996/12/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/05 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-1119(96)00542-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(96)00542-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 1996 Dec 5;182(1-2):155-62. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(96)00542-2.,['GENBANK/D42117'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three patients died soon after grafting, the others showed prompt haemopoietic recovery with median times to recover an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) above 0.5 and 1.0 x 10(9)/I of 15 (range 9-27) and 17d (range 10-28) respectively. Time to platelet recovery above 20 or 50 x 10(9)/I was 16 (range 9-76) and 18d (range 12-100) respectively. 27 patients (46%) developed no or mild acute graft-versus-host disease (GVIID). The incidence of moderate (grade II) disease was 27%; 24% of the patients developed severe acute GVHD (grades III or IV), 55% of patients who were alive 90d after transplantation developed chronic GVHD, the probability to develop extensive chronic GVHD was 32% (95% confidence interval 22-42) with a median follow-up of 14 months. Overall and event-free survival (EFS) at 1 year were 54% (CI 48-60) and 50% (CI 43-57), respectively, the relapse incidence was 23% (CI 17-29). EFS was 67% (CI 55-79) in patients transplanted for acute leukaemias in first complete remission, chronic myelogenous leukaemia in first chronic phase, or severe aplastic anaemia. Transplantation of allogeneic PBPC resulted in prompt and durable engraftment. The incidence and severity of acute and chronic GVHD seemed comparable to that observed after allogeneic BMT. Overall and event-free survival in this cohort of patients, most of whom suffered from advanced leukaemia or lymphoma, is encouraging, suggesting that the high numbers of T lymphocytes and/or natural killer cells contained in a typical PBPC collection product exert a vigorous graft-versus-leukaemia effect. Further evaluation of allogeneic PBPCT is highly desirable.","['Schmitz, N', 'Bacigalupo, A', 'Labopin, M', 'Majolino, I', 'Laporte, J P', 'Brinch, L', 'Cook, G', 'Deliliers, G L', 'Lange, A', 'Rozman, C', 'Garcia-Conde, J', 'Finke, J', 'Domingo-Albos, A', 'Gratwohl, A']","['Schmitz N', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Labopin M', 'Majolino I', 'Laporte JP', 'Brinch L', 'Cook G', 'Deliliers GL', 'Lange A', 'Rozman C', 'Garcia-Conde J', 'Finke J', 'Domingo-Albos A', 'Gratwohl A']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, University of Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Male', 'Platelet Count', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1958.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Dec;95(4):715-23. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1958.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dutch Cooperative Study Group on Immunophenotyping of Haematological Malignancies (SIHON).,692-9,"During the last decade, biannual quality controls were performed in the Netherlands focusing on the immunophenotyping of leukaemic haematological malignancies. All results on 48 specimens obtained by 18-34 laboratories were analysed. The interlaboratory variability and percentages of discordant results from 30 markers were measured by assessing false positive or negative (cut-off 10%) results in comparison with median results of the group. The quality of the immunophenotypic diagnoses obtained from the interpretation of these markers in relation to clinical data was evaluated by scoring them as 'correct', 'minor fault', 'major fault', 'not based upon the markers used', and 'no diagnosis', CD3, CD8, CD19, CD61 and Sm lambda had the lowest percentage discordancy (sum of total negative and positive discordant values 5-7.5% of assays): CD13, CD15, cyCD22, CD33 and TdT scored worst with 14-20% cumulative discordancy. The analysis of each diagnosis yielded 78% acceptable immunophenotypic conclusions (correct 54% and minor fault 24%). It appeared that the major faults in immunophenotyping were caused by suboptimal antibody selection and erroneous interpretation of the results obtained, rather than by technical errors. Large differences per diagnostic category were observed, with the best scores for mature B-cell leukaemias, AMLs and common-ALL, and the poorest scores for T-cell malignancies which were correctly diagnosed in only 24-60% of specimens. Mature T-NHL and T-PLL were mistakenly diagnosed as T-ALL by 40% of the centres. Misinterpretation of TdT immunofluorescence or omitting this marker contributed significantly to these wrong diagnoses. A median of 4% of immunophenotypic diagnoses were not based on a correct panel of antibodies, but upon the morphology of the accompanying blood smear, and was often flawed by overinterpretation. In conclusion, both the technical performance of immunophenotyping of haematological malignancies in The Netherlands and the procedure by which a final diagnosis is obtained needs improvement, especially for T-cell malignancies.","['Kluin-Nelemans, J C', 'van Wering, E R', ""van'T Veer, M B"", 'van der Schoot, C E', 'Adriaansen, H J', 'van der Burgh, F J', 'Gratama, J W']","['Kluin-Nelemans JC', 'van Wering ER', ""van'T Veer MB"", 'van der Schoot CE', 'Adriaansen HJ', 'van der Burgh FJ', 'Gratama JW']","['Department of Haematology, Leiden University Hospital, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['False Negative Reactions', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*standards', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Netherlands', '*Quality Control', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1962.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Dec;95(4):692-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1962.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additional chromosome changes were observed in 71% of the cases. 9p abnormalities were identified in 26%, and monosomy 7 as well as hyperdiploid karyotypes 50 were both found in 17% of cases. 9p anomalies were characterized by a low complete remission (CR) rate (58%) and an extremely short median remission duration (MRD: 100 d). In patients with monosomy 7, the poor treatment outcome was confirmed (CR rate 55%: MRD 113 d). In contrast, all patients with hyperdiploid karyotypes 50 achieved CR, and the overall survival was superior to all other Ph-positive ALL patients except those without additional chromosome aberrations. Exclusive rearrangement of the minor breakpoint cluster region of the BCR gene and lack of coexpression of myeloid-associated antigens in cases with 9p anomalies as well as a high frequency of rearrangements of the major breakpoint cluster region of the BCR gene in patients with monosomy 7 (89%) further substantiated that additional chromosome aberrations may characterize distinct subgroups of Ph-positive ALL. Moreover, the necessity of the complementing use of chromosome banding analyses, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, and fluorescence in situ hybridizations in the accurate identification of Ph-positive patients has become evident due to variant Ph translocations in 3%, and negative PCR assays in 4% of the cases.","['Rieder, H', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Gassmann, W', 'Maurer, J', 'Janssen, J W', 'Gokbuget, N', 'Schwartz, S', 'Thiel, E', 'Loffler, H', 'Bartram, C R', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Fonatsch, C']","['Rieder H', 'Ludwig WD', 'Gassmann W', 'Maurer J', 'Janssen JW', 'Gokbuget N', 'Schwartz S', 'Thiel E', 'Loffler H', 'Bartram CR', 'Hoelzer D', 'Fonatsch C']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Medical Centre of Human Genetics, Philipps University, Marburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1968.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Dec;95(4):678-91. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1968.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One patient suffered a CNS relapse, but without any evidence of bone marrow involvement. The remaining four patients with no evidence of MRD at CR were still in haematological remission at follow-up after 4, 11, 12 and 13 months, respectively.

Similar drug treatment of the HL60 promyelocytic cell line also produced sublines exhibiting an extended MDR phenotype. The KG1a and the HEL cell lines expressed functional P-glycoprotein and were resistant to the drug concentrations used for treatment.

Correlations between medical charts and maternal interview were high for birth weight (r = 0.98, kappa = 0.9) and gestational age (r = 0.86, kappa = 0.6). Mean differences between the two sources were small, -10.5 g for birth weight and -0.36 weeks for gestational age. Reproductive history and medical procedures had high to moderate reliability. Problems after delivery and pregnancy complications generally had low validity and reliability. Little evidence of differential misclassification was found. Time between delivery and interview ranged from zero to 8 years and did not greatly affect reliability. This study suggests that validity and reliability of maternally reported pregnancy and delivery information may differ with the nature of the factor of interest, but is affected little by time from birth or case-control status.","['Olson, J E', 'Shu, X O', 'Ross, J A', 'Pendergrass, T', 'Robison, L L']","['Olson JE', 'Shu XO', 'Ross JA', 'Pendergrass T', 'Robison LL']","['Department of Pediatric Epidemiology/Clinical Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['Birth Weight', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Labor, Obstetric', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Mental Recall', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Random Allocation', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009032 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 1997 Jan 1;145(1):58-67. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009032.,,"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42479/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All high power transmitters.,10-7,"A small area study of cancer incidence, 1974-1986, near 20 high power television (TV) and frequency modulation (FM) radio transmitters in Great Britain was carried out to place in context the findings of an earlier study around the Sutton Coldfield transmitter. The national database of postcoded cancer registrations was used with population and socioeconomic data from the 1981 census. Cancers examined were adult leukemias, skin melanoma, and bladder cancer, following the findings in the earlier study of significant declines in risk of these cancers with distance from the Sutton Coldfield transmitter. Childhood leukemia and brain cancer were also examined. Statistical analysis was performed for all transmitters combined, four overlapping groups of transmitters defined by their transmission characteristics, and for all transmitters separately. There were 3,305 adult leukemia cases from 0-10 km (observed/expected (O/E) ratio = 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.07). A decline in risk of adult leukemia was found for all transmitters combined (p = 0.05), two of the transmitter groups, and three of the single transmitters; for all transmitters combined, observed excess risk was no more than 15% at any distance up to 10 km, and there was no observed excess within 2 km of transmitters (O/E ratio = 0.97, 95% CI 0.78-1.21). For childhood leukemia and brain cancer, and adult skin melanoma and bladder cancer, results were not indicative of a decline in risk with distance from transmitters. The magnitude and pattern of risk found in the Sutton Coldfield study did not appear to be replicated. The authors conclude that the results at most give no more than very weak support to the Sutton Coldfield findings.","['Dolk, H', 'Elliott, P', 'Shaddick, G', 'Walls, P', 'Thakrar, B']","['Dolk H', 'Elliott P', 'Shaddick G', 'Walls P', 'Thakrar B']","['Department of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, England.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Radio Waves/*adverse effects', 'Registries', '*Television', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009026 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 1997 Jan 1;145(1):10-7. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009026.,,,,,,"['Am J Epidemiol. 1997 Oct 15;146(8):682-3.

Sutton Coldfield transmitter.,1-9,"A small area study of cancer incidence in 1974-1986 was carried out to investigate an unconfirmed report of a ""cluster"" of leukemias and lymphomas near the Sutton Coldfield television (TV) and frequency modulation (FM) radio transmitter in the West Midlands, England. The study used a national database of postcoded cancer registrations, and population and socioeconomic data from the 1981 census. Selected cancers were hematopoietic and lymphatic, brain, skin, eye, male breast, female breast, lung, colorectal, stomach, prostate, and bladder. Expected numbers of cancers in small areas were calculated by indirect standardization, with stratification for a small area socioeconomic index. The study area was defined as a 10 km radius circle around the transmitter, within which 10 bands of increasing distance from the transmitter were defined as a basis for testing for a decline in risk with distance, and an inner area was arbitrarily defined for descriptive purposes as a 2 km radius circle. The risk of adult leukemia within 2 km was 1.83 (95% confidence interval 1.22-2.74), and there was a significant decline in risk with distance from the transmitter (p = 0.001). These findings appeared to be consistent over the periods 1974-1980, 1981-1986, and were probably largely independent of the initially reported cluster, which appeared to concern mainly a later period. In the context of variability of leukemia risk across census wards in the West Midlands as a whole, the Sutton Coldfield findings were unusual. A significant decline in risk with distance was also found for skin cancer, possibly related to residual socioeconomic confounding, and for bladder cancer. Study of other radio and TV transmitters in Great Britain is required to put the present results in wider context. No causal implications can be made from a single cluster investigation of this kind.","['Dolk, H', 'Shaddick, G', 'Walls, P', 'Grundy, C', 'Thakrar, B', 'Kleinschmidt, I', 'Elliott, P']","['Dolk H', 'Shaddick G', 'Walls P', 'Grundy C', 'Thakrar B', 'Kleinschmidt I', 'Elliott P']","['Department of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, England.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Radio Waves/*adverse effects', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009025 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 1997 Jan 1;145(1):1-9. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009025.,,,,,,"['Am J Epidemiol. 1997 Oct 15;146(8):682-3.

Optimization of the method with viral promoter-luciferase reporter constructs indicated that expression of luciferase activity persisted up to 5 d and was promoter, pressure, and site dependent (ventral > dorsal). Using cytomegalovirus (CMV)-driven human alpha1-antitrypsin, transgene expression was immunolocalized within keratinocytes of the stratum granulosum at 24 h. We measured tensile strength of skin incisions at 11-21 d in both normal and diabetic rats transfected with TGF-beta1 expression vectors at surgery. Native murine TGF-beta1 under an SV40 promoter produced positive effects, while wound strengthening was more pronounced in diabetic animals using a CMV-driven construct. Transfection of rat skin with constitutively active, mutant porcine TGF-beta1 under the control of the CMV and Moloney murine leukemia virus promoters significantly increased tensile strength up to 80% for 14-21 d after surgery. Transfection 24 h before surgery was more effective. Particle-mediated gene delivery can be used to deliver viral promoter-cytokine expression constructs into rat skin in a safe, efficient, and reproducible fashion. The extent of wound repair, as evidenced by enhanced tensile strength, can be markedly improved in tissues transfected with TGF-beta1 expression constructs.","['Benn, S I', 'Whitsitt, J S', 'Broadley, K N', 'Nanney, L B', 'Perkins, D', 'He, L', 'Patel, M', 'Morgan, J R', 'Swain, W F', 'Davidson, J M']","['Benn SI', 'Whitsitt JS', 'Broadley KN', 'Nanney LB', 'Perkins D', 'He L', 'Patel M', 'Morgan JR', 'Swain WF', 'Davidson JM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-2561, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (alpha 1-Antitrypsin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biolistics', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Keratinocytes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Rats', 'Skin/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Wound Healing/*physiology', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin/genetics/pharmacology']",1996/12/15 00:00,1996/12/15 00:01,['1996/12/15 00:00'],"['1996/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI119118 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1996 Dec 15;98(12):2894-902. doi: 10.1172/JCI119118.,,"['AG-06528/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AR-41943/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC507757,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is assumed that the cells with high catalase activity are resistant to high concentrations of ascorbate since catalase can decompose hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced by the auto-oxidation of ascorbate in cultured medium. In this study, we investigated whether intracellular catalase activity affects the uptake of ascorbate into animal tissue and cultured cells. Ascorbate concentrations in the tissues of guinea pigs and various cultured cells, with and without supplementation of ascorbate, were determined to evaluate the efficiency of ascorbate uptake. We found a positive correlation between the efficiency of ascorbate uptake and catalase activity in various tissues of guinea pigs (r = 0.767, p < 0.05). Furthermore, a positive correlation between the two was also found in various species of cultured cells.

In a first instance, we assumed that altered drug-topo II interactions, based on quantitative and/or qualitative modifications of the enzyme, are a cause of resistance in the cell line. We tried to modify the drug sensitivity of the cells by means of various agents and cytokines. Positive results were obtained with verapamil and, to a lesser extent, cyclosporin A, but they were not specific for the drug resistant variant and occurred in the parental CCRF-CEM as well.

The effect of UTI on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF)-induced stimulation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and in the promyeloid leukemia U937 cells was studied. uPA antigen was evaluated in the cell lysate and in the conditioned media by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blot. TNF can promote the production of uPA in HUVEC and in U937 cells. The PKC inhibitors (H7, calphostin C, and staurosporine) inhibited TNF-induced uPA expression and secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis of the expression of cell surface receptor-bound uPA by flow cytometry using uPA-specific MAb indicates that induction of uPA expression by TNF was inhibited when these cells were incubated with UTI. On the other hand, treatment of the cells with UTI alone failed to alter uPA production. UTI also reduced the secretion of uPA in TNF-treated cells. UTI was as effective as PKC inhibitors in inhibiting uPA expression by TNF. Incubation of the cells with UTI, however, had no effect on the ability of PMA to stimulate cell-associated uPA expression. These data suggest that UTI may influence the PKC-dependent protein kinase pathway in uPA expression. The study on intracellular pathways involved in UTI modulation of uPA will enhance our understanding of the role that UTI plays in uPA-mediated cellular invasion.","['Kobayashi, H', 'Gotoh, J', 'Terao, T']","['Kobayashi H', 'Gotoh J', 'Terao T']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Shizuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,"['0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Trypsin Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'OR3S9IF86U (urinastatin)', 'U5NH2JV64T (saruplase)']",IM,"['8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Enzyme Precursors/analysis', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/analysis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Trypsin Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/analysis/*biosynthesis']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 1996 Dec;71(4):380-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Viroproduction, neutralizing antibody production, and vital DNA presence in testis, blood, muscle, and semen were analyzed at various times after infection. Inoculation of RAV-1 into the gonads of adult males resulted in a low level of viroproduction in testis and blood, followed by the appearance of neutralizing antibody 2 or 3 wk later. Neither viroproduction in semen nor viral DNA presence in sperm were detected even though the infected chickens were found to produce RAV-1 in testis. One week after intratesticular inoculation of 1-wk-old males with RAV-1, a high level of viroproduction was found in blood and testis, and viral DNA was detected in gonadal cells. Further, by 6 wk after inoculation, the production of virus decreased in all tissues, viral DNA could not longer be detected in the testis, and neutralizing antibodies appeared in blood. All together these data show that it is possible to infect testicular cells by direct inoculation of RAV-1 in the testis, and that the immune response of both adult and young chickens seems to reduce this infection. Moreover, no evidence of spermatozoa infection was found; this result suggests that RAV-1 inoculation into testis may not induce genetic transmission of virus, and consequently would not be useful in the production of transgenic chickens.","['Afanassieff, M', 'Dambrine, G', 'Ronfort, C', 'Lasserre, F', 'Coudert, F', 'Verdier, G']","['Afanassieff M', 'Dambrine G', 'Ronfort C', 'Lasserre F', 'Coudert F', 'Verdier G']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Transfert de genes, INRA LA 810, CNRS UMR 5534, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon I, Villeurbanne, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Avian Dis,Avian diseases,0370617,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*metabolism', 'Avian Leukosis/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Base Sequence', '*Chickens', 'DNA, Viral/analysis/chemistry/genetics', 'Disease Vectors', 'Male', 'Muscle, Skeletal/chemistry', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/veterinary', 'Poultry Diseases/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Semen/chemistry/*virology', 'Testis/chemistry/*virology']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Avian Dis. 1996 Oct-Dec;40(4):841-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Normal progenitors adhere through a variety of receptors to stroma and extracellular matrix components, including fibronectin. Adhesion through integrins to fibronectin may not only serve to anchor progenitors to the microenvironment but also to directly alter the proliferative behavior of normal hematopoietic progenitors. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a malignant disease of the hematopoietic stem cell. At the molecular level, CML is characterized by the BCR/ABL gene rearrangement which encodes for the oncoprotein, p210bcr-abl. Presence of the p210bcr-abl tyrosine kinase is necessary and sufficient for the malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells. Clinically, CML is characterized by an abnormal, premature release of primitive progenitors and precursors in the blood and by the continuous proliferation of the malignant progenitor population. In vitro, CML progenitors fail to adhere to or be regulated by marrow stroma. Since CML progenitors express similar numbers of integrin adhesion receptors as normal progenitors, functional rather than quantitative differences of these receptors on CML progenitors may be responsible for the abnormal circulation and proliferation of the malignant clone. In this manuscript we will review the role of integrin adhesion receptors present on normal hematopoietic progenitors in the regulation of their proliferation and discuss signal transduction mechanisms that may be responsible for these effects. We will also discuss the integrin defect in CML which may be caused by the presence of the oncoprotein, P210bcr-abl, and may explain the abnormal trafficking and proliferation observed in CML.","['Verfaillie, C M', 'Hurley, R', 'Lundell, B I', 'Zhao, C', 'Bhatia, R']","['Verfaillie CM', 'Hurley R', 'Lundell BI', 'Zhao C', 'Bhatia R']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Division', 'Connective Tissue/physiology', 'Extracellular Matrix/*physiology', 'Fibronectins/physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*physiology', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000203658 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1997;97(1-2):40-52. doi: 10.1159/000203658.,,"['P01-CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-4581401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL-48738-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,160,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At equitoxic doses, JM216 showed the most apoptotic cells and had the most platinum bound to the DNA; JM244 showed the fewest apoptotic cells and had the least platinum bound to DNA.

Strongyloides stercoralis infection has been considered a cofactor of leukemogenesis. Hypereosinophilia (HE) is also observed and could be associated with either the presence of parasites or the leukemic process. In non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, eosinophilia may or may not affect prognosis. To determine whether infection with S stercoralis and therefore eosinophilia has a significant effect on the development of ATL, we studied two variables in 38 patients: age at onset and median survival rate. Infected (Ss+) patients (n = 19) were younger (P = .0002) and survived longer (P = .0006) than uninfected (Ss-) patients (n = 19) (median age, 39 vs 70 years; median survival, 167 vs 30 days). Mean survival of patients with hypereosinophilia (HE+) was not significantly different from that of patients without hypereosinophilia (HE-) (P = .57). However, overall survival was longer for Ss + HE + patients than for Ss-HE-patients (P = .01; 180 vs 30 days) or Ss-HE + patients (P = .03; 180 vs 45 days). Among patients with mean survival more than 180 days, Ss + HE + patients survived longer (P = .028). Our data confirm that cofactors related to the environment, such as S stercoralis and hypereosinophilia associated with S stercoralis or human T-cell leukemia virus, type 1 (HTLV-1) might be important in HTLV-1-associated leukemogenesis and suggest that hypereosinophilia affects the prognosis of HTLV-1-associated leukemia.","['Plumelle, Y', 'Gonin, C', 'Edouard, A', 'Bucher, B J', 'Thomas, L', 'Brebion, A', 'Panelatti, G']","['Plumelle Y', 'Gonin C', 'Edouard A', 'Bucher BJ', 'Thomas L', 'Brebion A', 'Panelatti G']","['Department of Hematobiology, University Hospital, Martinique, French West Indies.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Eosinophilia/mortality/*parasitology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/mortality/*parasitology', 'Male', 'Martinique/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', '*Strongyloides stercoralis', 'Strongyloidiasis/*etiology/mortality', 'Survival Rate']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/107.1.81 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1997 Jan;107(1):81-7. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/107.1.81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All had AML with maturation (FAB M2) and were myeloperoxidase positive. Immunologic studies showed all to be HLA-DR positive but negative for the CD13, CD14, and CD33 antigens. Two of four were CD34 antigen positive. Cytogenetic studies were performed in three patients, and all demonstrated t(8;21)(q22;q22). In studies using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in two patients, including the patient in whom karytypic analysis was not performed, the AML1-ETO fusion product of t(8;21) was identified.

This suggests that its etiologic agent may be absent or extremely rare on the North American continent. All three species of B. burgdorferi sensu lato known to be associated with human Lyme borreliosis (B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, and B. afzelii have been isolated in Europe, whereas only B. burgdorferi sensu stricto has been found in North America. This suggests that either B. garinii or B. afzelii might be the etiologic agent of borrelial lymphocytoma. To investigate this hypothesis we characterized five strains of B. burgdorferi sensu lato isolated from lymphocytoma lesions of patients residing in Slovenia. The methods used included: large restriction fragment pattern analysis of restriction enzyme MluI-digested genomic DNA, plasmid profiling, protein profiling, ribotyping using 5S, 16S, and 23S rDNA probes, and polymerase chain reaction amplification of the rrf (5S)-rrl (23S) intergenic spacer region. Molecular subtyping showed that four of the five isolates belonged to the species B. afzelii; however, this species is the predominant patient isolate in Slovenia and, therefore, may not represent a preferential association with lymphocytoma. The fifth isolate appeared to be most closely related to the DN127 genomic group of organisms. Further characterization of the isolate revealed that it possessed a unique molecular ""fingerprint."" The results not only show that borrelial lymphocytoma can be caused by B. afzelii but also demonstrate an association with another genomic group of B. burgdorferi sensu lato that is present in North America as well.","['Picken, R N', 'Strle, F', 'Ruzic-Sabljic, E', 'Maraspin, V', 'Lotric-Furlan, S', 'Cimperman, J', 'Cheng, Y', 'Picken, M M']","['Picken RN', 'Strle F', 'Ruzic-Sabljic E', 'Maraspin V', 'Lotric-Furlan S', 'Cimperman J', 'Cheng Y', 'Picken MM']","[""Section of Infectious Disease, Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Bacterial Vaccines)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (OspA protein)', '368GB5141J (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins/analysis', 'Bacterial Vaccines', 'Biopsy', 'Borrelia burgdorferi Group/*genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'DNA Primers/analysis', 'DNA, Bacterial/analysis', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*microbiology', '*Lipoproteins', 'Lyme Disease', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Skin/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*microbiology', 'Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-202X(15)42785-X [pii]', '10.1111/1523-1747.ep12285646 [doi]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 1997 Jan;108(1):92-7. doi: 10.1111/1523-1747.ep12285646.,,['AR 41517/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To our knowledge, this is the first case with CNL who showed deletion of the long arm of chromosome 20 before treatment was started.","['Matano, S', 'Nakamura, S', 'Kobayashi, K', 'Yoshida, T', 'Matsuda, T', 'Sugimoto, T']","['Matano S', 'Nakamura S', 'Kobayashi K', 'Yoshida T', 'Matsuda T', 'Sugimoto T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Tonami General Hospital, Toyama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*pathology', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/*genetics']",1997/01/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199701)54:1<72::AID-AJH11>3.0.CO;2-C [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199701)54:1<72::aid-ajh11>3.0.co;2-c [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1997 Jan;54(1):72-5. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199701)54:1<72::aid-ajh11>3.0.co;2-c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These observations have in recent years been supported by laboratory results indicating the presence of CML-specific T cells in the lymphocyte repertoire of both normal healthy individuals and disease-bearing patients. Both MHC-unrestricted and MHC-restricted immune effector mechanisms are involved. Donor lymphocyte infusion has produced encouraging GvL effects. However, future adoptive immunotherapy may depend on the isolation and generation of leukemia-specific T cells. Although many proteins may potentially act as leukemia antigens in CML for MHC-restricted cytotoxicity, the bcr-abl fusion protein has been most extensively investigated. There is now much evidence to suggest that the bcr-abl junctional peptides are capable of eliciting both CD4 and CD8 responses in normal healthy donors and CML patients. Furthermore, the T-cell lines generated react with autologous or HLA-matched fresh CML cells, suggesting that the bcr-abl fusion protein can be processed in vivo so that the joining segment is bound to HLA molecules in a configuration and concentration similar to those of the immunizing peptide for antigen recognition by the antigen-specific T-cell receptor. These results also indicate that the bcr-abl junctional peptides may be used for immunotherapy of CML. Other strategies available for immunotherapy of CML include immunologically or genetically manipulated donor T-cell infusion, the use of cytokines, adoptive immunotherapy with leukemia-reactive T-cells expanded ex vivo, and immune gene therapy. Novel and rational immunotherapy may therefore play an important adjuvant role in future in the management of patients with CML.","['Lim, S H', 'Coleman, S']","['Lim SH', 'Coleman S']","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/therapy', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1997/01/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199701)54:1<61::AID-AJH9>3.0.CO;2-2 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199701)54:1<61::aid-ajh9>3.0.co;2-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1997 Jan;54(1):61-7. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199701)54:1<61::aid-ajh9>3.0.co;2-2.,,,,49,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Earlier studies have shown that a general genomic under-methylation is associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and metastatic prostate cancer. Site-specific methylation changes, as revealed by the use of methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, have been reported to occur in the promotor region of the calcitonin gene in chronic myeloid leukemia as it progresses from the chronic phase to blast crisis, in non-Hodgkin's lymphoid neoplasms and in non-lymphocytic leukemia. We have now explored possible methylation changes associated with benign and malignant breast tumors. Two approaches were employed: (i) chemical determination of general genomic methylation status and (ii) base-specific analysis of the methylation changes in the promoter of the calcitonin gene with the aid of genomic sequencing. The results did not reveal any changes of total DNA 5-methylcytosine content in ductal carcinoma of breast in comparison with benign tumors. There was a small, yet significant, increase in 5-methylcytosine content in lobular carcinoma. Genomic sequencing of the promoter region of the calcitonin gene, however, revealed a striking hypermethylation at or around the transcription start site of the gene in ductal carcinomas. In benign tumors and lobular carcinomas, this region was either entirely unmethylated or only slightly methylated. The latter changes may reflect a regional hypermethylation of the short arm of chromosome 11, which harbors, in addition to the calcitonin gene, a number of putative or established tumor-suppressor genes. Our results demonstrate that genomic sequencing in its present form can be used for a reliable and precise DNA methylation analysis of primary human tumors.","['Hakkarainen, M', 'Wahlfors, J', 'Myohanen, S', 'Hiltunen, M O', 'Eskelinen, M', 'Johansson, R', 'Janne, J']","['Hakkarainen M', 'Wahlfors J', 'Myohanen S', 'Hiltunen MO', 'Eskelinen M', 'Johansson R', 'Janne J']","['A.I.

Methotrexate tightly binds to dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), blocking the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolic acid, the active form of folic acid. Methotrexate also directly inhibits the folate-dependent enzymes of de novo purine and thymidylate synthesis. Resistance to methotrexate may develop as a result of elevated DHFR activity or defective transport of methotrexate into malignant cells. Increased DHFR enzyme levels may also result from amplification of the DHFR gene, which is now clinically significant in selected patients. Methotrexate is an active drug in the first-line treatment of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) and in metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. Since the introduction of methotrexate chemotherapy for malignant GTD, most hospitals have reported almost 100% cure rates for patients with nonmetastatic disease using single-agent regimens. Patients with low-risk metastatic disease have been treated with methotrexate and folinic acid and over 50% complete remission rates have been reported. Patients with metastatic GTD who had one or more high-risk factors benefited from initial multiagent chemotherapy, rather than waiting for acquisition of drug-resistance to single-agent therapy to start multiagent treatment. Using multiagent combination chemotherapy such as MAC (methotrexate, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide) or EMA-CO (etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin D and cyclophosphamide, vincristine), most investigators have reported remission in approximately 60 to 80% of patients with high-risk metastatic GTD. Although the role of chemotherapy in carcinoma of the cervix has been limited for several reasons, trial of combination chemotherapy including methotrexate has been reported.

To examine the important receptor domains and signal transduction pathways involved in these cellular responses, c-Mpl cytoplasmic domain truncation and tyrosine substitution mutants were generated. In the myelomonocytic leukaemia cell lines WEHI3B-D+ and M1, ectopic expression of the wild-type c-Mpl receptor induced TPO-dependent cellular differentiation characterized by increased cell migration through agar and acquisition of the morphology and molecular markers of macrophages. Consistent with the concept that proliferative and differentiation signals emanate from distinct receptor domains, the C-terminal 33 amino acids of c-Mpl were dispensable for a proliferative response in Ba/F3 cells but proved critical for WEHI3B-D+ and M1 differentiation. Finer mapping revealed that substitution of Tyr599 by phenylalanine within this c-Mpl domain was sufficient to abolish the normal differentiation response. Moreover, in contrast to the normal c-Mpl receptor, this same mplY599F mutant was also incapable of stimulating TPO-dependent Shc phosphorylation, the association of Shc with Grb2 or c-Mpl and of inducing c-fos expression. Thus activation of components of the Ras signalling cascade, initiated by interaction of Shc with c-Mpl Tyr599, may play a decisive role in specific differentiation signals emanating from the c-Mpl receptor.","['Alexander, W S', 'Maurer, A B', 'Novak, U', 'Harrison-Smith, M']","['Alexander WS', 'Maurer AB', 'Novak U', 'Harrison-Smith M']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Phenylalanine', 'Phosphorylation', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*physiology', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thrombopoietin/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tyrosine']",1996/12/02 00:00,1996/12/02 00:01,['1996/12/02 00:00'],"['1996/12/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/02 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/02 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1996 Dec 2;15(23):6531-40.,,,PMC452478,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The physiologically active form of vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25D3), is formed by successive hydroxylations of cholecalciferol at the 25 and 1 alpha positions. In this study we examined the effects of the absence of the 1 alpha (OH) group, introduction of a double bond in position 16, and further modifications at the 23, 26, and 27 positions in the side chain on the potency of the VDAs. The parameters studied were the rapidity of the induction of monocytic differentiation, the cell cycle traverse, and the effects of VDAs on intracellular calcium homeostasis in HL60 cells. The results show that (1) 1,25D3 derivatives which lace the 1 alpha (OH) group have little differentiation-inducing activity, (2) hexafluorination (6F) of the terminal methyl groups in the side chain partially restores the activity of 1 alpha-desoxy compounds and potentiates the activity of 1 alpha hydroxylated compounds, and (3) 25-(OH)-16,23E-diene-26,27-hexafluoro-vitamin D2 (Ro25-9887) alone among the twelve compounds tested induces differentiation with only minimal changes in the basal levels of intracellular calcium and store-dependent calcium influx in HL60 cells. Addition of 1 alpha (OH) group to this compound increases its differentiation-inducing activity but also elevates basal calcium level. The results suggest that altered calcium homeostasis is not an obligatory component of HL60 leukemia cell differentiation, and that Ro25-9887 and related VDAs may be suitable for testing as components of anti-leukemic therapy.","['Gardner, J P', 'Zhang, F', 'Uskokovic, M R', 'Studzinski, G P']","['Gardner JP', 'Zhang F', 'Uskokovic MR', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pediatrics, UMD-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['CD11 Antigens/metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cholecalciferol/*analogs & derivatives', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Ethanol/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Manganese/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', '*Molecular Structure', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology']",1996/12/15 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/12/15 00:00'],"['1996/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4644(19961215)63:4<500::AID-JCB11>3.0.CO;2-H [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4644(19961215)63:4%3C500::AID-JCB11%3E3.0.CO;2-H [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1996 Dec 15;63(4):500-12. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4644(19961215)63:4%3C500::AID-JCB11%3E3.0.CO;2-H.,,['R01-CA-44722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Groupe D'etude des Lymphomes Digestifs.,7-16,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Multiple lymphomatous polyposis (MLP) is an uncommon type of gastrointestinal lymphoma. The aim of this study was to analyze the clinicopathologic features and outcome of a large series of patients. METHODS: From 1984 to 1995, 31 patients were enrolled prospectively. Exhaustive staging and immunohistochemical analysis were performed. The first 10 patients were treated with cyclophosphamide-vincristine-prednisolone (COP) and the subsequent 21 with doxorubicin-teniposide-cyclophosphamide-prednisolone (AVmCP). Eleven patients were treated with high-dose radiochemotherapy and stem cell autotransplantation because of partial response or relapse. RESULTS: Advanced age and multiple polyps involving several gastrointestinal segments characterized initial clinical presentation. The typical tumor cell phenotype (pan-B+, CD5+, and CD10-) along with Bcl-1 rearrangement indicated that MLP is the gastrointestinal counterpart of mantle cell lymphoma. After COP treatment, only 3 patients achieved partial remissions, whereas 80% of patients after AVmCP treatment achieved complete or good partial remission. High-dose radiochemotherapy changed partial into complete remission in 80% of cases. None of the initial 10 patients survived for 3 years, but the expected 5-year survival rate was 59% in patients receiving the anthracycline-containing regimen (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: MLP is a distinct entity among gastrointestinal lymphomas. An anthracycline-containing multidrug regimen and high-dose radiochemotherapy supported by autotransplantation seem to improve its poor prognosis.","['Ruskone-Fourmestraux, A', 'Delmer, A', 'Lavergne, A', 'Molina, T', 'Brousse, N', 'Audouin, J', 'Rambaud, J C']","['Ruskone-Fourmestraux A', 'Delmer A', 'Lavergne A', 'Molina T', 'Brousse N', 'Audouin J', 'Rambaud JC']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Hotel-Dieu, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,0374630,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'COP protocol 1', 'VAP-cyclo protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Methylprednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Polyps/drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Prospective Studies', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0016508597000139 [pii]', '10.1016/s0016-5085(97)70212-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Gastroenterology. 1997 Jan;112(1):7-16. doi: 10.1016/s0016-5085(97)70212-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have mapped the site of interaction of CRKL and BCR-ABL to the amino terminal SH3 domain of CRKL with a proline rich region in the C-terminus of ABL. The proline-rich region was mutated and the effect of this deletion on BCR-ABL transforming function was assayed. Our data show that this deletion does not impair the ability of BCR-ABL to render myeloid cells factor independent for growth. In cells expressing the proline deletion mutation of BCR-ABL, CRKL is still tyrosine phosphorylated and forms a complex with BCR-ABL as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation. Our data suggest that the interaction between CRKL and the proline deletion mutant of BCR-ABL is an indirect interaction as CRKL does not interact directly with the proline deletion mutant of BCR-ABL in a gel overlay assay or in a yeast two-hybrid assay.

We describe a pair of identical twins who were diagnosed with a T-cell malignancy at 9 and 11 years of age, one with T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and the other with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Leukemic cells from the twins shared the same TCR beta gene rearrangement with an identical 11 bp N region. The most plausible interpretation of this result is that these malignancies were initiated in one twin fetus in utero, in a single T-lineage cell that had stable bi-allelic TCR beta rearrangements. Progeny of this cell then spread to the other twin before birth via shared placental vasculature. This was then followed by a 9- and 11-year preleukemic latent period before clinical disease manifestation as leukemia or lymphoma.

These cases did not meet the current criteria for inclusion in LDGL, since all patients had less than 2,000 GL/microL. However, in each of these patients, we found evidence for expansion of a discrete GL population. Clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) beta gene was found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of all nine patients with CD3+ LDGL. Using recently generated monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against the TCR V beta gene regions, we identified a unique TCR V beta on GL from each of three patients studied. In two patients with CD3- LDGL, we also identified a restricted pattern of reactivity, by staining with MoAbs against p58 antigen found on normal natural killer (NK) cells. The clinical features of these 11 patients with relatively low absolute number of GL were similar to those reported previously for patients with greater than 2,000 GL/microL. These data demonstrate that newer techniques such as MoAbs against V beta gene regions and p58 molecules and molecular analyses are useful to identify expansions of discrete GL proliferations. Demonstration of an expansion of a restricted GL subset is evidence for the diagnosis of LDGL, even in patients with a relatively low GL count. Our results also contribute to distinguish between the end of normality and the beginning of pathology in the broad spectrum of GL lymphocytoses.","['Semenzato, G', 'Zambello, R', 'Starkebaum, G', 'Oshimi, K', 'Loughran, T P Jr']","['Semenzato G', 'Zambello R', 'Starkebaum G', 'Oshimi K', 'Loughran TP Jr']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Padua University School of Medicine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/immunology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/blood/classification/*diagnosis/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76804-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jan 1;89(1):256-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consistent low levels of spontaneous apoptosis were observed in myeloid cells from normal bone marrow samples, while untreated cells collected from 56 de novo AML patients showed variable apoptosis. Control myeloid cells showed increased apoptosis after in vitro treatments with daunomycin (DNR), cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C), or gamma irradiation (RAD). Most AML samples showed less treatment-associated apoptosis, suggesting that apoptosis responses to therapeutic agents may be frequently attenuated in AML. Certain cytogenetic abnormalities common in AML may affect apoptosis, as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) samples with t(15;17) karyotypes showed consistently low levels of spontaneous and treatment-associated apoptosis. Apoptosis assays may provide unique functional subtyping of AMLs, as other common cytogenetic subsets showed variable apoptosis. Altered function of two well-characterized regulators of apoptosis, BCL-2 and p53, was not entirely responsible for this variability. A genomic p53 mutation was found in only one AML sample. All samples that demonstrated the highest BCL-2-positive cell fractions showed low apoptosis, but reduced apoptosis was seen in both the presence and absence of BCL-2 overexpression. Finally, data from matched diagnosis and relapse sample pairs suggest that neither further reduced apoptosis nor additional BCL-2 overexpression is necessarily associated with disease progression.","['Banker, D E', 'Groudine, M', 'Norwood, T', 'Appelbaum, F R']","['Banker DE', 'Groudine M', 'Norwood T', 'Appelbaum FR']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Disease Progression', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genes, p53', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/radiation effects']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76803-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jan 1;89(1):243-55.,,"['CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18105/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0-1CA58954/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Congenital deficiency of TCII results in intracellular Cbl deficiency, one effect of which is to disrupt DNA synthesis, leading to megaloblastic anemia. We report here an in vitro culture system in which cell growth is dependent on delivery of Cbl to cells by TCII. Recombinant human holo-TCII was shown to support in dose-dependent manner the growth of the human erythroleukemic cell line K562 and the murine lymphoma cell line BW5147. Free Cbl also supported cell growth; however, at 100- to 1,000-fold higher concentrations than those effective in the presence of apo-TCII. To determine if cellular depletion of Cbl could be achieved by interfering with interactions between TCII/Cbl and its cell-surface receptor, several monoclonal antibodies raised against human TCII were studied. Three antibodies, found to compete for the same binding site on TCII, proved to be effective inhibitors of TCII/Cbl-dependent cell growth. Our results suggest that monoclonal anti-TCII antibodies that block the function of this protein may prove useful in antitumor therapies.","['McLean, G R', 'Quadros, E V', 'Rothenberg, S P', 'Morgan, A C', 'Schrader, J W', 'Ziltener, H J']","['McLean GR', 'Quadros EV', 'Rothenberg SP', 'Morgan AC', 'Schrader JW', 'Ziltener HJ']","['Biomedical Research Centre, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcobalamins)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Folic Acid/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Lymphoma/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Transcobalamins/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin B 12/pharmacology/physiology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76802-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jan 1;89(1):235-42.,,['R01-DK28561-14/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present studies, we characterized signaling during Fas-induced apoptosis in RPMI-8226 and IM-9 multiple myeloma (MM) derived cell lines as well as patient plasma cell leukemia cells. Treatment with anti-Fas (7C11) monoclonal antibody (MoAb) induced apoptosis, evidenced by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and propidium iodide staining, and was associated with increased expression of c-jun early response gene. We also show that anti-Fas MoAb treatment is associated with activation of stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); however, no detectable increase in extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1 and ERK2) activity was observed. Because interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a growth factor for MM cells and inhibits apoptosis induced by dexamethasone and serum starvation, we examined whether IL-6 affects anti-Fas MoAb-induced apoptosis and activation of SAPK or p38 MAPK in MM cells. Culture of MM cells with IL-6 before treatment with anti-Fas MoAb significantly reduced both DNA fragmentation and activation of SAPK, without altering induction of p38 MAPK activity. These results therefore suggest that anti-Fas MoAb-induced apoptosis in MM cells is associated with activation of SAPK, and that IL-6 may both inhibit apoptosis and modulate SAPK activity.","['Chauhan, D', 'Kharbanda, S', 'Ogata, A', 'Urashima, M', 'Teoh, G', 'Robertson, M', 'Kufe, D W', 'Anderson, K C']","['Chauhan D', 'Kharbanda S', 'Ogata A', 'Urashima M', 'Teoh G', 'Robertson M', 'Kufe DW', 'Anderson KC']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Multiple Myeloma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/immunology/*physiology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76801-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jan 1;89(1):227-34.,,['CA 50947/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a genetically inactivated form of HSV that is restricted to a single cycle of replication (disabled single-cycle virus, [DISC-HSV]), we have transduced normal human hematopoietic progenitor cells and primary leukemia blasts with efficiencies ranging from 80% to 100%, in the absence of growth factors or stromal support. Toxicity was low, with 70% to 100% of cells surviving the transduction process. Peak expression of transferred genes occurred at 24 to 48 hours after transduction with the DISC-HSV vector, declining to near background levels by 14 days. Despite this limitation, sufficient protein is produced by the inserted gene to permit consideration of the vector for applications in which transient expression is adequate. One example is the transfer of immunostimulatory genes, to generate leukemia immunogens. Thus, murine A20 leukemia cells transduced with a DISC-HSV vector encoding granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were able to stimulate a potent antitumor response in mice, even against pre-existing leukemia. The exceptional transducing ability of the DISC-HSV vector should therefore facilitate genetic manipulation of normal and malignant human hematopoietic cells for biological and clinical investigation.","['Dilloo, D', 'Rill, D', 'Entwistle, C', 'Boursnell, M', 'Zhong, W', 'Holden, W', 'Holladay, M', 'Inglis, S', 'Brenner, M']","['Dilloo D', 'Rill D', 'Entwistle C', 'Boursnell M', 'Zhong W', 'Holden W', 'Holladay M', 'Inglis S', 'Brenner M']","[""Cell and Gene Therapy Program, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Simplexvirus/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76789-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jan 1;89(1):119-27.,,"['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies established the existence of a sphingomyelin (SM) cycle that operates in response to the action of IFN-gamma on HL-60 cells, but the mechanisms by which IFN-gamma induces the SM hydrolysis remain unexplored. In this study, biochemical events mediating IFN-gamma effects on SM turnover and their specificity and role in HL-60 differentiation were investigated. The activation of the SM cycle by IFN-gamma occurred rapidly, with a decrease of approximately 20% in the SM level observed after 60 minutes with a concomitant increase in ceramide level. Treatment of HL-60 cells with IFN-gamma did not influence the 1,2-diacylglycerol concentration, intracellular Ca2+ concentration, or phospholipase D activity. IFN-gamma stimulated a rapid release of arachidonic acid (AA) from HL-60 cells; the effect was abolished by the pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin, suggesting a role for a pertussis-toxin-sensitive G protein in IFN-gamma-mediated activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2). At 4 to 120 hours after the stimulation of the cells with IFN-gamma, a significant increase in the particulate and soluble PLA2 activity was observed, corresponding to an increase in the level of immunoreactive cPLA2 in both cytosol and membrane fractions. The treatment of cells with tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A completely abolished the effect of IFN-gamma on PLA2 activity in membrane and cytosolic fractions, but had no effect on IFN-gamma-mediated early AA release suggesting dual mechanism of PLA2 activation. Melittin, potent activator of PLA2, and AA mimicked the effect of IFN-gamma on SM hydrolysis. Pretreatment of HL-60 cells with the PLA2 inhibitor, bromophenacyl bromide (BPB), or pertussis toxin abolished the effect of IFN-gamma on SM hydrolysis; exogenous addition of AA overcame the effects of BPB and pertussis toxin. Long-term exposure (5 days) of HL-60 cells to IFN-gamma caused an increase in nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)-reducing and nonspecific esterase (NSE) activity and induced expression of Fc gamma RI (CD64) without significant effects on cell number, adherence, or phagocytic activity. The treatment of cells with AA or melittin induced NBT, NSE, and CD64 expression to the level similar to that observed with IFN-gamma, and no further increase was observed with the combination of IFN-gamma and AA or IFN-gamma and melittin. Treatment of HL-60 cells with indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase, and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), an inhibitor of lipoxygenase, had no effects on IFN-gamma-mediated induction of CD64 expression. These studies indicate a key role for the phospholipase A2/AA pathway, as an early biochemical signal elicited by the occupation of IFN-gamma-receptor, in mediating IFN-gamma induction of the SM cycle and phenotypic changes associated with differentiation of HL-60 along monocytic lineage.","['Visnjic, D', 'Batinic, D', 'Banfic, H']","['Visnjic D', 'Batinic D', 'Banfic H']","['Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, Croatia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '07MXG07O12 (interferon gamma receptor)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '20449-79-0 (Melitten)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', '7BO8G1BYQU (Masoprocol)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/drug effects/physiology', 'Arachidonic Acid/*physiology', 'Benzoquinones', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Ceramides/metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Diglycerides/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Masoprocol/pharmacology', 'Melitten/pharmacology', 'Membrane Lipids/*metabolism', '*Monocytes', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Phospholipase D/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Quinones/pharmacology', 'Receptors, IgG/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interferon/drug effects/physiology', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Sphingomyelins/*metabolism', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76785-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jan 1;89(1):81-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neither stem cell population responds to single cytokines in vitro and each requires the synergistic action of two or more cytokines for proliferation, whereas the progenitor cell population proliferates in response to single cytokines. Since each of these cell populations was sorted as c-kit+, they express receptors for stem cell factor. Cell populations were also analyzed by autoradiography for their ability to specifically bind iodinated cytokines and this revealed that both stem cell populations expressed receptors for interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-3, IL-6, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), but lacked receptors for macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Cells within the progenitor cell population specifically bound IL-3, GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-6, and IL-1 alpha, whereas no receptors were detected for M-CSF and LIF. Within each cell population examined, heterogeneity was observed in the percentage of cells labeled and the number of receptors per cell.

Based on this data set, numbers of inhabitants and expected number of cancer cases by sex and age in squares of 500 x 500 m were calculated for all of Finland. Observed number of cancer cases in each square were obtained based on record linkage of the map coordinates with the Finnish Cancer Registry. The ratio of observed and expected number of cancer cases was modeled using Poisson regression. The example analysis included all 23 leukemia and 531 any cancer cases registered in an area around an oil refinery in 1983-1986. There was no significant association between distance from the oil refinery and risk of leukemia or any cancer. The method proved fast and efficient in comparing areal differences in cancer incidence in Finland.

In light of this, we examined whether recombinant adenovirus vectors could transfer genes into neoplastic cells of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a leukemia of ""resting"" B cells. Using high-titer recombinant adenovirus vectors, we found we could transfer genes encoding beta-galactosidase or murine CD80 (B7-1) into the CLL B cells of all patients tested (n = 10). The efficiency of gene transduction into CLL B cells was approximately 100 to 1,000-fold lower than into HeLa cells at any given multiplicity of infection (MOI). At a MOI of 500, 10% to 70% of the CLL B cells from different patients were made to express the transgene, as assessed by multiparameter flow cytometric analysis. Sustained levels of expression with little loss in the percentage of infected cells were maintained for up to 9 days, at which point the analysis was stopped. We found that CLL B cells have markedly lower expression levels of integrins that facilitate internalization of adenovirus particles into target cells, perhaps accounting, in part, for the reduced efficiency of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer compared with that in HeLa cells. Although HeLa cells express high levels of alpha(v)beta5, and detectable amounts of alpha(v)beta3, we find CLL cells from all patients tested express only low amounts of alpha(v)beta3, and no detectable alpha(v)beta5. Activation of CLL cells via CD40 cross-linking enhances expression of alpha(v)beta3, and induces expression of alpha(v)beta5. This phenotypic change is associated with a fivefold increase in the efficiency of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer into such activated CLL B cells. This study demonstrates that adenovirus vectors can transduce genes into CLL B cells and that the efficiency of gene transduction is enhanced by activation via CD40 cross-linking. This is the first demonstration that high proportions of CLL B cells can be made to express a selected transgene, suggesting that such gene transfer methods may become useful for the study of the pathogenesis and/or treatment of this disease.","['Cantwell, M J', 'Sharma, S', 'Friedmann, T', 'Kipps, T J']","['Cantwell MJ', 'Sharma S', 'Friedmann T', 'Kipps TJ']","['UCSD Human Gene Therapy Program, UCSD School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093-0663, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Integrins)']",IM,"['*Adenoviridae/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Integrins/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*virology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Transgenes/genetics']",1996/12/15 00:00,1996/12/15 00:01,['1996/12/15 00:00'],"['1996/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65029-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Dec 15;88(12):4676-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunotherapy with monoclonal or bispecific antibodies (bsAb) is a promising approach to improve this situation, but is hampered by the absence of tumor-specific antigens on the majority of tumors. To evade this problem, we developed a new tumor-specific approach in which bispecific antibodies exploit chimerism after allogeneic BMT by redirecting donor T cells against recipient-specific antigens on tumor cells. Two different leukemia relapse models were established using a T-cell lymphoma (ST-1) and a B-cell lymphoma (BCL1) to evaluate the efficiency of such a therapy. In these experiments, irradiated BALB/c (Thy-1.2+, I-Ad) mice were transplanted with C57BL/6 Thy-1.1 (I-Ab) BM cells under the protection of graft-versus-host disease-preventing monoclonal antibodies. Forty-five days after BMT, the chimeric mice were injected with either 2 x 10(4) recipient-type, Thy-1.2+, CD3- ST-1 cells or major histocompatability complex (MHC) class II+ (I-Ad)-BCL1 cells. Four days later, the mice were treated with 8 microg bsAb G2 (anti-CD3 x anti-Thy-1.2) or 10 microg (+10 microg, day 6) bsAb BiC (anti-CD3 x anti-I-Ad), respectively. These combinations guaranteed exclusive binding of the bsAbs target arms to tumor cells, leaving the surrounding, donor-type hematopoietic cells unbound. Compared with the parental antibodies, the bsAbs markedly reduced tumor mortality. Between 34% and 83% of mice survived in the bsAb groups compared with 0% of the control groups treated with parental antibodies, clearly documenting the benefit of the redirection principle. Furthermore, cytokine release (interleukin-6) after anti-CD3 antibody or bsAb treatment was decreased by administering a low-dose antibody preinjection. We have shown (1) that 6 weeks after BMT, when donor T-cell reconstitution is still in progress, T-cell-redirecting bsAb are clearly superior to parental antibodies in terms of tumor cell elimination; and (2) that the polymorphism of a common antigen such as Thy-1 or a clinically more relevant target antigen such as MHC class II can be used as an operational tumor-specific antigen after allogeneic BMT.","['Lindhofer, H', 'Menzel, H', 'Gunther, W', 'Hultner, L', 'Thierfelder, S']","['Lindhofer H', 'Menzel H', 'Gunther W', 'Hultner L', 'Thierfelder S']","['Forschungszentrum fur Umwelt und Gesundheit (GSF)-Institut fur Immunologie, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/adverse effects/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/transplantation', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Diarrhea/etiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Thymoma/therapy', 'Thymus Neoplasms/therapy', 'Weight Loss/immunology']",1996/12/15 00:00,1996/12/15 00:01,['1996/12/15 00:00'],"['1996/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65026-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Dec 15;88(12):4651-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because FA cells are hypersensitive to DNA cross-linking agents and have chromosomal instability, FA has been viewed as a disorder of DNA repair. However, the exact cellular defect in FA cells has not been identified. Sequence analysis of the gene defective in group C patients (FAC) has shown no significant homologies to other known genes. The FAC protein has been localized to the cytoplasm, indicating that FAC may either play an indirect role in DNA repair or is involved in a different cellular pathway. Recent evidence has indicated that FA cells may be predisposed to apoptosis, especially after treatment with DNA cross-linking agents. The demonstration that genes can suppress apoptosis has been accomplished by overexpression of such genes in growth factor-dependent cell lines that die by apoptosis after factor withdrawal. Using retroviral-mediated gene transfer, we present evidence that expression of FAC in the hematopoietic factor-dependent progenitor cell lines 32D and MO7e can suppress apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal. Flow cytometry and morphologic analysis of propidium iodide stained cells showed significantly lower levels of apoptosis in FAC-retroviral transduced cells after growth factor deprivation. Expression of FAC in both cell lines promoted increased viability rather than proliferation, which is consistent with other apoptosis-inhibiting genes such as Bcl-2. These findings imply that FAC may act as a mediator of an apoptotic pathway initiated by growth factor withdrawal. Furthermore, the congenital malformations and hematologic abnormalities characterizing FA may be related to an increased predisposition of FA progenitor cells to undergo apoptosis, particularly in the absence of extracellular signals.","['Cumming, R C', 'Liu, J M', 'Youssoufian, H', 'Buchwald, M']","['Cumming RC', 'Liu JM', 'Youssoufian H', 'Buchwald M']","['Department of Genetics, Research Institute, The Hospital For Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (FANCC protein, human)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/12/15 00:00,1996/12/15 00:01,['1996/12/15 00:00'],"['1996/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)65015-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Dec 15;88(12):4558-67.,,['HL52138/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To gain insight into the physiological role of flt3L in early hematopoiesis, levels of flt3L were determined in serum of patients with multilineage bone marrow failure and related to the severity of stem cell depletion. In patients with aplastic anemia (AA) and in cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced transient suppression of hematopoiesis, flt3L fluctuated in an inverse relationship to the degree of bone marrow failure. In severe AA at diagnosis, levels of circulating soluble flt3L were highly elevated (2,653 +/- 353 pg/mL) as compared with normal blood serum values of 14 +/- 39 pg/mL. Flt3L returned to near normal levels within the first 3 months following successful bone marrow transplantation and in autologous remission induced by immunosuppressive therapy with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG; 100 +/- 31 and 183 +/- 14 pg/mL, respectively). In contrast, rejection of the graft or relapse of the disease after ALG was accompanied by an increase to high pretreatment concentrations of the circulating cytokine (3,770 +/- 2,485 and 1,788 +/- 233 pg/mL, respectively). Flt3L in serum inversely correlated with the colony-forming ability of AA bone marrow precursors in vitro (R = -.86), indicating that the concentration of the ligand reflects hematopoiesis at the progenitor cell level. Flt3L increased to 2,500 pg/mL in the serum of leukemia patients during chemoradiotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression and returned to normal values along with hematopoietic recovery. Expression of the membrane-bound form of flt3L was significantly elevated in mononuclear bone marrow and peripheral blood cells from patients with severe pancytopenia, suggesting de novo synthesis of the factor in response to bone marrow failure. The data provide a strong argument for the involvement of flt3L in the regulation of early hematopoiesis in vivo.","['Wodnar-Filipowicz, A', 'Lyman, S D', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Tichelli, A', 'Speck, B', 'Nissen, C']","['Wodnar-Filipowicz A', 'Lyman SD', 'Gratwohl A', 'Tichelli A', 'Speck B', 'Nissen C']","['Department of Research and Division of Hematology, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/blood/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Bone Marrow/*abnormalities', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/chemically induced', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/blood/*metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/blood/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",1996/12/15 00:00,1996/12/15 00:01,['1996/12/15 00:00'],"['1996/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood. 1996 Dec 15;88(12):4493-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this restriction needs to be re-evaluated in light of findings that the repertoire of Ig VH genes used by primary B cells of normal adults is actually more restricted than originally assumed. Because of this, we critically examined the Ig VH1 and VH7 genes expressed by leukemia cells of a random panel of patients with B cell CLL (n = 117). Forty-one (35%) had leukemia cells with functional VH1 gene rearrangements. Of these, the large majority expressed Ig VH1-69 (n = 26; 63%). The remaining leukemia cell samples expressed VH1-2 (n = 4; 10%), VH1-3 (n = 2; 5%), VH1-8 (n = 2; 5%), VH1-18 (n = 1; 2%), VH1-45 (n = 1; 2%), and VH1-46 (n = 5; 12%). Only 1 of the 117 examined (<1%) used Ig VH genes of the VH7 subgroup. We found that certain alleles of the IgVH1-69 locus are favored in CLL. Also, leukemia B cells that express VH1-69 have a distinctive use distribution of D and JH gene segments compared with that of VH1-expressing CLL B cells that do not use VH1-69 or non-neoplastic B cells that express VH1-69. Finally, the average length of the heavy chain third complementarity-determining regions (CDR3) of VH1-69-expressing leukemia cells is significantly longer than that of normal adult B cells that also express Ig encoded by VH1-69 genes. Collectively, this study indicates that the Ig expressed in CLL have distinctive molecular features that are not representative of the Ig expressed by primary B cells of normal adults.","['Johnson, T A', 'Rassenti, L Z', 'Kipps, T J']","['Johnson TA', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Kipps TJ']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1997 Jan 1;158(1):235-46.,"['GENBANK/U84156', 'GENBANK/U84157', 'GENBANK/U84158', 'GENBANK/U84159', 'GENBANK/U84160', 'GENBANK/U84161', 'GENBANK/U84162', 'GENBANK/U84163', 'GENBANK/U84164', 'GENBANK/U84165', 'GENBANK/U84166', 'GENBANK/U84167', 'GENBANK/U84168', 'GENBANK/U84169', 'GENBANK/U84170', 'GENBANK/U84171', 'GENBANK/U84172', 'GENBANK/U84173', 'GENBANK/U84174', 'GENBANK/U84175', 'GENBANK/U84176', 'GENBANK/U84177', 'GENBANK/U84178', 'GENBANK/U84179', 'GENBANK/U84180', 'GENBANK/U84181', 'GENBANK/U84182', 'GENBANK/U84183', 'GENBANK/U84184', 'GENBANK/U84185']",['R37-CA49870RO1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many instances, the changes are specific for the tumour type in question. Some tumours, even among the most malignant ones, have only a single chromosomal abnormality, whereas others have numerous secondary aberrations. Although an overall parallel exists between a tumour's malignancy and the number and complexity of its chromosomal changes, in some situations altered selection pressure may give rise to reduced karyotypic complexity with time. The effective causes of both primary and secondary chromosomal changes of neoplastic cells are largely unknown. In some special situations, in particular therapy induced acute leukaemias, exposure to a carcinogenic agent seems to have specifically induced the leukaemogenic genetic rearrangement. Patients carrying malignant neoplasms have in most studies been found to have normal chromosomal stability in their non-neoplastic somatic cells, both generally and at the genomic regions that are rearranged in their tumours. Although abnormal chromosomal fragility of cells belonging to the neoplastic parenchyma has not been convincingly demonstrated, the existence of such instability remains a viable, perhaps even necessary, hypothesis. To look for a unifying mechanism common to all neoplastic processes seems simplistic: specific mutagenesis giving rise to both primary and secondary chromosomal changes is likely to occur in some tumours, whereas in others random aberrations are generated, and at least as far as the secondary ones are concerned often at a higher than normal rate, followed by Darwinian selection for fitness within the host organism.","['Heim, S']",['Heim S'],"['Department of Genetics, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Surv,Cancer surveys,8218015,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Connective Tissue Diseases/genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Surv. 1996;28:247-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-six axillary abnormalities seen mammographically in 94 patients were retrospectively reviewed and correlated with the clinical diagnoses and pathologic results found in the medical records. For each abnormality, the length, margins, and presence of microcalcifications were noted. Logistic regression was used to determine an association between these findings and status (benign or malignant). RESULTS: Seventy-six of 94 patients had lymphadenopathy. Eighteen of 94 patients had an abnormality other than lymphadenopathy. Because two of these 94 patients had more than one abnormality, a total of 96 abnormalities occurred, 20 of which were due to an abnormality other than lymphadenopathy. Regarding the 76 cases of lymphadenopathy, the most frequent diagnosis was nonspecific benign lymphadenopathy in 29% (n = 22) of cases, followed by metastatic breast cancer in 26% (n = 20) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia or well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma in 17% (n = 13). Other causes (n = 21) included collagen vascular disease, lymphomas other than well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma, metastatic disease from nonbreast primary site, metastatic disease from unknown primary site, sarcoidosis. HIV-related lymphadenopathy, and reactive lymphadenopathy associated with a breast abscess. An association between length of nonfatty lymph nodes and malignant status was statistically significant at the .001 level. When a length greater than 33 mm was used as a predictor of malignancy, the specificity and sensitivity were 97% and 31%, respectively. We found an association between malignancy and nonfatty lymph nodes with ill-defined or spiculated margins (p = .053). Regarding the 20 abnormalities other than lymphadenopathy, epidermal cysts (n = 7) were most prevalent. CONCLUSION: The most common axillary abnormality revealed on mammography was abnormal lymph nodes.

In AML, the beneficial role of purging the graft with cyclophosphamide derivatives (4-HC or mafosfamide) has been strongly suggested by retrospective studies from the European Cooperative Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and by single institution studies. Also, gene marking experiments have clearly shown that tumour cells infused with unpurged marrow indeed recirculate and in some instances, induce or contribute to tumour recurrence. Amifostine protects normal progenitor cells without concomitantly protecting colony forming unit leukaemic progenitors (CFUL). In comparative in vitro studies, we have shown that pre-incubation of normal marrow contaminated by leukaemic progenitors with amifostine followed by mafosfamide, results not only in a protection of the more mature progenitors (CFUGM, BFUE), but also sensitises leukaemic progenitors, so that in the end, the therapeutic index of mafosfamide is increasing by 6 logarithms. In the clinical field, it has been shown in patients with breast cancer autografted with protection by amifostine results in a shortening of the duration of aplasia of about 10 days. A European randomised study evaluating amifostine in the context of autografting for acute leukaemia has just started.","['Gorin, N C']",['Gorin NC'],"['Service des Maladies du Sang, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'M487QF2F4V (Amifostine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Amifostine/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0959-8049(96)00331-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(96)00331-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1996;32A Suppl 4:S31-9. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(96)00331-0.,,,,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These transgenic mouse strains, both of which express high levels of Tla2-3-TL antigen in their thymus, were analyzed for their T cell function with emphasis on cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) generation. A T cell response against TL was induced in Tg. Tla2-3-1, Tg. Tla2-3-2, and control C3H mice by skin grafts from H-2Kb/T3b transgenic mice, Tg.Con.3-1, expressing T3b-TL ubiquitously. Spleen cells from mice that had rejected the T3b-TL positive skin grafts were restimulated in vitro with Tg. Con.3-1 irradiated spleen cells. In mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC), approximately 20% and 15% of Thy-1+ T cells derived from Tg.Tla2-3-1 and Tg.Tla2-3-2, respectively, expressed TCR gamma delta, whereas almost all those from C3H expressed TCR alpha beta. The MLC from Tg. Tla2-3-2 and C3H demonstrated high CTL activity against TL, while those from Tg. Tla2-3-1 had little or none. The generation of gamma delta CTL recognizing TL in Tg. Tla2-3-2, but not C3H mice, was confirmed by the establishment of CTL clones. A total of 14 gamma delta CTL clones were established from Tg. Tla2-3-2, whereas none were obtained from C3H. Of the 14 gamma delta CTL clones, 8 were CD8+ and 6 were CD4-CD8- double negative. The CTL activity of all these clones was TL specific and inhibited by anti-TL, but not by anti-H-2 antibodies, demonstrating that they recognize TL directly without antigen presentation by H-2. The CTL activity was blocked by antibodies to TCR gamma delta and CD3, and also by antibodies to CD 8 alpha and CD8 beta in CD8+ clones, showing that the activity was mediated by TCR gamma delta and coreceptors. The thymic origin of these gamma delta CTL clones was indicated by the expression of Thy-1 and Ly-1 (CD5), and also CD8 alpha beta heterodimers in CD8+ clones on their surfaces and by the usage of TCR V gamma 4 chains in 12 of the 14 clones. Taken together, these results suggest that Tla2-3-TL antigen expressed in the thymus engages in positive selection of a sizable population of gamma delta T cells.","['Tsujimura, K', 'Takahashi, T', 'Morita, A', 'Hasegawa-Nishiwaki, H', 'Iwase, S', 'Obata, Y']","['Tsujimura K', 'Takahashi T', 'Morita A', 'Hasegawa-Nishiwaki H', 'Iwase S', 'Obata Y']","['Laboratory of Immunology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CD8 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Clone Cells', 'Graft Rejection/immunology', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/biosynthesis', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Skin Transplantation/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.184.6.2175 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1996 Dec 1;184(6):2175-84. doi: 10.1084/jem.184.6.2175.,['GENBANK/D86082'],,PMC2196386,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to the genetic defects, some human subjects have various abnormalities in urate metabolism. Urate metabolism abnormalities are classified into two categories, hyperuricemia and hypouricemia. Usually, the urate pool size of an adult male is about 1,200 mg, and 700 mg urate is produced daily. The production is balanced by the excretion of urate into urine (500 mg) and intestine (200 mg). If this balance is disturbed, either hyperuricemia or hypouricemia occurs. According to the mechanisms, hyperuricemia is classified into overproduction and underexcretion, and hypouricemia into underproduction and overexcretion. Overproduction of ruate is caused by PRPP synthetase superactivity, HPRT deficiency, leukemia and alcohol ingestion. Underexcretion of urate is caused by renal insufficiency and treatment by diuretics. Underproduction of urate is caused by xanthine dehydrogenase deficiency, purine nucleoside deficiency and allopurinol treatment. Overexcretion of urine is caused by familial renal hypouricemia, Fanconi's syndrome, diabetes mellitus and treatments with benzbromarone and probenecid. All of these conditions are classified, according to other aspects, into primary and secondary, and genetic and non-genetic abnormalities.","['Akaoka, I', 'Kamatani, N']","['Akaoka I', 'Kamatani N']","['2nd Department of Internal Medicine, Teikyo University School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Nihon Rinsho,Nihon rinsho.

We have designated the gene encoding this transcript Hp53int1 (the GDB designation is D17S2179E). The cDNA is 1125 bp and is polyadenylated downstream from a consensus poly(A) addition site. The entire 1125 bp is derived from intron 1 of the p53 gene, with no introns having been removed. The cDNA contains no major open reading frame although reading frame +1 contains a relatively low abundance of stop codons compared to the other two reading frames and could possibly encode a protein of 119 amino acids. Analysis of the +1 reading frame shows a region of high homology to a portion of the DNA-binding domain of NF-kappaB. These results indicate that a novel polyadenylated transcript is encoded by the first intron of the human p53 gene. Hp53int1 may be a pseudogene for a gene that may have encoded a DNA-binding protein. Alternatively, the transcript may have a function, since RNA transcripts of this gene are present in a number of human cells and their levels are induced during terminal differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells such as HL-60 and U937.","['Reisman, D', 'Balint e', 'Loging, W T', 'Rotter, V', 'Almon, E']","['Reisman D', 'Balint e', 'Loging WT', 'Rotter V', 'Almon E']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of South Carolina, Columbia 29208, USA.

In the present study, a cDNA clone encoding the human homologue of RP105 was isolated. The amino acid sequence of human RP105 is highly homologous to that of mouse RP105 with 74% identity, and the leucine-rich repeats are well conserved. The expression of the human RP105 transcript was detected in some B cell lines, a histiocytic leukemia cell line, and peripheral blood leukocytes. We also determined the chromosomal locations of the mouse RP105 gene (Ly64 locus) and the human RP105 gene (LY64 locus). Interspecific mouse backcross analysis was used to map the Ly64 locus at the distal region of chromosome 13.

Patients with primary thrombocythemia due to hypofunctional thrombocytes suffer frequently from haemorrhagic and thrombotic complications. The objective of treatment is therefore to achieve a normal number of thrombocytes. Medicamentous procedures are the same as in primary polycythemia. In primary myelofibrosis and chronic myeloid leukaemia it is also necessary to reduce the pathological population in bone marrow by the above mentioned therapeutic procedures. Contrary to the former two diagnoses, the survival of patients with primary myelofibrosis is shorter and the patients need more supportive treatment. In chronic myeloid leukaemia also transplantation treatment can be used, if a suitable donor is available.

The results, prognostic factors and live-tables will be demonstrated. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between 1984 and 1995 48 patients were treated at the Department of Radiooncology at the University of Munster because of epidural metastases. All but 3 cases were histologically proved. Three patients were irradiated without definitive histology because of clinical symptoms and CT or MR-imaging. Only patients with solid tumors were considered-patients with systemic diseases like leukemia or lymphoma were not analysed. In all of our cases irradiation was combined with systemic steroid application. Radiotherapy was performed with cobalt-60 or with an accelerator with total doses between 25 Gy and 40 Gy. RESULTS: The combination of irradiation and steroids had resulted in pain relief in about 80% of all patients. The ambulatory status after paraparesis was restituted in 35%. Best prognosis had been seen in patients with the following criterions: primary tumor should be breast cancer, no evidence of other tumor manifestation, no signs of paraparesis or paraplegia before the beginning of irradiation or regaining the ambulatory status after therapy. Under these conditions we have calculated a median survival rate of 709 days for these patients with good prognosis. Patients with bronchogenic carcinoma had a very poor prognosis with a median survival rate of only 90 days. CONCLUSIONS: Epidural metastases in cancer led often to a very fatal outcome. Irradiation is useful for pain relief and also for local tumor control. In some cases in patients with good prognostic factors long-time survival could be demonstrated. The results of irradiation are comparable with those after surgery.","['Wagner, W', 'Prott, F J', 'Rube, C', 'Willich, N']","['Wagner W', 'Prott FJ', 'Rube C', 'Willich N']","['Paracelsus-Strahlenklinik, Osnabruck.']",['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

Case report and review of the literature.,285-8,"Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) terminating in acute leukaemia (AL) is an infrequent condition. In several cases, flow cytometric analysis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored membrane proteins such as DAF and CD59/MACIF has suggested the leukaemic cells to be derived from the PNH clone, thereby implicating PNH as a potential preleukaemic disease. In the present paper, we review the data for one patient treated in our hospital and 20 cases reported in the literature from 1969 to 1993. The sex ratio is 1 female/2 males, mean age at diagnosis of PNH was 46 years and the mean interval between the diagnoses of PNH and AL was 53 months. AL type was AML M6 in 8 patients, other types of AML in 12 and ALL in one, with a mean survival of 7.1 months following diagnosis of AL. In all cases analyzed, the PNH phenotype of erythrocytes disappeared with progression of AL, whereas reappearance of this phenotype with complete remission of AL was inconstant. PNH would thus appear to be a potential preleukemic disease. When this disorder terminates in AL, the type is often AML M6, although ALL is also possible. The prognosis of AL in PNH is poor as for other secondary leukaemias. Apart from marrow aplasia, leukaemic transformation is another life threatening complication of PNH which may justify allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) and potential leukaemic transformation can therefore be an additional argument in favour of allo-BMT when pancytopenia develops in PNH patients.","['Cornelis, F', 'Montfort, L', 'Osselaer, J C', 'Sonet, A', 'Doyen, C', 'Chatelain, C', 'Chatelain, B', 'Bosly, A']","['Cornelis F', 'Montfort L', 'Osselaer JC', 'Sonet A', 'Doyen C', 'Chatelain C', 'Chatelain B', 'Bosly A']","['Haematology Division, Mont-Godinne University Hospital (Catholic University of Louvain, Yvoir, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",France,Hematol Cell Ther,Hematology and cell therapy,9613253,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00282-996-0285-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Cell Ther. 1996 Jul;38(3):285-8. doi: 10.1007/s00282-996-0285-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In most patients, 20 good quality metaphases per slide were easily analyzed, showing that a 10-40 times reduction of the number of cells used for cytogenetics allows a reliable karyotypic analysis in hematological malignancies.","['Brigaudeau, C', 'Gachard, N', 'Clay, D', 'Fixe, P', 'Rouzier, E', 'Praloran, V']","['Brigaudeau C', 'Gachard N', 'Clay D', 'Fixe P', 'Rouzier E', 'Praloran V']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHRU de Limoges, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Hematol Cell Ther,Hematology and cell therapy,9613253,,IM,"['Bone Marrow', 'Hematologic Diseases/blood/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping/*methods', 'Neoplasms/blood/*genetics']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00282-996-0275-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Cell Ther. 1996 Jul;38(3):275-7. doi: 10.1007/s00282-996-0275-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We summarized new features of apoptosis including high molecular weight DNA fragmentation and programmed cell death of enucleated cells. We described the recent contributions about the three oncogenes bcl-2, p53 and c-myc. New inducers and inhibitors of apoptosis have been reported, particularly the role of stromal environment, thrombopoietin, erythropoietin and flt-3 ligand has been mentioned. Apoptosis has been studied in red cell pathology: polycythemia, thalassemia and deficiency in folates, vitamin B12, iron and G6PD. Recently, the involvement of programmed cell death has been documented in bone marrow failure and myelodysplasia. In Acute Leukemia, the therapeutic action of numerous drugs has been proven by their in vitro apoptotic effect. The resistance of malignant cells to apoptosis, in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, due to bcr-abl oncogene, has been partially explained by conformational changes in p53 expression and is reversed by retinoic acid. Numerous reports in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia have documented the major role of apoptosis in this disease, especially in therapeutic efficacy of Chlorambucil, Fludarabine and Methylxanthine derivatives. At least, in Myeloma, it has been shown that apoptosis is induced by dexamethasone and HMBA, and inhibited by interleukine 6 that prevents activation of SAP Kinases.","['Binet, J L', 'Mentz, F', 'Merle-Beral, H']","['Binet JL', 'Mentz F', 'Merle-Beral H']","['Department of Hematology, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Hematol Cell Ther,Hematology and cell therapy,9613253,,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Hematologic Diseases/*pathology', 'Humans']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00282-996-0253-z [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Cell Ther. 1996 Jul;38(3):253-64. doi: 10.1007/s00282-996-0253-z.,,,,123,,,,,,,,,,,,,

European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer.,247-52,"Since the early 80s, the EORTC Leukemia Group has included 3947 patients in 8 consecutive phase III studies on acute myelogenous leukemia, with stratification according to the age groups. Some of these patients were included by other cooperative groups (GIMEMA, HOVON), within intergroup studies. The main hypotheses tested by randomization were intensive chemotherapy consolidation, allogeneic and autologous bone marrow transplantation in the younger patients. In patients aged 60 years or more, a wait and see policy followed by a palliative chemotherapy was compared to an immediate conventional induction treatment, mitoxantrone was compared to daunorubicin, and, during remission, a low dose Ara-C maintenance treatment to no maintenance. The main results can be summarized as follows: Allogeneic BMT, and, relatively, autologous BMT do better than intensive chemotherapy consolidation with regards to the disease-free survival, but not for the overall survival after remission. In the elderly, an immediate induction and a low-dose Ara-C maintenance treatment are preferable to the other options tested. Mainly in patients aged more than 45, the supplementary toxicity of more intensive chemotherapy consolidation, with high dose Ara-C, counter balanced the increased anti-leukemic effect. Finally the trials randomizing GM-CSF during induction yielded disappointing results. The EORTC LCG is currently studying the relative value of various intercalating agents during induction, and of the G-CSF as well, and, during remission the autologous peripheral stem cells compared to bone marrow transplantation.","['Zittoun, R']",['Zittoun R'],"[""Service d'Hematologie, Hotel-Dieu, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Hematol Cell Ther,Hematology and cell therapy,9613253,,IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Europe', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00282-996-0247-x [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Cell Ther. 1996 Jul;38(3):247-52. doi: 10.1007/s00282-996-0247-x.,,,,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In fact, myeloid leukemic cells bear specific receptors for G-CSF and GM-CSF and these CSFs induce an in vitro proliferation in primary blast cells of most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In addition, autocrine or paracrine loops of stimulation have been demonstrated in some cases. Despite these theoretical risks of blast proliferation, G-CSF and GM-CSF have been extensively tested in patients with AML or myelodysplastic syndromes. Major objectives were the correction of acquired or chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, but also the reinforcement of the antileukemic efficacy of cytotoxic agents. Recently, G-CSF has also been used to mobilize hematopoietic progenitors in the peripheral blood. Major results of several double-blind clinical trials are the demonstration of the safety of CSF administration in these patients, since no risk of in vivo blast cell regrowth has been observed, and their efficacy to shorten the duration of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. However, no significant reduction in the treatment-related mortality and no survival improvement were afforded by the use of these CSFs. From another point of view, the search for AML-specific CSF-receptor or CSF-receptor associated molecule abnormalities represents a new promising area to try to understand the mechanisms of leukemogenesis.","['Dombret, H']",['Dombret H'],"['Service Clinique des Maladies du Sang, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Hematol Cell Ther,Hematology and cell therapy,9613253,"['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00282-996-0231-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Cell Ther. 1996 Jul;38(3):231-40. doi: 10.1007/s00282-996-0231-5.,,,,92,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the time of manifestation of angio-oedema symptoms or within a few years the following diseases were diagnosed: liver angioma (n = 1), M-components (n = 7, one of whom also had echinococcal liver cysts), breast cancer (n = 1), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL; n = 1); three patients had no associated disease. Anti-C1-INH autoantibodies, measured both as immunoglobulin binding to C1-INH immobilized onto microtitre plates (ELISA) and as plasma inhibitory activity of C1-INH function, were found in 12 patients. Binding of C1-INH to paraproteins, transferred to Immobilon after agarose gel electrophoresis, was detectable in five of seven M-components associated with AAE. Immunoblotting analysis of SDS-PAGE-separated plasma demonstrated that C1-INH circulated in the cleaved 96-kD form in the 12 patients with autoantibodies, but not in the one without. In conclusion, the large majority of our patients have autoantibodies to C1-INH. Circulating autoantibodies are necessary for the generation of cleaved C1-INH. The paraproteins associated with AAE are frequently autoantibodies to C1-INH and thus account for its consumption.","['Cicardi, M', 'Beretta, A', 'Colombo, M', 'Gioffre, D', 'Cugno, M', 'Agostoni, A']","['Cicardi M', 'Beretta A', 'Colombo M', 'Gioffre D', 'Cugno M', 'Agostoni A']","['Institute of Internal Medicine, University of Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Complement C1 Inactivator Proteins)', '0 (Complement C4)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Angioedema/*chemically induced/immunology', 'Autoantibodies/*immunology', 'Complement C1 Inactivator Proteins/*immunology', 'Complement C4/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2249.1996.d01-866.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1996 Dec;106(3):475-80. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2249.1996.d01-866.x.,,,PMC2200617,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The optimization of the MTX dose and/or the subsequent leucovorin rescue is based on pharmacokinetic data calculated from plasma concentrations collected after cessation of the MTX administration. The influence of the MTX assay method on the subsequent pharmacokinetic evaluation was studied in 13 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Plasma samples were collected after administration of MTX (5-8 g/m2) as 24 h infusions. All samples were analyzed by five different analytical procedures, viz. liquid chromatography (LC), enzyme inhibition assay (EIA), two fluorescence polarization immunoassays (FPIA1 and FPIA2) and enzyme multiplied immunoassay (EMIT). Using measurements from the four non-chromatographic procedures, only about 50% of determined pharmacokinetic parameters (area under the plasma concentration time curve, calculated by the trapezoidal rule and from pharmacokinetic modelling, and the terminal half life time) were within the range 75-125% of the values obtained from LC data. We conclude that the clinical outcome of MTX therapy using estimated MTX pharmacokinetics as guidelines for proper dosing of MTX and/or leucovorin rescue might be affected by the lack of accuracy of non-chromatographic procedures for MTX analysis.

However, the importance of the individual alpha (170 kDa) and beta (180 kDa) isozymes as targets of topoisomerase II-active drugs is not clear. To address this question, human CCRF-CEM leukemia cells were incubated with bromodeoxyuridine, and either the nascent DNA or bulk DNA not undergoing replication was purified by immunoprecipitation with an anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibody. The topoisomerase II isozymes that coprecipitated with either the nascent DNA or bulk DNA were analyzed by Western blotting. The alpha isozyme formed complexes with nascent DNA in cells pretreated with either VM-26 or mitoxantrone, while the beta isozyme was only bound to bulk DNA. At moderately cytotoxic concentrations, VM-26 enhanced the binding of topoisomerase II alpha to nascent DNA at least 5.2-fold compared to bulk DNA. However, in VM-26 resistant CEM/VM-1 cells incubated with equitoxic concentrations of VM-26, topoisomerase II alpha complex formation with nascent DNA was decreased at least 5.5-fold compared to bulk DNA. Drug-induced binding of topoisomerase II beta with bulk DNA in CEM/VM-1 cells did not correlate with cytotoxicity. Collectively, these results indicate that the formation of VM-26 stabilized complexes of topoisomerase II alpha with nascent DNA are critical to the development of cytotoxicity, and that resistance of CEM/VM-1 cells to VM-26 is related to impaired formation of these complexes. The results also provide indirect evidence that topoisomerase II alpha is involved in DNA, replication.","['Qiu, J', 'Catapano, C V', 'Fernandes, D J']","['Qiu J', 'Catapano CV', 'Fernandes DJ']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Etoposide/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Protein Binding', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/12/17 00:00,1996/12/17 00:01,['1996/12/17 00:00'],"['1996/12/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/17 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/bi9619637 [doi]', 'bi9619637 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1996 Dec 17;35(50):16354-60. doi: 10.1021/bi9619637.,,['CA 44597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The membrane bound FR in L1210A cells exhibited significantly (up to 17-fold) greater relative affinities for (6S)-N5-methyltetrahydrofolate, (6S)-N5-formyltetrahydrofolate and methotrexate compared to the FR in L1210JF cells. Furthermore, receptor-mediated transport of [3H]-(6S)-N5-methyltetrahydrofolate was much more efficient in L1210A cells compared to L1210JF cells. When solubilized with Triton X-100, the ligand binding characteristics of FR from both sublines resembled those of the receptor associated with L1210 JF cell membranes. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis as well as RT-PCR analysis of the entire coding region revealed a single species of FR in both cells, identical to murine FR-alpha. The FR in L1210JF cells was sensitive to phosphatidylinositol specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) indicating the presence of a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) membrane anchor while the FR in L1210A cells was resistant to PI-PLC; however, the FR in L1210A cells was released from plasma membranes by nitrous acid, as expected for GPI and its PI-PLC resistant structural variants. Treatment of L1210A cell membranes with mild base rendered the protein PI-PLC sensitive as expected for GPI anchors acylated in the inositol ring and also decreased the affinities of the membrane associated FR for reduced folates. When the cDNA for murine FR-alpha was expressed in parental L1210 cells the protein was PI-PLC resistant but was sensitive to PI-PLC when the cDNA was expressed in human 293 fibroblasts. In L1210JF, L1210A, and parental L1210 cells, several cell surface proteins, including FR, incorporated [3H]ethanolamine, a component of the GPI membrane anchor; however, the labeled proteins were released by PI-PLC only in L1210JF cells. The above results preclude any peculiarity of the FR polypeptide in either L1210 subline as the basis for the observed differences in PI-PLC sensitivity and membrane-associated functions of FR. Partial deglycosylation of membrane associated FR from either cell with N-glycanase did not influence its ligand binding characteristics. The results of this study lead to the hypothesis that variant GPI structures may modulate the function of a protein by influencing its conformation/topography in the membrane. Such effects may be identified by their disappearance/reduction upon detergent solubilization or mild base treatment of the membrane.","['Wang, X', 'Jansen, G', 'Fan, J', 'Kohler, W J', 'Ross, J F', 'Schornagel, J', 'Ratnam, M']","['Wang X', 'Jansen G', 'Fan J', 'Kohler WJ', 'Ross JF', 'Schornagel J', 'Ratnam M']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Ohio, Toledo 43699-0008, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Ethanolamines)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '5KV86114PT (Ethanolamine)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Phosphoinositide Phospholipase C)', 'EC 4.6.1.13 (Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'TYK22LML8F (5-methyltetrahydrofolate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Ethanolamine', 'Ethanolamines/metabolism', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Leucovorin/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Methotrexate/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase', 'Phosphoinositide Phospholipase C', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Radioligand Assay', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tetrahydrofolates/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/12/17 00:00,1996/12/17 00:01,['1996/12/17 00:00'],"['1996/12/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/17 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/bi961098q [doi]', 'bi961098q [pii]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1996 Dec 17;35(50):16305-12. doi: 10.1021/bi961098q.,,['R29CA57598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These include skeletal deposition of radium and radiostrontium in bone volume; deposition on bone surfaces of plutonium and other actinides; liver deposition of actinides; induction of skeletal or liver malignancies by these radionuclides; induction of tooth and jaw abnormalities; mammary cancer induction by radium in humans and in the beagle; depression of circulating cells in blood; and induction of bone fractures. There are also inter-species differences that may not have been noted if multiple species (including humans) had not been studied. Some of these are more rapid excretion of radium in humans compared with most other mammals; induction by radium of eye melanomas in animals but not humans; rapid loss of deposited plutonium from liver in many species of mice and rats but not in humans and dog; substantial sex-related differences in skeletal plutonium retention and bone sarcoma induction in mice but not in humans or dog; and induction of head sinus carcinomas by 226Ra in humans but not the beagle. Leukemia and other related neoplasms were not induced in radionuclide-injected lifespan dogs in excess of the occurrence in control animals. Much of our current understanding of skeletal biology and radionuclide behavior in mammals was derived from this and related projects.

A Phillips face tanner model HB 171/A was used as a light source. Chloroma were irradiated through a 5 mm thick glass filter that cut off all of the UVB contamination. The irradiances were measured, from 250 to 400 nm, with a well-characterized and calibrated double-grating spectroradiometer Optronic 742. The overall uncertainty of dose evaluation was estimated to be +/-15% (2 sigma). The cells were irradiated with UVA doses of 4 and 8 J/cm2 and cultured thereafter for 24 h. After this period of time, a marked decline up to 50% was observed in cell proliferation in UVA-irradiated ChL cultures. The cell proliferation decline was found to be caused by simultaneously occurring G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in part of the UVA-irradiated ChL population. Concomitantly, with the decline in cell proliferation, an increase was observed in the expression of the major histocompatibility (MHC) class I and II antigens. Because protein kinase C (PKC) is known to regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis and expression of MHC antigens, and because UVA was shown to regulate PKC activity/expression, we therefore examined whether UVA irradiation has any effect on the expression of isozymes of PKC. Western blots revealed that ChL express alpha, beta I, delta, epsilon, eta, and zeta/iota isozymes of PKC and that expression of all isozymes declined 24 h after UVA irradiation (8 J/cm2). Finally, PKC activation in ChL by exposure to phorbol ester caused cell cycle arrest in G1 phase but did not induce apoptosis. This suggests that the previously shown UVA-induced PKC activation in ChL might be responsible for the induction of MHC antigens but the simultaneously observed ChL apoptosis is likely to be mediated by PKC down-regulation. All together, our results suggest that UVA, at irradiance levels that resemble the outdoor exposure, may have profound effects on the immune-related properties of leukocytes. Thus, we speculate that in vivo the immune functions of leukocytes passing through dermal capillaries might be altered by exposure to solar UVA radiation.","['Leszczynski, D', 'Fagerholm, S', 'Leszczynski, K']","['Leszczynski D', 'Fagerholm S', 'Leszczynski K']","['Radiobiology Laboratory, Finnish Centre for Radiation and Nuclear Safety, Helsinki, Finland.

DESIGN: A retrospective review of the relevant cases and a review of the literature are presented. METHOD: A clinical review of this rare, life-threatening entity, occurring almost exclusively in severely neutropenic patients is presented and compared to the relevant clinical findings from an analysis of this series, the largest reported to date and first to document a significant clustering (p < .01). CONCLUSION: We conclude, based on epidemiologic evidence, that this clustering was directly related to the release of airborne fungal spores from dormant soil reservoirs disturbed during hospital construction. Therefore, we strongly advocate increased vigilance with respect to precautions against airborne pathogens wherever severely neutropenic hosts are treated.","['Lueg, E A', 'Ballagh, R H', 'Forte, V']","['Lueg EA', 'Ballagh RH', 'Forte V']","['Department of Otolaryngology, University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine, Ontario.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Canada,J Otolaryngol,The Journal of otolaryngology,7610513,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillus/*isolation & purification', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Male', 'Mucor/*isolation & purification', 'Neutropenia', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sinusitis/complications/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Wilms Tumor/complications']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Otolaryngol. 1996 Dec;25(6):366-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown that high levels of expression of the Mos/MAPK pathway in Swiss 3T3 fibroblast cause cells in S phase to undergo apoptosis, while cells in G1 irreversibly growth arrest. Interestingly, cells in G2 and M phases also arrest at a G1-like checkpoint after proceeding through mitosis. These cells fail to undergo cytokinesis and are binucleated. Thus, constitutive overexpression of Mos and MAPK cannot be tolerated, and fibroblasts transformed by Mos express only low levels of the mos oncogene product. Here, we show that p53 plays a key role in preventing oncogene-mediated activation of MAPK. In the absence of p53 (p53-/-), the growth arrest normally observed in wild-type p53 (p53+/+) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) is markedly reduced. The mos transformation efficiency in p53-/- MEFs is two to three orders of magnitude higher than that in p53+/+ cells, and p53-/- cells tolerate > 10-fold higher levels of both Mos and activated MAPK. Moreover, we show that, like Mos, both v-ras and v-raf oncogene products induce apoptosis in p53+/+ MEFs. These oncogenes also display a high transforming activity in p53-/- MEFs, as does a gain-of-function MAPK kinase mutant (MEK*). Thus, the p53-dependent checkpoint pathway is responsive to oncogene-mediated MAPK activation in inducing irreversible G1 growth arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, we show that the chromosome instability induced by the loss of p53 is greatly enhanced by the constitutive activation of the Mos/MAPK pathway.","['Fukasawa, K', 'Vande Woude, G F']","['Fukasawa K', 'Vande Woude GF']","['ABL-Basic Research Program, NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Proteins v-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mos)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (Map3k1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Oncogene Protein p21(ras))']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Division', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes/*genetics', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression', '*MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Moloney murine sarcoma virus/genetics', 'Oncogene Protein p21(ras)/genetics/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins v-raf', 'Oncogenes', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mos/*physiology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.17.1.506 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1997 Jan;17(1):506-18. doi: 10.1128/MCB.17.1.506.,,,PMC231775,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several of these Hox genes have been found to display distinctive expression patterns, with genes located at the 3' side of the clusters being expressed at their highest levels in the most primitive subpopulation of human CD34+ bone marrow cells and genes located at the 5' end having a broader range of expression, with downregulation at later stages of hematopoietic differentiation. To explore if these patterns reflect different functional activities, we have retrovirally engineered the overexpression of a 5'-located gene, HOXA10, in murine bone marrow cells and demonstrate effects strikingly different from those induced by overexpression of a 3'-located gene, HOXB4. In contrast to HOXB4, which causes selective expansion of primitive hematopoietic cells without altering their differentiation, overexpression of HOXA10 profoundly perturbed myeloid and B-lymphoid differentiation. The bone marrow of mice reconstituted with HOXA10-transduced bone marrow cells contained in high frequency a unique progenitor cell with megakaryocytic colony-forming ability and was virtually devoid of unilineage macrophage and pre-B-lymphoid progenitor cells derived from the transduced cells. Moreover, and again in contrast to HOXB4, a significant proportion of HOXA10 mice developed a transplantable acute myeloid leukemia with a latency of 19 to 50 weeks. These results thus add to recognition of Hox genes as important regulators of hematopoiesis and provide important new evidence of Hox gene-specific functions that may correlate with their normal expression pattern.","['Thorsteinsdottir, U', 'Sauvageau, G', 'Hough, M R', 'Dragowska, W', 'Lansdorp, P M', 'Lawrence, H J', 'Largman, C', 'Humphries, R K']","['Thorsteinsdottir U', 'Sauvageau G', 'Hough MR', 'Dragowska W', 'Lansdorp PM', 'Lawrence HJ', 'Largman C', 'Humphries RK']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '164384-16-1 (Hoxa10 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Homeobox/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', '*Homeodomain Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Lymphoid Tissue/cytology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Retroviridae/genetics']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.17.1.495 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1997 Jan;17(1):495-505. doi: 10.1128/MCB.17.1.495.,,['N44DK322/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],PMC231774,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experimentally, E2a-Pbx1 transforms a variety of cell types, including fibroblasts, myeloid progenitors, and lymphoblasts. Structure-function studies have shown that contributions from both E2a and Pbx1 are necessary for oncogenesis, but the Pbx1 homeodomain is dispensable and the required portion of Pbx1 has not been delineated. In this study, we used deletional and site-directed mutagenesis to identify portions of Pbx1 necessary for oncogenic and transcriptional activities of E2a-Pbx1. These studies defined a motif (named the Hox cooperativity motif [HCM]) carboxy terminal to the Pbx homeodomain that is required for cooperative DNA binding, cellular transcriptional activity, and the oncogenic potential of E2a-Pbx1. The HCM is highly conserved throughout the Pbx/exd subfamily of divergent homeodomain proteins and functions in DNA-binding assays as a potential contact site for Hox dimerization. E2a-Pbx1 proteins with interstitial deletion or single-point mutations in the HCM could neither activate transcription in cellular assays nor transform NIH 3T3 cells. An E2a-Pbx1 mutant containing 50 amino acids of Pbx1b spanning the HCM but lacking the homeodomain was capable of inducing fibroblast transformation. Thus, the HCM is a necessary and sufficient contribution of Pbx1 for oncogenesis induced by E2a-Pbx1 and accounts for its homeodomain-independent transforming properties. Since subtle alterations of the Pbx HCM result in complete abrogation of transforming activity whereas the homeodomain is entirely dispensable, we conclude that interactions mediated by the HCM are more important for transformation by E2a-Pbx1 than interactions with cognate Pbx DNA sites.","['Chang, C P', 'de Vivo, I', 'Cleary, M L']","['Chang CP', 'de Vivo I', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (HOXB7 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxb7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.17.1.81 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1997 Jan;17(1):81-8. doi: 10.1128/MCB.17.1.81.,,"['AI-07290/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC231732,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine the effect of an alternate exposure metric, we analyzed cell-type specific leukemia mortality in Pliofilm workers. The work history of each Pliofilm worker was used to define each worker's maximally exposed job/department combination over time and the associated long-term average concentration associated with the maximally exposed job (LTA-MEJ). Using this measure, in conjunction with four job exposure estimates, we calculated SMRs for groups of workers with increasing LTA-MEJs. The analyses suggest that a critical concentration of benzene exposure must be reached in order for the risk of leukemia or, more specifically, AMML to be expressed. The minimum concentration is between 20 and 60 ppm depending on the exposure estimate and endpoint (all leukemias or AMMLs only). We believe these analyses are a useful adjunct to previous analyses of the Pliofilm data. They suggests that (a) AMML risk is shown only above a critical concentration of benzene exposure, measured as a long-term average and experienced for years, (b) the critical concentration is between 50 and 60 ppm when using a median exposure estimate derived from three previous exposure assessments, and is between 20 and 25 ppm using the lowest exposure estimates, and (c) risks for total leukemia are driven by risks for AMML, suggesting that AMML is the cell type related to benzene exposure.","['Schnatter, A R', 'Nicolich, M J', 'Bird, M G']","['Schnatter AR', 'Nicolich MJ', 'Bird MG']","['Exxon Biomedical Sciences, Inc., East Millstone, New Jersey 08875-2350, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Risk Anal,Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,8109978,"['0 (Carcinogens)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Carcinogens/*adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/chemically induced/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/mortality', 'Male', 'Maximum Allowable Concentration', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/mortality', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Ohio/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1539-6924.1996.tb00834.x [doi]'],ppublish,Risk Anal. 1996 Dec;16(6):833-40. doi: 10.1111/j.1539-6924.1996.tb00834.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The uPA localization enhances plasmin formation on the cell surface and facilitates cell migration. The cellular and tissue distribution of uPAR is not fully established. We have analyzed uPAR expression in nine leukemic cell lines of distinct lineages and maturational states and correlated this with expression of plasminogen receptors, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) receptors and LDL receptor-related protein (LRP). The most immature and least differentiated cell line (an erythro-myeloid cell line) and cells of lymphoid lineage, did not express uPAR, whereas cells differentiated along the myelo-monocytic pathway displayed this receptor. Plasminogen and tPA receptors were expressed by all leukemic cell lines and by all nucleated peripheral blood cells but B and T lymphocytes were negative for cell surface expression of both uPAR and LRP while monocytes and neutrophils were positive for expression of both uPAR and LRP. PMA stimulation induced surface expression of uPAR in lymphocytes but did not induce expression of LRP by these cells. In contrast, lymphoid cell lines were negative for uPAR expression even after PMA stimulation, indicating differences in regulation of uPAR expression between lymphocytes and lymphoid cell lines. The pattern of uPAR expression on leukemic cell lines was also studied on bone marrow blast cells from leukemic patients. Only the most mature myeloid cells expressed uPAR on their surfaces. In contrast, M3 leukemic cells and other blast cells displaying lymphoid markers such as TdT (+) and/or CD2 (+) did not express intracellular or cell-surface associated uPAR, indicating an heterogeneity among these promyelocytic cells and suggesting that uPAR may be a useful marker for leukemia typing.

It is believed to be a blocker of apoptosis but might be different from bcl-2 in the control of apoptosis. Using immunostaining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections, we investigated the expression of Mcl-1 in 42 thymic epithelial tumours: three medullary thymomas, five mixed thymomas, seven cortical thymomas, eight well-differentiated thymic carcinomas, 14 squamous cell carcinomas, four lymphoepithelioma-like carcinomas and one undifferentiated carcinoma, bcl-2 immunocytochemical localization was also performed for comparison. High-grade thymic carcinomas, especially squamous cell carcinomas, revealed more intense Mcl-1 immunoreactivity as compared to other subtypes (P < 0.001). In cases that co-expressed Mcl-1 and bcl-2, the less differentiated cells had more intense expression of bcl-2, while the more differentiated cells displayed stronger Mcl-1 immunoreactivity. The differential expression of Mcl-1 and bcl-2 in neoplastic cells provides evidence that these proteins may play different roles in the processes of programmed cell death in thymic neoplasms. The finding that thymic carcinomas have stronger immunoreactivity for Mcl-1 indicates that this protein could be a useful marker to differentiate aggressive thymic epithelial tumours from indolent ones.","['Chen, F F', 'Yan, J J', 'Chang, K C', 'Lai, W W', 'Chen, R M', 'Jin, Y T']","['Chen FF', 'Yan JJ', 'Chang KC', 'Lai WW', 'Chen RM', 'Jin YT']","['Department of Pathology, National Cheng Kung University Medical Centre, Tainan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Carcinoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Thymoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2559.1996.d01-540.x [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 1996 Dec;29(6):541-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2559.1996.d01-540.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible role of autologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) in patients with AML who relapse after ABSCT. Eighteen consecutive patients were enrolled in the study. At ABMT, 17 patients were in untreated relapse and one was in third complete remission (CR). The preparative regimen was BAVC, and consisted of BCNU 800 mg/m2 on day -6, M-AMSA 150 mg/m2/day on days -5 to -3, VP-16 150 mg/m2/day on days -5 to -3 and Ara-C 300 mg/m2/day on days -5 to -3. There were two regimen-related deaths (11%). Thirteen out of 17 patients in untreated relapse before ABMT achieved CR (76%). The cumulative risk of relapse was 58 +/- 13% at 3 years. Seven patients are in CR between 7+ and 53+ months, with a disease-free survival (DFS) probability of 36 +/- 12% at 3 years. The probability of DFS after ABMT was clearly higher in those patients relapsing later than 7 months after the first autograft (52%) than in patients relapsing earlier (20%)(P = 0.02). In a significant proportion of patients, remission duration was clearly longer after ABMT than ABSCT. We conclude that BAVC conditioning followed by ABMT is associated with a low treatment-related toxicity and results in prolonged DFS in a substantial number of AML patients who relapse after ABSCT. Until better therapeutic options become available, ABMT in untreated relapse is a useful alternative in this group of very poor-risk patients.","['de la Rubia, J', 'Sanz, G F', 'Martin, G', 'Sempere, A', 'Picon, I', 'Carral, A', 'Larrea, L', 'Martinez, J', 'Soler, M A', 'Bonanad, S', 'Lopez, F', 'Jarque, I', 'Sanz, M A']","['de la Rubia J', 'Sanz GF', 'Martin G', 'Sempere A', 'Picon I', 'Carral A', 'Larrea L', 'Martinez J', 'Soler MA', 'Bonanad S', 'Lopez F', 'Jarque I', 'Sanz MA']","['Department of Hematology, La Fe University Hospital, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'BAVC protocol']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Amsacrine/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Dec;18(6):1167-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that chimeric status evolution was different between the long-term surviving patients and relapsed patients. The former showed either donor chimerism (DC) or transient mixed chimerism (tMC), while the latter always showed a recipient-growing MC (r.gMC).

However, the fact that some cytogenetic relapses appear to be transient may complicate protocols for early therapeutic intervention based on molecular analysis and could result in the unnecessary treatment of some patients. To determine the frequency and significance of transient cytogenetic relapse, we have studied serial samples from 98 CML patients after allogeneic BMT by conventional cytogenetics and competitive RT-PCR for BCR-ABL mRNA. During the period of study, 26 patients had cytogenetic or haematologic evidence or relapse. In four cases (15% of those who relapsed; 4% of all patients) relapse appeared to be transient; i.e., subsequent marrow samples were completely Ph chromosome-negative despite the fact that there had been no change in treatment, including the level of immunosuppression. BCR-ABL mRNA levels broadly paralleled the cytogenetic findings. Of these four patients, two subsequently progressed to frank haematologic relapse and two remained strongly positive for BCR-ABL transcripts and are therefore presumably still at risk of relapse. Analysis of B cell-enriched, T cell-enriched and lymphoid-depleted fractions for three patients demonstrated that transient relapse was not due to the proliferations of BCR-ABL-positive lymphoid cells. In contrast, BCR-ABL-positive myeloid precursor cells were detected in two of three patients tested. We conclude that transient cytogenetic relapse followed by sustained remission is a relatively infrequent occurrence after current allogeneic transplant regimens.","['Lin, F', 'Kirkland, M A', 'van Rhee, F V', 'Chase, A', 'Coulthard, S', 'Bungey, J', 'Goldman, J M', 'Cross, N C']","['Lin F', 'Kirkland MA', 'van Rhee FV', 'Chase A', 'Coulthard S', 'Bungey J', 'Goldman JM', 'Cross NC']","['LRF Leukaemia Unit, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/ultrastructure', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Dec;18(6):1147-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients engrafted and none experienced acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease. The time needed to achieve granulocyte recovery was 13, 26 and 29 days, respectively and platelet recovery occurred in 28, 49 and 51 days. All patients presented a marked increase of HbF, the values observed being much greater than those documented in patients given marrow transplantation and comparable with those observed in normal children in the first year of age. The recovery of T cell immunity, as well as that of natural killer subpopulations, mimicked that described in BMT recipients, a quicker return of CD8+ T cells determining the characteristic inversion of CD4/CD8 ratio. An impressive increase in the percentage and absolute number of B lymphocytes, apparently not related to viral infections, was demonstrable in all three cases. These data suggest that CBT recipients can experience a slight delay in hematological recovery when compared with patients given BMT.

AzhepSi shares certain properties with the natural polyamines, but in contrast with spermidine and spermine it inhibits the growth of L1210 leukemia cells in culture at micromolar concentrations. The bis(ethyl) derivative of AzhepSi was made, in analogy to bis(ethyl) spermine, a polyamine derivative, which gained much attention during the last decade as a potential anticancer drug. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells accumulate the dimethylsilyl tetramines considerably more and are more sensitive to these drugs than are CHO-MG cells, a polyamine uptake-deficient mutant. This and related observations demonstrate that AzhepSi and EtAzhepSi are preferentially taken up by a polyamine transport system. Both tetramines inhibit the growth of a variety of tumor cells at micromolar concentrations. AzhepSi turned out to be either equipotent or more potent, but in no case less potent than EtAzhepSi. When given alone at daily doses of 25 micromol/kg, the compounds did not prolong the survival time of L1210 leukemia mice. However, in combination with 2-(difluoromethyl)ornithine and neomycin, AzhepSi had a significant effect on the life span of the animals. The growth rate of 3LL Lewis lung carcinoma was reduced by both compounds at daily doses of 25 micromol/kg. The observations presented in this work suggest that the dimethylsilyl tetramines are antiproliferative agents in vitro and in vivo. Due to enhanced general toxicity, the introduction of N-ethyl substituents was of no advantage in the case of these polyamine analogues.","['Seiler, N', 'Delcros, J G', 'Vaultier, M', 'Le Roch, N', 'Havouis, R', 'Douaud, F', 'Moulinoux, J P']","['Seiler N', 'Delcros JG', 'Vaultier M', 'Le Roch N', 'Havouis R', 'Douaud F', 'Moulinoux JP']","['URA CNRS 1529, Institut de Recherche Contre le Cancer, Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Rennes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Silanes)', '0 (bis(7-amino-4-azaheptyl)dimethylsilane)', '0 (bis(7-ethylamino-4-azaheptyl)dimethylsilane)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Lewis Lung/drug therapy', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Silanes/*pharmacology']",1996/12/15 00:00,1996/12/15 00:01,['1996/12/15 00:00'],"['1996/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Dec 15;56(24):5624-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both T and B cells in PP expressed CD95 at the early stage of MAIDS and decreased in number thereafter.

On the other hand, the number of B cells was also decreased in PP of lpr mice with MAIDS. The proliferative ability of B cells in PP of MAIDS mice in response to immunoglobulin M cross-linking or lipopolysaccharide was severely impaired, while the B cells normally proliferated in response to anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody.

Genetic mapping studies have indicated that sequences responsible for neurovirulence reside within the env gene. To address the question of direct envelope protein neuroxicity in the central nervous system (CNS), we have generated chimeric mice expressing the CasBrE envelope protein in cells of neuroectodermal origin. Specifically, the multipotent neural progenitor cell line C17.2 was engineered to express the CasBrE env gene as either gp70/p15E (CasE) or gp70 alone (CasES). CasE expression in these cells resulted in complete (>10(5)) interference of superinfection with Friend murine leukemia virus clone FB29, whereas CasES expression resulted in a 1.8-log-unit decrease in FB29 titer. Introduction of these envelope-expressing C17.2 cells into the brains of highly susceptible IRW mice resulted in significant engraftment as integral cytoarchitecturally correct components of the CNS. Despite high-level envelope protein expression from the engrafted cells, no evidence of spongiform neurodegeneration was observed. To examine whether early virus replication events were necessary for pathogenesis, C17.2 cells expressing whole virus were transplanted into mice in which virus replication in the host was specifically restricted by Fv-1 to preintegration events. Again, significant C17.2 cell engraftment and infectious virus expression failed to precipitate spongiform lesions. In contrast, transplantation of virus-expressing C17.2 progenitor cells in the absence of the Fv-1 restriction resulted in extensive spongiform neurodegeneration by 2 weeks postengraftment. Cytological examination indicated that infection had spread beyond the engrafted cells, and in particular to host microglia. Spongiform neuropathology in these animals was directly correlated with CasBrE env expression in microglia rather than expression from neural progenitor cells. These results suggest that the envelope protein of CasBrE is not itself neurotoxic but that virus infectious events beyond binding and fusion in microglia are necessary for the induction of CNS disease.","['Lynch, W P', 'Snyder, E Y', 'Qualtiere, L', 'Portis, J L', 'Sharpe, A H']","['Lynch WP', 'Snyder EY', 'Qualtiere L', 'Portis JL', 'Sharpe AH']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. wonk@mbcrr.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (virus structural protein p15)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Brain/*metabolism/virology', 'Cell Line', 'Central Nervous System/virology', 'DNA, Viral', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microglia/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Prion Diseases/*metabolism/virology', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*metabolism/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virulence', 'Virus Replication']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.12.8896-8907.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Dec;70(12):8896-907. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.12.8896-8907.1996.,,['R01 NS31065/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC190987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the enzyme is unable to cleave the extended tRNA substrate at the RNA-DNA junction even at high enzyme concentrations. The RNase H domain of the reverse transcriptase was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and purified from Escherichia coli extracts. Following removal of the glutathione S-transferase portion of the protein, the specificity of the isolated RNase H domain was determined in the plus-strand primer reaction and in the tRNA primer removal reaction. Although the isolated domain lacked specificity in both cases, it was still unable to cleave the tRNA substrate precisely at the RNA-DNA junction. Specificity in both cases could be restored by adding back a truncated form of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase lacking the RNase H domain. These results implicate the polymerase domain as a specificity determinant for the RNase H activity of reverse transcriptase.

To determine if PVC-211 MuLV also has expanded its host range, we tested its infectivity on Chinese hamster ovary-derived CHO-K1 cells, which are generally resistant to ecotropic MuLV. The results indicated that PVC-211 MuLV, but not F-MuLV, was highly infectious for CHO-K1 cells. Studies using glycosylation inhibitors and glycosylation mutants of CHO-K1 cells, as well as interference studies, suggested that PVC-211 MuLV has acquired the ability to interact with the ecotropic MuLV receptor on CHO-K1 cells that has undergone glycosylation-dependent modification. Using chimeric viruses between PVC-211 MuLV and F-MuLV, we were able to localize the viral genetic element crucial for CHO-K1 cell tropism within the env gene of PVC-211 MuLV and show that glycine at position 116 and lysine at position 129 of the envelope glycoprotein SU were important.

To determine the responsive elements in the human ICAM-1 gene promoter, a reporter construct in which the 5'-flanking 4.4-kb region of the ICAM-1 gene was linked to the promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene was cotransfected with expression vectors for Tax1 and Tax2, both of which were separately confirmed to be potent transactivators of the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). Tax1 strongly activated the ICAM-1 promoter in all the cell lines tested: three T-cell lines (Jurkat, MOLT-4, and CEM), one monocytoid cell line (U937), and HeLa. Unexpectedly, Tax2 activated the ICAM-1 promoter only in HeLa. By deletion and mutation analyses of the 1.3-kb 5'-flanking region, we found that Tax1 transactivated the ICAM-1 promoter mainly via a cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE)-like site at -630 to -624 in the Jurkat T-cell line and via an NF-kappaB site at -185 to -177 and an SP-1 site at -59 to -54 in HeLa. On the other hand, Tax2 was totally inactive on the ICAM-1 promoter in Jurkat but transactivated the promoter via the NF-kappaB site at -185 to -177 in HeLa. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated proteins specifically binding to the CRE-like site at -630 to -624 in Tax1-expressing T-cell lines. Stable expression of Tax1 but not Tax2 in Jurkat subclones enhanced the surface expression of ICAM-1. The differential ability of Tax1 and Tax2 in transactivation of the ICAM-1 gene may be related to the differential pathogenicity of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2.","['Tanaka, Y', 'Hayashi, M', 'Takagi, S', 'Yoshie, O']","['Tanaka Y', 'Hayashi M', 'Takagi S', 'Yoshie O']","['Shionogi Institute for Medical Science, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*genetics', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.12.8508-8517.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Dec;70(12):8508-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.12.8508-8517.1996.,,,PMC190942,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Measurements of the width of the subarachnoid compartments were performed in 243 brain computed tomography (CT) examinations of 196 children examined during (125) and/or after (71) treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia without central nervous system involvement. Data were compared with normative data. RESULTS. Diffuse brain atrophy was observed in 74% and 65% of the CT examinations performed during and after cessation of treatment, respectively. The highest incidence of brain atrophy (78%) occurred during the administration of intrathecal chemotherapy. All children younger than 2 years of age exhibited brain atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Brain atrophy is the principal CT finding in the majority of children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and it can be attributed mainly to intrathecal chemotherapy. This finding can be observed long after therapy completion.","['Prassopoulos, P', 'Cavouras, D', 'Golfinopoulos, S', 'Evlogias, N', 'Theodoropoulos, V', 'Panagiotou, J']","['Prassopoulos P', 'Cavouras D', 'Golfinopoulos S', 'Evlogias N', 'Theodoropoulos V', 'Panagiotou J']","['Department of Radiology, University Hospital, Medical School of Crete, Iraklion, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Invest Radiol,Investigative radiology,0045377,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Atrophy/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging', 'Brain/diagnostic imaging/drug effects/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*diagnostic imaging/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00004424-199612000-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest Radiol. 1996 Dec;31(12):749-54. doi: 10.1097/00004424-199612000-00003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluates the validity of using tracer studies to predict radiation doses from therapy with the same radiolabeled antibody. METHODS: Quantitative imaging and blood radioactivity were used to obtain the pharmacokinetics and radiation doses that were delivered to the total body, blood, marrow, lungs, liver, kidneys, thyroid, spleen and tumors. Tracer and therapy data for eight patients with lymphoma and one patient with breast cancer were compared using linear regression statistics. Doses of 131I-labeled antibody for the tracer studies ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 GBq (2 to 10 mCi), and therapy doses ranged from 0.7 to 5.6 GBq (20 to 150 mCi). RESULTS: Radiation doses to tissues and, in particular, the bone marrow and tumors were reliably predicted from tracer studies. In this group of patients, median dose to marrow from marrow targeting, total body and blood was 9.2 cGy/GBq for tracer studies and 7.6 cGy/GBq for therapy studies with a median difference of 0.5 cGy/GBq. Median dose to tumors was 81.1 cGy/GBq for tracer studies and 70.3 cGy/GBq for therapy studies with a median difference of 5.9 cGy/GBq. CONCLUSION: In these patients, tracer studies were predictive of the radiation doses from therapy for total body, major organs and tumors. The radiation doses to marrow and tumors, which are the usual determinants of the therapeutic index, correlated well between tracer and therapy studies (r > or = 0.95).","['DeNardo, D A', 'DeNardo, G L', 'Yuan, A', 'Shen, S', 'DeNardo, S J', 'Macey, D J', 'Lamborn, K R', 'Mahe, M', 'Groch, M W', 'Erwin, W D']","['DeNardo DA', 'DeNardo GL', 'Yuan A', 'Shen S', 'DeNardo SJ', 'Macey DJ', 'Lamborn KR', 'Mahe M', 'Groch MW', 'Erwin WD']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of California Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/radiation effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/radiotherapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/radiotherapy', '*Radioimmunotherapy', 'Radiotherapy Dosage']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Nucl Med. 1996 Dec;37(12):1970-5.,,['P01-CA 47829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Single-channel measurements have indicated that disruption of actin filaments with cytochalasin D (CD) resulted in a considerable increase of the activity of non-voltage-gated sodium-permeable channels of 12 pS unitary conductance. Background activity of these channels was low; open probability (po) did not exceed 0.01-0.02. After CD, po grew at least 10-20 times. Cell-attached and whole-cell recordings showed that activation of sodium channels was elicited within 1-3 min after the addition of 10-20 micrograms/ml CD to the bath extracellular solution or in the presence of 5 micrograms/ml CD in the intracellular pipette solution. Preincubation of K562 cells with CD during 1 h also increased drastically the activity of 12 pS sodium channels. Whole-cell measurements confirmed that CD-activated channels were permeable to monovalent cations (preferentially to Na+ and Li+), but not to bivalent cations (Ca2+, Ba2+). Colchicine (1 microM), which affect microtubules, did not alter background channel activity. Our data indicate that actin filaments organization plays an important role in the regulation of sodium-permeable channels which may participate in providing passive Na+ influx in red blood cells.","['Negulyaev, Y A', 'Vedernikova, E A', 'Maximov, A V']","['Negulyaev YA', 'Vedernikova EA', 'Maximov AV']","['Institute of Cytology, Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Sodium Channels)', '22144-77-0 (Cytochalasin D)']",IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/*drug effects', '*Actins', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Cytochalasin D/*pharmacology', 'Electrophysiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Sodium Channels/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1091/mbc.7.12.1857 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 1996 Dec;7(12):1857-64. doi: 10.1091/mbc.7.12.1857.,,,PMC276035,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MRI patterns of the femoral marrow were compared among the FAB subtypes of acute leukemia, and the MRI patterns were correlated with prognosis. All five MRI patterns were observed in the femoral marrow in adult acute leukemia, and diffuse infiltration was most commonly seen (41.9%). A completely fatty marrow was also depicted in two cases (4.7%) and faint signal in four cases (9.3%) in spite of untreated acute leukemia. The M2 subtype of AML tended to be demonstrated as a minimally abnormal MRI finding, which was significantly different from the other types of AML. The patients who showed fatty marrow or faint signal were thought to have a good prognosis, while diffuse or heterogeneous infiltration was regarded as a poor prognostic sign. However, there were some exceptions to these rules, and no significant differences were revealed in prognosis between minimally abnormal and advanced MRI patterns.

RMR was measured by ventilated hood indirect calorimetry in 27 patients who had been in positive energy balance and 27 healthy control children matched pairwise for gender and fat free mass (FFM). Mean change in BMI s.d. score to 2 y was +1.0 (s.d. 1.3), 95% CI +0.5 to +1.5 (paired t, P < 0.01).

These patients show an inversion that, in contrast to the common inversions responsible for 1/5 of all haemophilia A, affects the first rather than intron 22 of the gene. This displaces the most telomeric of the factor VIII exons (exon 1) by approximately 100 kb towards the telomere, and close to the region of the C6.1A gene. This novel inversion creates two hybrid transcription units: one formed by the promoter and first exon of the factor VIII gene followed by a widely expressed sequence; the other by the promoter and coding region of the C6.1A gene plus most of the factor VIII gene (part of intron 1 and exons 2-26). Investigation of this transcription unit reveals that the C6.1A gene has an unsuspected intron in the region coding for the previously described 3'-untranslated tail of the message. Furthermore, exons located beyond the known C6.1A sequence and present in normal transcripts precede exons 2-26 of the factor VIII gene in the hybrid mRNA of the haemophilic twins. The factor VIII sequences in this hybrid mRNA are not expected to be expressed because they lack the first exon, encoding the prepeptide, and follow a translation stop in the C6.1A gene.

More recently, we have demonstrated that GM-CSF and IL-3 increase the sensitivity of acute myeloid leukemic (AML) cells to LAK activity. Together, these findings have prompted us to study the role of PRL on the target arm of the LAK response. We show here that CD33+ blasts from AML patients express membrane PRL-R and that the PRL/PRL-R interaction is followed by increased susceptibility to natural killer (NK) (p < 0.02) and LAK (p < 0.001) cells. As predicted from the dimerization model of PRL-R and in agreement with previous reports, the response of AML blasts to PRL was bell-shaped with a trend peak at 25 ng/ml. Although enhanced lysis occurred at the target recognition level, it was not accompanied by changes in the MHC class I, cellular adhesion molecules, or myeloid differentiation antigens. Cell cycle recruitment and lysis increased concurrently in three cases studied, suggesting a modulatory action of PRL on the expression of putative cycle-related NK/LAK-target structures.

In the presence of murine spleen cells, combination treatments using AZT plus Met-ENK or concanavalin A reduced FLV replication by 63% and 84%, respectively, as compared with 47% for AZT alone. When interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4 and interferon (IFN gamma) levels were measured in FLV-infected cell cultures, both AZT and Met-ENK treatments induced a higher production of IFN gamma and a slight increase in IL-2 and IL-4, as compared with either treatment alone. Subsequent treatment of FLV-infected cells with concanavalin A-stimulated cell supernatants, containing approximately 10 U/ml each of IFN gamma and IL-2, resulted in inhibition of viral replication. Thus, in the absence of spleen cells, IFN gamma was added to cell cultures to determine whether this cytokine contributed to combination antiviral effects. Results show that addition of IFN gamma alone results in a slight suppression of FLV expression, whereas treatment with both AZT and IFN gamma inhibits FLV replication significantly. Subsequently, addition of anti-IFN gamma antibody to cell cultures treated with Met-ENK blocked antiviral effects due to this neuropeptide. Thus anti-FLV effects of spleen cells treated with Met-ENK in combination with AZT are mediated to a large degree by IFN gamma.","['Sin, J I', 'Specter, S']","['Sin JI', 'Specter S']","['Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', '58569-55-4 (Enkephalin, Methionine)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enkephalin, Methionine/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Spleen/drug effects/immunology', 'Virus Replication/drug effects', 'Zidovudine/*pharmacology']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1996 Dec;279(3):1268-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is usually associated with an increased growth rate of the neoplastic cells and a generally more autonomous and aggressive biological behavior. However, it has not been established whether the more rapid growth rate and growth factor independence are consequences of the polyploid, karyotypically increasingly aberrant nature of these cells or whether the accelerated, more autonomous growth contributes to polyploidization. In this study, we have examined a recently described (H. J. Wajchman et al., Exp. Cell Res., 224: 312-322, 1996) series of sublines of HL60 cells with increasing resistance to the monocytic differentiation-inducing steroid hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) and found that growth factor independence, shown by reduced requirement for serum supplementation of the medium and the ability to grow at low seeding densities, precedes polyploidization of these cultures. The growth factor independence was found to be accompanied by constitutive changes in the DNA binding pattern of the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1, characteristic of an exposure to 1,25D3. Similar changes in the pattern of AP-1 binding were also observed in the 1,25D3-resistant HL60 sublines, but the intensity of the DNA binding by AP-1 was increased only in sublines with resistance to 1,25D3 but still near-diploid. The data suggest that the culture of HL60 cells in the presence of 1,25D3 results in constitutive up-regulation of growth-related machinery that reduces the need for growth factors and cytokines and demonstrate that this increased growth potential precedes polyploidization of the culture populations.","['Studzinski, G P', 'Rathod, B', 'Rao, J', 'Kheir, A', 'Wajchman, H J', 'Zhang, F', 'Finan, J B', 'Nowell, P C']","['Studzinski GP', 'Rathod B', 'Rao J', 'Kheir A', 'Wajchman HJ', 'Zhang F', 'Finan JB', 'Nowell PC']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMD-New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Growth Substances/blood/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', '*Polyploidy', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Dec 1;56(23):5513-21.,,['R01-CA-44722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The whole-cell and inside-out configuration of the patch-clamp technique was used to examine the channel properties after injection of in vitro transcribed cRNA into rat basophilic leukemia cells. The action of verapamil on current through mKv1.3 channels could be separated into an acceleration of the rate of current decay during depolarizing pulses and a reduction of steady state peak current when applied either extracellularly or intracellularly. Both effects were greatly reduced when the membrane-impermeable N-methyl-verapamil was applied extracellularly, but it affected current through mKv1.3 channels similar to verapamil if applied to the intracellular side of the membrane. Mutations in the outer vestibule of the mKv1.3 channel did not change the ability of verapamil to accelerate the mKv1.3 current decay during depolarizing pulses, whereas the reduction of the steady state peak current by verapamil applied either extracellularly and intracellularly and by N-methyl-verapamil applied intracellularly was decreased approximately 25-fold in all three cases. Substances known to interact with an extracellular site of the channel (e.g., extracellularly applied tetraethylammonium or kaliotoxin) did not compete with extracellularly applied verapamil on blocking steady state peak current, whereas intracellularly applied tetraethylammonium, which is known to interact with an intracellular site of the channel, was able to reduce the effect of extracellularly applied verapamil on blocking steady state peak current, suggesting competition for a common binding site between verapamil and intracellularly applied tetraethylammonium. The results from the competition experiments as well as from the mutations in the outer vestibule of mKv1.3 are compatible with the idea that verapamil applied extracellularly moves through the membrane to reach its internal binding site on the mKv1.3 channel.","['Rauer, H', 'Grissmer, S']","['Rauer H', 'Grissmer S']","['Department of Applied Physiology, University of Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Potassium Channels)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Ion Channel Gating', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Potassium Channels/chemistry/*drug effects', 'Rats', 'Verapamil/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1996 Dec;50(6):1625-34.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to other anthracenedione-based agents, this drug causes fewer side effects, mainly because it is resistant to metabolic reduction. We investigated the interaction between MXH2 and inorganic nitrite (NO2-) in aqueous solutions and found that this drug undergoes acid-catalyzed oxidation by nitrite. The rate of this reaction measured versus [NaNO2] at constant pH or versus pH at constant [NaNO2] was found to be directly proportional to the actual HNO2 concentration, indicating HNO2 to be the major oxidizing species. Involvement of .NO and/or NO2. radicals as minor oxidants is suggested based on the dependence of the rate of oxidation on the presence of air. Spectrophotometric and electron paramagnetic resonance analyses indicate that early products of the reaction are identical to those generated by oxidation of MXH2 by a horseradish peroxidase/hydrogen peroxide system. The major product is hexahydronaphtho[2,3-f]quinoxaline-7,12-dione, which is formed by intramolecular cyclization of one alkylamino side chain in the oxidized, diiminoquinone MX(N) form of the drug.

Exposure of CML-BC cells from 12 patients to c-myb antisense oligodeoxynucleotides resulted in significant (p<001) inhibition of leukemia colony formation (average inhibition 63%) and was accompanied by down-regulation of c-myb expression. Colonies derived from CML chronic phase progenitors were virtually unaffected in 10 cases, but down-regulation of c-myb expression was not detected. However, in studies conducted with CD34+ leukemia cells, a subset highly enriched for hematopoietic progenitors, colony formation was inhibited at both disease stages, whereas CFU-GM colony formation derived from normal CD34+ cells was not affected by exposure to c-myb antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. These data suggest that CML chronic phase and blast crisis progenitors are both sensitive to the inhibitory effects of c-myb antisense oligomers, and that the lack of inhibition in partially purified CML-chronic phase progenitors is probably due to inefficient penetration of oligodeoxynucleotides into the clonogenic cells. The preferential effect of c-myb antisense oligodeoxynucleotides on colonies arising from the compartment that includes CML-CD34+ progenitors likely reflects the expansion of a cell population with high proliferative potential and elevated c-myb mRNA levels.","['Szczylik, C', 'Skorski, T', 'Malaguarnera, L', 'Hetman, J', 'Chen, S T', 'Calabretta, B']","['Szczylik C', 'Skorski T', 'Malaguarnera L', 'Hetman J', 'Chen ST', 'Calabretta B']","['Department of Oncology, CSK WAM, Warszawa, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Poland,Folia Histochem Cytobiol,Folia histochemica et cytobiologica,8502651,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Primers', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/biosynthesis']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Folia Histochem Cytobiol. 1996;34(3-4):129-34.,,['CA46782/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The therapy has only a palliative effect and therefore the common attitude to the therapy is conservative (watch and wait policy). Monotherapy with alkylating cytostatics, usually chlorambucil, is considered by most authors to be the therapy of first choice. Only the French study showed superiority of polychemotherapy CHOP over monotherapy. New drugs for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia are purine-analogs. Fludarabine has been used mostly of this purine-analogs. The response rate to fludarabine therapy is 30-45% in pretreated patients and the response rate in the chemotherapy-naive patients is about 80%. 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine was used in the same indications and it showed that this drug had a similar effect in this disease as fludarabine. The contemporary indication for fludarabine is standard-chemotherapy-refractory disease. Whether this drug will be used for initial therapy, is a question. Interferon alpha is therapeutically active in early stages of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but it is unclear, if this response has any influence on survival. Interferon alpha is ineffective in advanced stages of this disease. The role of interferon alpha as the maintenance treatment after chemotherapy is heavily discussed.","['Adam, Z', 'Vorlicek, J', 'Hejlova, N']","['Adam Z', 'Vorlicek J', 'Hejlova N']","['II. interni klinika, FNsP Brno-Bohunice.']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Czech Republic,Vnitr Lek,Vnitrni lekarstvi,0413602,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Pentostatin/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Vnitr Lek. 1996 Aug;42(8):573-8.,,,,43,Lecba chronicke lymfaticke leukemie.,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe both a documented and a presumed case of ganciclovir-resistant CMV infection. A bone marrow transplant recipient with an episode of CMV viremia and antigenemia underwent broncho-alveolar lavage from which a CMV strain was isolated. The sensitivity of this strain to ganciclovir and foscarnet was tested in a plaque reduction assay, which was performed in 6 different fibroblast lines. The inhibitory drug concentration which reduced viral plaque formation by 50% (IC50) was a median of 12.7 microM (range 6.1-29.6) for ganciclovir (resistance defined as IC50 > 6 microM), which documented the presence of CMV resistance to ganciclovir. The strain was sensitive to foscarnet. This ganciclovir-resistant CMV strain had no clinical impact, although the patient was treated with ganciclovir. A second patient had Aids and subsequently developed CMV retinitis which was treated with intravenous ganciclovir for 3 weeks, followed by longterm oral ganciclovir therapy. Approximately 4 1/2 months after initiation of antiviral therapy the patient developed fatal CMV multi-organ disease while on continued oral ganciclovir treatment, which suggested the occurrence of CMV resistance to this agent. CMV organ disease was documented at autopsy by histology and immunochemistry, but virus was not cultured.

SETTING: Division of Haematology, University Hospital Nijmegen and the Red Cross Blood Bank Nijmegen, the Netherlands. DESIGN: Prospective, non-randomized study. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients who relapsed after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation were treated with infusion of lymphocytes from the original bone marrow donor. Lymphocytes were collected by means of leukapheresis. Follow-up was done by frequent checks at the outpatient clinic. RESULTS: Eleven of 15 (73%) patients with relapsed chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and only one of 13 patients (8%) with a relapse of acute leukaemia went into complete remission (p < 0.001). Entering complete remission was always preceded by acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The development of acute and/or chronic GVHD was significantly associated with the origin of T-lymphocytes in the blood of the recipient at the time of infusion. If the T-lymphocytes came mostly from the patient himself, the infusion remained usually without effect. If the T-lymphocytes came mostly from the donor, the patients went into complete remission. CONCLUSION: Patients with a relapse of leukaemia after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may enter complete remission after infusion of lymphocytes from the original marrow donor. This form of immunotherapy can be successful especially in patients with a relapsed CML with a relatively low percentage of autologous T-lymphocytes at the time of infusion.","['Schattenberg, A V', 'van de Wiel-van Kemenade, E', 'Bar, B M', 'Geurts van Kessel, A H', 'van der Maazen, R W', 'de Witte, T J']","['Schattenberg AV', 'van de Wiel-van Kemenade E', 'Bar BM', 'Geurts van Kessel AH', 'van der Maazen RW', 'de Witte TJ']","['Academisch Ziekenhuis, Nijmegen, Afd.

While tyrosine phosphorylation upon Fas-ligation was readily apparent in wild-type Jurkat cells (which are sensitive to anti-Fas-induced apoptosis), drastically reduced tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in Fas-resistant Jurkat subclones (which still express CD95 on their surface). More importantly, TCR/CD3-negative Jurkat variants which expressed normal levels of CD95 and were fully susceptible to Fas-triggered cell death, did not show any protein tyrosine phosphorylation upon Fas-ligation.

Cytologic diagnosis included nine large-cell and six small-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), three Hodgkin's lymphomas (HD), and two AML. Key cytologic features included markedly pleomorphic and monomorphic cell populations in HD and NHL, respectively, as well as lack of tumor cell cohesion and necrosis in all cases. Cytologically, acute leukemia may be difficult to differentiate from large-cell NHL, and small-cell NHL from reactive/benign small lymphocytes. Blood, scant cellularity, crush artifacts, and apparent molding may affect diagnostic accuracy. Immunocytochemistry in cell block sections of sputa and washings is useful in the diagnostic workup in selected cases.

The uptake of serotonin in these cells was saturable (Km, 3.37 microM; Vmax, 2.03 nmol/10(6) cells) and Na+ dependent; isoosmotic replacement of Na+ with choline chloride in the assay medium resulted in the decreased uptake process. Augmentation of intracellular free calcium, [Ca2+]i, by thapsigargin decreased the uptake of serotonin in these cells. Similarly, addition of calcium ionophores (A23187) and ionomycin also inhibited serotonin transport. In Fura-2-loaded cells, these agents increased the [Ca2+]i contents. These results suggest that an increase in [Ca2+]i is implicated with a decrease in serotonin transport. Since an increase in [Ca2+]i is known to activate calmodulin (CaM), we employed CaM antagonists. Calmodulin antagonists W-7 (N-[6-aminohexyl]-5-chloro-1-naphthalene-sulfonamide) and mellitin inhibited serotonin uptake in K562 cells, suggesting that CaM is involved in serotonin transport regulation. Furthermore, acute exposure of K562 cells to known protein kinase C (PKC) activators, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (DiC8), curtailed serotonin uptake by these cells. However, staurosporine (a PKC inhibitor) failed to abolish the inhibitory effects of PMA on serotonin transport in these cells, indicating that the target of PMA is not PKC. Nonetheless, the PMA-induced inhibitory effects are specific as 4 alpha-phorbol-12,13,didecanoate (a phorbol ester known not to activate PKC) failed to mimic PMA-like actions on serotonin transport in K562 cells. DiC8 not only exerted higher inhibitory effects than PMA but also had additive effects in the presence of the latter on serotonin transport. These results suggest that in addition to PKC, there are other cellular targets (of PMA) implicated in serotonin transport regulation.","['Khan, N A', 'Meyneil, J P', 'Deschaux, P']","['Khan NA', 'Meyneil JP', 'Deschaux P']","[""Laboratoire de Physiologie Animale, Unite d'Immuno-Physiologie Generale et Comparee, Universite de Limoges, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (Serotonin Antagonists)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calmodulin/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Serotonin/*metabolism', 'Serotonin Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/15 00:00,1996/09/15 00:01,['1996/09/15 00:00'],"['1996/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008874996902427 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1996.0242 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1996 Sep 15;172(2):269-74. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1996.0242.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these difficulties is related to a large amount of conditional probabilities to be assessed and in many cases this task was recognised to be practically insoluble. The MYCIN certainty factors model is a widely distributed pragmatical approach for modeling reasoning under uncertainty that substantially simplifies the problem, at the sacrifice of theoretical soundness. One can determine certainty factors as a function of prior and posterior probability. However, this approach is only consistent with the modularity axiom for certainty factors for tree-structure inference networks, which is rarely true for practical applications. In this paper we abandon the requirement of a direct probabilistic interpretation of certainty factors and build a model of propagation of uncertainty in terms of absolute belief and belief updates. We describe our model for propagating uncertainty in terms of matrix multiplication with specifically defined addition and multiplication which correspond to parallel and sequential combinations of certainty factors. It is possible to define these operations in such a manner that they form a field, and therefore to obtain some useful properties. Finally we present a method of determining certainty factors from statistical data using nonlinear regression and illustrate it with a leukemia diagnostics problem.","['Cruz, G P', 'Beliakov, G']","['Cruz GP', 'Beliakov G']","['Dto. de Hematologia, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Santafe de Bogota, Colombia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Artif Intell Med,Artificial intelligence in medicine,8915031,,IM,"['Artificial Intelligence', '*Expert Systems', 'Models, Theoretical', '*Probability']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['093336579500016X [pii]', '10.1016/0933-3657(95)00016-x [doi]']",ppublish,Artif Intell Med. 1996 Feb;8(1):1-14. doi: 10.1016/0933-3657(95)00016-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report on a patient with a low grade malignant lymphoma of the b-cell type with optic nerve involvement. PATIENT: In 1990 a 38-year old patient presented with typical symptoms of optic neuritis in the left eye. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a signal enhancement in the left optic nerve. Hematologically a well differentiated Non Hodgkin's lymphoma of the b-cell type was diagnosed. Neurological signs and symptoms in the following years were regarded as manifestations of multiple sclerosis (MS). In 1994 the patient presented with an acute visual loss in the right eye. MRI this time revealed a signal enhancement in the right optic nerve and a big CNS lesion. Gradually a bilateral partial optic nerve atrophy developed. The cerebrospinal fluid contained atypical lymphocytes, matching with the cells in the peripheral blood, morphologically and in the fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). These findings suggest an intracerebral manifestation of a well differentiated Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Low grade malignant well-differentiated Non-Hodgkin lymphomas infiltrate the optic nerve. The clinical course in our case mimicked multiple sclerosis.","['Dunker, S', 'Reuter, U', 'Rosler, A', 'Wiegand, W']","['Dunker S', 'Reuter U', 'Rosler A', 'Wiegand W']","['Medizinisches Zentrum fur Augenheilkunde, Philipps-Universitat Marburg.']",['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Ophthalmologe,Der Ophthalmologe : Zeitschrift der Deutschen Ophthalmologischen Gesellschaft,9206148,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cranial Nerve Neoplasms/*diagnosis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*diagnosis', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Optic Atrophy/diagnosis', 'Optic Nerve/pathology', 'Optic Nerve Diseases/*diagnosis']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ophthalmologe. 1996 Aug;93(4):351-3.,,,,,Sehnervenbeteiligung bei chronisch-lymphatischer Leukamie der B-Zell-Reihe.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, it is valued positively by students. On the other hand, lecturing is usually valued negatively. Teaching of epidemiology and social medicine is further handicapped by the fact that students consider it irrelevant. In 1994/95, one of 18 social medicine courses for fifth year medical students at Hannover Medical School was problem-based. The following ""cases"" were used: 1. rheumatic patient with various social medical problems (losing sick pay, receiving status as handicapped person, early retirement etc.), 2. cluster of patients with leukaemia in the surroundings of a nuclear power plant and 3. recent newspaper articles on the effects of the 1993 Health Care Reform Law (dentists refusing to treat patients because of a fixed budget, introduction of prepayment methods in hospital etc.). Evaluation by the students at the end of the course revealed that PBL is well accepted in social medicine. Students rated learning success, relevance of the subject compared to other disciplines and the ability to transfer the acquired knowledge into medical practice well above the traditional courses. Besides lectures, practical courses and seminars, PBL should therefore be used as a standard method of learning in undergraduate medical education.","['Busse, R']",['Busse R'],"['Abt.

This region was very out-of-the-way before German reunification. With its static indigenous population, and the retrieval possibilities of respective archives, it offered good conditions for a long-term study over four decades; 13 out of 63 administrative district communities could be randomly selected for research. Between 1950 and 1993, 144 patients who contracted either leukaemia or another type of malignant neoplasm of the lymphoid and haematopoetic tissues were recorded (Pos. C 81-C 96 ICD 10). When these patients' dwellings were charted, a sporadic, inconspicious, temporal-spatial distribution became apparent in seven out of 13 localities. However, in six of the 13 communities there was the same limited local concentration of cases spread over a period of time, as had been observed in the abovementioned village. This cartographically noticeable concentration was termed ""cluster""; in these ""clusters"", both locals and long-term residents were affected. What these ""clusters"" have in common topographically is that they are noticeably located in moist areas. The study clearly demonstrates the difficulties in assessing these cartographically significant ""clusters"" from a statistical point of view, i.e. in making a risk quantification for small populations and with insufficient demographic data. Therefore, no statement can be made as to whether the observed ""clusters"" represent change findings, or rather, an epidemiological, i.e. endemic fundamental pattern of leukaemia and haemoblastoses; one that, within a shorter observation period, must remain undetected-that is, could be disguised by population migrations.","['Curio, F']",['Curio F'],"['Landratsamt Kronach, Gesundheitswesen.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Gesundheitswesen,Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany)),9204210,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural Population/*statistics & numerical data']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gesundheitswesen. 1996 Jul;58(7):391-9.,,,,,Leukamien und andere Hamoblastosen: Beschreibung einer Auffalligkeit ihres kleinraumigen Auftretens und die Schwierigkeit der Bewertung.

The TEL/PDGF beta R is an unusual fusion of a putative transcription factor, TEL, to a receptor tyrosine kinase. The translocation fuses the amino terminus of TEL, containing the helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain, to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of the PDGF beta R. We hypothesized that TEL/PDGF beta R self-association, mediated by the HLH domain of TEL, would lead to constitutive activation of the PDGF beta R tyrosine kinase domain and cellular transformation. Analysis of in vitro-translated TEL/ PDGF beta R confirmed that the protein self-associated and that self-association was abrogated by deletion of 51 aa within the TEL HLH domain. In vivo, TEL/PDGF beta R was detected as a 100-kDa protein that was constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine and transformed the murine hematopoietic cell line Ba/F3 to interleukin 3 growth factor independence. Transformation of Ba/F3 cells required the HLH domain of TEL and the kinase activity of the PDGF beta R portion of the fusion protein. Immunoblotting demonstrated that TEL/PDGF beta R associated with multiple signaling molecules known to associate with the activated PDGF beta R, including phospholipase C gamma 1, SHP2, and phosphoinositol-3-kinase.

One activating Kit mutation substitutes a valine for aspartic acid at codon 816 (D816V) and is frequently observed in human mastocytosis. Mutation at the equivalent position in the murine c-kit gene, involving a substitution of tyrosine for aspartic acid (D814Y), has been described in the mouse mastocytoma cell line P815. We have investigated the mechanism of oncogenic activation by this mutation. Expression of this mutant Kit receptor tyrosine kinase in a mast cell line led to the selective tyrosine phosphorylation of a 130-kDa protein and the degradation, through the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway, of a 65-kDa phosphoprotein. The 65-kDa protein was identified as the src homology domain 2 (SH2)-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, a negative regulator of signaling by Kit and other hematopoietic receptors, and the protein product of the murine motheaten locus. This mutation also altered the sites of receptor autophosphorylation and peptide substrate selectivity. Thus, this mutation activates the oncogenic potential of Kit by a novel mechanism involving an alteration in Kit substrate recognition and the degradation of SHP-1, an attenuator of the Kit signaling pathway.","['Piao, X', 'Paulson, R', 'van der Geer, P', 'Pawson, T', 'Bernstein, A']","['Piao X', 'Paulson R', 'van der Geer P', 'Pawson T', 'Bernstein A']","['Program in Molecular Biology and Cancer, Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, ON Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn6 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mast Cells/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Substrate Specificity/genetics']",1996/12/10 00:00,1996/12/10 00:01,['1996/12/10 00:00'],"['1996/12/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/10 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.25.14665 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Dec 10;93(25):14665-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.25.14665.,,,PMC26192,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The schedule of drug administration appears to be a clinical risk factor for this devastating treatment complication. PURPOSE: We tested the hypothesis that prolonged exposure of leukemia cells in vitro to low concentrations of etoposide, compared with short exposures to high concentrations, could produce equivalent or greater desired cytotoxic effects, with decreased occurrence of undesired site-specific double-stranded DNA recombinational events (i.e., recombinogenesis). METHODS: We used the frequency of V(D)J (variable-diversity-joining) recombinase-mediated deletions of exons 2 and 3 of the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene as a biomarker of etoposide-induced, nonhomologous, site-specific DNA rearrangement. A polymerase chain reaction-based technique was used to measure exon 2 + 3 deletions in human lymphoid leukemia CCRF-CEM cells 6 days after either 4-hour or 24-hour treatment with etoposide at clinically relevant concentrations. Cytotoxic effects of etoposide (determined by the number of viable cells present in the treated compared with the control [i.e., untreated] cells) were measured 6 days after treatment of the cells. The frequency of the exon 2 + 3 deletion following the two treatment-duration conditions was compared by use of the Mantel-Haenszel statistic. All P values resulted from two-sided tests. RESULTS: Cytotoxicity increased with increasing etoposide concentration and exposure duration, as expected. By day 6, the frequency of exon 2 + 3 deletions was significantly higher (global P value = .0003) after the 4-hour treatment than after the 24-hour treatment, regardless of whether the frequency was assessed at etoposide concentrations achieving equivalent (e.g., 95%) cytotoxicity (14.2 x 10(-7) versus 4.1 x 10(-7) or at equivalent etoposide concentrations (e.g., 1 microM) (10.8 x 10(-7) versus 1.3 x 10(-7). Thus, the ratio of desired cytotoxic to undesired recombinogenic effects was higher with the 24-hour schedule. After the treated cells were subcloned at limiting dilutions, the frequency of the exon 2 + 3 deletion increased from 16.3 x 10(-7) to 4.33 x 10(-3), indicating that the recombinational event is not necessarily lethal. CONCLUSION: For all drug concentrations and levels of cytotoxicity studied in CCRF-CEM cells, there was a greater ratio of cytotoxicity to genetic recombination following prolonged exposure to etoposide than following brief exposure. IMPLICATION: These data suggest that recombinogenesis is not inextricably linked to cytotoxicity. If confirmed in the clinical setting, the use of prolonged dosage schedules may provide a means to decrease the risk of etoposide-induced acute myeloid leukemia without compromising treatment efficacy.","['Chen, C L', 'Fuscoe, J C', 'Liu, Q', 'Pui, C H', 'Mahmoud, H H', 'Relling, M V']","['Chen CL', 'Fuscoe JC', 'Liu Q', 'Pui CH', 'Mahmoud HH', 'Relling MV']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101-0318, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Etoposide/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Exons/drug effects', 'Gene Rearrangement/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/12/18 00:00,1996/12/18 00:01,['1996/12/18 00:00'],"['1996/12/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/18 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/88.24.1840 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1996 Dec 18;88(24):1840-7. doi: 10.1093/jnci/88.24.1840.,,"['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1996 Dec 18;88(24):1787-9.

To determine the structure-activity relationship, various nucleobase analogues of EUrd, such as 5-fluorouracil, thymine, cytosine, 5-fluorocytosine, adenine, and guanine derivatives, were synthesized by condensation of 1-O-acetyl-2,3,5-tri-O-benzoyl-3-C-ethynyl-alpha,beta-D-ribo-pentofur anose (6) and the corresponding pertrimethylsilylated nucleobases in the presence of SnCl4 or TMSOTf as a Lewis acid in CH3CN followed by debenzoylation.

Diazonium salts prepared from aminoazonafides were key intermediates for many of the analogues. Six of the new compounds were more potent than azonafide in a panel of tumor cells including human melanoma and ovarian carcinoma and murine L1210 leukemias. Three of these compounds, the 10-OCH3, 10-OC2H5, and 10-F analogues, had better ratios of cardiotoxicity to tumor-cell toxicity than azonafide. Eight compounds were not cross-resistant with MDR L1210 leukemia, and the 10-CN analogue was more potent against solid tumor cells than leukemia cells. The 9-OH, 10-CN, and 10-F analogues had high potency against both sensitive and resistant cell lines of MFX 7 breast carcinoma and WiDr colon carcinoma and sensitivity A599 lung carcinoma. Advantages of the 10-Cl, 10-NH2, and 10-CN analogues over azonafide were apparent in P388 leukemia in mice, and the 10-CN analogue was more effective than doxorubicin in this assay. Quantitative structure-activity relationship studies revealed statistically significant correlations between DNA binding strength of 8- and 10-substituted azonafides, as measured by deltaTm, and toxicity to tumor cells. There also were correlations between substituent size, as measured by MR, and cytotoxicity for 9- and 10-substituted azonafides and between MR and deltaTm for 4- and 11-substituted azonafides. Lipophilicity of substituents (pi) correlated with cytotoxicity for 9-, 10-, and 11-substituted azonafides. These results lend support to a model in which DNA binding strength influences cytotoxic potency, and lipophilicity increases DNA binding whereas large substituents decrease it.","['Sami, S M', 'Dorr, R T', 'Alberts, D S', 'Solyom, A M', 'Remers, W A']","['Sami SM', 'Dorr RT', 'Alberts DS', 'Solyom AM', 'Remers WA']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Arizona, Tucson 85721, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isoquinolines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/12/06 00:00,1996/12/06 00:01,['1996/12/06 00:00'],"['1996/12/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/06 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/jm960623g [doi]', 'jm960623g [pii]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1996 Dec 6;39(25):4978-87. doi: 10.1021/jm960623g.,,"['CA49875/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM52795/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['J Med Chem 1997 Aug 1;40(16):2660'],,,,,,,,,

To determine whether CIF blocks at the level of IL2 transcription, we introduced reporter plasmids into the human T leukemia cell line Jurkat by transient transfection. These contained the luciferase gene under the control of either the human IL2 upstream enhancer region (segments -326 to +45) or three repeats of the NFAT element contained within it (segments -255 to -285). Expression of luciferase in these cells was induced by phorbol myristate acetate plus a calcium ionophore. CIF inhibited induction of either construct as did cyclosporine, which is known to block activation of the NFAT element. CIF failed to inhibit several other enhancer elements. The NFAT-controlled luciferase gene system distinguishes CIF from other T cell inhibitory activities present in colostrum, in particular, TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 2 and the glucocorticoids. Stably transfected Jurkat cells behaved similarly to the transiently transfected ones with respect to inhibition by CIF and cyclosporine.

Stromal alterations were accompanied by shifts in thymocyte differentiation and the appearance of the leukaemogenic mink cell focus-forming (MCF) murine leukaemia virus.","['Davey, G M', 'Tucek-Szabo, C L', 'Boyd, R L']","['Davey GM', 'Tucek-Szabo CL', 'Boyd RL']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Monash University Medical School, Prahran, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Thymus Gland/*cytology/immunology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/immunology/*pathology']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(95)00102-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(95)00102-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Oct;20(10):853-66. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(95)00102-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In search of an easily accessible diagnostic parameter, expression of CD44 standard (CD44s) and CD44 variant isoforms (exons v5, v6, v7 and v10) in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) of patients with hematological malignancies was evaluated by fluorescence activated cell scanning. The analysis of 30 blood samples of healthy donors and patients with non-malignant diseases and of 183 blood samples of patients with malignant hematological disorders revealed that only in patients with malignant disorders did a measurable proportion of PBLs express CD44 variant isoforms, mostly exons v5, v6, v7 and, less frequently, exon v10. Elevated levels of CD44v expression were noted in PBLs of patients with acute and chronic myeloid leukemia (AML: 16%, CML: 25%), Hodgkin's disease (HD: 17%), multiple myeloma (MM: 22%), polycythemia vera (PV: 33%), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL: 23%) and, most frequently, in PBLs of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL:54%). CD44v expression was not restricted to the malignant phenotype, but instead was also noted in T cells, B cells and monocytes, preferentially in a subpopulation of large cells. Furthermore, expression of CD44v in PBLs was not linked to the histological grading or clinical staging. There was, however, an inverse correlation with tumor progression, whereas response to therapy was frequently accompanied by upregulation of CD44v. Thus, expression of CD44v in the PBLs of patients with NHL mainly reflected immune responsiveness. Since NHL manifests itself primarily in lymphoid organs, its progression is difficult to follow. Monitoring of CD44v in PBLs could be used as an additional and convenient parameter for surveying the course of disease.","['Khaldoyanidi, S', 'Achtnich, M', 'Hehlmann, R', 'Zoller, M']","['Khaldoyanidi S', 'Achtnich M', 'Hehlmann R', 'Zoller M']","['Department of Tumor Progression, and Immune Defense, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,['0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(96)00048-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00048-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Oct;20(10):839-51. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00048-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an effort to determine the distribution of TPO and MPL in the different hematopoietic cell types and in various types of tissue, we examined the mRNA expression of this ligand-receptor pair in two series of human leukemia-lymphoma cell lines and of solid tumor cancer cell lines using northern blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. At the northern blot mRNA level, 8/15 (53%) megakaryocytic and 3/11 (27%) erythroid leukemia cell lines expressed MPL mRNA; except for one positive monocytic cell line, the remaining 78 pre B-cell, B-cell, plasma cell, T-cell, NK cell, myeloid, monocytic and Hodgkin/anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL)-derived cell lines were negative. No MPL message was detected in any of the 23 solid tumor cell lines established from 21 different tumors. In order to examine whether a low level of MPL expression could be detected, 51 leukemia cell lines were investigated with the RT-PCR technique. By this technique, MPL message was seen in many more cell types: 13/26 (50%) of non-erythromegakaryocytic cell lines and in nearly all megakaryocytic (14/15, 93%) and erythroid (10/11, 91%) cell lines. Thus, the highest expression of MPL clearly occurs in cells with megakaryocytic differentiation; furthermore, expression of MPL appears to be restricted to hematopoietic cell types. TPO mRNA expression was examined by RT-PCR and found in 9/11 (82%) of the solid tumor cell lines (derived from colon, endometrium, kidney, liver, ovary, retinoblastoma and urinary bladder cancers). Among the leukemia-lymphoma cell lines, TPO mRNA was detected by RT-PCR in most plasma cell, myeloid, megakaryocytic and erythroid cell lines, but not in pre B-cell, B-cell or T-/NK-cell lines. The results reported here extend the observations of MPL and TPO expression in normal cells to the whole spectrum of hematological cell types and to an array of different tissue types, both exemplified by their malignant counterparts.","['Graf, G', 'Dehmel, U', 'Drexler, H G']","['Graf G', 'Dehmel U', 'Drexler HG']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', '*Gene Expression', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Thrombopoietin/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(96)00057-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00057-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Oct;20(10):831-8. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00057-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Translocations t(8;21), t(15;17) and inv(16) may account for up to 30% of all cases of adult and childhood AML and their identification either by cytogenetics or molecular techniques is becoming of crucial importance for the routine diagnosis and treatment of AML, since they allow the identification of patients whose likelihood of cure is remarkably better. In these patients, the need of myeloablative protocols, supported by autologous or allogeneic transplantation, may not be required at least in first remission, and this can prevent the delivery of inappropriately toxic therapies. On the other hand, patients whose blasts are showing rearrangements of 11q23 band had a significantly worse prognosis and its precise identification may help the accrual to more appropriate and aggressive therapeutic protocols. These molecular markers are offering new tools, which are extremely sensitive, for the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) for a growing number of AML patients. Although very promising in acute promyelocytic leukemia, the clinical significance and utility to investigate MRD persistence may be different for other the AML subgroups and caution should be taken in transferring these data to the clinical practice outside prospective controlled clinical trials.","['Biondi, A', 'Rambaldi, A']","['Biondi A', 'Rambaldi A']","['Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', '*Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Remission Induction', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(96)00022-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00022-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Oct;20(10):801-7. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(96)00022-7.,,,,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amphotericin B was initiated early in the febrile neutropenic episode at a dose of 1-1.5 mg/kg per day. Four of the five patients had normal chest films at the time amphotericin B was started and only later developed infiltrates, which subsequently progressed to cavitation formation with resolution of the infiltrates around the cavitations. This is compatible with primary aspergilloma or invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The patients experienced partial (2 patients) or complete resolution (3 patients) of the process, and none died of the fungal infection. In the past, infection with invasive aspergillosis carried a high mortality. We believe that this positive outcome constitutes a change in the natural history of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in neutropenic patients as a result of the early initiation of high dose amphotericin B. We recommend the early empiric use of amphotericin B therapy in febrile neutropenic patients not responding to broad-spectrum antibiotics, and that the minimal initial dose be 1 mg/kg per day especially in institutions carrying a high incidence of aspergillosis.","['Ruchlemer, R', 'Yinnon, A M', 'Hershko, C']","['Ruchlemer R', 'Yinnon AM', 'Hershko C']","['Hematology Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Israel,Isr J Med Sci,Israel journal of medical sciences,0013105,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amphotericin B/*therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Isr J Med Sci. 1996 Nov;32(11):1089-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, we selected 50% TCA as a fixative agent which made the final absorbance of the SRB assay to be exactly matched to the cell density with a small deviation and a low background. Besides the change of TCA concentration, a precentifugation of microplate just before fixation also improved the previous assay procedures in the two points of view.

Mutations within p53, which are only detected in cell lines established from transplanted tumors, have been previously shown to be associated with the immortalization of erythroleukemic cells in culture. In this study, we have demonstrated that primary erythroleukemic cells grown in liquid culture undergo rapid apoptosis independent of the stabilization of wild-type p53 protein. Further confirmation that the programmed cell death observed for liquid-cultured F-MuLV-induced primary erythroleukemic cells is largely p53 independent was provided by experimentation with a transgenic mouse line containing multiple copies of the dominant negative mutant p53Pro-193 allele. Erythroleukemic cells taken from tumor-bearing transgenic mice expressing high levels of the mutant p53Pro-193 undergo programmed cell death in culture in a manner that is largely identical to that observed for tumor cells derived from nontransgenic littermates. Furthermore, the rate of development of F-MuLV-induced erythroleukemias for both p53Pro-193-transgenic and nontransgenic littermates are similar. Moreover, cytogenetic analysis indicates that primary erythroleukemia cells are diploid, whereas chromosomal aberrations were observed in all established cell lines. These results are consistent with the notion that mutations within the p53 tumor suppressor gene affect genomic stability, subsequently leading to changes in gene expression that are associated with the immortalization of erythroid progenitor cells.","['Howard, J', 'Ung, Y', 'Adachi, D', 'Ben-David, Y']","['Howard J', 'Ung Y', 'Adachi D', 'Ben-David Y']","['Division of Cancer Biology Research, Sunnybrook Health Science Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/physiology', 'Karyotyping', '*Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', '*Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Organ Size', '*Retroviridae Infections', 'Spleen', 'Transgenes/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/physiology/virology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology', '*Tumor Virus Infections']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1996 Dec;7(12):1651-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sublethal concentrations of bleomycin (1 microgram/ml) induced a decrease in cell growth in both vector-only and bcl-2-transfected U937 cells. In MNC-transfected U937 cells, loss of viable cells and colony-forming cells was observed following 4 days of bleomycin treatment. This was accompanied by accumulation of cells in the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle and morphological changes as well as induced expression of markers associated with myeloid differentiation (i.e., increased granularity and CD11b expression). In contrast, bcl-2-transfected U937 cells maintained viable cell numbers and colony forming cells for up to 2 weeks in the presence of bleomycin. These cells did not show cell cycle accumulation in G0-G1 and in addition, displayed delayed expression of differentiation markers when compared with bleomycin-treated, vector-only transfected U937 cells. One day following a 5-day exposure to 1 microgram/ml bleomycin, a loss of differentiated cells by apoptosis, as demonstrated by dUTP and analyzed by flow cytometry, was observed in the MNC-transfected U937 cell population. In contrast, differentiated bcl-2-transfected U937 cells remained viable for 2 weeks following bleomycin treatment. The results of this study suggest that up-regulated Bcl-2 not only blocks apoptosis in proliferating myeloid cells but also delays or prevents apoptosis in differentiated myeloid cells.","['Guedez, L', 'Zucali, J']","['Guedez L', 'Zucali J']","['Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville 32610, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bleomycin/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Free Radicals/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Up-Regulation/physiology']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1996 Dec;7(12):1625-31.,,['AI 24709/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has been attributed to the activity of p210bcr-abl tyrosine kinase present in the K562 cells, which is known to suppress drug-induced apoptosis. Recently, K562 cells have been shown to express the antiapoptosis Bcl-xL but not Bcl-2 proteins. To investigate the contribution of Bcl-xL toward resistance to drug-induced apoptosis, we created K562/Bcl-xS and K562/neo cells by electroporating the expression plasmids pSFFVneo-Bcl-xS and pSFFVneo, containing the bcl-xS and neomycin resistance genes, respectively, into K562 cells. K562/Bcl-xS but not K562/neo cells expressed the bcl-xS mRNA and p19Bcl-xS protein. In contrast, both cell types expressed equivalent levels of Bcl-xL, Bax, Bcl-2, Myc, retinoblastoma, p21cbor-abl, and p145abl proteins. A significant increase in the hemoglobin levels was observed in the K562/Bcl-xS compared with the K562/neo cells (P < 0.05). In addition, K562/Bcl-xS cells were significantly more sensitive than K562/neo cells to undergoing erythroid differentiation induced by low-dose 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) and hexamethyl bisacetamide (P < 0.05), but not by all-trans-retinoic acid. Low-dose ara-C- or hexamethyl bisacetamide-induced differentiation was not associated with apoptosis of K562/Bcl-xS or K562/neo cells. Low-dose ara-C-induced erythroid differentiation was accompanied by conversion of the retinoblastoma protein to predominantly its underphosphorylated isoform as well as by down-regulation of Myc levels in K562/Bcl-xS and K562/neo cells. Importantly, exposure to high-dose ara-C (HIDAC; 100 microM ara-C for 4 h) caused internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and the morphological features of apoptosis in K562/Bcl-xS cells. These effects were modestly enhanced by cotreatment with HIDAC plus herbimycin A. In contrast, K562/neo cells were completely resistant to HIDAC- and herbimycin A-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that the expression of Bcl-xS induces erythroid differentiation and partially sensitizes chronic myelogenous leukemia-blast crisis-derived K562 cells to ara-C-induced differentiation and apoptosis.","['Ray, S', 'Bullock, G', 'Nunez, G', 'Tang, C', 'Ibrado, A M', 'Huang, Y', 'Bhalla, K']","['Ray S', 'Bullock G', 'Nunez G', 'Tang C', 'Ibrado AM', 'Huang Y', 'Bhalla K']","['Department of Medicine, Winship Cancer Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlenta, Georgia 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'I16QD7X297 (Neomycin)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Neomycin', 'Plasmids', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Transfection', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1996 Dec;7(12):1617-23.,,"['CA56613/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63382/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four control lambs were inoculated with minimal essential medium supplemented with fetal calf serum. The animals were monitored during a period of 24 months. Beginning at 5 to 12 months after inoculation, four of the five lambs inoculated with the fresh HTLV-I-infected peripheral blood cells began to develop detectable levels of antibodies to a recombinant HTLV-I gp21env antigen, as determined by an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). The anti-gp21 antibodies persisted for the remaining observation period. These antibodies were not detected in the sera from the other sheep. Absorption and blocking experiments demonstrated the specificity of the gp21 reactivity. This reactivity was also confirmed by Western blot (WB). With the exception of the serum of an MT-2-inoculated sheep that formed a weak band with p19 by WB, none of the sera of the four gp21-positive sheep or of the other experimental sheep reacted with other structural or regulatory HTLV-I proteins, as determined by ELISA, WB, and radioimmunoassay. PCR analyses demonstrated the presence of the HTLV-I provirus in peripheral blood leukocytes of the four sheep showing antibodies to gp21env. The remaining sheep were negative. PCR analyses failed to detect BLV sequences in any of the experimental sheep. None of the sheep showed clinical abnormalities during the observation period.

This virus is associated with a variety of autoimmune disorders. The possible association between HTLV-I Infection and autoimmune thyroiditis has not been fully studied. We therefore evaluated anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TGAb) in the sera of patients with ATL, carriers of HTLV-I, and in healthy control subjects to investigate the possible association between such infection and auto-immune thyroiditis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two ATL patients (21 males, 31 females; mean age 56.4 years) and 50 HTLV-I carriers (18 males, 32 females; mean age 56.7 years) were studied. The control subjects were 877 healthy adults (271 males, 606 females; mean age 54.8 years) who were negative for HTLV-I antibody. TPOAb, TGAb, thyroxine (T4) and thyrotrophin (TSH) were measured in serum using a radioimmunoassay kit. RESULTS: Positivity for thyroid autoantibodies (TPOAb and/or TGAb) was found in 21 of 52 ATL patients (40.4%), 15 of 50 HTLV-I carriers (30.0%), and 120 of 877 control subjects (13.7%). The difference between the HTLV-I-Infected and the control subjects was statistically significant (P < 0.005). Female control subjects had a significantly higher prevalence of positivity for thyroid autoantibodies than the males (17.3 vs 5.5%, P < 0.001). Carriers of HTLV-I and patients with ATL of each sex showed an equally high prevalence of positivity for thyroid autoantibodies. Of the subjects who were positive for thyroid autoantibody, 7.5% of control subjects, 19.0% of ATL patients, and 40.0% of HTLV-I carriers had hypothyroidism. A significant difference in this respect was noted between the HTLV-I infected subjects and the control subjects (P < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a high prevalence of positivity for thyroid autoantibodies (TPOAb and/ or TGAb) in the adult T-cell leukaemia patients and the HTLV-I carriers. The adult T-cell leukaemia patients and the HTLV-I carriers each had a high prevalence of hypothyroidism.

Cross talk between endocrine control of stress response and cellular antioxidant defense system.,2469-77,"Adaptation to stress evokes a variety of biological responses, including activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and synthesis of a panel of stress-response proteins at cellular levels: for example, expression of thioredoxin (TRX) is significantly induced under oxidative conditions. Glucocorticoids, as a peripheral effector of the HPA axis, exert their actions via interaction with a ligand-inducible transcription factor glucocorticoid receptor (GR). However, how these stress responses coordinately regulate cellular metabolism is still unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that either antisense TRX expression or cellular treatment with H2O2 negatively modulates GR function and decreases glucocorticoid-inducible gene expression. Impaired cellular response to glucocorticoids is rescued by overexpression of TRX, most possibly through the functional replenishment of the GR. Moreover, not only the ligand binding domain but the DNA binding domain of the GR is also suggested to be a direct target of TRX. Together, we here present evidence showing that cellular glucocorticoid responsiveness is coordinately modulated by redox state and TRX level and propose that cross talk between neuroendocrine control of stress responses and cellular antioxidant systems may be essential for mammalian adaptation processes.","['Makino, Y', 'Okamoto, K', 'Yoshikawa, N', 'Aoshima, M', 'Hirota, K', 'Yodoi, J', 'Umesono, K', 'Makino, I', 'Tanaka, H']","['Makino Y', 'Okamoto K', 'Yoshikawa N', 'Aoshima M', 'Hirota K', 'Yodoi J', 'Umesono K', 'Makino I', 'Tanaka H']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Asahikawa Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)', '10465-78-8 (Diamide)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Northern', 'CHO Cells', 'COS Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Diamide/pharmacology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Mammals', 'Neoplasm Proteins/pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Thioredoxins/*biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Transfection']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI119065 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1996 Dec 1;98(11):2469-77. doi: 10.1172/JCI119065.,,,PMC507704,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unexpected observations of delayed cumulative toxicity prompted a search for a second generation antimetabolite with a more favorable biochemical, pharmacological and toxicological profile. LY309887, 6R-2',5'-thienyl-5, 10-dideazatetrahydrofolic acid, had 9-fold greater potency to inhibit GARFT (Ki = 6.5 nM) compared to lometrexol. Like lometrexol, LY309887 was activated by folpolyglutamate synthetase, however, it had a lower first order rate constant. In vitro and in vivo data were consistent with these observations: polyglutamation of LY309887 was less extensive compared to lometrexol and livers of mice accumulated fewer polyglutamates of LY309887 than polyglutamates of lometrexol. The affinities of these two compounds for isoforms of human folate receptors (FR) were compared. Lometrexol had a 6-fold higher affinity for FR alpha than LY309887 and both compounds had higher affinity for the alpha isoform compared to the beta isoform. The selectivity of LY309887 for FR alpha (beta (Ki)/ alpha (Ki) = 10.5) was twice that of lometrexol's (beta / alpha = 5.0). Lometrexol and LY309887 were potent cytotoxic compounds against the human leukemia cell line CCRF-CEM with IC50's of 2.9 nM and 9.9 nM, respectively. In vivo, LY309887 was more potent than lometrexol at inhibiting tumor growth in the C3H mammary murine tumor model and several tumor xenografts. Excellent efficacy was achieved by both compounds in several colon xenografts. In two pancreatic human xenografts, LY309887 achieved greater efficacy than lometrexol. In summary, the biochemical and pharmacological properties of lometrexol and LY309887 support the hypothesis that these antifolates will have clinical activity against human solid tumors. LY309887 is a second generation GARFT inhibitor with biochemical and pharmacological properties which distinguish it from lometrexol and suggest that it will have broad antitumor activity, a different pharmacokinetic profile and produce less toxicity than lometrexol in cancer patients.","['Mendelsohn, L G', 'Shih, C', 'Schultz, R M', 'Worzalla, J F']","['Mendelsohn LG', 'Shih C', 'Schultz RM', 'Worzalla JF']","['Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, IN 46285, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"[""0 (6R-2',5'-thienyl-5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolic acid)"", '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '6P3AVY8A7Q (lometrexol)', 'EC 2.1.2.- (Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases)', 'EC 2.1.2.2 (Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)']",IM,"['Acyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tetrahydrofolates/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00194532 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1996;14(3):287-94. doi: 10.1007/BF00194532.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An understanding of the cellular pharmacology of the drug and specifically the cellular targets linked to the drug's effect is of substantial value in assisting the clinical investigator in selecting the proper dose and schedule of drug administration. The clinical development of ara-C for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) provides a useful paradigm for the study of this process. An understanding of the cellular pharmacology, cytokinetics and pharmacokinetics of ara-C in leukemic mice showed substantial schedule-dependency. Exposure to high doses for a short duration (C x t) resulted in a palliative therapeutic outcome. In marked contrast, exposure to lower doses for a protracted period (c x T) was curative. Clinical use of ara-C in patients with AML patterned after the murine experience, c x T approach, has been of limited benefit in terms of long-term disease-free survival. Studies with human leukemia blasts from patients have shown that for the majority of patients, the initial rate-limiting step is membrane transport, the characteristics of which are substantially affected by extracellular drug concentration (dose). This pharmacologic impediment is eliminated with the blood levels attained during the infusion of gram doses (1-3 gm/m2) of the drug (high-dose ara-C, HiDaC) for shorter periods of time, a C x t approach. Clinical confirmation of these pharmacologic observations is evident in the therapeutic efficacy of HiDaC in patients with relapsed or SDaC-refractory acute leukemia. This is further emphasized by the significantly improved leukemia-free survival of patients with AML treated with HiDaC intensification during remission compared to those patients treated with milligram doses typical of SDaC protocols. Thus, the identification and monitoring of important parameters of drug action in tumors during the course of a clinical trial can be of substantial assistance in optimizing drug dose and schedule so as to attain the best therapeutic index.","['Capizzi, R L']",['Capizzi RL'],"['Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00194527 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1996;14(3):249-56. doi: 10.1007/BF00194527.,,,,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, it is concluded that at least CD44s expression is important in both lymphatic and hematogenous metastasis.","['Kawasaki, N', 'Matsuo, Y', 'Yoshino, T', 'Yanai, H', 'Oka, T', 'Teramoto, N', 'Liu, C', 'Kondo, E', 'Minowada, J', 'Akagi, T']","['Kawasaki N', 'Matsuo Y', 'Yoshino T', 'Yanai H', 'Oka T', 'Teramoto N', 'Liu C', 'Kondo E', 'Minowada J', 'Akagi T']","['Department of Pathology, Okayama University Medical School, Shikata-cho, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/secondary', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0910505097852209 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1996.tb03112.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1996 Oct;87(10):1070-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1996.tb03112.x.,,,PMC5920998,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These patients were unclassifiable by FAB criteria, they were CD34+ and did not express myeloid- or lymphoid-associated antigens (CD13, CD33, CD14, CD15, CD61, CD19, CD10, CD22, CD7, CD2, CD5, CD3). Clonal abnormalities were seen in 8 of 9 cases. Del(5q) as the sole anomaly was observed in 3 cases; +13 was the primary change in 3 cases, and isolated trisomy 12 was found in 1 patient. A complex karyotype with trisomy 12q, in association with del 17p and trisomy 21q was detected in 1 case. One patient with 5q- relapsed with refractory anemia with excess of blasts; the presence of dysgranulopoiesis and a few blasts with possible monocytoid morphology in the remaining 2 patients point to a ""myeloid nature"" of these leukemias. Analysis of cytologic features in our 3 patients with +13, in combination with previously reported cases, suggests the occurrence of immature stem cell involvement with limited differentiation potential, possibly more along the myeloid than the lymphoid lineage. The significance of trisomy 12q in this subset of leukemia remains elusive; some clues of minimal differentiation towards the myeloid lineage in our cases are provided by positivity for the CD117 (c-kit) antigen and by relapse with acute myeloid leukemia without maturation (M1) in one patient. We conclude that, with presently available diagnostic techniques, AUL is a rare subset of leukemia, in which cytogenetic changes are confined to a few chromosomes, with prevalent involvement of 5q and of chromosomes 13 and 12.

Between 1974 and 1993, 1767 cases of NHL, 351 of CLL, 1678 of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM), 4131 of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 10575 of BCC were registered, and contributed to a total of 120103 person-years at risk. Following NHL, 36 cases of SCC were registered compared with 5.1 expected, corresponding to a standardised incidence ratio (SIR) of 7.0 (95% confidence interval, CI, 4.9-9.7); 37 cases of BCC were observed compared with 10.2 expected (SIR = 3.6; 95% CI 2.6-5.0).

After SCC, 23 cases at NHL were observed compared with 9.0 expected (SIR = 2.6; 95% CI 1.6-3.8); after BCC, 43 cases of NHL were registered compared with 22.5 expected (SIR = 1.9; 95% CI 1.4-2.6); and after CMM, four cases of NHL were observed compared with 2.0 expected (SIR = 2.0). No significant excess of CLL was recorded following skin cancer, but the absolute numbers were small and the SIR was above unity. The findings of this study, conducted in populations with a high level of ascertainment and registration of skin cancers, confirm an excess of skin cancers including BCC, following NHL and CLL, and an excess of NHL following skin cancers. This may be related to shared aetiological factors such as U.V. radiation and associated immunosuppression. Individual-based data on the relationship between U.V. exposure and lymphoid neoplasms are needed to clarify the issue.","['Levi, F', 'Randimbison, L', 'Te, V C', 'La Vecchia, C']","['Levi F', 'Randimbison L', 'Te VC', 'La Vecchia C']","['Registre Vaudois des Tumeurs, Institut Universitaire de Medecine Sociale et Preventive, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Carcinoma, Basal Cell/*epidemiology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*epidemiology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Switzerland/epidemiology']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1996.642 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1996 Dec;74(11):1847-50. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1996.642.,,,PMC2077229,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors have investigated tumor risks specifically associated with electric fields, as this exposure is distinct from magnetic fields. The study design is a case-control study nested within a cohort of 170,000 workers employed at Electricite de France-Gaz de France (EDF) between 1978 and 1989. All incident cases of cancer and benign tumor of the brain diagnosed in 1978-1989 among workers before the age of retirement were included. Four randomly selected controls were individually matched to each case by year of birth. The exposure to electric fields was assessed from measurements collected in 850 EDF workers for a full work week. Arithmetic and geometric mean exposures were included in a job-exposure matrix to determine the cumulative exposure of the cases and the controls. Exposures to potentially carcinogenic chemicals found at the workplace were also evaluated through expert judgment. The analysis by site of tumor did not show any increased risk for leukemia (72 cases). An odds ratio of 3.08 (95% confidence interval 1.08-8.74) was observed for all brain tumors (69 cases) for exposure above the 90th percentile (> or = 387 V/m-year), and there was some indication of a dose-response relation, although the risk did not increase monotonically with exposure. No confounding from magnetic fields or from other potentially carcinogenic hazards was apparent. The observed association was somewhat stronger after allowing a 5-year latency period before diagnosis (odds ratio = 3.69, 95% confidence interval 1.10-12.43) for exposure above the 90th percentile. However, the risk of brain tumor could not be linked to a specific type of tumor. An unexpected association was also observed for colon cancer, using geometric indexes of exposure, but no other association was seen for any other type of cancer. Our study indicates that electric fields may have a specific effect on the risk of brain tumor, and that this should be taken into account in future analyses on the carcinogenic effects of 50- to 60-Hz fields.","['Guenel, P', 'Nicolau, J', 'Imbernon, E', 'Chevalier, A', 'Goldberg, M']","['Guenel P', 'Nicolau J', 'Imbernon E', 'Chevalier A', 'Goldberg M']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale-Unite 88, Hopital National de Saint-Maurice, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', '*Occupational Exposure', '*Power Plants', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",1996/12/15 00:00,1996/12/15 00:01,['1996/12/15 00:00'],"['1996/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a008889 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 1996 Dec 15;144(12):1107-21. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a008889.,,,,,,['Am J Epidemiol. 1997 Oct 1;146(7):606-7.

DNA extracted from whole blood by chloroform extraction (CP-DNA) and DNA prepared only by osmotic shock, washing, heating and freezing procedures (RPoS-DNA), were utilized. Fifteen cattle well characterized serologically were investigated for BLV-provirus with PCR using this different DNA preparations. With both methods all but one investigated animal were correctly identified. It was estimated that in case of CP-DNA PCR 10 BLV-provirus copies were sufficient to obtain a positive result. The sensitivity of RPoS-DNA PCR was similar. Because of the greater practicability of the latter technique we used it in a small field study with ten cattle. All serologically positive animals were correctly identified by the PCR. In addition one seronegative animal was found to carry BLV-provirus.

Distress was rated by use of the Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the pain and distress scores for the different preparations of EMLA. CONCLUSION: The EMLA patch and the EMLA cream are equally effective in alleviating pain associated with lumbar puncture. The EMLA patch simplifies and speeds up the application of EMLA.

Murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) have been used as model systems to investigate virion and genomic RNA structure, viral replication and variability, and pathogenesis. Detailed knowledge of the genetic structure of MuLV and of the viral life cycle has led to the development of MuLV-derived retroviral vectors for gene transfer with potential applications in human gene therapy. In this review we have summarized the properties and functions of the 5' domain, called the leader, of MuLV genomic RNA. The 5' leader is formed of small interspersed and superimposed genetic elements involved in every step of the viral life cycle. In addition, the 3' domain of the leader encodes the N-terminal part of glycosylated forms of the GAG polyprotein, also named Gross cell surface antigen (GCSA or glycoGAG) which is essential for full spreading and pathogenic abilities of the virus in the animal. Therefore, the 5' leader of MuLV genomic RNA appears to be a very attractive model to study structure-function relationships of a small and multifunctional genetic domain in vitro, in cell culture and in the animal.","['Corbin, A', 'Darlix, J L']","['Corbin A', 'Darlix JL']","['LaboRetro, Unite de Virologie Humaine (INSERM U412), Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Biochimie,Biochimie,1264604,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Virion/*chemistry', '*Virus Replication']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0300-9084(96)80009-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0300-9084(96)80009-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochimie. 1996;78(7):632-8. doi: 10.1016/s0300-9084(96)80009-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The alpha subunit shares a region of high homology, termed the Runt domain, with the products of the Drosophila melanogaster segmentation gene runt and the human acute myeloid leukemia-related gene AML1. To study the molecular basis for the DNA binding and heterodimerization functions of this factor, we constructed series of deletions of the alpha and beta subunits and examined their activities by electrophoretic mobility shift and affinity column assays. The minimal functional region of the alpha subunit for DNA binding and dimerization was shown to coincide with the Runt domain. On the other hand, the region of the beta subunit required for heterodimerization was localized to the N-terminal 135 amino acids. Furthermore, it was found that the DNA binding activity of the Runt domain is regulated by a reduction/oxidization (redox) mechanism and that its reductively activated state, which is extremely labile, is stabilized by the beta subunit. These findings add a new layer to the mechanism and significance of the regulatory interplay between the two subunits of PEBP2.","['Kagoshima, H', 'Akamatsu, Y', 'Ito, Y', 'Shigesada, K']","['Kagoshima H', 'Akamatsu Y', 'Ito Y', 'Shigesada K']","['Laboratory of Biochemistry, Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606, Japan. kshigesa@virus.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/chemistry', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/metabolism']",1996/12/20 00:00,1996/12/20 00:01,['1996/12/20 00:00'],"['1996/12/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/20 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.51.33074 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)78820-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Dec 20;271(51):33074-82. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.51.33074.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of the mutant protein in NIH 3T3 cells caused cellular transformation, and expression in COS cells activated the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Surprisingly, Ras.GTP levels measured in COS cells established that this novel mutant accumulates to 90% in the GTP state, considerably higher than a residue 12 mutant. Biochemical analysis confirmed that the higher Ras.GTP levels correspond to a dramatic decrease in intrinsic GTP hydrolysis as well as resistance to GTPase-activating proteins.

We previously showed that mutant MuLV which lack expression of an accessory protein, glycosylated gag, had lost neurovirulence, indicating that this protein may be involved in promoting CNS infection. The mutations were located in the ""Kozak"" consensus sequence of the initiation codon for this protein. Here it is shown that shortly after inoculation of mice with one of these mutant viruses, revertants emerged which had regained expression of glycosylated gag and had also regained the neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence exhibited by the wild-type virus. The phenotypic revertants retained the mutations in the ""Kozak"" consensus sequence but exhibited a G-->A mutation 12 codons downstream from the mutated start site, creating a new initiation codon and a glycosylated gag protein, which was truncated at its N-terminus. Using antibodies specific for glycosylated gag it is shown that the frequency of splenic infectious centers expressing revertant virus increased progressively during the 2 months following inoculation of mutant virus until > or = 50% of the virus-producing cells in the spleen expressed revertant virus. In contrast, although phenotypic revertants were detectable at low frequency after cell-free passage in vitro in M. dunni fibroblasts, there was no evidence for selection. These results indicate that glycosylated gag facilitates virus spread within the spleen and to extra-splenic sites, such as the CNS, and suggest that the protein may function through its interaction with the host.","['Portis, J L', 'Fujisawa, R', 'Mcatee, F J']","['Portis JL', 'Fujisawa R', 'Mcatee FJ']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Hamilton, Montana 59840, USA. john_portis@nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'DNA, Viral', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*physiology', 'Glycosylation', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Nervous System Diseases/*virology', 'Phenotype', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Spleen/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*virology', 'Virulence/genetics']",1996/12/15 00:00,1996/12/15 00:01,['1996/12/15 00:00'],"['1996/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(96)90666-2 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1996.0666 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1996 Dec 15;226(2):384-92. doi: 10.1006/viro.1996.0666.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that the ATL cell line, RV-ATL, formed tumors when inoculated into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. In contrast, the HTLV-1 in vitro-transformed cell line, SLB-1, was nontumorigenic in SCID mice. ATL cells contain HTLV-1 proviral DNA sequences but lack detectable viral gene expression, in contrast to HTLV-1 in vitro-transformed cells, which express all viral gene products. We investigated the role of HTLV-1 gene expression in tumorigenesis by superinfecting RV-ATL cells with HTLV-1. The resulting cell line, HT-1RV, expressed HTLV-1. Injection of HT-1RV cells into SCID mice resulted in a reduced tumorigenic phenotype compared to the parental RV-ATL cells. In vitro natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity assays revealed that cell lines expressing HTLV-1 gene products, SLB-1 and HT-1RV, were sensitive to NK cell cytolysis. In contrast, nonexpressing RV-ATL cells were resistant to NK cell cytolysis. These studies indicate that lack of viral gene expression allows HTLV-1-infected cells to elude detection by murine NK cells and increases tumorigenicity in SCID mice. Thus the loss of HTLV-1 gene expression in ATL cells may be an important mechanism by which leukemic cells escape immune surveillance in humans.","['Stewart, S A', 'Feuer, G', 'Jewett, A', 'Lee, F V', 'Bonavida, B', 'Chen, I S']","['Stewart SA', 'Feuer G', 'Jewett A', 'Lee FV', 'Bonavida B', 'Chen IS']","['Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine 90095-1747, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', '*Gene Expression', 'Genes, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation']",1996/12/15 00:00,1996/12/15 00:01,['1996/12/15 00:00'],"['1996/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682296906431 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1996.0643 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1996 Dec 15;226(2):167-75. doi: 10.1006/viro.1996.0643.,,"['CA38597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When GAP expression was downregulated by antisense RNA, the degree of macrophage differentiation was increased, implicating GAP in the regulation of macrophage differentiation.","['White, J R', 'Gordon-Smith, E C', 'Rutherford, T R']","['White JR', 'Gordon-Smith EC', 'Rutherford TR']","[""Department of Cellular and Molecular Sciences, St. George's Hospital Medical School, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (ras GTPase-Activating Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Division/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/*genetics', '*Down-Regulation', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Antisense/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'ras GTPase-Activating Proteins']",1996/12/13 00:00,1996/12/13 00:01,['1996/12/13 00:00'],"['1996/12/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/13 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(96)91834-3 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1996.1834 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1996 Dec 13;229(2):504-10. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1996.1834.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The genomic DNA for human cyclin G consists of six exons, and in the first intron, one distinct putative binding site for the p53 tumor suppressor gene product (GCACAAGCCCAGGCTAGTCC) was detected. We performed chromosome mapping utilizing the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique using both cDNA and genomic DNA for cyclin G. FISH localizes human cyclin G to the 5q32-q34 region. In the vicinity of the chromosomal location of human cyclin G, four cases of chromosomal translocations in human hematopoietic tumors have been reported, such as a subgroup of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and acute lymphocytic leukemia. It is therefore important to examine whether chromosomal translocations around this region cause aberrant cyclin G expression in a manner that is causally related to leukemia.","['Endo, Y', 'Fujita, T', 'Tamura, K', 'Tsuruga, H', 'Nojima, H']","['Endo Y', 'Fujita T', 'Tamura K', 'Tsuruga H', 'Nojima H']","['Department of Biochemistry, Fukushima Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,"['0 (CCNG1 protein, human)', '0 (Ccng1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ccng1 protein, rat)', '0 (Cyclin G)', '0 (Cyclin G1)', '0 (Cyclins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Cyclin G', 'Cyclin G1', 'Cyclins/*genetics', 'DNA', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data']",1996/11/15 00:00,1996/11/15 00:01,['1996/11/15 00:00'],"['1996/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0888-7543(96)90598-4 [pii]', '10.1006/geno.1996.0598 [doi]']",ppublish,Genomics. 1996 Nov 15;38(1):92-5. doi: 10.1006/geno.1996.0598.,"['GENBANK/D78341', 'GENBANK/D86077', 'GENBANK/X70871']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By PCR amplification of human Namalwa cell cDNA using degenerate primers made from the conserved amino acid sequences in the RNA binding domain of EWS and FUS/TLS, we obtained a cDNA fragment (RBP56 cDNA), the predicted amino acid sequences of which were similar but not identical to those of EWS and FUS/TLS.

This gene is transcribed in lymphoid tissues, having a 3-kb mRNA. The cDNA sequence of G7e shows stretches of nucleotide homology with murine leukemia virus (MuLV) envelope genes, and the predicted protein encompasses viral envelope motifs. The finding of a gene resembling MuLV envelope genes, flanked by a long terminal repeat and gag- and pol-like sequences, leads to the assumption that G7b and G7a in the mouse were separated through the insertion of a provirus, an event that might have taken place even before speciation of rat and mouse. The 15-kb interval forms a part of a 50-kb region, between Hsp70.3 and G7, where recombination preferentially takes place. Several disease susceptibility genes have been mapped to this same interval. The position of G7e in or in the vicinity of a recombinational hot spot might not be coincidental.

Allogeneic cell therapy, induced by infusion with peripheral blood lymphocytes, a mixture of allogeneic spleen and lymph node cells and allogeneic activated cell therapy, induced by in vitro recombinant-interleukin-2(rIL-2)-activated allogeneic bone marrow cells in tumor-bearing mice, prevented disease development in adoptive BALB/c recipients. Concomitant in vivo activation of allogeneic lymphocytes with rIL-2 suppressed even more effectively the development of leukemia in secondary adoptive recipients of spleen cells obtained from treated mice. In contrast, in vivo administration of rIL-2 after syngeneic BMT, with or without equal numbers of syngeneic lymphocytes, led to disease development in secondary recipients. Our data suggest that effective cell therapy can be achieved after SBMT by allogeneic but not syngeneic lymphocytes and that anti-leukemic effects induced by allogeneic lymphocytes can be further enhanced by in vitro or in vivo activation of allogeneic effector cells with rIL-2. Therefore, cell therapy by allogeneic lymphocytes following autologous BMT could become an effective method for inducing GVL-like effects on minimal residual disease provided that graft versus host disease can be prevented or adequately controlled.","['Weiss, L', 'Nusair, S', 'Reich, S', 'Sidi, H', 'Slavin, S']","['Weiss L', 'Nusair S', 'Reich S', 'Sidi H', 'Slavin S']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology/therapy', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002620050309 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1996 Oct;43(2):103-8. doi: 10.1007/s002620050309.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we show that in the U937 monoblastic leukemia cell line, pretreatment with IFN-gamma enhanced sensitivity to apoptosis triggered by gamma-irradiation or antitumor agents (etoposide or adriamycin), as well as by anti-Fas antibody. In addition, IFN-gamma caused an increased expression of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme (Ice) gene, following strong induction of the interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gene, the product of which is a transcriptional activator of the Ice gene. An inhibitor of ICE/Ced-3 family proteases, Z-Asp-CH2-DCB, blocked apoptosis in control cells as well as in IFN-gamma-pretreated cells. These results suggest that enhanced susceptibility of IFN-gamma-pretreated cells to apoptosis is mediated through the induction of Ice by IRF-1.

In this report, the stability of retrovirus-mediated gene expression driven by three different potent promoters has been examined in purified human CD34+ cells. The promoters, murine stem cell virus (MSCV) long terminal repeat (LTR) and pgk, show gene expression in 10 times more hematopoietic colonies derived from CD34+ cells than the commonly used Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) LTR. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, however, demonstrates that the levels of gene expression in retrovirus-transduced cells decrease with time in long-term bone marrow cultures and in suspension cultures containing hematopoietic growth factors. Removal of hematopoietic growth factors from the suspension culture medium was associated with a decrease in cell proliferation and differentiation, but with stable gene expression. Retrovirus-mediated gene expression is, therefore, inversely related to proliferation and differentiation of the transduced CD34+ cells. These observations may have implications in future design and implementation of human gene therapy protocols.","['Lu, M', 'Zhang, N', 'Maruyama, M', 'Hawley, R G', 'Ho, A D']","['Lu M', 'Zhang N', 'Maruyama M', 'Hawley RG', 'Ho AD']","['Cancer Center, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0671, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tlx1 protein, mouse)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.10 (phosphoglucokinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Expression', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1996.7.18-2263 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1996 Dec 1;7(18):2263-71. doi: 10.1089/hum.1996.7.18-2263.,,"['R01 DK49619-02/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI36612-03/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the effectiveness of gene therapy for ATL, the effect of ganciclovir on ATL cell lines transfected with the thymidine kinase gene of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-TK) was analyzed. To transfer the HSV-TK gene to ATL cells, a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vector that has specific infectivity to CD4+ cells was used. HSV-TK was inserted into the long terminal repeats of HIV-1 and driven by the SL3 promoter HXBSL3TK. HXBSL3TK was co-transfected with HXBCAT as a reporter into MT2 or HUT102 cells by DEAE-dextran. The cells were incubated with ganciclovir, and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was analyzed. The CAT activity of the MT2 cells and HUT102 cells transfected with HXBSL3TK decreased dose-dependently with ganciclovir. HXBSL3TK was also co-transfected into COS cells with an HIV-1 packaging vector that has gag, pol, and env driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter.

Immunohistochemical study could improve the results of this detection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1982 and 1992, 70 consecutive boys with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and treated with the same therapeutic regimen were included in the study. Testicular biopsy (TB) was surgical and bilateral. One piece of tissue was fixed and analysed by conventional microscopy. An immunohistochemical study was performed on the other sample with a panel of anti-T and anti-B Mc Ab, including JCB 117 (anti-CD79a) which stains early pre B lymphoblasts. RESULTS: Twenty-five children relapsed while on treatment and did not undergo TB. Among the 45 boys who underwent routine TB, one had a diffuse infiltration seen in conventional histology. Thirty-nine had normal morphological and immunohistochemical study: among them, six relapsed subsequently in bone marrow; in this group, event free survival (EFS) was 85 +/- 10% with a median follow-up of 80 months after the biopsy. In the five remaining boys, anti-CD79a was found positive on blasts in four cases and anti-CD3 in one case; four of those relapsed, including two in the testes during the year following the biopsy; EFS was 20 +/- 36% (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: New Mc Ab such as JCB 117 (anti-CD79a) might detect a minimal residual disease in the testes of children treated for ALL, particularly on routine histological material. These results, if confirmed in larger series, might influence further therapeutic strategy.","['Imadalou, K', 'Rubie, H', 'Brousset, P', 'Guitard, J', 'Suc, A', 'Delsol-Tahou, M', 'Claeyssens, S', 'Izard, P', 'Robert, A', 'Delsol, G', 'Regnier, C']","['Imadalou K', 'Rubie H', 'Brousset P', 'Guitard J', 'Suc A', 'Delsol-Tahou M', 'Claeyssens S', 'Izard P', 'Robert A', 'Delsol G', 'Regnier C']","[""Unite d'hemato-oncologie pediatrique, CHU Purpan, Toulouse, France.""]",['fre'],['Journal Article'],France,Arch Pediatr,Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,9421356,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79A protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Biopsy', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'CD79 Antigens', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology', 'Testis/*pathology']",1996/10/01 00:00,2000/05/05 09:00,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0929693X96817180 [pii]', '10.1016/0929-693x(96)81718-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pediatr. 1996 Oct;3(10):977-83. doi: 10.1016/0929-693x(96)81718-0.,,,,,Biopsie testiculaire a l'arret du traitement des leucemies aigues lymphoblastiques: interet de la detection immunohistochimique des blastes residuels.,,,,,,,,,,,,

PDGF, a growth factor for multiple target cells, has been shown to be a potent chemoattractant for a variety of mesenchymal cells. However, it is likely that PDGF-mediated cell migration will be influenced by other cytokines that can be produced during physiological and pathological conditions. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a cytokine that is produced by a variety of cells including osteoblasts, may promote bone formation, but the mechanism is not known. Since osteoblasts are responsible for laying down new matrix during skeletal remodeling, in this report we have examined whether PDGF or LIF influences the migration of osteoblasts. Among several cytokines and growth factors tested, only PDGF was able to elicit a major chemotactic (directed migration) and a minor chemokinetic (random-migration) response in osteoblasts. LIF alone was not active in either chemotaxis or chemokinesis but when included with PDGF it caused a reduction in chemokinesis. Further, pretreatment of osteoblasts with LIF caused an increase in PDGF-driven chemotaxis. Finally, osteoblasts exposed briefly to LIF synthesized a higher level of non-collagenous proteins upon further treatment with PDGF. These observations are consistent with a role for LIF in promoting bone formation, both by influencing directional migration of osteoblasts and in laying down new matrix.","['Chandrasekhar, S', 'Harvey, A K']","['Chandrasekhar S', 'Harvey AK']","['Endocrine Division, Lilly Research Laboratories, Indianapolis, Indiana 46285, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Bone Matrix/metabolism', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Collagen/biosynthesis', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Fibronectins/biosynthesis', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/physiology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Osteoblasts/*cytology', 'Osteocalcin/metabolism', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1996/12/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199612)169:3<481::AID-JCP8>3.0.CO;2-K [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199612)169:3<481::AID-JCP8>3.0.CO;2-K [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1996 Dec;169(3):481-90. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199612)169:3<481::AID-JCP8>3.0.CO;2-K.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rev. Immunol., 10:289-306; Barondes et al., 1994, J. Biol. Chem., 269:20807-20810). After immunoscreening of a lambda gt11 cDNA expression library made from bone-nodule forming cultures of fetal rat calvaria (RC) cells with an antibody raised against osteoblastic cells (Turksen et al., 1992, J. Histochem. Cytochem., 40:1339-1352), three cDNA clones were isolated and sequenced; the sequence matched that of rat galectin 3. Galectin 3 mRNA was detected in various fetal and adult rat tissues, including calvaria and cultured RC cells. In RC cells and the rat osteosarcoma cell line ROS 17/2.8, galectin 3 mRNA expression increased with time in culture, in contrast to its behavior in fetal rat skin fibroblasts (RSF) in which its expression decreased with time in culture. In a second rat osteosarcoma line, UMR 106.01, galectin 3 mRNA was almost nondetectable. The synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) enhanced galectin 3 expression in RSF cell cultures, while 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) had no significant effect. In contrast, Dex downregulated and 1,25(OH)2D3 upregulated galectin 3 expression in RC and ROS 17/2.8 cells, especially at later time points in culture when expression of osteoblast-associated differentiation markers by these cell types is most marked. Immunolabeling with an antibody against rat galectin 3 to identify galectin 3 protein showed that cells labelled within both the ROS 17/2.8 and RC populations but with marked intercellular heterogeneity of intensity. Our data support the conclusion that galectin 3 is a previously unrecognized product of osteoblastic cells, that galectin 3 mRNA and protein expression increases with time in vitro concomitant with other markers of osteogenesis, including formation of bone nodules and expression of osteoblast-associated markers such as alkaline phosphatase, bone sialo-protein, and osteocalcin, and that its expression is regulated by hormones such as glucocorticoids and 1,25(OH)2D3 that modulate other aspects of the osteoblast phenotype.","['Aubin, J E', 'Gupta, A K', 'Bhargava, U', 'Turksen, K']","['Aubin JE', 'Gupta AK', 'Bhargava U', 'Turksen K']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Galectin 3)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone and Bones/cytology/metabolism', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Galectin 3', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Osteoblasts/*metabolism', 'Osteosarcoma/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Rats', 'Skull/metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution']",1996/12/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199612)169:3<468::AID-JCP7>3.0.CO;2-M [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199612)169:3<468::AID-JCP7>3.0.CO;2-M [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1996 Dec;169(3):468-80. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199612)169:3<468::AID-JCP7>3.0.CO;2-M.,['GENBANK/UNKNOWN'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The case of a child with extramedullary relapse of APL after initial treatment with ATRA and that of an adult whose initial treatment was chemotherapy are presented, and the literature on extramedullary relapse of APL is reviewed. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were identified, including the 2 current patients. Ethnicity could be determined in 23 patients, 17 of whom were of other than Northern European extraction. The most common sites of extramedullary disease were the skin (15 patients), central nervous system (5 patients), mediastinum (3 patients), and, curiously, gingiva (3 patients). Extramedullary leukemia developed in 19 patients: after treatment with ATRA (6 patients), cytotoxic chemotherapy (12 patients), or both (1 patient), and developed in 7 others before any treatment for leukemia was given. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest but do not prove that extramedullary APL may occur more frequently after ATRA than other therapy, since ATRA has been available for a relatively short period of time.

Delocalization of PML from nuclear bodies has been documented in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells and suggested to contribute to leukemogenesis. In an attempt to get new insights into the function of the wild-type PML protein and to investigate whether it displays an altered expression pattern in neoplasms other than acute promyelocytic leukemia, we stained a large number of normal and neoplastic human tissues with a new murine monoclonal antibody (PG-M3) directed against the amino-terminal region of PML. As the PG-M3 epitope is partially resistant to fixatives, only cells that overexpress PML are detected by the antibody in microwave-heated paraffin sections. Among normal tissues, PML was characteristically up-regulated in activated epithelioid histiocytes and fibroblasts in a variety of pathological conditions, columnar epithelium in small active thyroid follicles, well differentiated foamy cells in the center of sebaceous glands, and hypersecretory endometria (Arias-Stella). Interferons, the PML of which is a primary target gene, and estrogens are likely to represent some of the cytokines and/or hormones that may be involved in the up-regulation of PML under these circumstances. In keeping with this concept, we found that PML is frequently overexpressed in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin's disease, a tumor of cytokine-producing cells. Among solid tumors, overexpression of PML was frequently found in carcinomas of larynx and thyroid (papillary), epithelial thymomas, and Kaposi's sarcoma, whereas carcinomas of the lung, thyroid (follicular), breast, and colon were frequently negative or weakly PML+. We did not observe any changes in the levels of PML expression as the lesion progressed from benign dysplasia to carcinoma. Our immunohistological data are consistent with the hypothesized growth suppressor function of PML and strongly suggest that PML expression levels are likely to be modulated by a variety of stimuli, including cytokines and hormones.","['Gambacorta, M', 'Flenghi, L', 'Fagioli, M', 'Pileri, S', 'Leoncini, L', 'Bigerna, B', 'Pacini, R', 'Tanci, L N', 'Pasqualucci, L', 'Ascani, S', 'Mencarelli, A', 'Liso, A', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Falini, B']","['Gambacorta M', 'Flenghi L', 'Fagioli M', 'Pileri S', 'Leoncini L', 'Bigerna B', 'Pacini R', 'Tanci LN', 'Pasqualucci L', 'Ascani S', 'Mencarelli A', 'Liso A', 'Pelicci PG', 'Falini B']","['Institute of Pathology, Ospedale Niguarda, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Carcinoma/chemistry/pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/*chemistry/*pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/chemistry/*pathology', 'Epithelium/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Lymphoid Tissue/chemistry/pathology', 'Lymphoma/chemistry/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Organ Specificity', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Sarcoma/chemistry/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1996 Dec;149(6):2023-35.,,,PMC1865355,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These aberrations were originally detected by karyotyping and then by more sophisticated cytogenetic analysis. A few karyotypic alterations can be directly linked to distinct malignancies, such as the Philadelphia chromosome in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, loss of distal chromosome 3p 14 in small-cell lung cancer, the loss of distal chromosome 11p13 in Wilms' tumor, and loss or rearrangement of the short arm of chromosome 3 in clear and chromophobe RCC. The relative specificity of the latter findings enabled investigators to diagnose an occult renal clear-cell carcinoma from a supraclavicular lymph node metastasis by analysis of G-banded metaphase chromosomes obtained from this mass. A similar report based also on cytogenetic findings was published earlier. Karyotypic changes, however, detect only gross alterations visible to an observer. With more refined diagnostic tools, such as microsatellite analysis, other, even smaller, well defined lesions can be analyzed. A summary of the known frequencies of chromosomal losses is given in Table 1. The combination of certain LOH patterns has shown great promise in the differential diagnosis of renal tumors. The transfer of molecular genetics from the laboratory to surgical pathology and other clinical departments is a meaningful event and a challenging task. Molecular pathology is certain to become important in the diagnosis of tumors with unclear histology. Diagnosis based widely upon staining techniques and determination of a patient's prognosis by staging and grading alone will be increasingly accompanied by molecular genetic methods. Pathology may be on the verge of the greatest change since the introduction of the microscope.","['Steiner, G', 'Sidransky, D']","['Steiner G', 'Sidransky D']","['James Buchanan Brady Urological Institute, Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comment', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (DNA, Satellite)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', '*DNA, Satellite', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Microscopy/methods']",1996/12/01 00:00,2000/03/29 09:00,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1996 Dec;149(6):1791-5.,,,PMC1865338,30,,,['Am J Pathol. 1996 Dec;149(6):2081-8.

However, no down-regulation of CD 25 expression was observed on PBMC in all patients and normal individuals after treatment with 13-cis RA or ATRA. In the aspect of growth inhibition on PBMC in ATL patients, we tried to clarify the mechanism of the phenomenon. In agarose gel electrophoresis, extracted genomic DNA from retinoic acid treated PBMC in hyper-sensitive and sensitive ATL patients showed multimer DNA fragmentation pattern. On the other hand, genomic DNA from PBMC after treatment with retinoic acid in resistant ATL patients and normal individuals showed high molecular DNA pattern without fragmentation. Taken together, it is suggested that retinoic acid could induce growth inhibition of PBMC in some ATL patients resulting in DNA fragmentation, apoptosis.

APL is characterized by three distinct and unique features: i) accumulation in the bone marrow of tumor cells with promyelocytic features; ii) invariable association with specific translocations which always involve chromosome 17 and the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) locus; iii) exquisite sensitivity of APL blasts to the differentiating action of retinoic acid (RA). From this point of view APL has become the paradigm for therapeutic approaches utilizing differentiating agents. The last five years have been crucial for the understanding of the molecular basis of APL. RAR alpha translocates in 99% of cases to a gene located on chromosome 15 that we initially named myl and is now known as PML. In a few cases RAR alpha variably translocates to chromosome 11, where it fuses to the PLZF gene or to a gene, also on 11, which has not yet been characterized. In addition, RAR alpha is also found translocated to chromosome 5, where it fuses to the NPM gene. The cloning of variant translocations in APL and comparative analysis of their associated products is crucial for the understanding of the molecular etiopathogenesis of the disease.

Recent data from the GMALL Group showed that prognosis can be improved with an innovative treatment regimen. In the current retrospective survey we focus on therapeutic results obtained at our Institutions during a 15-year period with ALL-type regimens in 34 adults with either B/L3-ALL or advanced-stage Burkitt's lymphoma. METHODS: Five successive ALL treatment programs were developed. They included a homogeneous induction phase with early intrathecal chemoprophylaxis, multidrug postremission consolidation followed by cranial irradiation (4 trials), high-dose chemotherapy plus autografting (2 trials), late consolidation (2 trials), and variable-length maintenance (4 trials). Early response and prolonged disease-free survival rates were analyzed according to selected clinical and therapeutic variables. RESULTS: Overall, a complete remission was achieved in 62%, with a median duration of 1.6 years and a 10-year remission rate of 49%. A diagnosis of B/L3-ALL (p = 0.007), the use of idarubicin instead of adriamycin during induction (p = 0.018), a serum creatinine < 1.6 mg/dL, and an uninvolved central nervous system were associated with higher response rates. As regards long-term disease-free survival, results were significantly better in patients with < 1 x 10(9)/L L3/blast cells in the peripheral blood (p = 0.0029) and/or aged < 50 years (p = 0.04), and in those consolidated with the most recent rotational high-dose plus peripheral blood stem cell autotransplant regimen. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results presented, ALL-like regimens may still represent a worthwhile therapeutic choice. The use of idarubicin during induction, the prognostic subclassification of patients, a careful control of dysmetabolic complications, the selection of the proper chemo-radioprevention for meningeal disease and perhaps the introduction of high-dose chemotherapy supported by autologous stem cell rescue appear to be the mainstay of further improvements.","['Lerede, T', 'Bassan, R', 'Rossi, A', 'Di Bona, E', 'Rossi, G', 'Pogliani, E M', 'Motta, T', 'Torri, V', 'Buelli, M', 'Comotti, B', 'Viero, P', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Cortelazzo, S', 'Rodeghiero, F', 'Barbui, T']","['Lerede T', 'Bassan R', 'Rossi A', 'Di Bona E', 'Rossi G', 'Pogliani EM', 'Motta T', 'Torri V', 'Buelli M', 'Comotti B', 'Viero P', 'Rambaldi A', 'Cortelazzo S', 'Rodeghiero F', 'Barbui T']","['Department of Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1996 Sep-Oct;81(5):442-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Implications for prognosis.,428-33,"BACKGROUND: CD23 is a functionally relevant molecule in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) which mediates growth and differentiation signals in B-cells. An intriguing feature of CD23 is its ability to be cleaved from the cell surface and released into the serum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum levels of soluble CD23 (sCD23) were determined with a sandwich enzyme immunoassay at the time of diagnosis in 90 previously untreated CLL patients, in order to evaluate whether they reflected disease activity and tumor load. Results were correlated with those dealing with CD23 expression on leukemic cells to verify whether the cellular counterpart determines serum levels. RESULTS: CD23 was detected on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 78 out of 90 (86.6%) B-CLL patients, without correlation with clinical stage. Circulating levels of sCD23 in the serum of patients with CLL were highly elevated in comparison to 15 normal controls (p < 0.0005); this increase reflected tumor mass as defined by either clinical stage (p < 0.0005) or bone marrow (BM) histology (p < 0.0005). Neither percentage nor absolute number of CD23+ cells correlated with circulating levels. Interestingly, life expectancy was significantly shorter in patients with higher serum levels of sCD23 (p < 0.0005). When integrated into the Binet clinical staging system, sCD23 led to isolation of two subgroups with different prognosis among intermediate-risk patients. Furthermore, longitudinal studies support the idea that sCD23 can be utilized as an indicator of disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: sCD23 is a highly sensitive and suitable marker with prognostic potential in B-CLL.","['Molica, S', 'Levato, D', ""Dell'Olio, M"", 'Matera, R', 'Minervini, M', 'Dattilo, A', 'Carotenuto, M', 'Musto, P']","['Molica S', 'Levato D', ""Dell'Olio M"", 'Matera R', 'Minervini M', 'Dattilo A', 'Carotenuto M', 'Musto P']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,"['Aged', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, IgE/*analysis']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1996 Sep-Oct;81(5):428-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytologic, cytogenetic and clinical features were studied at diagnosis and during disease evolution in 11 patients presenting with de novo AML. Diagnoses according to the FAB criteria were AML-M2 (3 cases), AML-MO and AML-M4 (2 cases each), AML-M4eos, AML-M5, AML-M6, AML-M7 (1 case each). RESULTS: Immunophenotyping disclosed positivity for CD33 or CD13 and for the CD34 stem cell antigen in all cases tested. Lymphoid-associated markers (LM) were detected in 7/9 patients. In 5 cases the expression of at least 2 LM was seen. In addition, evidence of clonal rearrangement of the immunoglobulin (Ig) and/or T-cell receptor (TCR) genes was documented in 3/4 evaluable cases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-nine patients with acquired severe aplastic anemia underwent cytogenetic examination on bone marrow cells at the time of diagnosis (n = 34) and/or at least twice after immunosuppressive therapy (IS) (n = 35). RESULTS: We identified 2 major groups. Group A: 51 patients (74%) were normal and remained normal. Group B: 18 patients (26%) had at least one abnormal cytogenetic analysis. This second group could be further subdivided as follows: (B1) chromosomal abnormalities not present at first examination and acquired in the course of the disease (n = 7); (B2) clonal cytogenetic abnormalities present at first examination and persisting (n = 3); (B3) reversible cytogenetic abnormalities (n = 8). The most frequent abnormality was trisomy 8 (n = 8) followed by monosomy 7 (n = 2); 82% of patients are alive in group A and 61% in group B. Three patients developed acute leukemia, all from group B. This represents 4% of all patients or 17% of those with at least one abnormal cytogenetic test. CONCLUSIONS: Thus the majority of SAA patients have normal karyotypes in marrow cells at presentation and at follow-up. Patients with abnormal karyotypes exist and can be further subdivided into those with reversible and those with persistent abnormalities.

Thymic OT is not secreted but, after translocation of a hybrid neurophysin/MHC class I protein, is integrated within the plasma membrane of TEC, thus allowing its presentation to pre-T cells. In order to further demonstrate that thymic OT behaves like a membrane antigen, we assessed the effect of mAbs to OT on cytokine productions by cultures enriched in human TEC. 75-85% pure TEC cultures were prepared from human thymic fragments. Using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, ir-OT, ir-interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), ir-interleukin-6 (IL-6) and ir-leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) could be detected in these TEC cultures. ir-OT was restricted to TEC, while some ir-IL-6 and ir-LIF were also seen in occasional fibroblasts. In basal conditions, ir-IL-6 and ir-LIF (but not ir-OT and ir-IL-1 beta) were detected in the supernatants of human TEC cultures. MAbs to OT induced a marked increase of ir-IL-6 and ir-LIF secretion in TEC cultures. No significant effect was observed using mAbs against vasopressin, mouse immunoglobulins, or control ascitic fluid controls. These data show that OT is fully processed and recognized by specific mAbs at the outer surface of TEC plasma membrane.

In chronic phase CML, intensity of treatment as determined by the degrees of WBC suppression, and, more recently, of cytogenetic remission, as measures of the reduction of tumor burden appear to correlate directly with survival. The superiority of a therapeutic regimen in chronic phase CML seems to primarily depend on whether its pharmacology permits a sufficiently high dosage to achieve the necessary reduction of tumor burden.

A critical appraisal of various experiences in different centers.,149-60,"The therapeutic strategy in patients with Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) is a difficult balance between the prevention of bleeding and thrombotic complications and the risks of drug side effects and toxicity. Major bleeding is rare and seem to be related to higher platelet counts: therefore, a platelet count over 1500 x 10(9)/L is generally regarded as an indication for cytoreduction. Thrombotic complications include microvascular occlusive symptoms, which are reversible with low-dose aspirin, and large vessels thrombosis. The risk of major thrombosis is higher in ET patients aged more than 60 ys. and with previous occlusive event. In this high-risk group, the non-alkylating agent hydroxyurea (HU) significantly reduces the rate of vascular complications and has emerged as the treatment of choice. However, the long-term risk/benefit of HU remains disputed because its leukemogenic potential has not been ruled out. This holds also for other myelosuppressive agents, such as busulphan and pipobroman. Other drugs of particular interest for young patients include recombinant alpha-interferon (IFN) and Anagrelide. Both of them are effective in lowering platelet count, but their efficacy in reducing clinical complications remains to be demonstrated. However, both IFN and Anagrelide have shown to have frequent and clinically important side effects. Thus, further clinical studies are required to establish their role in the strategy of ET patient treatment.","['Barbui, T', 'Finazzi, G', 'Dupuy, E', 'Kiladjian, J J', 'Briere, J']","['Barbui T', 'Finazzi G', 'Dupuy E', 'Kiladjian JJ', 'Briere J']","['Division of Hematology, Ospedali Riuniti Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '6Q99RDT97R (Pipobroman)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'K9X45X0051 (anagrelide)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alkylating Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Anemia, Megaloblastic/chemically induced', 'Arrhythmias, Cardiac/chemically induced', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/chemically induced', 'Busulfan/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Ischemic Attack, Transient/etiology', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pipobroman/therapeutic use', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Platelet Count/drug effects', 'Prognosis', 'Quinazolines/therapeutic use', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/complications/drug therapy/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Thrombosis/epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609074373 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Sep;22 Suppl 1:149-60. doi: 10.3109/10428199609074373.,,,,86,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IFN-alpha exerts beneficial therapeutic effects in chronic myelogenous leukemia, polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, resulting in control of hematopoietic hyperplasia and, in a minority of patients, in induction of cytogenetic remission. The mechanism of action of IFN-alpha in MPD is poorly defined. Recently published in vitro findings suggest that IFN-alpha interacts with the regulation of hematopoiesis by multiple ways. Its antiproliferative activity is well known for more than a decade, however, substantial growth inhibition is achieved only at relatively high concentrations. Defective adhesion of hematopoietic progenitor cells in CML to bone marrow stromal cells is corrected by IFN-alpha, which might expose CML progenitors to inhibitory cytokines produced by the bone marrow microenvironment. Recent work from our group demonstrated, that IFN-alpha potently interacts with the production of hematopoietic cytokines in bone marrow stromal cells. Expression of stimulatory cytokines, such as GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-1 and IL-11 is inhibited by IFN-ct, whereas the production of negative regulators, such as IL-1RA and MIP-1 alpha, is stimulated. The combined action of IFN-alpha on paracrine expression of cytokines suggests an indirect antihematopoietic effect, which might contribute to its clinical activity in MPD.","['Peschel, C', 'Aulitzky, W E', 'Huber, C']","['Peschel C', 'Aulitzky WE', 'Huber C']","['IIIrd Department of Medicine, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Connective Tissue/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/metabolism/pathology/*therapy']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609074370 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Sep;22 Suppl 1:129-34. doi: 10.3109/10428199609074370.,,,,77,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The risk of leukemia, or myelodysplasia, or lymphoma in the 32P-treated patients was 10% at the 10th year, but increase after that time to reach a value of about 30% at the 20th year, in the surviving case. This risk was not dose-related. Despite a marked reduction of the cumulative 32P dose in the patients maintained by hydroxyurea, the actuarial risk was 19% at the 10th year. In the patients treated exclusively by non radio-mimetic agents (hydroxyurea or pipobroman) a risk of 10% at the 10th year was observed. The risk of carcinoma (excluding skin cancers) was about 15% at the 10th year in the 32P-treated cases, a value similar to that generally reported by the French statistics. There was no prevalence of digestive carcinomas. In contrast, the patients receiving 32P and hydroxyurea as maintenance had an excess risk: 29% at the 10th year. In the relatively young cases treated by non radio-mimetic agents, the risk was similar in both arms: 9% at the 10th year, similar to the expected incidence at this age. The risk of myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia was still relatively low at the 10th year, about 15% in all arms, but increased towards a value higher than 30% in the patients surviving at the 20th year. At the present time, but in only a few cases with long-term following, no myelo-fibrosis with splenic metaplasia has been observed in the pipobroman-treated cases. The present results, which need to be confirmed (the present analysis has been done in spring 95) suggest that:-the use of non radio-mimetic agents does not protect against leukemic transformation, which may be a consequence of the disease; rather than of the treatment,-maintenance therapy after initial use of 32P increases the risk of both leukemia and carcinoma,-and hydroxyurea does not delay the risk of developing myelo-fibrosis, in comparison with 32P alone.","['Najean, Y', 'Rain, J D', 'Dresch, C', 'Goguel, A', 'Lejeune, F', 'Echard, M', 'Grange, M J']","['Najean Y', 'Rain JD', 'Dresch C', 'Goguel A', 'Lejeune F', 'Echard M', 'Grange MJ']","['Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '6Q99RDT97R (Pipobroman)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Acute Disease', 'Carcinoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Disease Progression', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Phlebotomy', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Pipobroman/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Polycythemia Vera/drug therapy/*pathology/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Risk', 'Splenomegaly/epidemiology/etiology']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199609074368 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 Sep;22 Suppl 1:111-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199609074368.,,,,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effects of these drugs on various steps of the signal transduction cascade was investigated to gain insight into the mechanism of action of these drugs. It appeared that addition of the drugs to resting cells induced changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. The most active anti-allergics in inhibiting exocytosis, AL3264 and oxatomide, also induced the largest changes in phosphorylation. The effects of the drugs on tyrosine phosphorylation after cell activation was complex. Additionally, Ca2+ fluxes were investigated. Ca2+ efflux from the cells was negligibly influenced by the active drugs. However, the drugs inhibited influx from extracellular Ca2+, which was correlated with the effects of the drugs on inhibition of exocytosis and on membrane stabilization induced by the drugs, measured as haemolysis of erythrocytes. It is concluded that inhibition of Ca2+ influx is the major mechanism with which these drugs inhibit exocytosis and that for this effect drug-membrane interactions, possibly affecting the function of membrane embedded proteins, are of importance.

In normal and contralateral DRGs small numbers of weakly fluorescent GAL- and GMAP-positive neuronal cell bodies and numerous positive fibers were observed. No NPY-positive cell bodies but a few fibers surrounding blood vessels were seen. In LIF deficient mice hardly any GAL- or GMAP-positive neurons or fibers were seen, nor was NPY-like immunoreactivity present in cell bodies. After axotomy there was a dramatic upregulation of all three peptides in wild-type DRG neurons, whereby 50-60% of the neuron profiles, encompassing both small and large profiles, were GAL- and GMAP-immunoreactive (IR). About one third of all neuron profiles, mainly large ones, were NPY-positive. In LIF-deficient mice this upregulation was much less pronounced. Thus GAL- and GMAP-IR neuron profiles were reduced by 65-70% compared with the wild-type mice. The number of NPY-positive neuron profiles was reduced to half but this difference was not significant. There was also an ipsilateral decrease in fluorescence intensity for all three peptide immunoreactivities in the LIF-deficient mice as compared with wild-type mice after axotomy. There was no apparent difference in size between, respectively, GAL- and GMAP-positive profiles when comparing LIF-deficient and wild-type mice before or after axotomy. There were, however, no small NPY-IR profiles in the LIF-deficient group. The present results suggests that LIF is important for the dramatic upregulation of GAL and GMAP seen after axotomy. It may also be important for the normal expression of galanin in mouse DRGs, since wild-type mice seemed to have somewhat more positive cell bodies and more fluorescent fibers. LIF seems to be less important for the control of NPY synthesis, but may be involved in NPY regulation in small-sized neurons.","['Corness, J', 'Shi, T J', 'Xu, Z Q', 'Brulet, P', 'Hokfelt, T']","['Corness J', 'Shi TJ', 'Xu ZQ', 'Brulet P', 'Hokfelt T']","['Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Exp Brain Res,Experimental brain research,0043312,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neuropeptide Y)', '127120-75-6 (galanin message-associated peptide)', '88813-36-9 (Galanin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Axons/*physiology', 'Denervation', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Galanin/*metabolism', 'Ganglia, Spinal/cytology/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Neurons, Afferent/metabolism', 'Neuropeptide Y/*metabolism']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00227180 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Brain Res. 1996 Nov;112(1):79-88. doi: 10.1007/BF00227180.,,['DK 41301/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the cells are vortex-stirred in RPMI 1640 culture medium, the pH of the medium should be adjusted with HEPES and NaOH, instead of NaHCO3, to a pH higher than 7.6 for successful permeabilization; the higher the pH, the better the result obtained. Internalization of LY was near the background level at a pH below 7.4.

We have reviewed 27 consecutive such total hip arthroplasties (THA) at a minimal follow-up of two years. Of these, 20 were primary operations for Ficat (1985) stage-III and stage-IV lesions, and seven were revisions after the failure of previous surgery. The median age at operation was 30 years (17.5 to 44). The prostheses had a cemented, collared titanium-alloy stem, an alumina-alumina joint, and a press-fit socket. Seven had a titanium-alloy metal back and 20 had all-alumina cups of which six had to be cemented. At an average follow-up of five years, no patient had been lost to follow-up. One had died from septicaemia after two years and another with chronic graft-versus-host disease developed a deep infection 2.5 years postoperatively and had a successful revision. There were no revisions for aseptic loosening. The clinical results on the Merle d'Aubigne++ and Postel (1954) scale were very good or excellent in 23 hips (88%), good in one and fair in two. Ten hips showed incomplete acetabular radiolucencies less than 1 mm thick, but there were no radiolucent lines around the stems.

However, the timing and magnitude of the activation during cancer development are unknown. In this study, a new PCR-based method for measuring telomerase activity was developed and shown to be very useful for quantitative analysis of human telomerase. Using this assay, blood or bone marrow cells from healthy donors, and patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were examined as to their relative activity. Telomerase activity present in normal peripheral blood cells was generally very low. However, significant activity was detected occasionally in samples derived from younger healthy donors. Striking telomerase activation was observed at the time of the blastic crisis in CML: no samples from chronic phase cases showed significant activity, while all cases with a well established crisis showed strong activity. Most AML cases were telomerase-positive. Quantitative analyses revealed that the relative titer varied among the AML patients, from as low as found in normal cells to as high as found in cell lines. However, a tendency that the activity was higher in relapsed cases than in fresh ones was suggested. In summary, telomerase was activated during the progression of the clinical stages in leukemias. This observation suggests that shortened telomeres and increased telomerase activity might be necessary for cancer cells to undergo clonal evolution towards more malignant phenotypes in advanced stages.","['Tatematsu, K', 'Nakayama, J', 'Danbara, M', 'Shionoya, S', 'Sato, H', 'Omine, M', 'Ishikawa, F']","['Tatematsu K', 'Nakayama J', 'Danbara M', 'Shionoya S', 'Sato H', 'Omine M', 'Ishikawa F']","['Department of Life Science, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Telomerase/genetics/*metabolism']",1996/11/21 00:00,1996/11/21 00:01,['1996/11/21 00:00'],"['1996/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/21 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/21 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Nov 21;13(10):2265-74.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By DNA cross-hybridization we have identified two Meis1-related genes, Meis2 and Meis3. Sequence analysis revealed extensive amino acid similarity among the three Meis proteins both within and outside of the homeodomain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Meis genes belong to a distinct family of Pbx-related genes. Chromosome mapping studies indicated that Meis2 and Meis3 are unlinked to Meis1 and map to mouse chromosome 2 and 7, respectively.

Similarly, truncation and rearrangement of the c-myb proto-oncogene to yield a v-Myb-like protein leads to myeloid and B cell lymphomas in chickens and mice, and may be a factor in a number of human cancers. To study the effects of deregulation of v-Myb on T cell development, we have generated lines of transgenic mice in which the v-Myb oncoprotein is expressed in a T-cell-specific fashion. Analysis of T cell development in the v-Myb transgenic mice shows that ectopic expression of v-Myb affects the ratio of helper to cytotoxic T cells, by increasing the number of CD4+ helper cells, and inhibits thymic involution, such that mature animals have elevated numbers of thymocytes and circulating mature T cells. In a significant proportion of older animals, high grade T cell lymphomas develop, demonstrating that v-Myb is oncogenic in T cells.","['Badiani, P A', 'Kioussis, D', 'Swirsky, D M', 'Lampert, I A', 'Weston, K']","['Badiani PA', 'Kioussis D', 'Swirsky DM', 'Lampert IA', 'Weston K']","['CRC Centre for Cell and Molecular Biology, Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-myb)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oncogene Proteins v-myb', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*metabolism']",1996/11/21 00:00,1996/11/21 00:01,['1996/11/21 00:00'],"['1996/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/21 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/21 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Nov 21;13(10):2205-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular analysis of the MLL gene revealed that MLL was fused with two different genes, AF-6 on chromosome 6q27 and AF-5alpha. AF-5alpha, the 11th partner gene fused with MLL, is a novel gene mapped to chromosome 5q12, which encodes a 31 kDa protein of 269 amino acids and contains a possible nuclear targeting sequence, a potential leucine zipper dimerization motif and an alpha-helical coiled-coil domain. In situ hybridization and molecular cloning analyses demonstrated that two different types of chromosomal recombination had occurred in the cells. One was a three-way translocation among chromosomes 6, 8 and 11, and the other was an insertion of a chromosome 5-derived segment into the breakpoint of chromosomes 8 and 11. Accordingly, the karyotype was defined as del(5)(q11.2q12), der(6)t(6;8) (q27;q11.2), der(8)(8pter-->8q11.2::5q11.2-->5q12::11q23-->++ +11qter), der(11)t(6;11) (q27;q23). Thus, the MLL gene created two different fusion mRNAs, since the chromosome 11 split into two different chromosomes 5 and 6. This is the first report demonstrating fusion of the MLL gene with two different genes by a complex translocation.","['Taki, T', 'Hayashi, Y', 'Taniwaki, M', 'Seto, M', 'Ueda, R', 'Hanada, R', 'Suzukawa, K', 'Yokota, J', 'Morishita, K']","['Taki T', 'Hayashi Y', 'Taniwaki M', 'Seto M', 'Ueda R', 'Hanada R', 'Suzukawa K', 'Yokota J', 'Morishita K']","['Biology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (AFDN protein, human)', '0 (CENPK protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)', 'EC 3.6.4.4 (Kinesins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kinesins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Myosins/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/isolation & purification', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",1996/11/21 00:00,1996/11/21 00:01,['1996/11/21 00:00'],"['1996/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/21 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/21 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Nov 21;13(10):2121-30.,['GENBANK/R50104'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For understanding of these diseases, the evaluation of the chimeric status of LC following BMT is of great interest. To analyze the sex chromosome constitution of LC in the skin, we established a modified and refined technique of combined immunophenotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and investigated frozen sections of skin biopsies from nine patients after allogeneic sex-mismatched BMT and of two healthy donors for control. LC were specifically labeled using a fluorescent CD1 a antibody and hybridized simultaneously with X and Y chromosome-specific DNA probes. The results of this practical application on nine leukemia patients show the appearance of donor-type LC and the persistence of host-type LC at various times (36 up to 1395 days) after sex-mismatched BMT. Complete chimerism of LC could not be detected in any case. The frequency of recipient-specific LC ranged from 7% to 92% and showed no correlation with time postgrafting. We conclude from our results of 1461 analyzed LC that combined immunophenotyping and interphase cytogenetic analysis by FISH is the method of choice for the assessment of chimerism in a particular cell type after sex-mismatched BMT. Its practical application on other tissues affected by BMT-related pathophysiological processes reveals further knowledge of the time-dependent course of chimeric patterns after BMT.","['Hessel, H', 'Mittermuller, J', 'Zitzelsberger, H', 'Weier, H U', 'Bauchinger, M']","['Hessel H', 'Mittermuller J', 'Zitzelsberger H', 'Weier HU', 'Bauchinger M']","['GSF-National Research Center for Environment and Health, Institute of Radiobiology.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Histochem Cell Biol,Histochemistry and cell biology,9506663,['0 (DNA Probes)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Chimera', 'DNA Probes/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Langerhans Cells/*chemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', '*Sex Chromosomes']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02473310 [doi]'],ppublish,Histochem Cell Biol. 1996 Nov;106(5):481-5. doi: 10.1007/BF02473310.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To systematically evaluate the effect of methotrexate on spinal cord function, somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) were measured in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A prospective evaluation was performed in 38 consecutive children aged 1.4-15.3 years with newly diagnosed ALL during treatment. Intrathecal methotrexate therapy was included in the therapy schedule of all patients as central nervous system (CNS) therapy in addition to intravenous chemotherapy in 19 standard risk patients and intravenous chemotherapy with cranial irradiation in 19 intermediate or high-risk patients. The measured conduction times were compared with those of 38 control children matched for age, height, and sex. A significant increase in the conduction time of the tibial nerve SEP was found between the Th12 level and the cortex in children with ALL after receiving intrathecal methotrexate therapy during the induction and CNS therapy phases when compared with their controls. The difference of the mean latencies was 1.45 ms (95% CI 0.39-2.51; P < 0.01). There was no significant delay in the median nerve SEP from the brain stem to the cortex, indicating that the conduction delay was in the area of the spinal cord exposed to intrathecal methotrexate. Moreover, the cortical amplitudes of the median nerve SEPs were significantly reduced when measured immediately after intravenous and intrathecal methotrexate and compared to the amplitudes measured after induction therapy in standard risk patients (P = 0.001). Intrathecal methotrexate with systemic chemotherapy causes a deterioration in the somatosensory pathways within the CNS, suggesting also spinal cord dysfunction in children with ALL in addition to the cerebral dysfunction described earlier.","['Vainionpaa, L', 'Kovala, T', 'Tolonen, U', 'Lanning, M']","['Vainionpaa L', 'Kovala T', 'Tolonen U', 'Lanning M']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Oulu, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Neural Conduction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Reaction Time', 'Remission Induction', 'Spinal Cord/*drug effects/physiopathology']",1997/01/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199701)28:1<41::AID-MPO8>3.0.CO;2-T [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199701)28:1<41::aid-mpo8>3.0.co;2-t [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1997 Jan;28(1):41-7. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199701)28:1<41::aid-mpo8>3.0.co;2-t.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median time interval since irradiation was 10.8 years (range 5.6-22.8 years). Most survivors of leukemia received 24 Gy cranial irradiation for central nervous system prophylaxis; patients with solid tumors received between 20 and 66 Gy (median 37.5 Gy). The total evaluation included clinical history, physical examination, thyroid function tests, and thyroid ultrasonography; radionuclide scans were performed in patients whose abnormalities persisted on subsequent ultrasound exams. Clinical history and physical examination revealed thyroid abnormalities in 14 patients (15%), but ultrasound detected abnormalities in 42 patients (44%). These findings included inhomogeneity (n = 29), cysts (n = 15), and nodules (n = 22) and occurred in nearly half of patients treated with 15 Gy or more directly to the thyroid gland. Radionuclide scans confirmed the presence of thyroid nodules in 13 of 15 patients with ultrasonographic evidence of nodules. Six patients had thyroid neoplasia, including one case of papillary carcinoma. All patients with neoplasia had nodules demonstrated on ultrasonography. Our experience suggests that in childhood cancer survivors, ultrasonography is a sensitive, affordable, and noninvasive means of detecting subtle parenchymal abnormalities. We recommend thyroid ultrasonography for childhood cancer survivors who received head and neck irradiation. A baseline study should be obtained within 1 year of completion of therapy.

The series included 19 patients meeting the histopathologic criteria of presumptive LCH who were followed for 1.5-20 years (average 7.7 years). Most frequently, skeletal lesions (16 patients), diffuse interstitial lung infiltrates (seven patients), and pituitary gland involvement with diabetes insipidus (four patients) were present. Bone lesions of the skull and axial skeleton were associated with an infiltration of adjacent soft tissues in 10 of 16 patients. Liver, lymph node, and bone marrow involvement appeared sporadically. LCH was divided into localized or multifocal form. Localized disease took a benign course with remission of bone (n = 4) or lymph node lesions (n = 2). Also, in isolated pulmonary LCH (n = 2), spontaneous transition to inactive disease occurred. With the exception of isolated bone lesions (n = 27), which remained asymptomatic or showed a remission to treatment, multifocal LCH had a more aggressive course. Osseous lesions with adjacent soft tissue infiltration (n = 20) showed a relapse rate in excess of 80% independent of the treatment applied. Pulmonary involvement led to a more marked functional impairment compared to the isolated form, and systemic treatment yielded no convincing effect. In three patients with liver or bone marrow involvement, LCH showed a persistent, serious disease activity. One patient died of transition into acute monomyelocytic leukemia 18 months after diagnosis without preceding chemotherapy. In adults, LCH seems to be limited to a few organ systems. Multifocal LCH represents the more aggressive form with unfavorable prognosis in patients with bone lesions spreading into the adjacent soft tissue and liver or bone marrow involvement.","['Baumgartner, I', 'von Hochstetter, A', 'Baumert, B', 'Luetolf, U', 'Follath, F']","['Baumgartner I', 'von Hochstetter A', 'Baumert B', 'Luetolf U', 'Follath F']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Bone Diseases/pathology/therapy', 'Bone and Bones/pathology', 'Female', '*Histiocytosis, Langerhans-Cell/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",1997/01/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199701)28:1<9::AID-MPO3>3.0.CO;2-P [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199701)28:1<9::aid-mpo3>3.0.co;2-p [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1997 Jan;28(1):9-14. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199701)28:1<9::aid-mpo3>3.0.co;2-p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax activation of HTLV-I gene expression is mediated by three highly homologous regulatory elements known as 21 bp repeats which bind the transcription factor CREB. Questions remain about the mechanism by which Tax can stimulate CREB binding, whether Tax alters CREB binding affinity, what specific sequences in the HTLV-I 21 bp repeat mediate ternary complex formation, and if the ternary complex comprised of Tax and CREB can recruit coactivators such as CBP. To address these points, we used immobilized templates containing either the HTLV-I 21 bp repeats or the somatostatin CRE to assay Tax association with ATF/CREB family members. Tax formed a stable ternary complex on each of the 21 bp repeats with the transcription factor CREB but not related ATF/CREB proteins. In contrast, Tax did not form a similar complex on the CREB binding site in the somatostatin promoter. The formation of this complex was dependent on 3' sequences flanking the CREB binding site within each of the 21 bp repeats and resulted in marked increases in CREB association and binding affinity. Tax increased the binding of phosphorylated CREB to the 21 bp repeat resulting in increased association of the coactivator CBP. However, Tax did not form a complex on the somatostatin CRE in the presence of either phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated CREB and it did not stimulate CBP association to this element. These studies extend previous work and demonstrate how specific DNA sequences flanking the CREB binding site regulate the formation of a stable ternary complex that is able to more efficiently recruit the coactivator CBP.","['Yin, M J', 'Gaynor, R B']","['Yin MJ', 'Gaynor RB']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas 75235-8594, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '51110-01-1 (Somatostatin)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Somatostatin/genetics', '*Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",1996/11/22 00:00,1996/11/22 00:01,['1996/11/22 00:00'],"['1996/11/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/22 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(96)90620-8 [pii]', '10.1006/jmbi.1996.0620 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 1996 Nov 22;264(1):20-31. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.1996.0620.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the relationship between apoptosis and the apoptosis related proteins, bcl-2 and bax, was investigated in a number of human leukemic cell lines. Monocyte-derived supernatant induces extensive apoptosis in U937 myeloid leukemia cells and minor apoptosis in HL60 cells. No apoptosis was seen in four other cell lines (THP1, HL60-D3, KG1, and K562). The expression of bcl-2 and bax protein was determined in both groups of leukemic cell lines by flow cytometry (bcl-2 and bax) and Western blotting (bcl-2) at baseline level and after incubation with monocyte supernatant after different time periods. No clear relation was found between baseline bcl-2 or bax protein expression and the occurrence of apoptosis after incubation with monocyte supernatant. After different incubation time periods, no change was found in bcl-2 protein expression in U937 and K562 cells, whereas in KG1, HL60, and especially in THP1 cells, a significant decrease could be noticed. On the other hand, there was an increase in bcl-2 expression in HL60-D3 cells. Bax protein expression, measured at the same time points, remained essentially unchanged in HL60-D3 cells, decreased significantly in U937, HL60, and THP1 cells and slightly in K562 cells, and increased significantly in KG1 cells. Also, the ratio bax/bcl-2 decreased in HL60D3, but especially in U937 and HL60 cells, increased slightly in THP1 and KG1 cells, and remained essentially unchanged in K562 cells. Rh-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), the main mediator of monocyte mediated cytotoxicity, induced apoptosis in U937, HL60, and THP1 cells, thereby showing changes in bcl-2 expression similar to those found for monocyte derived supernatants. We concluded that in human leukemic cell lines, there is no relation between either bcl-2 or bax protein expression or the ratio of both, and apoptosis mediated by monocyte derived supernatant or TNF-alpha.","['Legdeur, M C', 'Bontje, P M', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Beelen, R H', 'van de Loosdrecht, A A', 'Broekhoven, M G', 'Langenhuijsen, M M', 'Thijsen, S F', 'Hofstee, H', 'Schuurhuis, G J']","['Legdeur MC', 'Bontje PM', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Beelen RH', 'van de Loosdrecht AA', 'Broekhoven MG', 'Langenhuijsen MM', 'Thijsen SF', 'Hofstee H', 'Schuurhuis GJ']","['Department of Hematology, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Monocytes/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1996 Nov;24(13):1530-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, curcumin was found to induce apoptotic cell death in promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells at concentrations as low as 3.5 micrograms/ml. The apoptosis-inducing activity of curcumin appeared in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the hypodiploid DNA peak of propidium iodide-stained nuclei appeared at 4 h after 7 micrograms/ml curcumin treatment. The apoptosis-inducing activity of curcumin was not affected by cycloheximide, actinomycin D, EGTA, W7 (calmodulin inhibitor), sodium orthovanadate, or genistein. By contrast, an endonuclease inhibitor ZnSO4 and proteinase inhibitor N-tosyl-L-lysine chloro-methyl ketone (TLCK) could markedly abrogate apoptosis induced by curcumin, whereas 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) had a partial effect. The antioxidants, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), L-ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol, catalase and superoxide dismutase, all effectively prevented curcumin-induced apoptosis. This result suggested that curcumin-induced cell death was mediated by reactive oxygen species. Immunoblot analysis showed that the level of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was decreased to 30% after 6 h treatment with curcumin, and was subsequently reduced to 20% by a further 6 h treatment. Furthermore, overexpression of bcl-2 in HL-60 cells resulted in a delay of curcumin-treated cells entering into apoptosis, suggesting that bcl-2 plays a crucial role in the early stage of curcumin-triggered apoptotic cell death.","['Kuo, M L', 'Huang, T S', 'Lin, J K']","['Kuo ML', 'Huang TS', 'Lin JK']","['Institute of Toxicology College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/*drug effects']",1996/11/15 00:00,1996/11/15 00:01,['1996/11/15 00:00'],"['1996/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0925-4439(96)00032-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0925-4439(96)00032-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1996 Nov 15;1317(2):95-100. doi: 10.1016/s0925-4439(96)00032-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lipid composition of the liposomes was dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG)/egg phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol/adriamycin (ADM) in a molar ratio of 11.4:2:12:1.3. Liver-metastasizing murine tumour models, M5076 and L5178Y-ML, were used. In vivo antitumour effect against these tumour models was assessed from increase in life span (ILS). The survival prolongation effect of L-ADM in mice with liver failure caused by M5076 was significantly higher than that of F-ADM. In contrast, significant enhancement of the effects by encapsulation in liposomes was not observed in L5178Y-ML-bearing mice. In vitro cytostatic activities of L-ADM against M5076 cells as well as against other tumour cell lines were lower than those of F-ADM. The in vitro kinetic study on the distribution of L-ADM to the tumour cells revealed that ADM in L-ADM was taken up into the tumour cells mainly after it was released from the liposomes rather than taken up as the liposomal form. Among the cell lines tested, M5076 cells had the highest phagocytic activity and therefore the highest uptake activity of ADM during incubation with L-ADM. These findings suggest that the augmented antitumour activity of L-ADM in M5076-bearing mice was the result of phagocytosis of L-ADM by M5076 cells as well as the reduction of toxicity, prolonged retention of ADM in systemic circulation, and liver accumulation of ADM after administration of L-ADM.","['Yachi, K', 'Suzuki, N', 'Tanaka, N', 'Okada, K', 'Mitsui, I', 'Kawato, Y', 'Komagata, Y', 'Komiyama, K', 'Kikuchi, H']","['Yachi K', 'Suzuki N', 'Tanaka N', 'Okada K', 'Mitsui I', 'Kawato Y', 'Komagata Y', 'Komiyama K', 'Kikuchi H']","['Basic Technology Research Laboratory, Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biopharm Drug Dispos,Biopharmaceutics & drug disposition,7911226,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Liposomes)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Culture Media', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Compounding', 'Drug Stability', 'Histiocytic Sarcoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Liposomes', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism/*secondary', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1099-081X(199611)17:8<699::AID-BDD983>3.0.CO;2-D [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1099-081X(199611)17:8<699::AID-BDD983>3.0.CO;2-D [doi]']",ppublish,Biopharm Drug Dispos. 1996 Nov;17(8):699-715. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1099-081X(199611)17:8<699::AID-BDD983>3.0.CO;2-D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Female C57BL/6 mice at 15-17 wks after LP-BM5 retrovirus inoculation and age-matched control animals were used in the studies. APAP treatment (300 mg kg-1, p.o.) resulted in moderate to severe centrilobular necrosis in control animals, with the necrotic area accounting for 40-60% of the total area. In contrast, the APAP-treated (300 mg kg-1, p.o.) infected animals exhibited mild zonal necrosis with the necrotic area accounting for 1-6% of the total area. In the same study, a statistically significant higher percentage of APAP glucuronide and a lower percentage of unchanged APAP were recovered from the urine of the LP-BM5-inoculated animals than from that of controls. No statistically significant differences between infected and uninfected animals in the urinary recovery of APAP sulfate, APAP cysteine, or APAP mercapturate were observed. The formation of APAP metabolites and APAP-associated biochemical changes were also determined from liver slice preparation to avoid in vivo complicating factors. Consistently more significant depletion of the intracellular glutathione levels and K+ content were observed in slices from the uninfected animals at high concentrations of APAP (1 and 2 mM) than in slices from the retrovirus-infected animals. The differences in APAP-associated biochemical changes were accompanied by a 1.4-1.5-fold increase in the formation of APAP glucuronide, sulfate, and glutathione metabolites in slices prepared from animals inoculated with LP-BM5. We concluded that, based on histological examination and hepatic biochemical measurements, the retrovirus-infected animals were more resistant to APAP-induced liver injury. This could be due, in part, to alterations in the detoxification and activation metabolic pathways of APAP.","['Chow, H H', 'Tang, Y', 'Li, P', 'Fisher, R L', 'Brendel, K', 'Watson, R R']","['Chow HH', 'Tang Y', 'Li P', 'Fisher RL', 'Brendel K', 'Watson RR']","['Department of Pharmacy Practice, University of Arizona, Tucson 85721, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biopharm Drug Dispos,Biopharmaceutics & drug disposition,7911226,"['0 (Analgesics, Non-Narcotic)', '362O9ITL9D (Acetaminophen)']",IM,"['Acetaminophen/*toxicity/urine', 'Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/*toxicity/urine', 'Animals', 'Biotransformation', '*Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Chronic Disease', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Female', 'Inactivation, Metabolic', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Liver/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Liver Diseases/metabolism/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Necrosis', 'Retroviridae Infections/*metabolism/physiopathology/virology']",1996/11/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1099-081X(199611)17:8<661::AID-BDD980>3.0.CO;2-C [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1099-081X(199611)17:8<661::AID-BDD980>3.0.CO;2-C [doi]']",ppublish,Biopharm Drug Dispos. 1996 Nov;17(8):661-74. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1099-081X(199611)17:8<661::AID-BDD980>3.0.CO;2-C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we aimed at investigating the rationale of the combination of ATRA plus idarubicin in two human leukemic cell lines, HL-60 and K562, that display a different sensitivity to ATRA treatment. The effects of ATRA were compared with those of two clinically active retinoids, 13-cis-retinoic acid (13-cis-RA) and 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA). Both in HL-60 and in K562 cells, the majority of the combinations of ATRA and idarubicin were synergistic, while the combinations with 9-cis-RA and 13-cis-RA were more effective in HL-60 and K562 cells, respectively. A 72 h pre-incubation with retinoids was able to further increase the cytotoxicity of ATRA plus idarubicin in the two cell lines. Intracellular idarubicin accumulation was enhanced by retinoids, as demonstrated by a cytofluorimetric method.

After in vivo treatment with SDZ PSC 833, mice showed a decreased tolerability to cyclosporin A (CsA), but also to ivermectin, a widely used polycyclic lactone pesticide of Streptomyces avermitilis origin. The sequels were suggestive of CsA- or ivermectin-induced central nervous system dysfunction; they were interpreted as caused by the neutralization of the Pgp at the blood-brain barrier level, implying that CsA and ivermectin were Pgp substrates. CsA was already known to display both Pgp substrate and Pgp inhibitor properties. It now appears that ivermectin may also inhibit Pgp function. When compared in short-term assays for Pgp function inhibition, which measure the restoration of the retention of two Pgp probes in multidrug-resistant (MDR) cells to their parental (Par) cell levels, ivermectin appeared only a few fold weaker that SDZ PSC 833 in the case of murine monocytic leukemia MDR-P388 cells and nearly as active as SDZ PSC 833 in the case of human lymphocytic leukemia MDR-CEM cells.

With the earlier dosimetry systems of the 1960s, it was possible to drive an RBE (relative biological effectiveness) for neutrons from the Japanese data, because it was thought that there was a significant neutron dose at Hiroshima compared with Nagasaki. The estimated RBE of about 20 was consistent with laboratory estimates for oncogenic transformation in vitro and tumors in animals. The revised dosimetry of the 1980s [DS 86] essentially eliminated the neutron component at Hiroshima, and consequently removed the only neutron RBE estimate based on human data. However, recent neutron activation measurements indicate that there may indeed have been thermal neutrons at Hiroshima, and measurements of the ratio of inter- to intra-chromosomal aberrations in peripheral lymphocytes of survivors also tend to indicate that the biologically effective dose was dominated by neutrons. Another area in which the large biological effectiveness of neutrons assumes importance is the production of photoneutrons in high energy medical linear accelerators (Linacs). An increasing number of accelerators operating in the 18 to 20 MV range are coming into routine clinical use and at this energy, photoneutrons generated largely in the collimators result in a total body dose to the patient. The increased risk of second malignancies must be balanced against the slight improvement in percentage depth doses compared with more conventional machines operating at 6 to 10 MV, below the threshold for photoneutron production.","['Hall, E J']",['Hall EJ'],"['Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Bull Cancer Radiother,Bulletin du cancer.

Two of the peripheral blood donors had previously been bone marrow donors and both expressed their preference for the new method.

His initial symptoms consisted of episodes of urinary retention. He underwent transurethral resection of the prostate, and a diagnosis of high-grade lymphoma was rendered. He then received a course of doxorubicin-based lymphoma chemotherapy regimen. However, based on a panel of immunocytochemical stains, a diagnosis of extramedullary leukemia or chloroma was confirmed. His bone-marrow examination at this point was normal. He underwent radiation therapy to the prostate with a total dose of 3960 cGy. Seven months after his initial presentation, he progressed to acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), M2 by FAB classification. He was successfully treated with induction and consolidation chemotherapy with Ara-C and idarubicin, and was maintained in complete remission up to 19 months of follow-up. Eight other cases of prostatic leukemia reported in the literature are presented. Five cases occurred in association with ANLL, 2 cases as sites of ANLL relapse, and 1 case in association with myelodysplasia. The use of immunohistochemical stains has aided us in diagnosis of extramedullary leukemia. Surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy play complementary roles in the treatment of prostatic extramedullary leukemia.","['Quien, E T', 'Wallach, B', 'Sandhaus, L', 'Kidd, P', 'Strair, R', 'Saidi, P']","['Quien ET', 'Wallach B', 'Sandhaus L', 'Kidd P', 'Strair R', 'Saidi P']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08901, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'CHOP protocol']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/diagnosis/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prostatectomy', '*Prostatic Neoplasms/complications/diagnosis/pathology/therapy', 'Radioisotope Teletherapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Urinary Retention/etiology', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1996/12/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199612)53:4<267::AID-AJH13>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199612)53:4<267::AID-AJH13>3.0.CO;2-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1996 Dec;53(4):267-71. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199612)53:4<267::AID-AJH13>3.0.CO;2-9.,,,,18,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The UV spectra of the 10-HCO-H2folate preparation has lambda max. 234, 333 nm and lambda min. 301 nm at pH 7.4, and lambda max. 257, 328 nm and lambda min. 229, 307 nm at pH 1. 1H-NMR spectroscopy of 10-HCO-H2folate (in 2H2O; 300 MHz) suggested a pure compound and gave resonances for one formyl group proton, two protons on C-7 and C-9, and no evidence for a C-6 proton, which is consistent with the structure proposed. The spectral properties indicated that the 10-HCO-H2folate preparation is not appreciably contaminated with 10-HCO-H4folate, 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolic acid (5,10-CH = H4folate) or 10-formylfolic acid (10-HCO-folate). The above data establish that the 10-HCO-H2folate prepared here is authentic. In contrast, a folate with a UV spectrum having lambda max. 272 nm and lambda min. 256 nm at pH 7, which was prepared by 2,6-dichloro-indophenol oxidation of 10-HCO-H4folate and reported to be 97% pure [Baram, Chabner, Drake, Fitzhugh, Sholar and Allegra (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 7105-7111], is apparently not 10-HCO-H2folate. 10-HCO-H2folate is utilized by Jurkat-cell (human T-cell leukaemia) and chicken liver aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase (AICAR T'ase; EC 2.1.2.3) in the presence of excess 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide ribotide (AICAR) resulting in the appearance of approximately 1 mol of H2folate product for each mol of AICAR formylated. The present 10-HCO-H2folate preparation had a kinetic advantage over 10-HCO-H4folate resulting from a difference of approx. 5-fold in K(m) values when both folates were used as cofactors for Jurkat-cell and rat bone marrow AICAR T'ase. No substantial kinetic advantage was observed using chicken liver AICAR T'ase. 10-HCO-H2folate had little or no activity with Jurkat-cell or chicken liver glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase (GAR T'ase, EC 2.1.2.2). The existence in vivo of 10-HCO-H2folate is suggested in mammals by several reports of detectable amounts of radiolabelled 10-HCO-folate in bile and urine after administration of radiolabelled folic acid.","['Baggott, J E', 'Johanning, G L', 'Branham, K E', 'Prince, C W', 'Morgan, S L', 'Eto, I', 'Vaughn, W H']","['Baggott JE', 'Johanning GL', 'Branham KE', 'Prince CW', 'Morgan SL', 'Eto I', 'Vaughn WH']","['Department of Nutrition Sciences, University of Alabama, Birmingham 35294, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Coenzymes)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '2800-34-2 (10-formyltetrahydropteroylglutamic acid)', '28459-40-7 (10-formyldihydrofolate)', '360-97-4 (Aminoimidazole Carboxamide)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.2.- (Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases)', 'EC 2.1.2.3 (Phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide Formyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)', 'F0X88YW0YK (AICA ribonucleotide)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)']",IM,"['Acyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'Chickens', 'Coenzymes/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Folic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/metabolism', '*Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases', 'Kinetics', 'Leucovorin/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide Formyltransferase', 'Rats', 'Ribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/06/15 00:00,1995/06/15 00:01,['1995/06/15 00:00'],"['1995/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3081031 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1995 Jun 15;308 ( Pt 3):1031-6. doi: 10.1042/bj3081031.,,,PMC1136826,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: One hundred thirty-one patients had computerized tomography (CT)-planned transperineal 125I implantation of the prostate from 1988 through 1995. One hundred fourteen of the patients did not receive prophylactic ATBs, 19 of whom required postimplant Foley catheter drainage for 1 day or more for acute urinary retention. RESULTS: The incidence of postimplant febrile episodes within 2 weeks of surgery among the patients who had not received prophylactic ATBs was 2 of 114 (2%). One of the two patients who developed postimplantation febrile episodes was treated successfully with ATBs as an outpatient. The second patient, who had a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and immune suppression, developed E. coli sepsis and required intravenous antibiotics. Of 17 patients who received prophylactic ATBs, none had a postoperative febrile episode.

This was confirmed using the normal interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent mouse myeloblastic 32D cell line. The hydroquinone-induced twofold increase in the number of IL-3-treated myelocytes does not result from stimulation of IL-3-induced proliferation. Hydroquinone's ability to effect this increase through an inhibition of apoptosis was investigated using mouse 32D and human HL-60 myeloblasts. Apoptosis induced by staurosporine treatment (0.5-1.0 microM) of HL-60 cells (50%) and 32D cells (15%) or by IL-3 withdrawal from 32D myeloblasts was determined by monitoring the development of characteristic morphological features and confirmed by the appearance of a typical nucleosomal DNA ladder upon agarose gel electrophoresis. Concentrations of hydroquinone (1-6 microM) that induce differentiation in 32D myeloblasts caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of staurosporine-induced apoptosis in both cell lines, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 3 microM, and prevented apoptosis in IL-3-deprived 32D cells. Hydroquinone inhibition of apoptosis in myeloblasts, like hydroquinone-induced granulocytic differentiation, required myeloperoxidase-mediated oxidation of hydroquinone to its reactive species, p-benzoquinone, and was inhibited 50% by the peroxidase inhibitor, indomethacin (20 microM). p-benzoquinone (3 microM) was shown to cause a 50% inhibition of CPP32, an IL-1 beta-converting enzyme/Ced-3 cysteine protease involved in the implementation of apoptosis and present in myeloid cells. The ability of hydroquinone to induce a program of differentiation in the myeloblast that proceeds only to the myelocyte stage coupled with its ability to inhibit the CPP32 protease and, thereby, apoptosis of the proliferating myelocytes, may have important implications for benzene-induced acute myeloid leukemia.","['Hazel, B A', 'Baum, C', 'Kalf, G F']","['Hazel BA', 'Baum C', 'Kalf GF']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*pharmacology', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mutagens/*pharmacology', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Staurosporine/*pharmacology']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.140730 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1996 Nov;14(6):730-42. doi: 10.1002/stem.140730.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic data showing involvement of both erythroid and monocyte-macrophage lineages in the JCML leukemic clone, as well as an observed episode of B-lineage lymphoid blast crisis in JCML, has strengthened the thesis for a lympho-hematopoietic pluripotent stem cell origin for the disorder. To study this further, JCML CD34+ cells from bone marrow (BM) or spleen from six newly diagnosed patients were isolated and cultured in clonogenic assays with combinations of recombinant cytokines. Compared to control CD34+ cells, JCML cells from all patients showed an aberrant growth pattern restricted almost exclusively to the monocyte-macrophage lineage. Most of the clonogenic activity was seen in a subsorted population of CD34+, HLA-Dr- cells. Additionally, an exaggerated growth response to minute doses of GM-CSF that had no effect on control cells was observed with JCML CD34+ cells. Recloning (""self-renewal"") of JCML CD34+ cells was also strongly promoted by GM-CSF. JCML colonies also formed spontaneously in the absence of exogenous cytokines but were augmented by GM-CSF, interleukin 1 and TNF-alpha, the latter feature not seen with control CD34+ cells from normal BM. The abnormal spontaneous growth pattern of CD34+ JCML cells could be suppressed directly in vitro by anti-TNF-alpha antibodies and anti-GM-CSF antibodies alone or in combination, and by soluble TNF-alpha receptors (sTNF-R:Fc), consistent with the notion that JCML CD34+ cells are stimulated by both cytokines in an autocrine manner. In malignant CD34+ cells from one patient, the cytogenetic marker monosomy 7 proved leukemic involvement of monocyte-macrophage, erythroid and B-lymphoid lineages. We conclude that CD34+ JCML cells of multilineage potential exhibit excessive and aberrant monocyte-macrophage colony formation, a property that was previously observed in JCML progenitors found in light density cell fractions. Thus, within the CD34+ cellular compartment is a subpopulation of JCML ""stem"" cells that accounts for the abnormal leukemic proliferative activity in this disease.","['Freedman, M H', 'Hitzler, J K', 'Bunin, N', 'Grunberger, T', 'Squire, J']","['Freedman MH', 'Hitzler JK', 'Bunin N', 'Grunberger T', 'Squire J']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*chemistry', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood', 'Male', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Stem Cells/chemistry/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.140690 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1996 Nov;14(6):690-701. doi: 10.1002/stem.140690.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, changes in the affinity or quantitative expression of adhesion molecules on either the bone marrow stroma or the blood cell precursor component-during normal development or due to activation or a malignant process-will affect cell attachment. Adhesion molecules, therefore, are modulator molecules which alter the biological behavior of normal or leukemic hematopoietic cells, primarily in terms of migration and localization properties, although they also participate in many other cell functions such as cytotoxicity, antigen presentation and binding of viruses or cancer cells.

In this study we found that the loop diuretic ethacrynic acid, which is used to treat hypercalcemia, enhanced the differentiation of human leukemia cells induced by VD3. Ethacrynic acid alone inhibited the proliferation of human promyelocytic HL-60 cells while only slightly increasing differentiation markers such as nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)-reducing and lysozyme activities. Ethacrynic acid effectively enhanced the growth-inhibiting action of VD3. In the presence of ethacrynic acid, VD3 increased the NBT-reducing and lysozyme activities and the CD11b expression of HL-60 cells more effectively than VD3 alone. Other loop diuretics, furosemide and bumetanide, also enhanced the differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by VD3, but to a lesser extent than ethacrynic acid. The differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by all-trans retinoic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide or phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate was also enhanced by ethacrynic acid with increasing NBT-reducing and lysozyme activities and the expression of CD11b or CD14 surface antigen.

Other human myelomonocytic leukemia ML-1, U937, P39/TSU and P31/FUJ cells were induced to differentiate by VD3 and this was also enhanced by ethacrynic acid. The long-term culture of HL-60 cells showed that ethacrynic acid plus VD3 induced the complete growth arrest of HL-60 cells.

Densitometry was used to quantitate the ratio of the normal 2.0 kb Hpa II fragments, indicating normal methylation status of the gene, compared to the intensity of the abnormal, hyper-methylated, 2.6-3.1 kb Hpa II fragments. We found a gradual increase in the ratio of methylated:unmethylated calcitonin gene during chronic phase with a dramatic rise at blast crisis. Further, the ratio of the abnormal hypermethylated 3.1 kb fragments to the methylated 2.6 kb fragment resulted in the identification of a clonal expansion of abnormally methylated cells. This expansion of cells with hypermethylation of the calcitonin gene during chronic phase was shown to coincide with the presence of a mutation in the p53 gene. The data presented in this study would suggest that an increased methylation status of the calcitonin gene during disease progression may indicate the expansion of abnormal blast cell populations and subsequent progression to blast crisis.","['Mills, K I', 'Guinn, B A', 'Walsh, V A', 'Burnett, A K']","['Mills KI', 'Guinn BA', 'Walsh VA', 'Burnett AK']","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, U.K. WHOKIM@CARDIFF.AC.UK']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,['9007-12-9 (Calcitonin)'],IM,"['Blast Crisis/*genetics/pathology', 'Calcitonin/*genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(96)00045-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(96)00045-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Sep;20(9):771-5. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(96)00045-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One possible way to overcome this problem is to use retinoic acid in combination with another agent that can induce differentiation, such as vitamin D3 or its analogs. In order to understand the mechanism of drug resistance to retinoic acid, we have isolated a clone of human HL-60 myeloid leukemic cells that is resistant to all-trans retinoic acid by continuous exposure to this agent. We have observed that the resistant cell line was also resistant to 9-cis-retinoic acid and more sensitive to the antileukemic action of the vitamin D3 analog, 1,25-dihydroxy-16-ene- 23-yne-26,27-F6-cholecalciferol. In addition, this combination showed synergistic antileukemic action against the wild type HL-60 leukemic cells. DNA sequence analysis revealed a mutation in the ligand binding region of retinoic acid receptor alpha in the HL-60/RA cells in which a glycine was replaced by an aspartic acid. Using gel retardation assays, we observed a large reduction in the formation of RXR-RAR heterodimers in the HL-60/RA cell line as compared to the parental cell line. This mutation in the retinoic acid receptor alpha of the HL-60/RA cells may be responsible for drug resistance to ATRA and 9-cis-retinoic acid and increased sensitivity to vitamin D3 analogs.","['Dore, B T', 'Momparler, R L']","['Dore BT', 'Momparler RL']","['Department de pharmacologie, Universite de Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/drug effects/*genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(96)00043-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(96)00043-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Sep;20(9):761-9. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(96)00043-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-11 has little effect on its own but it synergizes with other hematopoietic growth factors. We investigated the recovery of human myeloid progenitors incubated with IL-11 alone or in combination with other cytokines, including stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) following their in vitro treatment with ARA-C (10(-9) M) or Eilatin (10(-7) M). IL-11 in combination with IL-3 and GM-CSF markedly increased CFU-C colony growth pre- and post-ARA-C or Eilatin incubation from CML and normal individual bone marrow (BM) cells. Similarly, IL-11 alone or in combination with other cytokines increased cell recovery following 7-day suspension culture. A decrease in BCR/ABL fusion product was observed (by FISH analysis) after incubation of BM cells from CML patients in liquid culture for 7 days with 10(-9) M ARA-C or 10(-7) M Eilatin in the presence of IL-11 alone or in combination with other cytokines.

Because bryostatin (bryo) undergoes a rapid clearance in vivo, we were interested in its scheduling effects on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) clonogenicity. Therefore, we assessed the primary plating efficiency (PE1) of AML samples in response to several bryo concentrations after various preincubation periods in a semi-solid colony forming assay. Whereas continuous exposure to 10 nM bryo during the assay period reduced the PE1 in nearly all samples tested, preincubation of eight AML patients' specimens for 1, 2, 3 or 4 days with bryo in a dose range of 0.1-10 nM showed a heterogenous PE1 response. Stimulatory as well as inhibitory effects on leukemic clonogenic growth were seen within individual specimens depending on dose and preincubation time with no single incubation time or concentration that caused unequivocal common overall inhibition of clonogenic growth in most or all of the samples. Higher doses of bryo also failed to result in specific inhibition of leukemic cells: 4/8 samples showed an increased clonogenic response to 250 nM bryo whereas normal bone marrow progenitor cells were consistently inhibited in their clonogenicity at this dose. A marked similarity, i.e. undulatory effects with increasing bryo concentrations, was found for HL60 leukemic cells. In conclusion, the effects of bryo on clonogenic leukemia cell growth are strongly dependent on scheduling and dose varying between and within individual AML samples. These results caution against in vivo bryo pulse therapy, as currently applied, for treatment of AML.","['van der Hem, K G', 'Schuurhuis, G J', 'Drager, A M', 'Odding, J H', 'Huijgens, P C']","['van der Hem KG', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'Drager AM', 'Odding JH', 'Huijgens PC']","['Department of Hematology, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Bryostatins', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lactones/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(96)00031-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(96)00031-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Sep;20(9):743-50. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(96)00031-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Those liposomes consisted of cationic lipids with a long spacer were highly efficient in enhancing retroviral transduction and also less cytotoxic. On the other hand, the length of hydrophobic domains of neutral lipids was not correlated with the efficiency in enhancing the retroviral transduction.

The deranged cholesterol feedback mechanism has been widely recognised in initiation as well as progression of various types of cancers including chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Consequently, the present study was addressed to understand this phenomenon and revealed the existence of a unique 47 kDa protein factor having affinity for this SRE sequence in lymphocytes from normal subjects as well as its absence in lymphocytes from untreated CML patients. However, this factor appeared when the CML patients achieved complete haematological remission (CHR) through alpha-interferon therapy. Further, an inverse relationship was also observed between sterol modulated LDL-receptor gene transcription and the binding affinity of this 47 kDa factor to the SRE sequence. Based upon these results we propose that alpha-interferon through its receptor initiates phosphatidic acid dependent signalling which in turn regulates the affinity of 47 kDa sterol regulatory element binding factor as well as LDL-receptor gene transcription in lymphocytes from CML patients.","['Goel, R', 'Varma, S', 'Kaul, D']","['Goel R', 'Varma S', 'Kaul D']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biotechnology, Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Receptors, LDL)', '0 (Sterols)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '32266-35-6 (Dibutyryl Cyclic GMP)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Bucladesine/metabolism', 'Dibutyryl Cyclic GMP/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, LDL/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sterols/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Zinc/metabolism']",1996/10/22 00:00,1996/10/22 00:01,['1996/10/22 00:00'],"['1996/10/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/22 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304383596043558 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(96)04355-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1996 Oct 22;107(2):193-8. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(96)04355-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Direct transport measurements showed the presence of ATP-dependent uptake activities for NAc-DNP-[35S]Cys and naphthyl [14C] glucuronide, and Km values for half-maximal transport were comparable to the Ki values of these compounds for inhibition of [3H]DNP-SG transport. Transport of [3H]DNP-SG, NAc-DNP-[35S]Cys and naphthyl [14C]glucuronide each showed the same sensitivity to various anions and anion conjugates.

Antisense-oligodeoxynucleotides (AS-ODNs) offer the potential to block specific c-myc gene expression within lymphoma cells, but often exhibit a low efficiency of AS-ODN uptake. In this study, a polycationic lipid reagent, Lipofectamine (LFM), was utilized as a vehicle to increase efficiency of delivery, decrease the time needed to observe an inhibitory effect, and decrease the AS-ODN dose. The objective was to develop a more efficient and rapid in vitro AS-ODN strategy to inhibit proliferation of c-myc-dependent lymphoma cells and to test the specificity of Burkitt's lymphoma cell line-directed AS-ODNs for potential use as molecular purging agents in bone marrow transplantation. Proliferation assays were performed to determine the inhibitory effect of the AS-ODNs on two Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines with different chromosomal translocations, Daudi and ST486, in medium containing 8.5 microM LFM. AS-ODNs at a concentration of 0.36 microM induced a significant decrease in proliferation for both cell lines using the specific AS-ODN for each respective translocation. Within 5 h, Daudi responded to its specific AS-ODN/lipid complexes with a 35% decrease in proliferation, compared to cells which received no treatment or Daudi-specific AS-ODN without LFM (P = 0.0001). Daudi showed an insignificant decrease in proliferation when treated with an AS-ODN specific for the ST486 translocation (4%, P = 0.26). ST486 proliferation was decreased by 52% when treated with the specific antisense for ST486 compared to no treatment or ST486-specific AS-ODN without LFM (P < 0.003). Treatment with the AS-ODN specific for Daudi showed an insignificant 4% decrease (P = 0.42). Controls, including sense ODN for structure, reverse AS-ODN for structure and base composition, and AS-ODN without LFM, did not produce a significant change in cells treated with LFM alone or cells receiving no treatment. Clonogenic assays of both Daudi and ST486 treated with their specific AS-ODNs revealed a 50% inhibition of colony formation after the 5 h incubation as compared to no treatment. Confocal laser scanning microscopy verified that cellular uptake of AS-ODN was enhanced by cationic lipids. Immunoblot analysis showed a 63 +/- 5% and a 50 +/- 3% reduction in intracellular c-myc levels for Daudi and ST486, respectively, when their respective AS-ODNs were administered. Normal bone marrow progenitors were unaffected by the ODN/LFM complexes. These results suggest that the specific c-myc AS-ODN/LFM complexes inhibit c-myc-dependent tumor proliferation at an earlier time and at a lower dose compared to no lipid facilitation. This approach may form the basis for utilizing specific AS-ODN/LFM therapy either alone or in a cocktail of other agents as an ex vivo molecular purging approach to autologous stem cell transplantation in Burkitt's lymphoma.","['Williams, S A', 'Chang, L', 'Buzby, J S', 'Suen, Y', 'Cairo, M S']","['Williams SA', 'Chang L', 'Buzby JS', 'Suen Y', 'Cairo MS']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology and Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital of Orange County, CA 92668, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cation Exchange Resins)', '0 (Cations)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Lipofectamine)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Cation Exchange Resins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cations', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Synergism', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lipids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Dec;10(12):1980-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the time of autografting, nine patients (pts) were in first partial (five pts) or complete (four pts) remission, while four patients had achieved a second complete remission. Following myeloablative therapy a median number of 7.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg were autografted. The median time for neutrophil (> or = 0.5 x 10(9)/l) and platelet recovery (> or = 20 x 10(9)/l) was 13 and 10 days, respectively. Hematological recovery was delayed in a patient who received 5.8 x 10(6) positively selected CD34+ cells/kg. There was one toxic death 17 days post-transplantation because of overwhelming interstitial pneumonia. Two patients with a history of previous treatment failure relapsed 10 and 11 months post-transplantation, respectively, at sites of previous disease. Ten patients are disease-free with a median follow-up time of 18 months (range 10-47). The results presented here suggest that PBSC-supported high-dose therapy including TBI may provide long-term disease-free survival for patients with advanced-stage mantle cell lymphoma.","['Haas, R', 'Brittinger, G', 'Meusers, P', 'Murea, S', 'Goldschmidt, H', 'Wannenmacher, M', 'Hunstein, W']","['Haas R', 'Brittinger G', 'Meusers P', 'Murea S', 'Goldschmidt H', 'Wannenmacher M', 'Hunstein W']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/radiotherapy/surgery/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', '*Transplantation Conditioning', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1996/12/01 00:00,2000/03/29 09:00,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Dec;10(12):1975-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of B29 in other B cell disorders was, as a rule, significantly higher than in CLL.

Within CLL, 2.3% of typical cases were SN8+ while 16% of cases with atypical morphology and an increased number of prolymphocytes were SN8+. Our results suggest a useful role for SN8 in the immunophenotypic differentiation of B cell disorders as a marker for non-CLL diseases.

In this study, we investigated the in vitro cytotoxicity of CdA and CLB in CLL cells from 12 patients in vitro. Treatment with CLB for 6 h, followed by CdA for 18 h, resulted in 2.3- to 7.5-fold synergistic cytotoxicity in leukemic cells from 10 patients and an additive effect in cells from two patients. In general, synergy was greatest in patients who were sensitive to CLB or CdA, and could be enhanced by increasing the concentrations of CLB or CdA. Synergy was only observed if the cells were treated with CLB prior to CdA. Synergy could not be explained by an increase in the incorporation of CdA into DNA, or by the inhibition of repair of CLB-induced DNA crosslinks by CdA. In contrast to CLL cells, treatment of human marrow in vitro with CLB and CdA resulted in a low level of synergy for CFU-GM cells, and additive cell kill in erythroid progenitors. Thus, treatment with CdA and CLB can produce selective synergistic cell kill in CLL cells, and combination therapy may improve the therapeutic index of these agents in chemosensitive patients.","['Begleiter, A', 'Wang, H', 'Verburg, L', 'Lee, K', 'Israels, L G', 'Mowat, M R', 'Johnston, J B']","['Begleiter A', 'Wang H', 'Verburg L', 'Lee K', 'Israels LG', 'Mowat MR', 'Johnston JB']","['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, Manitoba Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/metabolism/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Dec;10(12):1959-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

C2-ceramide inhibited the clonal growth of not only TNF-alpha-sensitive myeloid leukemia cells (HL60 and U937) but also Raji cells. Following stimulation with C2-ceramide, HL60 and U937 cells showed apoptotic cell death, whereas Raji cells did not show a detectable level of apoptosis. However, a cell-cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase was observed in Raji cells after the treatment with C2-ceramide, which was accompanied by the dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma (RB) gene products and decreased expression of p53 proteins. Failure of C2-ceramide to induce apoptosis in Raji cells might be explained by the lack or low expression of apoptosis-inducing proteins by two lines of evidence: (1) Raji cells were resistant to apoptosis induced by ceramide even in the presence of transcription/translation inhibitors; (2) Bax protein expression was not detectable in Raji cells, although Bcl-2 protein expression in Raji cells was even less than that in HL60 and U937 cells. Moreover, protein kinase C (PKC), whose activation has been described to inhibit ceramide-induced apoptosis, inhibitor H-7 did not induce apoptotic cell death in Raji cells, suggesting that an imbalance between PKC and ceramide pathways is not the reason for the resistance of Raji cells against ceramide-induced apoptosis. Finally, ceramide-induced activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) was observed in Raji cells as well as HL60 cells, indicating that activation of this molecule may not be specific for apoptosis. By using the present model, one can dissect cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by ceramide.","['Kuroki, J', 'Hirokawa, M', 'Kitabayashi, A', 'Lee, M', 'Horiuchi, T', 'Kawabata, Y', 'Miura, A B']","['Kuroki J', 'Hirokawa M', 'Kitabayashi A', 'Lee M', 'Horiuchi T', 'Kawabata Y', 'Miura AB']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Akita University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (N-acetylsphingosine)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'NF-kappa B/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*deficiency', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/physiology', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Dec;10(12):1950-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P-glycoprotein expression detected by an immunocytochemical technique using MRK 16 antibody was present at the same level in CLL S and CLL R. The percentage of cells positive for P-gp was below 5% in all samples tested. Topoisomerase IIalpha level was quantified by Western blot analysis. None of the 18 CLL samples had detectable topoisomerase IIalpha protein. In addition, 12 CLL were tested for PCNA staining and no samples had more than 1% of positive cells at immunocytochemical detection indicating that CLL cells were not engaged in the cell cycle. Some differences were found between CLL S and CLL R in the glutathione system. Glutathione concentration (GSH) and GST activity was the same in CLL S and CLL R. The glutathione-S-transferase (GST) isoenzyme profile was different in the two CLL groups. The mean GST-pi and GST-alpha quantitation were twice as high as in CLL R compared to CLL S, but this difference did not reach statistical significance because of large variations between CLL samples. A significant correlation was observed between GST-pi expression and GST activity using CDNB as the substrate. GST-mu was detected in only one of seven CLL before therapy and in six of 11 resistant to chemotherapy. No correlation was found between P-glycoprotein expression, GST activity and the different GST isoenzymes studied. These results suggest that the glutathione system could play a role in the resistance of anticancer agents in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

RA stimulates the IL-3-induced growth by additionally recruiting quiescent stem and progenitor cells out of the G0/G1-phase and by increasing the cell cycle traverse rate. In contrast, TGF-beta addition resulted in a significant decrease in the number of proliferating cells. Simultaneous addition of RA and TGF-beta resulted in a stronger inhibition compared to addition of TGF-beta alone. Preincubation experiments further showed that RA is capable of sensitizing the progenitors to the inhibitory action of TGF-beta: the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta was significantly increased when cells were pretreated with RA. These data show that, in combination with IL-3, RA additionally stimulates quiescent bone marrow progenitors in a simultaneous way, and that it increases sensitivity of the progenitors to the inhibitory action of TGF-beta.

In this study, the effect of GF120918 on MDR cell lines and fresh human leukemia and myeloma cells was investigated.

For cytosine arabinoside, the dose-response curve is a simple negative exponential that can be described by a D10 value, a measure of slope. This D10 value can be affected by regulatory molecules added to the cultures. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) usually sensitizes cells, while hydrocortisone (HC) is protective. Growth factor responsive cells are more Ara-C sensitive in G-CSF than in GM-CSF or IL-3. The proto-oncogene bcl-2 may be part of the mechanism by which drug sensitivity is regulated. Previous work has shown that ATRA decreases bcl-2 RNA expression and the half-life of the protein; in contrast, the protein from cells treated with HC is more stable than controls. Growth factors were not shown to change either expression of bcl-2 RNA or the stability of its protein.

We observed that both measures doubled within 12-24 h after transfer from G-CSF in G-CSF with pIXY, but promptly returned to the previous state when pIXY was withdrawn. We conclude that growth factors regulate that activity of bcl-2 post-transcriptionally by altering the rate of synthesis of the protein.","['Hu, Z B', 'Minden, M D', 'McCulloch, E A']","['Hu ZB', 'Minden MD', 'McCulloch EA']","['The Ontario Cancer Institute/Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (PIXY321 fusion protein, recombinant)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Dec;10(12):1925-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several cell lines were established which consistently demonstrated a 2.5-3.0-fold increase in cellular CDD activity and exhibited an up to 3.0-3.5-fold increase in the IC50 value of ara-C with regard to inhibition of cell proliferation or DNA synthesis, respectively. In the absence of ara-C, these cells maintained unaltered morphology and growth characteristics as compared with parental cells and mock-transfected controls. In addition, we examined the CDD and dCK activity in hematopoietic cells and found CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells to reveal a low ratio of CDD/dCK activity. Together, these data suggest that constitutive overexpression of the CDD gene correlates with increased ara-C resistance and thus may prove useful in considering attempts to attenuate ara-C-induced toxicity on hematopoietic progenitor cells.","['Schroder, J K', 'Kirch, C', 'Flasshove, M', 'Kalweit, H', 'Seidelmann, M', 'Hilger, R', 'Seeber, S', 'Schutte, J']","['Schroder JK', 'Kirch C', 'Flasshove M', 'Kalweit H', 'Seidelmann M', 'Hilger R', 'Seeber S', 'Schutte J']","['Innere Klinik und Poliklinik (Tumorforschung), Universitatsklinikum Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/enzymology', 'Gene Expression', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Transfection']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Dec;10(12):1919-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), expression of flt3 was observed in 61 patients; 22 (73%) with AML and 39 (78%) with ALL. Among these, five patients with AML (one M2, two M4, and two M5) showed unexpected longer transcripts with a primer combination which could amplify the transmembrane (TM) domain through the juxtamembrane (JM) domain. For those patients who expressed flt3 mRNA, the extracellular domain of the flt3 gene was also examined by RT-PCR, but no length abnormality was seen in this region. We further analyzed the TM domain through the second tyrosine kinase domain by genomic amplifications. The five patients who showed aberrant flt3 transcripts exhibited abnormal longer PCR products in addition to the germline products at a region corresponding to the JM through the first TK (TK1) domains. Sequence analyses of the abnormal RT-PCR products demonstrated that partial sequences were tandemly duplicated. Because all these altered transcripts were in-frame, deduced protein products could be expected. Sequence analyses of the genomic DNA revealed that three of the five patients showed a simple internal duplication within exon 11; one had an internal duplication (26 bp) with a 4-bp insertion; and in the fifth patient, a 136-bp sequence from the 3' part of exon 11 to intron 11 and the first 16-bp sequence of exon 12 were each duplicated with 1-bp insertion. In order to confirm the tumor specificity of these alterations, DNA samples obtained at complete remission were also analyzed in the three patients harboring an flt3 duplication, but no abnormal PCR product other than germline was detected in any of the samples. Our results suggest that an internal tandem duplication at the JM/TK1 domains of the flt3 gene is a somatic change detected preferentially in AML, possibly containing a monocytic component.","['Nakao, M', 'Yokota, S', 'Iwai, T', 'Kaneko, H', 'Horiike, S', 'Kashima, K', 'Sonoda, Y', 'Fujimoto, T', 'Misawa, S']","['Nakao M', 'Yokota S', 'Iwai T', 'Kaneko H', 'Horiike S', 'Kashima K', 'Sonoda Y', 'Fujimoto T', 'Misawa S']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Dec;10(12):1911-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of retinoblastoma (Rb) and p53 gene expression in lymphoblasts of patients with de novo, relapsed, or refractory ALL treated in Southwest Oncology Group studies.",1901-10,"To examine the impact of inactivation of tumor suppressor genes on outcome in adult ALL, we compared two groups of patients registered to SWOG treatment protocols for loss of the Rb gene product and p53 overexpression: (1) 89 patients with de novo ALL, and (2) 26 patients with relapsed/refractory ALL. The groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, and race. Cell lysates (> or = 80% blasts) were analyzed by immunoblotting which enabled detection of Rb or p53 proteins in as little as 1 microg of lysate. Loss of Rb expression (pRbneg) was found in 54/85 (64%) de novo and 11/19 (58%) relapsed patients (P = 0.79). Overexpression of p53 (p53abn), indicative of p53 point mutations, was found in 16/75 (21%) de novo and 8/19 (42%) relapsed patients (P = 0.08). Using a nonisotopic RNase cleavage assay, p53 point mutations in exons 5-9 were confirmed in 14/23 (61%) p53abn specimens. For the de novo ALL group, patients with normal Rb protein had higher WBC and higher peripheral blast and lymphocyte counts. Otherwise neither abnormal Rb or p53 expression correlated with any of a large panel of clinical and laboratory variables including FAB class, blast lineage, expression of myeloid antigens or CD34, and presence of the Ph1 chromosome or BCR-ABL. Analyses of treatment outcomes demonstrated no significant impact of Rb or p53 status alone on CR rates, relapse-free or overall survival. An identical percentage (11%) of both de novo and relapsed/refractory patients had concurrent abnormalities of both Rb and p53 expression (pRbneg/p53abn). The survival curve of these patients suggests an increased rate of early death, but the number of patients in this group was small. Summarizing, (1) loss of Rb expression is common in adult ALL; (2) overexpression of p53 may be more frequent in relapsed/refractory than de novo adult ALL; and (3) although Rb or p53 alterations alone are not strong independent predictors of outcome, their concurrent expression may predict a poor response to therapy.","['Tsai, T', 'Davalath, S', 'Rankin, C', 'Radich, J P', 'Head, D', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Boldt, D H']","['Tsai T', 'Davalath S', 'Rankin C', 'Radich JP', 'Head D', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Boldt DH']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio 78284-7880, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, Retinoblastoma', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Point Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/biosynthesis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Dec;10(12):1901-10.,,"['CA32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA54174/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60432/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One group includes the p21 (CIP1, WAF1, CAP20), p27 (Kip1), and p57 (Kip2) CDKIs, which contain a homologous amino-terminal cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitory domain. The p16 (INK4A), p15 (INK4B), and p18 (INK4C) CDKIs, which have an ankyrin repeat motifs, belong to the other group. The p16 and p15 CDKI genes are very frequently altered in a variety of cancers including hematopoietic malignancies. The p19 (INK4D) gene is a newly cloned CDKI which belongs to the latter group. To determine if p19 genetic alterations play a role in hematopoietic malignancies, we examined DNA from 45 childhood newly diagnosed acute lymphocytic leukemias (ALLs), 30 acute myeloblastic leukemias (AMLs), 10 chronic myelocytic leukemias (CMLs), 45 adult T cell leukemias (ATLs), 70 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs), and 20 multiple myelomas (MM) as well as 14 ALL, 20 AML, two ATL, and five lymphoma cell lines.

By dual color in situ hybridization using a YAC from 3q26 containing the EVI1 gene and a YAC from the TPO locus, the localization of the human TPO gene could be refined to 3q27-q28 about 15-20 Mbp telomeric to the 3q26 breakpoints occurring in myeloid malignancies.

Most patients are women. Although widely varying 5q segments are deleted, the vast majority of cases share a common deleted region (5q31).

The female preponderance was found to be limited to refractory anemia (RA), RA with excess of blasts (RAEB) and myeloproliferative disease, all with 5q- as the only chromosome aberration. When other chromosome aberrations had developed or the diagnosis was AML, only marginal female preponderance was observed. The 5q31 was deleted in all patients with MDS and 5q- as the only aberration. In contrast, in AML and following cytogenetic progression other bands were deleted more often than 5q31. This difference, together with a different female preponderance suggests diverse pathogenetic mechanisms in MDS and AML. Furthermore, the bands 5q13-5q21 were found to be of importance for clinical progression from RA to RAEB, and 5q22-5q33 of importance for development of AML and cytogenetic progression.

Of the 135 patients who were still in CR after consolidation, 96 patients were less than 46 years of age: 36 patients had an HLA-identical sibling donor and were allocated for alloBMT (group I); they were compared to the 60 other patients who did not have an HLA-identical sibling donor and were treated with either ASCT or chemotherapy (group II).

Pneumonia responded to treatment in 66%, but outcome depended on when pneumonia was diagnosed. Patients with pneumonia diagnosed during week 1 or 2 (group 2 patients) had the lowest response rate (43%). Patients who developed pneumonia in the 3rd week after treatment initiation had the best outcome with all 16 patients recovering. Patients presenting with pneumonia had an intermediate response rate (75%). The different patient groups were comparable with regard to age, underlying disease, prophylactic therapy, and G-CSF application. Although a lower CR rate was not entirely responsible for the lower response rate in group 2, failure to achieve CR predicted unsuccessful treatment of pneumonia in all groups. Fungal pathogens appeared more common in group 2 patients. However, in these patients, administration of amphotericin B was associated with a significantly higher failure rate (15/21 failures vs 2/9 who received no amphotericin B). We conclude that patients who develop pneumonia during week 1 or 2 are a high-risk group, and that use of amphotericin B indicates a particularly poor prognosis, although we present data suggesting that earlier use of amphotericin might be beneficial. Furthermore, since achievement of CR was an important prognostic factor in all groups, WBC transfusions particularly from donors given G-CSF should be considered as a therapeutic option. Finally, since time to failure of induction therapy and time to CR were similar in high-risk patients, new chemotherapy regimens could potentially improve both the CR rate and the outcome of pneumonia.","['Wilhelm, M', 'Kantarjian, H M', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Pierce, S', 'Keating, M J', 'Freireich, E J', 'Estey, E H']","['Wilhelm M', 'Kantarjian HM', ""O'Brien S"", 'Pierce S', 'Keating MJ', 'Freireich EJ', 'Estey EH']","['Medizinische Poliklinik, University of Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amphotericin B/*therapeutic use', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Pneumonia, Bacterial/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Dec;10(12):1870-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another variant transduced a portion of the feline Notch2 gene, which was expressed as a novel truncated protein in the cell nucleus and which we believe functioned as an oncogene in the development of T cell malignancy.

Here we describe such a target for v-Myb by exploiting a temperature-sensitive mutant of the E26 avian leukemia virus encoding Myb-Ets. Myeloblasts transformed by the mutant differentiate into macrophages or die by apoptosis when shifted to the nonpermissive temperature as a result of inactivation of v-Myb. During this process mRNA of the antiapoptotic oncoprotein Bcl-2 is down-regulated with kinetics similar to those of Mim-1, a differentiation-related protein whose expression is directly regulated by Myb. Forced expression of bcl-2 rescues the cells from apoptosis, without preventing either their withdrawal from the cell cycle or their differentiation. v-Myb appears to act directly on the bcl-2 gene, because a bcl-2 promoter-driven reporter is activated by Myb-Ets and v-Myb-VP16 and requires intact Myb binding sites within the promoter. Surprisingly, inactivation of v-Myb in multipotent progenitors transformed by E26 virus does not induce apoptosis, indicating that bcl-2 regulation by the oncoprotein is required for the transformation of some cell types but not others.","['Frampton, J', 'Ramqvist, T', 'Graf, T']","['Frampton J', 'Ramqvist T', 'Graf T']","['European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins v-myb)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chickens', 'Down-Regulation', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hot Temperature', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Oncogene Proteins v-myb', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/metabolism/*physiology', '*Up-Regulation']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gad.10.21.2720 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Dev. 1996 Nov 1;10(21):2720-31. doi: 10.1101/gad.10.21.2720.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, whether this phosphorylation is required for CD28 costimulation and whether or not phosphorylation of any of the other three tyrosines of the CD28 cytoplasmic tail (tyrosines 188, 191 and 200) is also important for CD28 induced responses is unclear. To address this we examined the ability of chimeric receptors, consisting of the extracellular plus transmembrane membrane domain of human CD8 alpha linked to different mutated human CD28 cytoplasmic tails, to induce IL-2 secretion in Jurkat T leukemia cells in the presence of PMA and ionomycin. A receptor in which tyrosine 173 of the CD28 tail was mutated to phenylalanine was able to induce IL-2. By contrast, receptors which contained single tyrosine 188, 191 or 200 to phenylalanine substitutions were unable to induce IL-2. These results imply that in this system phosphorylation of tyrosine 173 and hence activation of PI3-kinase is not required for CD28 induced IL-2 secretion. Further, they imply that phosphorylation of each of tyrosines 188, 191 and 200 is necessary for this response. Despite an apparent requirement for phosphorylation of all three of these tyrosines, however, receptors which contain tyrosine only at positions 191 or 200 and a truncated receptor which does not contain tyrosine 200 induce normal IL-2. These last findings, therefore, illustrate the complexity of CD28 mediated activation signals.","['Teng, J M', 'King, P D', 'Sadra, A', 'Liu, X', 'Han, A', 'Selvakumar, A', 'August, A', 'Dupont, B']","['Teng JM', 'King PD', 'Sadra A', 'Liu X', 'Han A', 'Selvakumar A', 'August A', 'Dupont B']","['Immunology Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))']",IM,"['CD28 Antigens/*immunology', 'Cytoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*immunology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tyrosine/*immunology']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1399-0039.1996.tb02643.x [doi]'],ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 1996 Oct;48(4 Pt 1):255-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0039.1996.tb02643.x.,,"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09149/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-22507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dramatic symptoms that gave the disease its name and the unique nature of the underlying cellular abnormality made the disease for many years a curiosity amongst human blood disorders. Clinical manifestations of PNH are chronic hemolytic anemia with acute exacerbations, bone marrow failure, an increased tendency to thrombosis, and episodes of severe abdominal pain. PNH has a close although not yet fully understood relationship to aplastic anemia (AA), and probably also to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Blood cells in patients with PNH have a defect in the biosynthesis of a complex glycolipid structure which is a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) molecule and serves as an anchor for many surface proteins. Red cells, granulocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes and platelets are therefore deficient in all proteins which are anchored to the cell membrane by such a molecule. Biochemical analysis pinpointed the metabolic block in PNH cells to an early step in the anchor biosynthesis. The block in the biosynthetic pathway is due to the deficiency of a protein called PIG-A. The PIG-A gene maps to the X-chromosome. Cloning of the gene and analysis of the gene in PNH patients lead to the identification of a number of somatic mutations which occur on the active X-chromosome in an early hematopoietic stem cell. All mutations identified thus far inactivate or impair the function of the PIG-A protein and therefore fully explain the deficiency of the missing surface proteins, which in turn explain some of the clinical features of the disease. However, the characterization of the molecular lesion does not explain how the PNH clone can expand to the extent of contributing a substantial proportion of the patient's hematopoiesis. Thus a second factor is needed to explain the pathogenesis of PNH. We hypothesize that this is most likely the coexistence of bone marrow failure that produces paradoxically a growth or survival advantage for the PNH clone. The coexistence of more than one PNH clone in many patients supports this hypothesis and suggests that bone marrow failure is the primary event. The occurrence of the PIG-A mutation causing the absence of GPI-linked proteins on blood cells allows the PNH clone to flourish and to maintain hematopoiesis; thus it seems that the PIG-A mutation is nature's own gene therapy and the price that these patients have to pay is PNH.","['Bessler, M']",['Bessler M'],"['Department of Human Genetics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York 10021 NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Schweiz Med Wochenschr,Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,0404401,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Hemolytic/complications', 'Blood Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/complications', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/biosynthesis/blood', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/*blood/complications/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Thrombosis/complications']",1996/11/09 00:00,1996/11/09 00:01,['1996/11/09 00:00'],"['1996/11/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/09 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/09 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Schweiz Med Wochenschr. 1996 Nov 9;126(45):1912-21.,,,,49,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied the cell growth of HTLV-I-infected human T cells in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice and found that fresh leukemic cells or cell lines derived from leukemic cell clones but not HTLV-I-infected cell lines of nonleukemic cell origin showed tumorigenicity, and neither HTLV-I nor IL-2 expression was needed for cell growth in vivo, indicating that accumulating changes in addition to the initial events induced by HTLV-I infection were required for the development of ATL. The interaction between ATL cells and vascular endothelial cells appears to be one of the important factors which determine the pattern of organ infiltration by leukemic cells. E-selectin and its ligand are one of the major cell adhesion pathways between ATL cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Another pathway that had not been identified was studied using newly developed monoclonal antibodies capable of blocking cell adhesion. The molecules which directly mediate adhesion between ATL cells and HUVEC were determined to be OX40 and gp34, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) family and TNF family, respectively.

The zinc finger and leucine zipper domains of BR140 have significant homology to those of AF10 and AF17, suggesting that it belongs to this newly described gene family and, therefore, could be a target for chromosome translocation. To assess the potential involvement of BR140 in chromosome translocations in leukaemia, the chromosomal location of the BR140 gene has been determined by using several independent methods.

Only some mouse strains are susceptible to MPC induction, however, with BALB/c as the outstanding example. Most other strains are resistant. Our earlier studies with reciprocal BALB/c<-->DBA/2 chimeras suggested that part of this susceptibility is determined at the level of the target cell itself (DBA/2 is MPC resistant). The probability of the Ig/myc translocation is one of the possibly relevant variables. Because MPC resistance is dominant over susceptibility, it is conceivable that the translocations prevail due to some deficiency of the Ig rearrangement or Ig-associated repair mechanisms in BALB/c cells. This could be determined at the level of the chromosomes that participate in the translocation or by genes on other chromosomes. Here, we show that the substitution of the BALB/c-derived chr 12, 6, and 15, which carry IgH, kappa, and myc, respectively, with their homologs derived from MPC-resistant mice, did not affect MPC susceptibility. The use of Robertsonian 4.12 and 6.15 chromosomes in this study has also provided us with the opportunity to assess the parental derivation of the chromosomes participating in the translocation. In contrast to the human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-associated BCR/ABL fusion transcript, where a strong bias was claimed that was attributed to imprinting, we have found that the parental chromosomes were randomly involved in the translocation. We have also shown that the translocations could be of uniparental or biparental origin.","['Silva, S', 'Babonits, M', 'Klein, G']","['Silva S', 'Babonits M', 'Klein G']","['Microbiology and Tumor Biology Center (MTC), Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Animals', '*Chromosomes', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Female', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Plasmacytoma/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1996/11/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199611)17:3<179::AID-GCC6>3.0.CO;2-1 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199611)17:3<179::AID-GCC6>3.0.CO;2-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1996 Nov;17(3):179-84. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199611)17:3<179::AID-GCC6>3.0.CO;2-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our strategy of cloning the cDNA was to screen a human hepatoma G2 cDNA expression library in lambda gt11 using three different probes complementary to the coding strands of regions of the Hpr gene that contain codon changes permitting a discrimination from haptoglobin gene Hp1F. Among 8 x 10(5) recombinant phages screened, 2 hybridized to all three probes under stringent conditions. A 1.5 kb cDNA designated ST-1 was subcloned and sequenced. Almost total identity was found with the Hpr predicted exons 2-5, although exon 1 was missing. The ST-1 partial cDNA clone was used as a probe to screen a human leukemia molt-4 cDNA expression library in lambda gt11. Among 10(6) recombinant phages screened, 1 hybridized under stringent conditions. A 1.5 kb cDNA designated ST-2 was subcloned and sequenced. ST-1 and ST-2 cDNA were identical except for an insert of A at position 500 of ST-1 cDNA. Two different nucleotide changes were observed in the ST-1 and ST-2 sequences as compared with the expected Hpr cDNA sequence. An alternative processing of Hpr pre-mRNA was found in both cDNA clones that included 126 bp of the 3'-region of intron 1. This intronic sequence is thereby retained in the mature mRNA. cDNA analysis revealed an in-frame ATG in intron 1. Transcription/translation assay was used to demonstrate that the Hpr message could be translated from the internal methionine codon. We have thus shown for the first time that the Hpr gene is expressed in the human hepatoma G2 and leukemia molt-4 cell lines.","['Tabak, S', 'Lev, A', 'Valansi, C', 'Aker, O', 'Shalitin, C']","['Tabak S', 'Lev A', 'Valansi C', 'Aker O', 'Shalitin C']","['Department of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (HPR protein, human)', '0 (Haptoglobins)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/*biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Haptoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/dna.1996.15.1001 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 1996 Nov;15(11):1001-7. doi: 10.1089/dna.1996.15.1001.,['GENBANK/X89214'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, results are conflicting regarding the duration of palliation and the toxicity associated with this treatment. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with lymphoproliferative or myeloproliferative disorders were treated with splenic irradiation for palliation of splenomegaly and pain. The spleen was measured and pain and toxicity were assessed during radiation therapy. RESULTS: Splenomegaly and splenic pain decreased in 60 percent and 91 percent of patients, respectively. Radiation doses higher than 500 cGy appeared to be more effective than lower doses in reducing the spleen size in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Regression of splenomegaly and pain relief were maintained for less than one year and more than six months, respectively. Acute radiation toxicity resulted in the cessation of radiotherapy in two patients. CONCLUSION: Splenic irradiation is effective in the short-term palliation of splenomegaly and pain and may be most useful in the subset of patients with a life expectancy of less than one year. Terminally ill patients with splenomegaly secondary to lymphoproliferative or myeloproliferative disorders may benefit from splenic irradiation to minimize pain and pressure symptoms in addition to possible reduction of narcotic use.","['Paulino, A C', 'Reddy, S P']","['Paulino AC', 'Reddy SP']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hosp Palliat Care,The American journal of hospice & palliative care,9008229,,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*radiotherapy', 'Pain/etiology', 'Palliative Care/*methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Splenomegaly/*radiotherapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/104990919601300613 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hosp Palliat Care. 1996 Nov-Dec;13(6):32-5. doi: 10.1177/104990919601300613.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exfoliative cheilitis and infections (herpes and candidosis) were the most common oral complications, followed by haemorrhagic lesions and mucositis. Haemorrhagic lesions correlated with thrombocytopenia (RR = 30.5). Etoposide administration (RR = 8.6), alkylating agents (RR = 15.6), a prior course of chemotherapy (RR = 23.2) and neutropenia (RR = 4.16) were predictors of mucositis. Oral lesions were a common complication in this study, and a possible association of mucositis with several factors is suggested.","['Ramirez-Amador, V', 'Esquivel-Pedraza, L', 'Mohar, A', 'Reynoso-Gomez, E', 'Volkow-Fernandez, P', 'Guarner, J', 'Sanchez-Mejorada, G']","['Ramirez-Amador V', 'Esquivel-Pedraza L', 'Mohar A', 'Reynoso-Gomez E', 'Volkow-Fernandez P', 'Guarner J', 'Sanchez-Mejorada G']","['Department of Health Care, Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana-Xochimilco, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Cancer B Oral Oncol,"European journal of cancer.

To address this question, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were transfected with a murine leukemia retroviral vector containing DNA encoding either the catalytic domain of myosin light chain kinase (tMK) or the beta-galactosidase gene (beta-gal). Autoradiograms of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of myosin immunoprecipitated from 32Pi-labeled transfected cells demonstrated that MLC20 phosphorylation was increased 3.1 +/- 0.9-fold in cells expressing tMK compared with cells expressing beta-gal. Phosphopeptide mapping confirmed that myosin light chain kinase was responsible for the increased MLC20 phosphorylation. Transepithelial electrical resistance, a measurement of barrier function, of tMK cell monolayers was consistently < 10% (123 +/- 20 omega.cm2) of that of monolayers comprised of wild-type cells (1,456 +/- 178 omega.cm2) or cells expressing beta-gal (1,452 +/- 174 omega.cm2).

Therapeutic agents used for their treatment have been found responsible for the development of SPN in some cases. In addition, genetic factors are known to contribute to their development. METHODS: A retrospective study of 15 patients who had primary breast cancer and developed SPN concurrently or sequentially was conducted. RESULTS: Of 15 patients analysed in this study, five had haematological SPN, four had ovarian cancer, and six had different types of non-haematological SPN. Familial clustering was found in two patients. A peculiar abnormality of chromosome 5 and 7 was detected in one patient with haematological SPN, suggesting therapy-related leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: It is postulated that alkylating agents with or without p53 gene inactivation may predispose to leukaemia, whereas ovarian tumors following breast cancer could be related to BRCA 1 gene inactivation.","['Parikh, B', 'Advani, S']","['Parikh B', 'Advani S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Bombay, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Surg Oncol,Journal of surgical oncology,0222643,,IM,"['Adult', '*Breast Neoplasms/therapy', 'Causality', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/etiology', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",1996/11/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-9098(199611)63:3<179::AID-JSO8>3.0.CO;2-A [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-9098(199611)63:3<179::AID-JSO8>3.0.CO;2-A [doi]']",ppublish,J Surg Oncol. 1996 Nov;63(3):179-82. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-9098(199611)63:3<179::AID-JSO8>3.0.CO;2-A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A prominent factor that guarantees genomic stability of cells is p53 (ref. 1). The P53 gene encodes a transcription factor that has a role as a tumour suppressor. Identification of p53-target genes should provide greater insight into the molecular mechanisms that mediate the tumour suppressor activities of p53. The rodent Pc3/Tis21 gene was initially described as an immediate early gene induced by tumour promoters and growth factors in PC12 and Swiss 3T3 cells. It is expressed in a variety of cell and tissue types and encodes a remarkably labile protein. Pc3/Tis21 has a strong sequence similarity to the human antiproliferative BTG1 gene cloned from a chromosomal translocation of a B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. This similarity led us to speculate that BTG1 and the putative human homologue of Pc3/Tis21 (named BTG2) were members of a new family of genes involved in growth control and/or differentiation. This hypothesis was recently strengthened by the identification of a new antiproliferative protein, named TOB, which shares sequence similarity with BTG1 and PC3/TIS21 (ref. 7). Here, we cloned and localized the human BTG2 gene. We show that BTG2 expression is induced through a p53-dependent mechanism and that BTG2 function may be relevant to cell cycle control and cellular response to DNA damage.","['Rouault, J P', 'Falette, N', 'Guehenneux, F', 'Guillot, C', 'Rimokh, R', 'Wang, Q', 'Berthet, C', 'Moyret-Lalle, C', 'Savatier, P', 'Pain, B', 'Shaw, P', 'Berger, R', 'Samarut, J', 'Magaud, J P', 'Ozturk, M', 'Samarut, C', 'Puisieux, A']","['Rouault JP', 'Falette N', 'Guehenneux F', 'Guillot C', 'Rimokh R', 'Wang Q', 'Berthet C', 'Moyret-Lalle C', 'Savatier P', 'Pain B', 'Shaw P', 'Berger R', 'Samarut J', 'Magaud JP', 'Ozturk M', 'Samarut C', 'Puisieux A']","['Unite INSERM U453, Affiliee au CNRS, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,"['0 (Btg1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Btg2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '141490-22-4 (BTG2 protein, human)', '146835-72-5 (BTG1 protein, human)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*DNA Damage', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', '*Immediate-Early Proteins', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/ng1296-482 [doi]'],ppublish,Nat Genet. 1996 Dec;14(4):482-6. doi: 10.1038/ng1296-482.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD34-positive cells were cultured in the presence of appropriate concentrations of SCF and G-CSF for 5-7 d. After gamma irradiation with 500 rad or growth factor deprivation, the fraction of apoptotic cells was assessed by two independent methods applying either measurement of cells incorporating FITC-labelled dUTP by terminal transferase or assessment of the fraction of cells with a less than 2N DNA content in flow cytometry. Proliferating CML cells were not resistant to the induction of apoptosis either after gamma irradiation or subsequent to growth factor deprivation. A similar fraction of normal and CML cells underwent apoptosis 48 h after withdrawal of growth factors. CML cells displayed an increased susceptibility to induction of apoptosis after DNA damage. A significantly higher proportion of apoptotic cells were detected in samples derived from CML patients after irradiation with 0.5 Gy. These results, in conjunction with conflicting observations by other investigators, on the induction of apoptosis by gamma irradiation in various bcr-abl positive cells, suggest that bcr-abl-dependent effects on apoptosis strongly depend on the cells used. Our observations in CML cells derived exclusively from newly diagnosed CML patients demonstrate that bcr-abl expression per se is not sufficient to induce resistance to apoptosis.","['Albrecht, T', 'Schwab, R', 'Henkes, M', 'Peschel, C', 'Huber, C', 'Aulitzky, W E']","['Albrecht T', 'Schwab R', 'Henkes M', 'Peschel C', 'Huber C', 'Aulitzky WE']","['IIIrd Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of the Johannes Gutenberg-Universitat, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Cell Division', '*DNA Damage', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Gamma Rays', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*pathology', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1934.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Dec;95(3):501-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1934.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic Leukaemia Working Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT),494-500,"A total of 229 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in chronic phase were randomized between 1986 and 1990 to receive or not receive additional splenic irradiation as part of their conditioning prior to bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Both groups, 115 patients with and 114 patients without splenic irradiation, were very similar regarding distribution of age, sex, donor/recipient sex combination, conditioning, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prevention method and blood counts at diagnosis or prior to transplant. 135 patients (59%) are alive as of October 1995 with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. 52 patients have relapsed (23%), 26 patients in the irradiated, 26 patients in the non-irradiated group (n.s.) with a relapse incidence at 6 years of 28%. The main risk factor for relapse was T-cell depletion as the method for GvHD prevention, and an elevated basophil count in the peripheral blood prior to transplant. Relapse incidence between patients with or without splenic irradiation was no different in patients at high risk for relapse, e.g. patients transplanted with T-cell-depleted marrows (P = n.s.) and in patients with low risk for relapse, e.g. patients transplanted with non-T-cell-depleted transplants and basophil counts < 3% prior to transplant (P = n.s.). However, relapse incidence differed significantly in patients with non-T-cell-depleted transplants and high basophil counts (> 3% basophils in peripheral blood). In this patient group, relapse incidence was 11% at 6 years with splenic irradiation but 32% in the non-irradiated group (P = 0.05). Transplant-related mortality was similar whether patients received splenic irradiation or not. This study suggests an advantage in splenic irradiation prior to transplantation for CML in this subgroup of patients and illustrates the need for tailored therapy.","['Gratwohl, A', 'Hermans, J', 'van Biezen, A', 'Arcese, W', 'Debusscher, L', 'Ernst, P', 'Ferrant, A', 'Frassoni, F', 'Gahrton, G', 'Iriondo, A', 'Kolb, H J', 'Link, H', 'Niederwieser, D', 'Ruutu, T', 'Siegert, W', 'Zwaan, F E']","['Gratwohl A', 'Hermans J', 'van Biezen A', 'Arcese W', 'Debusscher L', 'Ernst P', 'Ferrant A', 'Frassoni F', 'Gahrton G', 'Iriondo A', 'Kolb HJ', 'Link H', 'Niederwieser D', 'Ruutu T', 'Siegert W', 'Zwaan FE']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Kantonsspital, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Child', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*therapy', 'Lymphopenia/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Spleen/*radiation effects', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1929.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Dec;95(3):494-500. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1929.x.,,,,,,['Br J Haematol. 1997 Apr;97(1):248-9.

A recombinant fusion protein of protein A and the superantigen Staphylococcus enterotoxin A (SEA) was used together with the mAbs anti-CD7, anti-CD38, anti-CD45RA and 4E3 (anti-P-glycoprotein) to correlate susceptibility to SDCC with expression of the MDR1-gene product. Our results demonstrated SDCC to be independent of MDR1-gene expression. This was further confirmed by blocking the function of Pgp in the leukaemic cell lines with a cyclosporine A derivative, which had no influence on SDCC. As expected, expression of the respective cell surface antigens on target cells had a strong impact on SDCC, although other factors seem to influence efficiency of SDCC as well.","['Zehrer, C', 'Beck, J', 'Gekeler, V', 'Ihle, J', 'Holzer, U', 'Dohlsten, M', 'Kalland, T', 'Niethammer, D', 'Dannecker, G E']","['Zehrer C', 'Beck J', 'Gekeler V', 'Ihle J', 'Holzer U', 'Dohlsten M', 'Kalland T', 'Niethammer D', 'Dannecker GE']","[""Department of Oncology/Haematology, Children's University Hospital, Tubingen, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Enterotoxins)', '0 (Superantigens)', '37337-57-8 (enterotoxin A, Staphylococcal)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics/immunology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics/immunology', 'Enterotoxins/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Superantigens/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1938.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Dec;95(3):452-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1938.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Endogenous serum hGM-CSF levels were detected by ELISA [mean 9585 pg/ml (line A, n = 4); mean 1610 pg/ml (line B, n = 4)]. Expression of hGM-CSF was observed in all organs tested including the heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, thymus, bone marrow and brain of hGM-CSF transgenic (hGMTg) mice. Morphological analysis of organs and peripheral blood cell counts showed no differences between hGMTg mice and their littermates. Murine Ba/F3 cells expressing functional hGM-CSF alpha beta receptor (BAF/alpha beta cells) could be successfully engrafted in hGMTg SCID mice.

We investigated bone marrows from 11 such patients (8 boys and 3 girls) and detected allelic losses at the NF1 locus in 4 of them and probable losses in 2 others. To determine which hematopoietic cell lineages were derived from the abnormal clones, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed cell lines and CD34+ cells were analyzed from 3 children with JCML with allelic losses in unfractionated marrow. CD34 cells from these 3 patients lacked the normal NF1 allele, whereas EBV cell lines retained it. Erythroblasts plucked from the burst-forming unit-erythroid colonies of one of these children lacked the normal NF1 allele. We also studied a 10-month-old boy with NF1 who developed an unusual myeloproliferative syndrome. His bone marrow and EBV cell line both showed loss of the normal NF1 allele. In our series and in the literature, male sex and maternal transmission of NF1 were associated with the highest risk of myeloid leukemia. These data (1) provide strong genetic evidence that NF1 functions as a tumor-suppressor in early myelopoiesis, (2) confirm the clonal nature of JCML/JMML, (3) suggest that the elevation in fetal hemoglobin seen in JCML/JMML is a result of primary involvement of erythroid progenitors in the malignant clone, (4) show consistent loss of NF1 in the CD34 cells of affected children and show that the malignant clone may also give rise to pre-B cells in some cases, and (5) implicate epigenetic factors in the development of leukemia in children with NF1.","['Miles, D K', 'Freedman, M H', 'Stephens, K', 'Pallavicini, M', 'Sievers, E L', 'Weaver, M', 'Grunberger, T', 'Thompson, P', 'Shannon, K M']","['Miles DK', 'Freedman MH', 'Stephens K', 'Pallavicini M', 'Sievers EL', 'Weaver M', 'Grunberger T', 'Thompson P', 'Shannon KM']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco 94143-0519, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Alleles', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/epidemiology/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neurofibromatosis 1/blood/complications/genetics/*pathology', 'Risk', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61177-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Dec 1;88(11):4314-20.,,"['3M01 RR01271-13S1/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular mechanisms of these altered functions are unknown. As expression of the p210bcr-abl oncogene product, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, is known to have an essential role in the pathogenesis of CML and tyrosine phosphorylation is intimately involved in various aspects of platelet activation, we examined the pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in platelets from 15 CML patients by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody (4G10). Before and after stimulation with thrombin, the only consistent difference between normal and CML platelets was the presence of a tyrosine phosphorylated protein with a relative molecular weight of 39 kD. This tyrosine phosphorylated protein was identified as crid, an SH2, SH3 containing adapter protein. Thus, as previously demonstrated for neutrophils from CML patients, tyrosine phosphorylation of p39crkl persists in mature platelets. No tyrosine phosphorylation of crid was detected following stimulation with thrombin in normal platelets. However, crkl became incorporated into the Triton X-100 insoluble residue following thrombin stimulation in a manner dependent on platelet aggregation. Further, we found that crkl is an endogenous substrate for calpain, a protease that may be involved in postaggregation signaling processes. This suggests that crkl may be involved in the reorganization of the cytoskeleton during normal platelet aggregation and its tyrosine phosphorylation in CML platelets may contribute to the abnormal platelet function in CML patients. Finally, we found that thrombopoietin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of crk1 in normal platelets and FDCP cells genetically engineered to express human c-Mpl. This suggests that crk1 can be phosphorylated by a kinase other than p210bcr-abl and that crk1 may have a role in signaling by thrombopoietin.","['Oda, A', 'Miyakawa, Y', 'Druker, B J', 'Ishida, A', 'Ozaki, K', 'Ohashi, H', 'Wakui, M', 'Handa, M', 'Watanabe, K', 'Okamoto, S', 'Ikeda, Y']","['Oda A', 'Miyakawa Y', 'Druker BJ', 'Ishida A', 'Ozaki K', 'Ohashi H', 'Wakui M', 'Handa M', 'Watanabe K', 'Okamoto S', 'Ikeda Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Calpain/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Platelet Aggregation/drug effects', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Thrombin/pharmacology', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61176-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Dec 1;88(11):4304-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past 15 years, we treated 56 patients with t-leuk who had received prior chemotherapy (39%), radiotherapy (11%), or both (45%). The drugs received included alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors. The primary tumors included hematological malignancies (49%) and solid tumors such as breast or ovarian cancer. The median age at diagnosis of the primary tumor was relatively young (43 years +/- 18). Twelve patients had more than one primary tumor and 31 patients had a family history of malignancy. Karyotypic abnormalities were found in 91% of the patients. Prognosis was uniformly poor, with an overall median survival of 10 months. Twelve of the 18 patients examined (67%) had a multidrug resistance phenotype. P53 genes of the leukemic cells, as well as the original tumors, were analyzed in 21 patients using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis followed by sequencing. P53 mutations were identified in 38% of these patients, a relatively high prevalence compared with other forms of MDS or de novo acute myeloid leukemia. Mutations were nongermline and restricted to the leukemic cells. We identified different p53 mutations in the various primary tumors of individual patients. The presence of a mutator phenotype was assessed by PCR analysis of microsatellites in eight loci (one trinucleotide repeat sequence, four dinucleotide, and three mononuclear repeat sequences). Microsatellite instability in two to seven loci were found in 15 of 16 (94%) of the patients. This instability is compatible with a mutator phenotype, which predisposes the patients to the development of malignancies including t-leuk.","['Ben-Yehuda, D', 'Krichevsky, S', 'Caspi, O', 'Rund, D', 'Polliack, A', 'Abeliovich, D', 'Zelig, O', 'Yahalom, V', 'Paltiel, O', 'Or, R', 'Peretz, T', 'Ben-Neriah, S', 'Yehuda, O', 'Rachmilewitz, E A']","['Ben-Yehuda D', 'Krichevsky S', 'Caspi O', 'Rund D', 'Polliack A', 'Abeliovich D', 'Zelig O', 'Yahalom V', 'Paltiel O', 'Or R', 'Peretz T', 'Ben-Neriah S', 'Yehuda O', 'Rachmilewitz EA']","['Department of Hematology, Hadassah University Hospital, Ein Karem, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Israel/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*genetics/mortality', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', '*Microsatellite Repeats', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/etiology/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/epidemiology/radiotherapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology/*genetics/mortality', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61175-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Dec 1;88(11):4296-303.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was a statistically significant correlation between the CD2 antigen positive leukemic cell content of bone marrow and probability of remaining in bone marrow remission, as well as overall event-free survival (EFS) (P = .0003 and P = .002, log-rank tests for linear trend). When compared with patients with the highest CD2 expression level (> 75% positivity), the life table relative event rate (RER) was 1.22 for patients with intermediate range CD2 expression level (30% to 75% positivity) and 1.81 for ""CD2-negative"" patients (< 30% positivity). At 6 years postdiagnosis, the EFS estimates for the three CD2 expression groups (low positivity to high positivity) were 52.8%, 65.5%, and 71.9%, respectively. CD2 expression remained a significant predictor of EFS after adjustment for the effects of other covariates by multivariate regression, with a RER of 1.47 for CD2-negative patients (P = .04). Analysis of T-lineage ALL patients shows a significant separation in EFS after adjustment for the National Cancer Institute (NCI) age and white blood cell (WBC) criteria for standard and high-risk ALL (P = .002, RER = 1.67). The determination of CD2 expression on leukemic cells helped identify patients with the better and poorer prognoses in both of these risk group subsets. For standard risk T-lineage ALL, CD2-negative patients had a worse outcome (P = .0007, RER = 2.92) with an estimated 5-year EFS of 55.9% as compared with 78.3% for the CD2-positive patients. Thus, CD2 negativity in standard risk T-lineage ALL identified a group of patients who had a worse outcome than high-risk T-lineage ALL patients who were CD2 positive. The percentage of CD2 antigen positive leukemic cells from T-lineage ALL patients is a powerful predictor of EFS after chemotherapy. This prognostic relationship is the first instance in which a biological marker in T-lineage ALL has been unequivocally linked to treatment outcome.","['Uckun, F M', 'Steinherz, P G', 'Sather, H', 'Trigg, M', 'Arthur, D', 'Tubergen, D', 'Gaynon, P', 'Reaman, G']","['Uckun FM', 'Steinherz PG', 'Sather H', 'Trigg M', 'Arthur D', 'Tubergen D', 'Gaynon P', 'Reaman G']","[""Children's Cancer Group ALL Biology Reference Laboratory, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55113, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'CD2 Antigens/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hepatomegaly/etiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/*mortality/pathology', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk', 'Splenomegaly/etiology/pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61174-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Dec 1;88(11):4288-95.,,"['CA-13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42633/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-51425/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated levels of apoptosis and of apoptosis-related oncoproteins (c-Myc, which enhances, and Bcl-2, which diminishes apoptosis) expressed within CD34+ and CD34- marrow cell populations of MDS patients (n = 24) to determine their potential roles in the abnormal hematopoiesis of this disorder. Marrow cells were permeabilized and CD34+ and CD34- cells were separately analyzed by FACS to detect: (1) a subdiploid (sub-G1) DNA population, and (2) expression of Bcl-2 and c-Myc oncoproteins. Within the CD34+ subset, a significantly increased percentage of cells demonstrated apoptotic/sub-G1 DNA content in early (ie. refractory anemia) MDS patients compared with normal individuals and AML patients (mean values: 9.1% > 2.1% > 1.2%). Correlated with these findings, the ratio of expression of c-Myc to Bcl-2 oncoproteins among CD34+ cells was significantly increased for MDS patients compared to those from normal and AML individuals (mean values: 1.6 > 1.2 > 0.9). Bcl-2 and c-Myc oncoprotein levels were maturation stage-dependent, with high levels expressed within CD34+ marrow cells, decreasing markedly with myeloid maturation. Treatment of seven MDS patients with the cytokines granulocyte colony-stimulating factor plus erythropoietin was associated with decreased levels of apoptosis within CD34+ marrow cells and may contribute to the enhanced hematopoiesis in vivo that was shown. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that altered balance between cell-death (eg, c-Myc) and cell-survival (eg, Bcl-2) programs were associated with the increased degrees of apoptosis present in MDS hematopoietic precursors and may contribute to the ineffective hematopoiesis in this disorder, in contrast to decreased apoptosis and enhanced leukemic cell survival in AML.","['Rajapaksa, R', 'Ginzton, N', 'Rott, L S', 'Greenberg, P L']","['Rajapaksa R', 'Ginzton N', 'Rott LS', 'Greenberg PL']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University Medical Center, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Genes, myc', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61173-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Dec 1;88(11):4275-87.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that soluble CD23 (sCD23), a protein derived from the B-cell membrane CD23 Ag, is selectively elevated in the serum of CLL patients. This prospective study assessed the predictive value of serum sCD23 level measured at study entry on the overall survival of all CLL patients and on disease progression of stage Binet A patients. Prognostic value of repeated measurements of sCD23 over time in stage A patients was also analyzed. One hundred fifty-three CLL patients were prospectively followed with a median follow-up of 78 months. Eight clinical or biological parameters were collected from the date of the first sCD23 measurement. At study entry, by Cox model, Binet staging (P = .0001) and serum sCD23 level (P = .03) appeared as prognostic factors for survival. Patients with sCD23 level above median value (> 574 U/mL) had a significantly worse prognosis than those with lower values (median survival of 53 v 100+ months, P = .0001). During follow-up, sCD23 doubling time increased by 3.2 the risk of death (P = .001). Among stage A patients (n = 100), sCD23 determination at study entry was the sole variable predictive of disease progression, patients with sCD23 level above 574 U/mL had a median time progression of 42 months versus 88 months for those with lower levels (P = .0001). Stage A patients who doubled their sCD23 level exhibited a 15-fold increased risk of progression (P = .0001) and, in addition, the sCD23 increase preceded by 48 months disease progression. We conclude that in CLL patients, serum sCD23 level provides significant additional prognostic information in terms of overall survival. Most interestingly, among early stage patients, sCD23 determination at diagnosis and during the course of the disease may help to the early identification of patients who will rapidly progress to upper stages.","['Sarfati, M', 'Chevret, S', 'Chastang, C', 'Biron, G', 'Stryckmans, P', 'Delespesse, G', 'Binet, J L', 'Merle-Beral, H', 'Bron, D']","['Sarfati M', 'Chevret S', 'Chastang C', 'Biron G', 'Stryckmans P', 'Delespesse G', 'Binet JL', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Bron D']","['Hopital Notre-Dame, University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/etiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*mortality/pathology', 'Life Tables', 'Lymphoid Tissue/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, IgE/*analysis', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61171-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Dec 1;88(11):4259-64.,,,,,,['Blood. 1997 Jun 1;89(11):4241-2.

To further characterize mechanisms by which cell-surface signaling might regulate CD10/NEP expression, we determined whether CD10/NEP was phosphorylated and whether the enzyme co-associated with additional cellular phosphoproteins. The CD10/NEP cytoplasmic tall contains two consensus recognition sequences for casein kinase II (CKII), a serine and threonine kinase that increases in activity following peptide signaling. In standard in vitro kinase assays, CKII phosphorylated full-length recombinant CD10/NEP but did not phosphorylate a truncated CD10/NEP protein that lacked the transmembrane region and cytoplasmic tail. To determine whether CD10/NEP might interact with additional cellular phosphoproteins, in vitro kinase assays were performed on CD10/NEP immune complexes from Nalm-6 cells. Three additional tyrosine phosphoproteins of approximately 40 kD, approximately 58 kD, and approximately 75 kD were identified in the CD10/NEP immunoprecipitates. The approximately 56-kD CD10/NEP-associated phosphoprotein was immunoprecipitated with an anti-lyn antibody confirming its identity as the lyn src-related kinase.

We cloned the chromosomal breakpoint of der (14) from an LPL case (1052) and showed that it involved a junction between 9p13 and the switch micro region of the Ig heavy chain locus (IgH) on 14q32. Using a YAC contig spanning 1.5 megabase (Mb), we determined that the 9p13 breakpoint in one case (1052) mapped within a 270-kb restriction fragment containing two previously reported 9p breakpoints associated with a alpha-heavy chain disease case (MAL) and KI-1 positive diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL) cell line (KIS-1). The same fragment also contained the PAX-5 gene which encodes a B-cell specific transcription factor involved in the control of B-cell proliferation and differentiation. The breakpoints of KIS-1 and 1052 were mapped within the 5' noncoding region of PAX-5, while the 9p13 breakpoint of MAL mapped 230 to 270 kb upstream to PAX-5. In all three cases, the translocation caused the juxtaposition of the PAX-5 gene to the IgH locus in the opposite direction of transcription. When compared with six other DLCL cell lines lacking t(9;14)(p13;q32), the KIS-1 cell line showed an 11-fold overexpression of PAX-5 mRNA and a significantly reduced expression of the p53 gene, which is normally regulated by PAX-5. Moreover, metaphase and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using a YAC clone spanning 1 Mb including the PAX-5 as a probe identified chromosomal translocations in 5 of 7 cases carrying 9p13 translocations. These findings suggest that the PAX-5 gene is the target of the t(9;14) in LPL whereby its expression may be deregulated by juxtaposition to IgH regulatory elements, thus contributing to lymphomagenesis.","['Iida, S', 'Rao, P H', 'Nallasivam, P', 'Hibshoosh, H', 'Butler, M', 'Louie, D C', 'Dyomin, V', 'Ohno, H', 'Chaganti, R S', 'Dalla-Favera, R']","['Iida S', 'Rao PH', 'Nallasivam P', 'Hibshoosh H', 'Butler M', 'Louie DC', 'Dyomin V', 'Ohno H', 'Chaganti RS', 'Dalla-Favera R']","['Department of Pathology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)61153-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1996 Dec 1;88(11):4110-7.,['GENBANK/U62539'],"['CA-34775/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-44029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 187 cases of CLLs and NHLs and 977 population controls were interviewed on medical, residential, family, and occupational history. Detailed information was collected about cultivated crops and animals bred from subjects who worked in farming and animal breeding. Information on crop diseases and pesticides used (and their quantity and duration) was also obtained. A priori job-exposure matrices were applied when a crop disease was reported, estimating the most probable pesticide and, when possible, an estimate of the cumulative dose. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by unconditional logistic analysis with adjustment for relevant confounders in farmers who bred animals and in farmers alone, for the main crops, types of animals, and pesticides categories. First recall and then the matrices were used for defining exposure, as it affected CLLs and NHLs and then separately on CLLs and low grade NHLs. Finally, the dose-response was investigated for those pesticides which had shown some association. RESULTS: No variable under study was associated with work in farming alone. In farming and animal breeding, no crop or animal showed an association with CLLs and NHLs when adjusted by exposure during childhood to farming and animal breeding (an indicator of life in a farming and animal breeding environment before the age of 13, which behaved as an independent risk variable). A non-significant association was found with stannates, arsenates, phosphates, and dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) based on recall, and for stannates, arsenates, and DDT after the application of the matrices. When CLLs together with low grade NHLs were considered, the association with insecticides in general, carbamates, and phosphates became significant according to personal recall (ORs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) 2.46, 1.07-5.63; 3.08, 1.05-9.00; 2.97, 1.28-6.91, respectively). The application of the matrices also showed a risk of borderline significance for stannates and dithiocarbamates. A significant dose-response effect was found for phosphates (for logarithmic unit increase, OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.00-1.57); a strong trend for stannates and carbamates did not reach significance. CONCLUSION: The association of CLLs and NHLs with work in farming-animal breeding is partially explained by exposure to pesticides-namely insecticides (carbamates, phosphates, and DDT) and stannates-possibly related to their use in animal breeding. The association is limited to cases of CLL and low grade NHL. The independent effect of the variable exposure during childhood suggests that early exposures, including possible contact with animals, may play a part in the pathogenic process of these neoplasms.","['Nanni, O', 'Amadori, D', 'Lugaresi, C', 'Falcini, F', 'Scarpi, E', 'Saragoni, A', 'Buiatti, E']","['Nanni O', 'Amadori D', 'Lugaresi C', 'Falcini F', 'Scarpi E', 'Saragoni A', 'Buiatti E']","['Istituto Oncologico Romagnolo (Oncological Institute of Romagna), Forli, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,['0 (Pesticides)'],IM,"['*Animal Husbandry', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pesticides/*adverse effects']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.53.10.652 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 1996 Oct;53(10):652-7. doi: 10.1136/oem.53.10.652.,,,PMC1128570,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serum samples were analysed for hepatitis C, hepatitis B, AST, ferritin, and non-transferrin bound iron. A bleomycin based assay was used to detect non-transferrin bound iron. Patient and blood bank records were examined to determine the number of units of transfused blood received by each patient. RESULTS: Ten patients had consistently raised serum AST activities. Of these, two had evidence of hepatitis C infection, one had chronic hepatitis B infection and one had chronic graft versus host disease affecting the liver. None of these four patients had detectable non-transferrin bound iron. The remaining six patients had no obvious reason for raised AST activities, but four had non-transferrin bound iron detectable in their serum as compared with only two out of 28 patients with normal AST activities. Patients with abnormal AST activities had higher serum ferritin concentrations than those with normal AST, though serum ferritin was raised in 21 of 28 patients without liver dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Non-transferrin bound iron may be found in this group of patients, suggesting that iron overload is the cause of the observed liver dysfunction.

Between July 1988 and June 1992, 219 newly diagnosed cases were identified, of whom 173 participated in the study. Two sex- and age-matched control groups were recruited: local controls from the same communities as the newly diagnosed cases of leukaemia and state controls from other randomly selected communities in Lower Saxony. An additional study group consisted of 175 cases of solid tumours. When the leukaemia cases were compared with the local controls, positive associations with parental occupational exposure, particularly agriculture-related exposure, were observed, which were statistically non-significant. A significant association was found for pesticide use in gardens (odds ratio = 2.52, 95% confidence interval: 1.0-6.1). No positive associations were seen when the leukaemia cases were compared to the state controls, but this finding could be explained by a higher proportion of state controls living in rural areas. In communities with a significantly elevated standardised incidence ratio of childhood leukaemia over the last decade (1984-1993), the prevalence of pesticide use in the garden was 21%, compared with the 10% in other communities. None of the examined risk factors were more common among cases of solid tumours. Our findings add some evidence to the hypothesis that pesticides are a risk factor for childhood leukaemia, and there are good reasons to consider abundant pesticide use in rural areas as a possible cause for clustering of childhood leukaemia.","['Meinert, R', 'Kaatsch, P', 'Kaletsch, U', 'Krummenauer, F', 'Miesner, A', 'Michaelis, J']","['Meinert R', 'Kaatsch P', 'Kaletsch U', 'Krummenauer F', 'Miesner A', 'Michaelis J']","['Institute of Medical Statistics and Documentation, Johannes Gutenberg-Universitat, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,['0 (Pesticides)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Agriculture', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/embryology', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/embryology', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Paternal Exposure', 'Pesticides/*adverse effects', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Urban Health']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0959-8049(96)00231-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0959-8049(96)00231-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1996 Oct;32A(11):1943-8. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(96)00231-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to a complete refractoriness of most subsets of lymphocytes to mitogen stimulation, the development of phenotypic abnormalities occurs such as the appearance of an abnormal CD4+ T cell subset lacking membranes Thy-1. This study was performed to compare the calcium responses during the early stages of MAIDS (week 9 or earlier) between T cells and B cells and between CD4+Thy-1- and CD4+Thy-1+ T cells. B cells were strikingly less affected than T cells: their baseline [Ca2+]i did not significantly increase, and their calcium response to anti-IgM antibody and concanavalin A (Con A) was partially maintained. In contrast, the response to Con A was completely abolished in T cells. Interestingly, calcium mobilization in response to membrane receptor-independent stimuli such as ionophores and thapsigargin was strongly inhibited in T cells, while no such inhibition was found in B cells. In comparison with their CD4+Thy-1+ counterparts, CD4+Thy-1- T cells had blunted calcium responses in controls, as well as in infected mice. However, CD4+Thy-1+ T cells were also strikingly altered, suggesting that the loss of membrane Thy-1 could be associated with, but not directly responsible for abnormalities of calcium responses in CD4+ T cells from RadLV-Rs-infected mice.","['Moutschen, M', 'Trebak, M', 'Greimers, R', 'Colombi, S', 'Boniver, J']","['Moutschen M', 'Trebak M', 'Greimers R', 'Colombi S', 'Boniver J']","['Department of Pathology, University of Liege, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (Thy-1 Antigens)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/*immunology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/*immunology', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Thy-1 Antigens/analysis']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/intimm/8.11.1715 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Immunol. 1996 Nov;8(11):1715-27. doi: 10.1093/intimm/8.11.1715.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the use of different Jurkat cell mutants it was demonstrated that CD2-mediated activation of EMT required expression of LCK, but not require surface expression of the CD3 zeta chain. Receptor-mediated activation of LCK does not in itself lead to activation of this Tec kinase since induction of LCK by ligation of CD4 or CD5 did not result in activation of EMT.

Control rats received rabbit sera and were sacrificed at 30 minutes, and 6 and 24 hours. LIF mRNA relative to GAPDH mRNA was detected at low levels within the glomeruli of occasional control rats. However with the induction of anti-GBM Ab GN, there was a marked increase in LIF steady-state mRNA beginning at three hours which persisted through 24 hour. LIF mRNA was also detected in cultured mesangial cells stimulated with IL-1 beta, identifying this cell type as a potential glomerular source for this cytokine.

This secretion correlates with increased phosphorylation of myosin light chain by protein kinase C (PKC). Calcium ionophores (A23187) also elicit secretion, which is enhanced by PMA. To analyze the roles of Ca2+ and PKC in the secretory process, A23187-induced myosin light chain phosphorylation was examined in the presence and absence of PMA. A23187-induced secretion correlated best with myosin light chain phosphorylation by PKC, not with phosphorylation by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). A23187 induced the translocation to membranes of the alpha, beta, delta, and epsilon isozymes of PKC. PMA not only increased the phosphorylation of myosin light chains at PKC-specific sites (Ser1 and Ser2) but also at sites attributed to MLCK (Ser19 and Thr18-Ser19). A23187 plus PMA induced higher levels of secretion concomitantly with increased myosin light chain phosphorylation at the PKC-specific sites. However, there was little correlation between the translocation of specific PKC isozymes and the phosphorylation of myosin light chains by PKC. Activation induced a novel triphosphorylated form of myosin light chain with a higher level of phosphorylation at the diphosphorylated MLCK sites. Quantitation of A23187 plus PMA-induced myosin light chain phosphorylation revealed that phosphorylation at PKC sites increased from zero to 0.35 mol/mol, was little changed at the monophosphorylated MLCK site (0.30 mol/mol), and increased from zero to 0.06 mol/mol at the diphosphorylated MLCK sites. Therefore, Ca2+-induced secretion correlates best with myosin light chain phosphorylation by PKC, and diphosphorylation by MLCK is unlikely to contribute to secretion.","['Ludowyke, R I', 'Scurr, L L', 'McNally, C M']","['Ludowyke RI', 'Scurr LL', 'McNally CM']","[""Centre for Immunology, St. Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Myosin Light Chains)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.18 (Myosin-Light-Chain Kinase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Calcimycin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Interactions', 'Histamine Release/*drug effects/physiology', 'Ionophores/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Myosin Light Chains/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Myosin-Light-Chain Kinase/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/administration & dosage/pharmacology']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Dec 1;157(11):5130-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both cytokine-secreting subsets lysed allogeneic tumor targets in vitro (""Tc1"" and ""Tc2"" subsets).

On day 15, histologic examination showed that Tc1 recipients had undetectable tumor burdens, whereas Tc2 recipients had extensive leukemic infiltrates. However, Tc2 recipients had essentially no histologic evidence of GVHD, whereas Tc1 recipients had mild to moderate GVHD (average GVHD scores of 1/40 and 9.3/40, respectively). In contrast, recipients of uncultured CD8+ donor T cells developed severe GVHD (average GVHD score of 26.7/40).

We find that constitutive expression of c-ets2 in the M1D+ myeloblast leukemic cell line (M1ets2) is sufficient to push these cells to a more differentiated state. The expression of several differentiation-specific genes is upregulated in M1ets2 cells, including those encoding macrophage-specific lysozyme M and tumor necrosis factor alpha, which are involved in bacteriolytic and inflammatory processes, respectively. Transcription factors c-jun and junB, previously shown to induce partial macrophage differentiation when overexpressed in myelomonocytic leukemia cell lines, are also upregulated in M1ets2 cells. The upregulation of junB is the result of a direct interaction of Ets2 with ets binding sites of the junB promoter, since transient or constitutive Ets2 expression in M1D+ cells activates junB transcription via ets binding sites. In addition, transfection of a dominant negative mutant of Ets2, devoid of its transcriptional activation domain, greatly reduces transcriptional activities of the junB promoter in M1ets2 cells. Finally, unlike their parental M1D+ counterparts, M1ets2 cells secrete the macrophage colony-stimulating factor, CSF-1, and are able to phagocytize.

D., Fincham, D. A., and Harvey, C. M. (1991) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1070, 111-118). We have reexamined this phenomenon separating the contribution of the two cationic amino acid transporters present in these cells (system y+ and system y+L). NaCl replacement with sucrose increased influx through system y+L, but decreased influx through system y+. We conclude that 1) the inhibition of system y+ is a response to the membrane depolarization that results from chloride removal, and 2) the stimulation of system y+L is due to the enhancement of the negative surface potential. Consistently, lysine influx through system y+L (in sucrose medium) was reduced by Na+, K+, Li+, and choline (K0.5 = 25-34 mM), the effect reaching a maximum at 35-40% of the original flux. Divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) were also inhibitory, but lower concentrations were required (K0.5 1.1-1.8 mM). The finding that sucrose stimulates uptake through changes in the surface potential explains similar effects observed in other cells with various cationic substrates.","['Deves, R', 'Angelo, S']","['Deves R', 'Angelo S']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile. rdeves@bitmed.med.uchile.cl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)', '451W47IQ8X (Sodium Chloride)', '57-50-1 (Sucrose)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'O3C74ACM9V (Ethylmaleimide)']",IM,"['Arginine/blood', 'Carrier Proteins/*blood', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Ethylmaleimide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lysine/*blood', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Membrane Proteins/*blood', 'Osmolar Concentration', '*Receptors, Virus', 'Sodium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Sucrose/pharmacology']",1996/12/13 00:00,1996/12/13 00:01,['1996/12/13 00:00'],"['1996/12/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/13 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.50.32034 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)78876-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Dec 13;271(50):32034-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.50.32034.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, this compound has been used as a selective tool for studies aimed at elucidating the role of iPLA2 in certain cellular functions. Herein we report that BEL also inhibits cellular phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (PAP) activity in intact P388D1 macrophages with an IC50 of about 8 microM, which is very similar to that previously found for inhibition of iPLA2 under the same experimental conditions. This results in the blockage of the incorporation of exogenous arachidonate and palmitate into diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol. Thus, inhibition of PAP by BEL blocks triacylglycerol biosynthesis in P388D1 cells due to decreased diacylglycerol availability. Because two forms of PAP activity exist in mammalian cells, differential assays were performed to identify which of these forms was inhibited by BEL. The results of these experiments revealed that BEL selectively inhibits the cytosolic, Mg2+-dependent enzyme. No apparent effect of BEL on the membrane-bound Mg2+-independent PAP form could be detected. Collectively, the results reported herein establish that BEL inhibits two cellular phospholipases, namely iPLA2 and Mg2+-dependent PAP, with similar potency. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of BEL on Mg2+-dependent PAP might explain several cellular functions previously attributed to iPLA2.","['Balsinde, J', 'Dennis, E A']","['Balsinde J', 'Dennis EA']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Revelle College and School of Medicine, University of California, La Jolla, California 92093-0601, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrones)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '2V16EO95H1 (Palmitic Acid)', '88070-98-8 (6-(bromomethylene)tetrahydro-3-(1-naphthaleneyl)-2H-pyran-2-one)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.1.3.4 (Phosphatidate Phosphatase)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Magnesium/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Naphthalenes/*pharmacology', 'Palmitic Acid/metabolism', 'Phosphatidate Phosphatase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Phospholipases A/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Pyrones/*pharmacology', 'Triglycerides/*biosynthesis']",1996/12/13 00:00,1996/12/13 00:01,['1996/12/13 00:00'],"['1996/12/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/13 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.50.31937 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)78862-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Dec 13;271(50):31937-41. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.50.31937.,,"['GM 20,501/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HD 26,171/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of toxicity may not always, however, involve profound damage of cellular constituents, but may involve a cytostatic effect through interference with the cell cycle. In this context, we have examined the induction of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 (WAF1, CIP1, or sdi1), whose overexpression suppresses the growth of various tumor cells, in human tumor cells metabolizing 3,6-diaziridinyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DZQ) and its C2,C5-substituted derivatives: 2,5-bis-(carboethoxyamino) (AZQ) and 2, 5-bis-2(-hydroxyethylamino) (BZQ). Both DZQ and AZQ were effectively activated by HCT116 human colonic carcinoma cells; the activation of the former involved largely a dicoumarol-sensitive activity, whereas that of the latter appeared to be accomplished primarily by one-electron transfer reductases. BZQ was not a substrate for the dicoumarol-sensitive enzyme in HCT116 cells. Cellular activation of the first two quinones was associated with formation of oxygen-centered radicals as detected by EPR in conjunction with the spin trap 5,5'-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide. The redox transitions of DZQ involved hydroxyl radical formation and were strongly inhibited by catalase, whereas those of AZQ showed a strong superoxide anion component sensitive to superoxide dismutase. These signals were suppressed by N-acetylcysteine with concomitant production of a thiyl radical adduct. This suggests an effective electron transfer between the thiol and free radicals formed during the activation of these quinones. DZQ and AZQ induced significantly the expression of p21 in HCT116 cells, but a 10-fold higher concentration of AZQ was required to achieve the level of induction elicited by DZQ. BZQ had little effect on p21 expression. p21 induction at both mRNA and protein levels correlated with the inhibition of either cyclin-dependent kinase activity or cell proliferation. p21 induction elicited by the above quinones was inhibited by N-acetylcysteine, whereas the non-sulfur analog, N-acetylalanine, was without effect. Catalase and superoxide dismutase did not effect p21 induction by aziridinylbenzoquinones in HCT116 cells, thus suggesting that extracellular sources of oxygen radicals generated by plasma membrane reductases have no influence in the expression of this gene. Hydrogen peroxide, a product of quinone redox cycling, elicited an increase of p21 mRNA levels in HCT116 and K562 human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. The latter lacks p53, one of the activators of p21 transcription, thus suggesting that p21 expression can be accomplished in a p53-independent manner in these cells. This study suggests that p21 induction is mediated by an increase in the cellular steady-state concentration of oxygen radicals and that the greater effectiveness in p21 induction by DZQ may be related to its efficient metabolism by NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase activity in HCT116 cells.","['Qiu, X', 'Forman, H J', 'Schonthal, A H', 'Cadenas, E']","['Qiu X', 'Forman HJ', 'Schonthal AH', 'Cadenas E']","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Aziridines)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '26C4VY6Z0M (N-acetylalanine)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', '7QID3E7BG7 (Dicumarol)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Alanine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Aziridines/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Benzoquinones/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*metabolism', 'Dicumarol/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Free Radicals/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'NADP/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/12/13 00:00,1996/12/13 00:01,['1996/12/13 00:00'],"['1996/12/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/13 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.50.31915 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)78859-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Dec 13;271(50):31915-21. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.50.31915.,,['1RO1 ES05423/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene transfer of the AGT gene, methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), results in only modest BCNU resistance. Recently, an AGT inhibitor, O6-benzylguanine (BG), entered clinical trials. In preclinical studies, BG potentiated the cytotoxic effect of BCNU in tumors but increased toxicity to normal CD34 cells. We transferred a mutant MGMT containing a glycine-to-alanine mutation at position 156, resulting in marked resistance to BG, into Chinese hamster cells; the K562 cell line and human CD34 cells used the retroviral backbone MFG. In each instance, cells expressed increased AGT and were much more resistant to the combination of BG and BCNU than the parental cells or cells transduced with wild-type MGMT. Furthermore, the transduction efficiency in human CD34 cells was in excess of 70%, and the proportion of CD34 transduced cells resistant to the combination was > 30%. Thus, retroviral-mediated transduction of a mutant MGMT into CD34 cells appears to be an effective way to induce selective resistance to a drug combination designed to overcome a significant resistance mechanism to nitrosoureas in tumors.","['Reese, J S', 'Koc, O N', 'Lee, K M', 'Liu, L', 'Allay, J A', 'Phillips, W P Jr', 'Gerson, S L']","['Reese JS', 'Koc ON', 'Lee KM', 'Liu L', 'Allay JA', 'Phillips WP Jr', 'Gerson SL']","['Department of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '01KC87F8FE (O(6)-benzylguanine)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'CHO Cells', 'Carmustine/*toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Primers', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Methyltransferases/*biosynthesis', 'Mutagenesis', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Transfection/methods']",1996/11/26 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/11/26 00:00'],"['1996/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.24.14088 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Nov 26;93(24):14088-93. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.24.14088.,,"['R01ES06288/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA063193/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA043703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UO1CA75525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA63193/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC19499,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In t(8;21) acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), the AML1 gene is juxtaposed to the ETO gene located on chromosome 8, generating an AML1/ETO fusion protein. Both AML1/ETO and the AML1 proteins recognize the same consensus DNA-binding motif (TGT/CGGT), which is found in the promoters of several genes involved in hematopoiesis. We found that two myeloid leukemia cell lines with the t(8;21) translocation, Kasumi and SKNO-1, have elevated levels of BCL-2 protein compared with other myeloid cell lines. In addition, we identified a consensus AML1 binding site in the BCL-2 promoter. Thus far, AML1/ETO has been shown to dominantly repress its target genes; however, we found that AML1/ETO activates transcription of the BCL-2 gene in U937 cells. This activation requires the presence of both the runt homology domain (rhd) and the C-terminal portion of AML1/ETO. We demonstrated sequence specific binding of both AML1A and AML1/ETO to the TGTGGT sequence in the BCL-2 promoter and showed that the AML1 binding site is required for responsiveness to AML1/ETO. Interestingly, AML1A and AML1B do not modulate the activity of the BCL-2 promoter. The elevated levels of BCL-2 in cells that express AML1/ETO may prolong their life span and contribute to the development of t(8;21) leukemia.","['Klampfer, L', 'Zhang, J', 'Zelenetz, A O', 'Uchida, H', 'Nimer, S D']","['Klampfer L', 'Zhang J', 'Zelenetz AO', 'Uchida H', 'Nimer SD']","['Laboratory of Molecular Aspects of Hematopoiesis, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1996/11/26 00:00,1996/11/26 00:01,['1996/11/26 00:00'],"['1996/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.24.14059 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Nov 26;93(24):14059-64. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.24.14059.,,"['R01 CA58842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK43052/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC19494,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When coexpressed in COS-7 cells with the previously identified IL-12 beta receptor (IL-12R beta) protein, two classes of 125I-huIL-12 binding sites were measured with Kds of about 55 pM and 8 nM, corresponding to the high- and low-affinity binding sites seen on phytohemagglutinin-activated lymphoblasts. This newly identified huIL-12R subunit is a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily, with closest resemblance to the beta-type cytokine receptor gp130 and the receptors for leukemia inhibitory factor and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Consequently, we have reclassified the previously identified IL-12R beta subunit as huIL-12R beta 1 and designated the newly identified subunit as huIL-12R beta 2. huIL-12R beta 2 is an 862-amino acid type I transmembrane protein with a 595-amino-acid-long extracellular domain and a cytoplasmic tail of 216 amino acids that contains three tyrosine residues. A cDNA encoding the mouse homolog of the huIL12R beta 2 protein has also been isolated. Human and mouse IL-12R beta 2 proteins show a 68% amino acid sequence identity. When expressed in COS-7 cells, huIL-12R beta 2 exists as a disulfide-linked oligomer with an apparent monomeric molecular weight of 130 kDa. Coexpression of the two identified IL-12R subunits in Ba/F3 cells conferred IL-12 responsiveness, and clones of these cotransfected Ba/F3 cells that grew continuously in the presence of IL-12 were isolated and designated LJM-1 cells. LJM-1 cells exhibited dose-dependent proliferation in response to huIL-12, with an ED50 of about 1 pM huIL-12. Interestingly, Ba/F3 cells transfected with IL-12R beta 2 alone proliferated in response to huIL-12 with an ED50 of about 50 pM, although a role for endogenous mouse IL-12R beta 1 in IL-12 signal transduction in these transfectants cannot be ruled out.

This implies that the rates of transcription and of silencing are separate properties determined by interaction of the regulatory elements of the transgene with the site of integration. Induction of the mMT-I promoter with zinc both increases expression level and strongly retards silencing of beta-geo expression. At a given integration site, expression level and silencing are affected coordinately by induction. Taken together with earlier studies of distant metal-responsive elements, these results suggest that distance from the promoter may determine whether a factor can increase transcription rate. Stimulation of an MRE can both increase transcription and overcome repressive effects of chromatin; we suggest that these functions are linked.","['Magis, W', 'Fiering, S', 'Groudine, M', 'Martin, D I']","['Magis W', 'Fiering S', 'Groudine M', 'Martin DI']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9038-94-2 (Metallothionein)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Metallothionein/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc/pharmacology', 'beta-Galactosidase/biosynthesis']",1996/11/26 00:00,1996/11/26 00:01,['1996/11/26 00:00'],"['1996/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.93.24.13914 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Nov 26;93(24):13914-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.24.13914.,,"['R37 DK044746/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '1F32HL08732/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5RO1DK44746/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '5RO1HL48356/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC19467,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence and progression of features in a large cohort of patients. METHODS: Clinical records of 25 patients with Shwachman syndrome were reviewed. RESULTS: Mean birth weight (2.92 +/- 0.51 kg) was at the 25th percentile. However, by 6 months of age, mean heights and weights were less than the 5th percentile. After 6 months of age, growth velocity was normal. Severe fat maldigestion due to pancreatic insufficiency was present in early life (fecal fat, 26% +/- 17% of fat intake; age, < 2 years). Serial assessment of exocrine pancreatic function showed persistent deficits of enzyme secretion, but 45% of patients showed moderate age-related improvements leading to pancreatic sufficiency. Neutropenia was the most common hematologic abnormality (88%), but leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia were also frequently encountered. Patients with hypoplasia of all three bone marrow cellular lines (n = 11) had the worst prognosis; 5 patients died, 2 of sepsis and 3 of acute myelogenous leukemia. Other findings included hepatomegaly and/or abnormal liver function test results and skeletal abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: A wide and varied spectrum of phenotypic abnormalities among patients with Shwachman syndrome is described. Pancreatic acinar dysfunction is an invariable abnormality. Patients with severe bone marrow involvement may have a guarded prognosis.","['Mack, D R', 'Forstner, G G', 'Wilschanski, M', 'Freedman, M H', 'Durie, P R']","['Mack DR', 'Forstner GG', 'Wilschanski M', 'Freedman MH', 'Durie PR']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,0374630,,IM,"['Abnormalities, Multiple/*physiopathology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Pancreatic Diseases/*physiopathology', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Syndrome']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0016-5085(96)70022-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0016-5085(96)70022-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Gastroenterology. 1996 Dec;111(6):1593-602. doi: 10.1016/s0016-5085(96)70022-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Poisson regression analysis of incidence rates in relation to the variables of interest. SETTING: The 403 county districts of England and Wales during 1979-85. SUBJECTS: Children aged under 15 years. RESULTS: There were significant trends in the incidence of lymphoblastic leukaemia at ages 0-4 and 5-9 years with the proportion of children in a district who had recently entered the district. While there was no consistent relation between the proportion of recent incomers in the total population of a district and its incidence rate, the combination of higher migration with greater diversity of origins or distance moved was associated with higher incidence in both age groups. Incidence increased significantly at age 0-4 with the level of employment in a district and at age 5-9 with the proportion of households with access to a car. No significant trends were found with commuting. CONCLUSIONS: The results for level of child migration and diversity of total migration provide evidence of an effect of population mixing on the incidence of childhood leukaemia which is not restricted to areas experiencing the most extreme levels of mixing.","['Stiller, C A', 'Boyle, P J']","['Stiller CA', 'Boyle PJ']","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, University of Oxford.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Demography', 'England/epidemiology', '*Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Poisson Distribution', '*Population Dynamics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', '*Socioeconomic Factors', 'Transients and Migrants/*statistics & numerical data', 'Travel', 'Wales/epidemiology']",1996/11/23 00:00,1996/11/23 00:01,['1996/11/23 00:00'],"['1996/11/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/23 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.313.7068.1297 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 1996 Nov 23;313(7068):1297-300. doi: 10.1136/bmj.313.7068.1297.,,,PMC2352738,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cases of cancer had a histologic diagnosis and/or a compatible clinical course. There were 51 children with cancer, for a cumulative incidence of cancer of 1.1 per 1,000 by 96 months of age. Maternal smoking was determined at each prenatal visit; 52% of mothers reported smoking at one or more visits. By age 8 years, cancer had occurred in 1.4 per 1,000 children whose mothers did not smoke during pregnancy, compared with 0.9 per 1,000 children whose mothers smoked (p = 0.15 by log rank test); the hazard ratio was 0.67 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38-1.17). There was no dose-response effect of smoking compared with nonsmokers (hazard ratio for one to 10 cigarettes/day = 0.45, more than 10 cigarettes/day = 0.83). The hazard ratio for leukemia among children whose mothers smoked was 0.82 (95% CI 0.31-2.11); the hazard ratio for cancers other than leukemia was 0.60 (95% CI 0.30-1.20). Adjustment did not change the hazard ratio substantially. Although the relatively small number of cases precluded extensive study of individual types of cancer, the authors conclude that maternal smoking during pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of childhood cancer in this cohort.","['Klebanoff, M A', 'Clemens, J D', 'Read, J S']","['Klebanoff MA', 'Clemens JD', 'Read JS']","['National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-7510, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Life Tables', 'Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', '*Pregnancy Complications', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Smoking/*adverse effects']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a008874 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 1996 Dec 1;144(11):1028-33. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a008874.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Freshly isolated mlgM+ cells obtained from BLV-infected cows with persistent lymphocytosis (PL) expressed increased Ig-mu mRNA and decreased mRNA for Ig-lambda relative to infected and uninfected animals that had normal peripheral lymphocyte counts. In contrast, there was no correlation between BLV-infection status and expression of major histocompatibility complex (Mhc) Class I or Class II genes. The induction of BLV expression in mlgM+ cells from animals with PL did not affect significantly the levels of Mhc Class I, Class II, Ig-mu or Ig-lambda mRNA. Phorbol ester-induced c-fos mRNA expression was greater in the BLV-infected cell line BL3 degrees than the uninfected parental cell line BL3 degrees. However, the level of c-fos expression did not appear different compared with its induction in peripheral blood B cells from seronegative animals and animals with PL. We conclude that the BLV early and late phase proteins have no effect on Ig or Mhc mRNA levels, but that freshly isolated mlgM+ cells from PL animals constitutively express increased Ig-mu and decreased Ig-lambda mRNA. These data suggest that the increase in Ig-mu and mlgM on B cells from PL cows is related to a differentiation state rather than trans-activation by BLV.","['Teutsch, M R', 'Lewin, H A']","['Teutsch MR', 'Lewin HA']","['Department of Animal Sciences, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 61801, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/virology', 'Cattle', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Genes, MHC Class I/genetics', 'Genes, MHC Class II/genetics', 'Immunoglobulins/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2427(96)05558-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2427(96)05558-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1996 Sep;53(1-2):87-94. doi: 10.1016/0165-2427(96)05558-4.,,['R01CA59148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However apoptosis is inhibited by curcumin, a specific inhibitor of c-jun/AP-1. Whereas curcumin restores ability of inhibited cells to grow, it does not affect ceramide-induced differentiation.

The available evidence suggests that, following first line treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), current treatment regimens used in the UK are unlikely to cause sterilisation in either gender. For men who are treated for Hodgkin's disease with 6 or more courses of antineoplastic therapy, azoospermia is the rule. Childhood studies have clearly indicated that the prepubertal testis is not protected from antineoplastic therapy that is potentially sterilising. The interpretation of tests of ovarian function in women treated for cancer in childhood is difficult, but there is increasing evidence of ovarian dysfunction in children treated for Hodgkin's disease. Reassuringly there is no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage following antineoplastic therapy or an increased number of abnormalities in the offspring. The growth patterns and requirement for growth hormone replacement therapy in children treated for ALL are still unclear. There is good evidence that the intensity and duration of combination cytotoxic antineoplastic therapy received by children with ALL influences the pattern of growth, and that adjuvant antineoplastic therapy for children treated for a brain tumour is an important factor in final height achieved. A child who has been treated for cancer should not be discharged from follow-up. Late effects may have significant implications in later life, and an understanding of these effects is essential to enable balanced decisions to be made regarding the benefits and risks of currently available agents.","['Wallace, W H', 'Kelnar, C J']","['Wallace WH', 'Kelnar CJ']","['Department of Child Life and Health, University of Edinburgh, Scotland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drug Saf,Drug safety,9002928,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child Development/*drug effects', 'Endocrine Glands/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Growth/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Ovary/drug effects', 'Testis/drug effects', 'Thyroid Gland/drug effects']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00002018-199615050-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Saf. 1996 Nov;15(5):325-32. doi: 10.2165/00002018-199615050-00003.,,,,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, only 89.1% similarity was observed between the BTLV env sequence and that of simian T-cell leukemia virus (PtM3). The sequences corresponding to the glycosylation sites, endoproteolytic processing site, and major immunological determinants were strictly conserved between BTLV and HTLV-1. To characterize the expressed protein we used a vaccinia expression system, which indicated that a protein of 62 kDa is encoded by the envelope gene. The protein acquired mostly high mannose modifications and was localized predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum. A fraction of the protein was expressed at the cell surface, where it could induce membrane fusion of target cells. The existence of HTLV-1-like viruses in baboons indicates the potential risk of transmission of such virus from these nonhuman primates to humans, thus highlighting the need for specific screening for such viruses during xenotransplantation.","['Vincent, M J', 'Novembre, F J', 'Yamshchikov, V F', 'McClure, H M', 'Compans, R W']","['Vincent MJ', 'Novembre FJ', 'Yamshchikov VF', 'McClure HM', 'Compans RW']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/blood/immunology/*veterinary/virology', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, env', 'Giant Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monkey Diseases/*virology', 'Papio/virology', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(96)90627-3 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1996.0627 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1996 Dec 1;226(1):57-65. doi: 10.1006/viro.1996.0627.,"['GENBANK/L03561', 'GENBANK/M11373', 'GENBANK/M37747', 'GENBANK/M67514', 'GENBANK/U03160']","['CA 62934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR 00165/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To the authors' knowledge, the frequency of overt testicular involvement at diagnosis of ALL and its impact on treatment outcome have not been reported previously. METHODS: The medical records of all 651 boys with ALL enrolled on St. Jude Total Therapy Studies X-XIIIA (May 1979 to December 1993) were reviewed to determine the frequency of overt testicular involvement at diagnosis. The log rank test and sequential Cox regression analyses, adjusted for known adverse features, were used to compare event free and overall survival for patients with and without testicular leukemia. A matched-pairs analysis was then conducted for both outcome measures. RESULTS: Thirteen of the 651 male patients (1.9%) presented with overt testicular leukemia. Compared with the other patients, these 13 boys had a significantly higher frequency of infant or adolescent age at diagnosis, hyperleukocytosis, splenomegaly, and mediastinal mass; a poorer 5-year event free survival (38% [95% confidence interval (CI), 15.4-61.4%] vs. 58% [95% CI, 53.6-61.7%], P = 0.06, log rank test); and a significantly poorer 5-year overall survival (37% [95% CI, 14-60.4%] vs. 75% [95% CI, 71.3-78.4%], P = 0.002). The difference in overall, but not event free, survival was supported by sequential Cox regression analyses and by the matched-pairs analysis (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Overt testicular involvement with leukemia at diagnosis was associated with an adverse survival in boys with ALL. Testicular irradiation may not be necessary in those patients who present with overt testicular involvement. This finding merits prospective evaluation in a larger sample of similarly treated patients.","['Gajjar, A', 'Ribeiro, R C', 'Mahmoud, H H', 'Sandlund, J T', 'Liu, Q', 'Furman, W L', 'Santana, V M', 'Crist, W M', 'Rivera, G K', 'Pui, C H']","['Gajjar A', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Mahmoud HH', 'Sandlund JT', 'Liu Q', 'Furman WL', 'Santana VM', 'Crist WM', 'Rivera GK', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",1996/12/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19961201)78:11<2437::AID-CNCR23>3.0.CO;2-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1996 Dec 1;78(11):2437-42.,,"['P01 CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of Pgp on hematopoietic cells has been correlated with CD34 expression. For acute myeloid leukemia, the prognostic value of Pgp for clinical response is at best equivalent to that of CD34. The current study investigated whether expression of CD34 can be associated with selection for drug resistance. METHODS: Several established MDR cell lines were screened by flow cytometry for expression of CD34. Human ovarian carcinoma cells (A2780), which simultaneously expressed CD34 and Pgp, were identified. Subsequent cloning resulted in a new cell line (A2780-Dx5c) that expressed CD34 in the absence of Pgp. Involvement of non-Pgp-mediated MDR mechanisms was assessed by immunohistochemistry (MRP and LRP), enzyme activity studies (glutathione pathway), cross-resistance patterns, and Northern blot (type II alpha topoisomerase). RESULTS: A2780-Dx5c was cross-resistant to doxorubicin, daunorubicin, idarubicin, and VP-16. However, unlike the Pgp-expressing cells, it was not cross-resistant to vincristine or amsacrine. The drug resistance was correlated with a decreased level of type II alpha topoisomerase in the A2780-Dx5c cell line compared with the parental cell line. No evidence was found of involvement of MRP, LRP, or the glutathione pathway with drug resistance in this cell line. CONCLUSIONS: A new cell line of nonhematopoietic and nonvascular endothelial origin that expresses CD34 in association with selection for MDR was cloned. A study of MDR mechanisms in this cell line revealed that reduced type II alpha topoisomerase levels were likely responsible for the MDR observed. A study of the causal relation between the selection of drug resistance and the expression of CD34 may provide insight into why CD34 correlates with poor clinical response in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","['Minderman, H', 'Vanhoefer, U', 'Toth, K', 'Minderman, M D', 'Rustum, Y M']","['Minderman H', 'Vanhoefer U', 'Toth K', 'Minderman MD', 'Rustum YM']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/analysis', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*metabolism']",1996/12/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19961201)78:11<2427::AID-CNCR22>3.0.CO;2-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1996 Dec 1;78(11):2427-36.,,"['CA13038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A case series of eight patients.,2421-6,"BACKGROUND: Second primary malignancies have been described in patients with both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. However, an association between renal cell carcinoma and lymphoid malignancies has rarely been described. Eight patients with both disorders are described and possible explanations for the association are reviewed. METHODS: A retrospective review of records from patients with renal cell carcinoma, lymphoma, leukemia, or myeloma discharged from the University of California at Los Angeles between July 1, 1993 and June 30, 1995 was performed. Renal cell carcinoma was diagnosed in 186 patients, whereas 405 had a lymphoid malignancy. Eight patients with both disorders were identified. RESULTS: In four of the eight patients, the renal cell carcinoma was diagnosed prior to their hematologic malignancy, whereas in the remaining four patients, the lymphoid malignancy was diagnosed first. Renal cell carcinoma is observed in the general population in 12.5 persons per 100,000 and hematologic malignancies in 31.8 per 100,000. The number of cases of lymphoid malignancies expected in the 186 renal cell carcinoma patients is lower than the 4 cases actually observed (P < 0.01). Likewise, the number of renal tumors expected in the 405 patients with hematologic malignancies is fewer than the 4 cases observed (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of renal cell carcinoma and lymphoid malignancy occurring in the same patient is higher than that expected in the general population.

Mild dysplasia of third-line cells was observed. Chromosome analysis yielded 47, XY, +8, t (9;22) (q34;q11), and the Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome and trisomy 8 were detected. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization revealed a large ber. Because the French-American-British (FAB) cooperative group diagnostic criteria for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL) were fulfilled and the Ph1 chromosome was detected, a diagnosis of Ph1-positive CMMoL was made. Hydroxyurea was given for cytoreduction and the patient has been followed with no evidence of acute transformation for about one year. CMMoL is classified as a myelodysplastic syndrome. However, it is rare to find the Ph1 chromosome in patients with these syndromes, and there have been very few reports of its detection in CMMoL.

The present analysis characterizes retrospectively febrile episodes in neutropenic pediatric hematology-oncology patients with regard to frequency of documented infections, organisms associated with these infections, efficacy of a standardized antibiotic regimen, and safety of early antibiotic discontinuation under defined conditions. A total of 149 pediatric febrile neutropenic episodes were identified during a 4-year period between 1990 and 1994. These occurred in 47 male and 19 female patients, of a mean age of 7.6 years (range 0.5-15). The most frequent diagnoses were leukemia (41% of patients), lymphoma (21%), rhabdomyosarcoma (7%), soft tissue sarcoma (5%), Ewing's sarcoma (5%), and osteosarcoma (4%). Infection was certain in 36% of febrile episodes, probable in 14%, and not determined in 50%. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 100) had a slightly, although not significantly higher incidence of documented and probable infection (57%). Patients with solid tumor had documented infection in 40% of their febrile episodes, and the detection rate in the children with leukemia was 31% (P < .20) Blood cultures were positive in 21 (14%) of 149 episodes. Staphylococci (both coagulase-negative and coagulase-positive strains) and Pseudomonas were the organisms most frequently isolated (six episodes each). Mouth and throat (11), lungs (10), and skin (10) were the next most frequent sites of localized infection. Initial treatment consisted of piperacillin and amikacin or of vancomycin and amikacin when the source of fever was thought to be an infected central line catheter, with addition of amphotericin B by the seventh day of treatment when fever with neutropenia persisted or upon clinical suspicion of underlying fungal infection. There was a single fatality, of a patient with Burkitt's lymphoma. Antibiotics were discontinued when initial blood cultures had no growth after at least 48 hours and no source of infection was found, the blood count was improving, and if the patient became afebrile and clinically well. No patient needed readmission during the fortnight that followed discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy. Patients with negative blood cultures under defined conditions, as described above, could safely be discharged early, thus shortening the duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy and hospital stay.","['Roguin, A', 'Kasis, I', 'Ben-Arush, M W', 'Sharon, R', 'Berant, M']","['Roguin A', 'Kasis I', 'Ben-Arush MW', 'Sharon R', 'Berant M']","['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Unit, Rambam Medical Center, Technion Faculty of Medicine, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Bacterial Infections/complications/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fever/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Hematologic Diseases/complications/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/complications/*physiopathology', 'Neutropenia/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08880019609030865 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1996 Nov-Dec;13(6):503-10. doi: 10.3109/08880019609030865.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The [11C]methyl alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (MeAIB) is prospectively an ideal tracer for transport measurements with PET, as it is not metabolized and concentrates in cells only via System A transport. We examined the factors governing [14C]MeAIB accumulation by cultured human erythroleukemic (K562) cells. Experiments were performed in growth medium and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) +/- cycloheximide (an inhibitor of protein synthesis) on logarithmically growing cells, as well as cells that had reached a growth plateau. Both inward transport rate and net uptake of MeAIB were positively correlated with cell growth rate and showed a strong inverse relationship to amino acid supply. The observations are consistent with a body of evidence from animal tumor cells, and they suggest that the correlation between System A transport and tumor cell proliferation may be obscured in vivo by variations in amino acid supply. Thus, while [11C]MeAIB might be useful as a PET radiotracer of System A transport per se, this compound may be limited in its ability to provide measurements of tumor growth rate.","['Bading, J R', 'Kan-Mitchell, J', 'Conti, P S']","['Bading JR', 'Kan-Mitchell J', 'Conti PS']","['Department of Radiology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nucl Med Biol,Nuclear medicine and biology,9304420,"['0 (Amino Acid Transport Systems)', '0 (Aminoisobutyric Acids)', '0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '2566-34-9 (2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Transport Systems', '*Aminoisobutyric Acids/pharmacokinetics', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*diagnostic imaging/*metabolism', 'Tomography, Emission-Computed', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0969-8051(96)00073-X [pii]', '10.1016/0969-8051(96)00073-x [doi]']",ppublish,Nucl Med Biol. 1996 Aug;23(6):779-86. doi: 10.1016/0969-8051(96)00073-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several approaches for inducing idiotype-specific immunization have been reported, but their major theoretical focus was related to the induction of humoral immunity. We have investigated an immunization procedure with naked DNA encoding human variable region gene sequences of an immunoglobulin heavy chain (VH), which may generate both humoral and cellular immune responses against the idiotype of a B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, we investigated heavy chain variable region genes obtained from an ALL patient and whether they could induce humoral and cellular immune responses in DBA/2 mice. The VH sequence was cloned into a mammalian expression vector for intradermal DNA vaccination and into a bacterial expression vector to obtain VH protein for Western blotting. The mammalian expression vector encoding the VH gene was injected into mice three times at 7-day intervals and was transduced into P1HTR which is a syngeneic tumor of DBA/2, to serve as target cells to detect cellular immunity. Spleen cells from the inoculated mice exhibited a significant cytotoxic T lymphocyte response to the target cells. By Western blotting, we could also detect trace levels of anti-VH antibodies in all mice serum. This approach for the induction of cellular immunity by intradermal injection is easy and variable region-specific, and may be used as vaccines after chemotherapy treatment of B cell malignancies.","['Abe, A', 'Emi, N', 'Taji, H', 'Kasai, M', 'Kohno, A', 'Saito, H']","['Abe A', 'Emi N', 'Taji H', 'Kasai M', 'Kohno A', 'Saito H']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*immunology', 'Antibody Formation', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology', 'DNA', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Injections, Intradermal', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gene Ther. 1996 Nov;3(11):988-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A series of cFMS-transfected HL-60 sublines with progressively higher cell surface FMS expression was derived by flow cytometric cell sorting. Overexpression of FMS increased the duration of the cell cycle, prolonging all cell cycle phases especially S phase, which doubled. The increased cell cycle generation times occurred without any detectable changes in RB expression level or phosphorylation. For retinoic acid (RA)-induced myeloid differentiation, progressive overexpression of FMS caused a greater fraction of cells to differentiate and G1/0 arrest compared to wild-type cells after the same number of cell cycle generation times. FMS overexpression also progressively increased the relative amount of dephosphorylated RB protein induced, while reducing the total amount of RB protein. The inducer-originated and FMS-driven changes in RB hypophosphorylation were not effected through changes in p21/WAF1/CIP1 in this p53-negative cell. Similar effects on differentiation and G0 arrest occurred with 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 (D3)-induced monocytic differentiation. FMS did not significantly affect myeloid differentiation induced by DMSO, which does not target steroid-thyroid hormone receptors like RA and D3. While differentiation is typically associated with hypophosphorylated RB in all these cases, the kinetics indicate that the FMS-induced changes in cell cycle and cell differentiation do not depend in a direct causal fashion on the interconversion between hyperphosphorylated and hypophosphorylated RB.","['Yen, A', 'Sturgill, R', 'Varvayanis, S', 'Chern, R']","['Yen A', 'Sturgill R', 'Varvayanis S', 'Chern R']","['Department of Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/pharmacology', '*Cell Cycle/drug effects', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'G1 Phase', 'Gene Expression', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1996/11/25 00:00,1996/11/25 00:01,['1996/11/25 00:00'],"['1996/11/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/25 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(96)90349-3 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1996.0349 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1996 Nov 25;229(1):111-25. doi: 10.1006/excr.1996.0349.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results suggest that P210 and P190(BCR/ABL) directly activate specific STAT family members and may help explain their overlapping yet distinct roles in leukemogenesis.","['Ilaria, R L Jr', 'Van Etten, R A']","['Ilaria RL Jr', 'Van Etten RA']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT6 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT6 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Janus Kinase 3', '*Milk Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'STAT6 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",1996/12/06 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/12/06 00:00'],"['1996/12/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/12/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.49.31704 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)79046-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Dec 6;271(49):31704-10. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.49.31704.,,['K08HL03310-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cultured human adult T-cell leukemia cell line, ED40515-N, expressed the message of alpha1-->3 fucosyltransferase (Fuc-T) IV and VII, with a low level of the Fuc-T III and VI message, and manifested the sialyl Lewis X as well as Lewis X (Galbeta1-->4 [Fucalpha1-->3]GlcNAcbeta1-->R) determinant at the cell surface. Transfection of this cell line with the pRc/CMV vector containing an antisense human Fuc-T VII construct (pRc/CMV/5'FT7AS) resulted in a significant decrease of endogenous Fuc-T VII message and a marked reduction in the cell surface expression of sialyl Lewis X determinant as well as a reduction in the enzymatic activity of alpha1-->3 fucosyltransferase against sialylated type 2 chain substrate. This was accompanied by diminution of cell adhesive activity toward E-selectin on interleukin-1beta-treated endothelial cells. These results indicated that the synthesis of the sialyl Lewis X determinants that were functionally active as E-selectin ligands was mainly mediated by Fuc-T VII in these lymphoid cells. On the other hand, the message of Fuc-T IV showed no significant change in the transfectant clones, and the surface expression of the Lewis X antigen as well as the enzymatic activity of alpha1-->3 fucosyltransferase against non-sialylated type 2 chain substrate was well preserved. The clear contrast between the diminished expression of sialyl Lewis X and the conserved manifestation of Lewis X in the transfectant clones suggested that the synthesis of sialyl Lewis X and that of Lewis X are independently regulated by different fucosyltransferases in human lymphoid cells. Fuc-T VII must be involved in the synthesis of sialyl Lewis X, while the synthesis of Lewis X is mediated by an enzyme other than Fuc-T VII, most probably Fuc-T IV.","['Hiraiwa, N', 'Dohi, T', 'Kawakami-Kimura, N', 'Yumen, M', 'Ohmori, K', 'Maeda, M', 'Kannagi, R']","['Hiraiwa N', 'Dohi T', 'Kawakami-Kimura N', 'Yumen M', 'Ohmori K', 'Maeda M', 'Kannagi R']","['Program of Experimental Pathology, Research Institute, Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya 464, Japan. rkannagi@aichi-cc.pref.aichi.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Lewis Blood Group Antigens)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sialyl Lewis X Antigen)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Fucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.152 (galactoside 3-fucosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Blotting, Northern', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'E-Selectin/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fucosyltransferases/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', '*Lewis Blood Group Antigens', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/metabolism', 'Oligosaccharides/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Sialyl Lewis X Antigen', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/12/06 00:00,1996/12/06 00:01,['1996/12/06 00:00'],"['1996/12/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/06 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.49.31556 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)79025-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Dec 6;271(49):31556-61. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.49.31556.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the accompanying paper (Shi, W.-X., Chammas, R., and Varki, A. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 31517-31525), we report that the extent of 9-O-acetylation of cell surface sialic acids on murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells can be modified by various manipulations, including differentiation, nocodazole treatment, and 9-O-acetyl esterase treatment. We have used this system to explore the putative roles of 9-O-acetylation in modulating alternative pathway complement activation, I-type lectin binding, and tissue homing. MEL cells are shown to be sensitive to lysis in vitro by the alternative pathway of human complement. Induced differentiation of the MEL cells causes resistance to lysis, and this correlates directly with extent of decrease in 9-O-acetylation. A similar resistance to alternative pathway lysis can be obtained by selective enzymatic removal of 9-O-acetyl groups from sialic acids. Conversely, the increase in cell surface 9-O-acetylation caused by nocodazole treatment correlates with increased sensitivity to alternative pathway lysis. Thus, a 9-O-acetyl group added to the side chain of cell surface sialic acids may abrogate its normal function in restricting alternative pathway activation. Indeed, the binding of human complement factor H, a negative regulator of the alternative pathway, is shown to be blocked by O-acetylation of the sialic acids on MEL cells. MEL cells are also shown to have cell surface ligands for the I-type lectins sialoadhesin and CD22. Sialoadhesin (but not CD22) binding is selectively enhanced by differentiation-induced loss of cell surface 9-O-acetylation and by direct enzymatic removal of the ester groups. Thus, some sialoadhesin ligands are masked by 9-O-acetylation, presumably because the side chain is required for recognition. Since sialoadhesin is expressed on some macrophages in vivo, we reasoned that tissue homing of MEL cells might be affected by O-acetylation. Indeed, enzymatic removal of cell surface 9-O-acetyl groups alters the tissue distribution of intravenously injected cells. In particular, de-O-acetylation caused significant increase in homing to the liver and spleen. These data demonstrate that cell surface 9-O-acetylation can affect a variety of biological recognition phenomena and provide a system for further exploration of the specific molecular mechanisms involved.","['Shi, W X', 'Chammas, R', 'Varki, N M', 'Powell, L', 'Varki, A']","['Shi WX', 'Chammas R', 'Varki NM', 'Powell L', 'Varki A']","['Glycobiology Program, UCSD Cancer Center, the Division of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (SIGLEC1 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 1)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', '0 (Siglec1 protein, mouse)', '55717-54-9 (9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Complement Pathway, Alternative', 'Humans', 'Lectins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 1', 'Sialic Acids/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/12/06 00:00,1996/12/06 00:01,['1996/12/06 00:00'],"['1996/12/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/06 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.49.31526 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)79021-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Dec 6;271(49):31526-32. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.49.31526.,,"['P01-CA5869/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-GM32373/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are sometimes modified by an O-acetyl ester at the 9-position, potentially altering recognition of sialic acid by antibodies, lectins, and viruses. 9-O-Acetylation is known to be selectively expressed on gangliosides in melanoma cells and on N-linked chains in hepatocytes. Using a recently developed probe, we show here that in murine erythroleukemia cells, this modification is selectively expressed on another class of oligosaccharides, O-linked chains carried on cell surface sialomucins. These cells also express 9-O-acetylation on the ganglioside GD3, but this modification appears to be undetectable on the cell surface. Increasing cell density in culture is associated with a decrease in cell surface 9-O-acetylation of sialomucins. This change correlates with the spontaneous differentiation toward a mature erythroid phenotype. This down-regulation upon differentiation and entry into the G0/G1 stage of the cell cycle is confirmed by differentiation-inducing agents. In contrast, cells arrested in G2/M by the microtubule depolymerizing agent nocodazole show increased expression of cell surface 9-O-acetylated sialomucins (but not the 9-O-acetylated ganglioside). However, the microtubule stabilizer taxol does not induce this increase, showing that the nocodazole effect is independent of cell cycle stage. Indeed, direct analysis showed no correlation of 9-O-acetylation with cell cycle stage in rapidly growing cells, and shorter treatments with nocodazole also increased expression. Western blots of cell extracts confirmed that changes caused by differentiation and nocodazole are not due to redistribution of molecules from the cell surface. Indeed, following selective removal of 9-O-acetyl groups from the cell surface by a specific esterase, the recovery of expression is mediated by new synthesis rather than by redistribution from an internal pool. Thus, 9-O-acetylation on these sialomucins appears to be primarily regulated by the rate of synthesis, and the increase with nocodazole treatment is likely due to the inhibition of turnover of cell surface molecules. These data show that 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids in murine erythroleukemia cells is a highly regulated modification, being selectively expressed in a cell type-specific manner on certain classes of oligosaccharides and differentially regulated with regard to subcellular localization and to the state of cellular differentiation.","['Shi, W X', 'Chammas, R', 'Varki, A']","['Shi WX', 'Chammas R', 'Varki A']","['Glycobiology Program, UCSD Cancer Center, the Division of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Mucins)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', '0 (Sialomucins)', '55717-54-9 (9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'GZP2782OP0 (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gangliosides/chemistry', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mucins/chemistry', 'N-Acetylneuraminic Acid/*metabolism', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Sialic Acids/*metabolism', 'Sialomucins', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/12/06 00:00,1996/12/06 00:01,['1996/12/06 00:00'],"['1996/12/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/06 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.49.31517 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)79020-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Dec 6;271(49):31517-25. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.49.31517.,,"['P01-CA5869/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-GM32373/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The TAL1 gene was originally discovered as being transcriptionally activated by chromosomal rearrangements in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here we have shown that TAL1 and the ubiquitously expressed murine bHLH transcription factor ALF1 formed heterodimers that, compared with ALF1 homodimers, had a more restricted E-box specificity and bound preferentially to the glucocorticoid-responsive E-box (Egre) motif (AACAGATGGT). Overexpression of the dominant inhibitory HLH protein Id1 in NIH3T3 cells reduced the transcriptional activity mediated by ALF1 homodimers, whereas the transcriptional activity mediated by TAL1/ALF1 heterodimers was resistant to Id overexpression. Our results show that ALF1 may serve as a dimerization partner for the bHLH oncoprotein TAL1 and form a complex with a distinctive DNA binding property. These findings support the hypothesis that the leukemic characteristics of the TAL1 oncoprotein could be mediated by activation of a set of target genes as heterodimeric complexes with ubiquitously expressed bHLH transcription factors such as ALF1 and that a principal role of TAL1 might be to neutralize an Id-mediated inactivation.","['Nielsen, A L', 'Norby, P L', 'Pedersen, F S', 'Jorgensen, P']","['Nielsen AL', 'Norby PL', 'Pedersen FS', 'Jorgensen P']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Aarhus University, C.

IL-11 is a member of the IL-6 family and known to require gp130 but not LIFR for signaling. In this study we investigate the functional and biochemical composition of the IL-11 receptor complex. The human IL-11 receptor alpha-chain was cloned from a human bone marrow cDNA library. IL-11Ralpha was shown to confer IL-11 responsiveness to human hepatoma cells either by cDNA transfection or by adding a soluble form of the receptor (sIL11Ralpha) expressed in the baculovirus system to the culture medium. In vitro immunoprecipitation experiments showed that sIL11Ralpha specifically binds IL-11 and that binding is enhanced by gp130. Similarly to IL-6 and CNTF, gp130 is able to induce dimerization of the IL-11.IL-11Ralpha subcomplex, the result of which is the formation of a pentameric receptor complex. However, in contrast to the other two cytokines, IL-11 was unable to induce either gp130 homodimerization or gp130/LIFR heterodimerization. These results strongly suggest that an as yet unidentified receptor beta-chain is involved in IL-11 signaling.","['Neddermann, P', 'Graziani, R', 'Ciliberto, G', 'Paonessa, G']","['Neddermann P', 'Graziani R', 'Ciliberto G', 'Paonessa G']","['Istituto di Ricerche di Biologia Molecolare ""P.

These results strongly suggest that protein tyrosine phosphatase beta2 is involved in triggering erythroid differentiation in mouse erythroleukemia cells.","['Kume, T', 'Watanabe, T', 'Sanokawo, R', 'Chida, D', 'Nakamura, T', 'Oishi, M']","['Kume T', 'Watanabe T', 'Sanokawo R', 'Chida D', 'Nakamura T', 'Oishi M']","['Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku 113, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Chlorides)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Zinc Compounds)', '86Q357L16B (zinc chloride)', 'EC 2.3.1.37 (5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptprj protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3)']",IM,"['5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase/genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chlorides/pharmacology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', '*Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Compounds/pharmacology']",1996/11/29 00:00,1996/11/29 00:01,['1996/11/29 00:00'],"['1996/11/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/29 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.48.30916 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)79150-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Nov 29;271(48):30916-21. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.48.30916.,['PDB/JT0626'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the maintenance of embryonic stem (ES) cell self-renewal is an activity unique to this family of cytokines, the intracellular signaling events mediated by gp130 remain largely unknown. Here we show a rapid and transient increase in the specific activity of the Src-related kinase Hck as well as of the Janus kinases Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 following treatment of ES cells with LIF or a combination of IL6 plus a soluble form of the IL6 receptor. Within 2 min of stimulation, we also observed increased tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC, activation of the guanidine nucleotide exchange activity on p21(ras), and an electrophoretic mobility shift of MAP kinase. Functional involvement of Hck and p21(ras) activation in gp130-mediated signaling is supported by the finding that the introduction of constitutively activated Hck or v-Ha-ras partially alleviates the requirement of ES cells for LIF to remain undifferentiated. In contrast, suppression of Jak1 in ES cells by antisense technology increased the amount of LIF required to retain their pluripotentiality. These results are consistent with the notion that gp130-mediated suppression of ES cell differentiation depends on signaling through at least two cascades, namely a p21(ras)-dependent pathway that possibly involves Hck, as well as a Jak kinase-dependent pathway.","['Ernst, M', 'Oates, A', 'Dunn, A R']","['Ernst M', 'Oates A', 'Dunn AR']","['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Melbourne Tumour Biology Branch, P.O.

Growth inhibition of the Calu-1 lung carcinoma cells induced with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a potent activator of protein kinase C, is associated with G2/M arrest and induction of expression of a novel, faster-migrating form of p21(WAF1/CIP1/SDI1) (p21) protein, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. This faster-migrating p21 protein was also expressed in TPA-treated A549 lung carcinoma cells which also exhibited G2/M arrest but not in TPA-treated U937 leukemia cells, which only expressed a slower-migrating form of p21 protein. However, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Southern analysis demonstrated no evidence of novel splice in TPA-treated Calu-1 cells. On the other hand, immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that the faster-migrating p21 protein could be detected only by peptide antibody directed against the N terminus but not the C terminus, suggestive of truncation of the latter or protein modification that results in the loss of the C-terminal epitope. Correlation of G2/M arrest with expression of the faster-migrating p21 protein suggests that this novel form of p21 protein may be a mediator of G2/M arrest and growth inhibition.","['Tchou, W W', 'Rom, W N', 'Tchou-Wong, K M']","['Tchou WW', 'Rom WN', 'Tchou-Wong KM']","['Division of Hematology, New York University Medical Center, New York, New York 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/genetics/*metabolism', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1996/11/22 00:00,1996/11/22 00:01,['1996/11/22 00:00'],"['1996/11/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/22 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.271.47.29556 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)79177-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Nov 22;271(47):29556-60. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.47.29556.,,"['AI35233/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL51494/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ewing sarcoma (N = 1), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in second remission (N = 1), Acute Lymphoid Leukemia (ALL) (N = 1), of multiple myeloma (N = 2) were analyzed by the simultaneous immunophenotypic (moAbs/ APAAP-staining) and genotypic analysis (for X and Y chromosomes) of interphase cells to characterize mixed chimerism, residual host cells, and leukemic relapse. Although a stable donor chimerism for T cells, myelomonocytic cells, and granulocytes was developed in seven of the eight patients at Days +21 to +28 post BMT, 0.5 to 1% host cells of different lineages remained continuously in five of the eight patients post BMT (> day 100). In two patients, one with common ALL and the other with multiple myeloma and long-term stable mixed chimerism, a tumor cell relapse was detected first in a sample at Day +176 and confirmed at Day +294. These malignant cells were genotypically of host origin and presented phenotypes identical to those at diagnosis. In the three patients with CML, residual host cells were identified as CD13 (Patient 3) of CD13/CD34 (Patient 4) positive and in one case as CD4/CD8 positive (Patient 7). Since no exclusive antigenic marker is available for this discrimination in these CML patients, normal host hematopoiesis can interfere with the identification of residual disease. Therefore, the identification of the bcr-abl transcripts by a two-step reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was included in this analysis. Patient 3 was bcr-abl positive at [Days +21, +28, +35, and +311, but negative at Days +121 and +400; Patient 4 was bcr-abl positive at only Day +166 post BMT. These results are interpreted as signaling a continuing risk of relapse. In Patient 7, the bcr-abl RT-PCR was negative at Days +142, +166, and +237. Thus, the combination of the simultaneous immunophenotypic and genotypic analysis and the bcr-abl detection by RT-PCR clearly improves the discrimination between malignant cells and normal residual host cells.","['Kogler, G', 'Hernandez, A', 'Heyll, A', 'Wolf, H H', 'Wernet, P']","['Kogler G', 'Hernandez A', 'Heyll A', 'Wolf HH', 'Wernet P']","['Bone Marrow Donor (with Transplantation Immunology), Medical School, Heinrich Heine University of Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Detect Prev,Cancer detection and prevention,7704778,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/*genetics/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*genetics/therapy']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Detect Prev. 1996;20(6):601-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CD4+/CD8+ ratio was reduced to 1.5 (0.7), compared with 3.0 (1.5) in 39 FeLV-and FIV-negative control cats. Differences from control values were significant, but there was no significant difference between CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes of FeLV-versus FIV-infected cats.

The levels of mRNA expression of DNA damage-inducible or death-related genes were measured at different times after CPT treatment. KM12 cells exhibited 3-fold higher basal levels of BCL-2 mRNA. Consistently, secondary DNA fragmentation, quantitated using a filter elution assay, was detected 24 h later and was 2-4-fold lower in KM12 cells than in SW620 cells. No induction of BAX was detected in either cell line. Consistent with the absence of functional p53, p21CIP1/WAF1 and GADD45 genes were not induced within the first 24 h. However, in SW620 cells, both mRNA levels were increased more than 10-fold at 48 h. The BCL-2-related gene MCL-1 and topoisomerase II mRNA were induced at 24 h, and topoisomerase I mRNA levels increased 3-fold at 48 h, only in SW620 cells.

These results indicate that gene-specific DNA methylation can play a role in downregulating top1 gene(s) and in the cellular resistance to camptothecins.","['Fujimori, A', 'Hoki, Y', 'Popescu, N C', 'Pommier, Y']","['Fujimori A', 'Hoki Y', 'Popescu NC', 'Pommier Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/*genetics', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1996;8(7-8):295-301.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten patients (23.2%) were found to have an increased (> or = 10%) proportion of gamma delta + T cells in the peripheral blood at 60-270 days after BMT. All of these patients remain alive, and 9 (90% of patients with > or = 10% gamma delta + cells) are free of disease at 2.5 years compared with a disease-free survival probability of 31% among patients with a normal proportion and concentration of gamma delta + T cells.

METHODS: MR images (19 patients) and CT scans (12 patients) were reviewed retrospectively in 19 children and adolescents with neurologic complications of leukemia or its treatment. Patients were divided into two groups: the first included those with disease-related complications of leukemia, such as meningeal and parenchymal leukemia, chloroma, and cerebrovascular disorders; the second included patients with treatment-related neurotoxicity and infection caused by immunocompromised states. Pathologic confirmation of the CNS lesions was obtained in eight patients. Factors that predisposed to the development of tumor-related or treatment-related complications were determined by reviewing the medical records. RESULTS: Among the 19 patients, 10 had two or more different CNS abnormalities found on CT scans or MR images. The imaging abnormalities seen in 12 patients during treatment included sinus thrombosis (n = 3), transient gray or white matter ischemia (n = 2), presumed disseminated microinfarcts (n = 1), cerebral hemorrhage or infarct (n = 3), inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (n = 1), infections (n = 4, 2 bacterial and 2 fungal), and meningeal leukemia (n = 2). After therapy, seven patients had CNS imaging abnormalities, including secondary brain tumors (2 malignant gliomas and 1 CNS lymphoma), spinal chloroma (n = 1), necrotizing leukoencephalopathy and mineralizing microangiopathy (n = 3), cerebral mucormycosis (n = 1), spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (n = 3), and spinal meningeal leukemia (n = 1). CONCLUSION: The wide spectrum of CNS abnormalities that occur during and after treatment for leukemia is related to the inherent risk of the leukemia itself, to the treatment method, and to the duration of survival. Because many neurologic complications of leukemia are treatable, early diagnosis is essential.","['Chen, C Y', 'Zimmerman, R A', 'Faro, S', 'Bilaniuk, L T', 'Chou, T Y', 'Molloy, P T']","['Chen CY', 'Zimmerman RA', 'Faro S', 'Bilaniuk LT', 'Chou TY', 'Molloy PT']","[""Department of Radiology, Children's Hospital of Philadelpha, PA, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,AJNR.

To delineate resistance mechanisms, we examined 5 GC-resistant leukemic cell lines, termed CEM-C7.R1-R5, isolated from the GC-sensitive human acute-T-cell-leukemic line, CCRF-CEM-C7, by selection in GC-containing medium. GC resistance was ascertained by analyzing cell-cycle progression, proliferation, and apoptosis. Radioreceptor assays revealed absence of ligand-binding activity in all clones, suggesting that defects in GC-receptor(GR) expression cause GC resistance. Analyses of the GR gene revealed that all but one (CEM-C7.R5) of the clones were heterozygous for the previously described L753F mutation. CEM-C7.R5 was either hemi- or homozygous for the L753F mutation and, hence, lacked a functional GR. Sequencing of the allele not carrying the L753F mutation of the other GC-resistant sub-lines revealed additional mutations in the GR gene in 3 cases: CEM-C7.R1 and R2 had a base-pair deletion in exon 9 (deltaT740) that resulted in a reading-frame shift and a pre-terminal in-frame stop. Translation of this mutant mRNA would produce a protein lacking 32 amino acids and expressing 4 altered residues at its new C terminus. CEM-C7.R3 harbored a non-sense mutation (Q710X) in exon 8, and its mRNA would be translated into a protein lacking 67 residues. Only CEM-C7.R4 cells were devoid of mutations in the coding region of the L753F negative allele. These data suggest that, in the CCRF-CEM acute-lymphatic-leukemia model, mutations in the GR-gene coding region represent one, but not the only, cause of GC resistance.","['Hala, M', 'Hartmann, B L', 'Bock, G', 'Geley, S', 'Kofler, R']","['Hala M', 'Hartmann BL', 'Bock G', 'Geley S', 'Kofler R']","['Institute for General and Experimental Pathology, Division of Molecular Pathophysiology, University of Innsbruck, School of Medicine, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glucocorticoids/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/27 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/11/27 00:00'],"['1996/11/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/11/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19961127)68:5<663::AID-IJC17>3.0.CO;2-2 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19961127)68:5<663::AID-IJC17>3.0.CO;2-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1996 Nov 27;68(5):663-8. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19961127)68:5<663::AID-IJC17>3.0.CO;2-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cell lines were tested for expression of the typical 210-kDa fusion protein, p210, using Western-blot analysis, and/or for mRNA expression of bcr-abl fusion genes, using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis. At diagnosis, mosaicism of B cells was demonstrated in every patient. During treatment with interferon alpha, p210-expressing B-lymphoid cell lines could not be established from 8 of 8 patients. Following discontinuation of IFN-alpha therapy, p210-positive cell lines were found early, even before cytogenetic recurrence.

These pathological changes are associated with functional deficiency of lymphocytes. However, the mechanisms involved have not been established. In MAIDS-susceptible C57BL/6 (B6) mice, the destruction of the LF occurred as early as 2-3 weeks after the infection by LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus (MuLV) and was accompanied by the intrafollicular infiltration of T cells of an unusual phenotype, Thy-1-CD4+. B6 mice, which Thy-1+ T cells had been depleted by the repeated inoculation with monoclonal antibody to Thy-1 antigen, developed LF destruction after infection similar to the control B6 mice. The LP-BM5 MuLV-infected C57BL/6-nu/nu (B6-nu/nu) mice, otherwise resistant to MAIDS induction, also developed these abnormalities following the adoptive transfer of highly purified Thy-1-CD4+ T cells obtained from MAIDS mice. Thus, the production of Thy-1-CD4+ T cells and their infiltration into LF are thought to be involved in triggering the LF destruction. However, the cytolysis of follicular components by activated CD8+ T cells or by LP-BM5 MuLV itself was a less likely mechanism as MAIDS developed in B6 mice depleted of CD8+ T cell. A/J mice, which are resistant to viral infection in the presence of CD8+ T cells, also developed MAIDS and LF destruction after the depletion of CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, no follicular destruction was observed in infected B6-nu/nu mice even though they are highly sensitive to LP-BM5 MuLV.","['Masuda, A', 'Makino, M', 'Kasajima, T']","['Masuda A', 'Makino M', 'Kasajima T']","[""Department of Pathology, Tokyo Women's Medical College, Japan.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,Clinical immunology and immunopathology,0356637,['0 (Thy-1 Antigens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*pathology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoid Tissue/immunology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology/*pathology', '*Thy-1 Antigens']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0090122996901865 [pii]', '10.1006/clin.1996.0186 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Immunol Immunopathol. 1996 Dec;81(3):253-60. doi: 10.1006/clin.1996.0186.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vivo planning and dosimetry.",2327-43,"Part II of this paper gives the results of applying the TBI methods described in part I, to in vivo patient planning and dosimetry. Patients are planned on nine CT based body slices, five of which pass through the lungs. Planned doses are verified with ten silicon diodes applied bi-laterally to five body sites, at each treatment. LiF TLDs are applied to seven other body sites at the first treatment only. For 84 patients and at least 1016 measurements per body site with the diodes, the mean measured total doses agreed with planned doses within at most 2% except at lung levels, where the mean measured dose was 3% too low. Standard deviations of the measurements about the mean were between 2.4 and 3.1%. For the LiF TLDs, the mean measured doses for all seven body sites were with in +/- 5% of planned doses. A separate assessment of measured entrance and transmitted doses showed that the former agreed well with planned doses, but that the latter tended to be low, especially over the lungs, and that they had a wider dispersion. Possible reasons for this are discussed. These results show measurement uncertainties similar to those for non-TBI treatments of Nilsson et al, Leunens et al and Essers et al. An analysis of the treatment plans showed a mean dose inhomogeneity in the body (75 patients, nine slices) of 19 +/- 6.0% (1 s.d.) and in the lungs (40 patients, five slices) of 9.2 +/- 2.85% (1 s.d.). The conclusions are that, overall, the methods are reasonably satisfactory but that, with an extra effort, even closer agreement between measured and planned doses and a further limited reduction in the body dose inhomogeneity could be obtained. However, if it were thought desirable to make a substantial reduction in the dose inhomogeneity in the body and lungs, this could only be achieved with the available equipment by changing from lateral to anterior-posterior irradiation and any potential advantages of this change would have to be balanced against a likely deterioration in patient comfort and an increase in treatment set-up times.","['Planskoy, B', 'Tapper, P D', 'Bedford, A M', 'Davis, F M']","['Planskoy B', 'Tapper PD', 'Bedford AM', 'Davis FM']","['Department of Medical Physics, UCL, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Phys Med Biol,Physics in medicine and biology,0401220,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/radiotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/radiotherapy', 'London', 'Lung/radiation effects', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/radiotherapy', 'Posture', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/radiotherapy', '*Radiotherapy Dosage', '*Radiotherapy, Computer-Assisted', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*methods']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1088/0031-9155/41/11/006 [doi]'],ppublish,Phys Med Biol. 1996 Nov;41(11):2327-43. doi: 10.1088/0031-9155/41/11/006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The G/total-actin ratio of malignant cells was found to be 1.37 to 1.81-fold higher compared to normal cells, indicating that malignant cells express reduced amounts of polymerized actin. The above findings were corroborated by fluorescence measurements of the amounts of rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled F-actin in normal and neoplastic cells, which showed significantly lower F-actin content in malignant cell preparations. Moreover, the total actin content, as quantitated by the DNase I inhibition assay and by immunoblot analysis, was found to be significantly decreased in the primary cultures of malignant human lymphocytes and endometrial cells when compared to the total actin levels in corresponding normal cells. Proliferation and viability measurements of normal and neoplastic cells in culture, treated equally with cytochalasin B (CB), revealed an increased susceptibility of malignant cells to this anticytoskeletal agent. This was not due to increased CB incorporation in neoplastic cells, as indicated by 3H-CB uptake experiments. In addition, fluorescence microscopy, in the presence of graded concentrations of CB, showed destabilization of microfilaments in the poorly differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma HEC-50 cells, compared to the well-differentiated Ishikawa cells. In conclusion, all investigated malignant cells are characterized by: (a) higher G/total-actin ratio; (b) decreased F- and total-actin content; and (c) lower resistance to CB treatment. These quantitatively determined parameters may represent potential biochemical indicators reflecting malignant transformation. Moreover, it seems worthwhile to explore whether or not the differential sensitivity of malignant cells to anticytoskeletal drugs may provide a valuable approach to the manipulation of malignant cells.","['Stournaras, C', 'Stiakaki, E', 'Koukouritaki, S B', 'Theodoropoulos, P A', 'Kalmanti, M', 'Fostinis, Y', 'Gravanis, A']","['Stournaras C', 'Stiakaki E', 'Koukouritaki SB', 'Theodoropoulos PA', 'Kalmanti M', 'Fostinis Y', 'Gravanis A']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Polymers)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)']",IM,"['Actins/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytochalasin B/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endometrial Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Endometrium/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Polymers/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/08 00:00,1996/11/08 00:01,['1996/11/08 00:00'],"['1996/11/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/08 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(96)00389-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(96)00389-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1996 Nov 8;52(9):1339-46. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(96)00389-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared to folic acid, DL-e,t-gamma-fluorofolic acid, a compound that is a poor substrate for polyglutamylation, was approximately 25-fold less potent in promoting growth of folate-depleted H35 rat hepatoma cells. DL-beta,beta-Difluorofolic acid, a compound that forms diglutamates more readily than does folic acid, was at least equivalent to folic acid in potency. Leucovorin (LV), a reduced folate, was 30-fold more potent than folic acid in promoting growth, whereas the analogous form of DL-e,t-gamma-fluorofolate, DL-e,t-gamma-fluoroleucovorin (DL-e,t-gamma-FLV) was only 4-fold more potent than folic acid. Both LV and DL-e,t-gamma-FLV protected or ""rescued"" cells from the growth inhibitory effects of MTX; however a 37- to 46-fold higher concentration of the fluoro analog was required. Folic acid, DL-e,t-gamma-fluorofolic acid, LV, and DL-e,t-gamma-FLV each potentiated the growth inhibitory effect of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine on CCRF-CEM human leukemia cells; higher concentrations of fluorinated analogs again were required.

We have now examined related aromatic fatty acids in order to define the range of active structures and identify plausible mechanisms of action. Structure-function analysis revealed that for effective stimulation of HbF in erythroid precursors: (1) the ideal length for the aliphatic side chain is four carbons; (2) oxygen or sulfur substitutions in the carboxylic chain are allowed, as evidenced by the equal or increased activity of phenoxypropionate, benzylthioglycolate, and benzyloxyacetate compared with phenylbutyrate; and (3) blocking the carboxylate group by conversion to the amide form greatly reduces potency. Molecular analysis indicated that the prototype agent, phenylbutyrate, increases HbF production through transcriptional activation of the gamma-globin gene. The latter contains a butyrate responsive promoter known to up-regulate transcription in the presence of short-chain fatty acids of three to five carbons. To determine whether stimulation of an element in this promoter by phenylbutyrate and its analogues might contribute to their mechanism of action, we used a transient expression system involving K562 erythroleukemia cells transfected with a luciferase reporter gene driven by the minimum gamma-globin promoter. Transcriptional activation in this experimental system correlated well with the capacity of an aromatic fatty acid to increase HbF production in erythroid precursors (r = 0.94). Our studies identify potent analogues of phenylbutyrate for the treatment of beta-chain hemoglobinopathies, and suggest that stimulation of a butyrate responsive promoter may be responsible for their activity.","['Hudgins, W R', 'Fibach, E', 'Safaya, S', 'Rieder, R F', 'Miller, A C', 'Samid, D']","['Hudgins WR', 'Fibach E', 'Safaya S', 'Rieder RF', 'Miller AC', 'Samid D']","['Clinical Pharmacology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Phenylacetates)', '0 (Phenylbutyrates)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)', 'ER5I1W795A (phenylacetic acid)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Fatty Acids/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/biosynthesis', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Hemoglobinopathies/blood/drug therapy/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Phenylacetates/pharmacology', 'Phenylbutyrates/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",1996/10/25 00:00,1996/10/25 00:01,['1996/10/25 00:00'],"['1996/10/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/25 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(96)00476-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(96)00476-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1996 Oct 25;52(8):1227-33. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(96)00476-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study evaluates methods for preparing and thawing cryopreserved CD34+ and CD34- cell lines for use as flow cytometry reagents. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The human myeloid leukemic cell lines KG 1 a (CD34+) and K562 (CD34-) were grown in culture under standard conditions and then prepared on ficoll gradients of different densities to determine which gave the component that was most reproducible. After ficoll preparation, the cells were frozen in standard cryopreservation media and four methods of thawing were examined. Determination of the method that gave the cell component that was most reproducible was based on viability, percentage of cell recovery, and maintenance of CD34 antigenicity status. RESULTS: Ficoll gradient preparation improved the ease of flow cytometry analysis when original viability was low, and it produced a more uniform cell population. However, it resulted in significant cell loss for both cell lines. While the cell recovery for K562 cells was not significantly different with any of the densities of ficoll, recovery was significantly better for KG 1 a cells with ficoll at a specific gravity of 1.077. Of the thawing methods examined, all three that involved a rapid thaw at 37 degrees C were statistically equivalent to each other and were better than thawing at 4 degrees C. CONCLUSION: With a standardized method of preparing cell lines as reagents for quality control purposes, data comparison among cell processing laboratories may more readily be initiated. Such cell lines could also be useful as a teaching tool for flow cytometry and in proficiency testing.","['Bowman, C A', 'Yu, M', 'Cottler-Fox, M']","['Bowman CA', 'Yu M', 'Cottler-Fox M']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine, Warren G.

The following studies were conducted to address some issues in chronic LGLL. (1) Chronic LGLL is characterized by the indolent course, and the diagnosis of leukemia is difficult in such patients as those without distinct organomegaly and/or any evidence of monoclonality. We performed immunohistological studies in a patient with persistent NK lymphocytosis. No organomegaly had been seen in the patient during a three-year-observation, who died from cerebrovascular accident. The autopsy findings revealed multi-organ infiltration including spleen, liver, bone marrow, lymph nodes and lung. These findings suggest that the cells of chronic LGLL have infiltrative capacity characteristic of malignant cells. (2) Lymphocytosis in chronic LGLL is usually stable for a long period. We found that both T- and NK-LGLL cells strongly expressed CD95, an apoptosis related protein. Anit-CD95 did not induce apoptosis, but suppressed proliferation induced by IL-2 or anti-CD3. These results suggest that CD95-CD95 ligand system is involved in the slow cell growth characteristic of chronic LGLL. (3) CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) cases are rarely seen in LGLL, and the physiologic counterpart of the leukemic cells has not been determined yet. We found that the DP-LGLL had alpha alpha type in the CD8 subunit and did not express RAG-1, these findings being characteristic of peripheral T cells. We also found that they expressed IL-4 mRNA and secreted IL-4 on activation. These results strongly suggest that DP-T-LGLL represents an expansion of a rare subset of peripheral DP-T cells, possibly derived from IL-4 activated CD4 single positive T cells.","['Mizuki, M', 'Tagawa, S', 'Shibano, M', 'Hirota, T', 'Machii, T', 'Kitani, T', 'Ohsawa, M', 'Aozasa, K', 'Nojima, J']","['Mizuki M', 'Tagawa S', 'Shibano M', 'Hirota T', 'Machii T', 'Kitani T', 'Ohsawa M', 'Aozasa K', 'Nojima J']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Medical School, Suita.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

She had been working on her farm for the previous 16 years. Every April she experienced fever, coughing, and dyspnea. Fine crackles were audible over both lung fields. On admission, arterial blood gas analysis showed hypoxemia, and pulmonary-function testing revealed restrictive lung disease and a low diffusing capacity. A chest X-ray film revealed radio-opacity throughout the lower lung fields. A 67Ga scintigram showed abnormal uptake in the lungs. Examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid revealed an abnormally high number of lymphocytes and a high CD4/CD8 ratio in the lymphocytes. Histological examination of a specimen obtained by transbronchial lung biopsy revealed interstitial pneumonitis. A precipitation test was positive for anti-Micropolyspora faeni antibody. After admission, symptoms resolved with no treatment. FL was diagnosed from anamnesis and the results of examinations. On admission, the level of soluble interleukin 2 receptor in serum was twice the upper limit of the normal value, and it decreased over time, a long with the severity of the disease. Serial measurements of levels of this receptor are clinically important for detecting the progression of adult T cell leukemia.

Most commonly used expression systems are based on stably transfected adherent CHO cells or nonadherent lymphoid cell lines. An efficient alternative is the infection of insect cells by recombinant baculoviruses. Transient expression in mammalian cells, e.g., COS cells, is often used for the production of smaller quantities of proteins. The choice of a suitable expression system depends largely on the biochemical and biological properties of the protein of interest, as well as on the nature of the planned experiments and the amount of recombinant protein required. We summarize here the expression of the cytokine human Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (hu-LIF) in five of the most commonly used systems, namely in CHO, Sp2/0, MEL, COS, and insect cells, in conjunction with an outline of the principles and characteristics of each of these expression systems. In result, the stably transfected cell lines, CHO, Sp2/0, and MEL cells, gave rise to production of fully glycosylated hu-LIF at variable product titers; incompletely glycosylated, albeit biological action hu-LIF could be rapidly produced by transient expression in COS cells or by baculovirus-mediated infection of insect cells.","['Geisse, S', 'Gram, H', 'Kleuser, B', 'Kocher, H P']","['Geisse S', 'Gram H', 'Kleuser B', 'Kocher HP']","['Sandoz Pharma Ltd., Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Protein Expr Purif,Protein expression and purification,9101496,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Baculoviridae/genetics', 'Cell Line/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Cells/*metabolism', 'Gene Amplification', '*Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Transfection']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1046-5928(96)90101-1 [pii]', '10.1006/prep.1996.0101 [doi]']",ppublish,Protein Expr Purif. 1996 Nov;8(3):271-82. doi: 10.1006/prep.1996.0101.,,,,111,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MB2 monoclonal antibodies were used for immunocytochemical staining of isolated lymphocytes from normal peripheral blood and from blood of leukemic patients (in 12 CLL patients, the p65 positivity was 83%, in 2 ALL patients, 100%, and in 4 AML patients, 75%). Our data suggest that p65 protein may be of use as a tumor marker in leukemia.","['Hanausek, M', 'Wang, S C', 'Blonski, J Z', 'Kulesza, E P', 'Walaszek, Z', 'Mirowski, M']","['Hanausek M', 'Wang SC', 'Blonski JZ', 'Kulesza EP', 'Walaszek Z', 'Mirowski M']","['Science Park-Research Division, University of Texas M.

Associated with this differentiation is the expression of ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase (UCH-L1). To investigate the role of UCH-L1 in TPA-induced Reh differentiation and apoptosis, molecular and chemical inhibition was used. Molecularly, a sequence-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (AODN) directed against UCH-L1 transcript was used to inhibit the expression of the gene. In addition, its complementary sense oligodeoxynucleotide (SODN) was used to indicate the specificity of AODN action. Chemically, sodium borohydride (NaBH4), an inhibitor of UCH-L, was used to block the transcript product. TPA-induced changes in Reh cell growth and morphology, UCH-L1 protein expression, apoptosis contour, surface phenotype, and enzymatic profile were assessed in the presence or absence of NaBH4, AODN or SODN. As previously reported, TPA induced Reh cells to differentiate into monocytoid B lymphocytes and stimulated the apoptotic pathway. However, adding NaBH4 or AODN inhibited the TPA effect on all parameters measured except apoptosis. The sequence in which NaBH4 or AODN were added in relation to TPA did not affect any of the response variables measured. The use of SODN did not influence any of the parameters measured, indicating the specificity of the action. Thus, we conclude that UCH-L1 is involved in the differentiation process of the lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, Reh. Our data suggest that TPA-induced apoptosis of Reh cells has a separate pathway from that of differentiation or that UCH-L1 expression is independent of the apoptotic pathway.","['Maki, A', 'Mohammad, R M', 'Smith, M', 'Al-Katib, A']","['Maki A', 'Mohammad RM', 'Smith M', 'Al-Katib A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University-School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,"['EC 3.1.2.- (Thiolester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thiolester Hydrolases/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-4681(09)60714-3 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-0436.1996.6010059.x [doi]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 1996 Mar;60(1):59-66. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-0436.1996.6010059.x.,,['CA50715/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secondly, to compare pair frequencies with random expectations, identify excesses, and measure the diameters of any clusters. Thirdly, to infer possible causes. DESIGN AND SETTING: Stratified Poisson analyses of two comprehensive sets of childhood leukaemia and cancer data in Great Britain: seeking home address pairs within particular census enumeration districts (EDs) or postcodes (PCs). Numbers of pairs/triplets of leukaemia registrations sharing single or adjacent EDs were compared with Poisson, expectations in national ED strata with different numbers of households (HHs). Pairs/triplets of leukaemia/cancer deaths (and births) sharing a single PC were compared with Poisson expectations in national PC strata with different numbers of postal delivery points (DPs). Same and adjacent house pairs were identified individually among the same PC death pairs. Areal case densities were estimated around a sample of index cases, using their own PC grid coordinates, and those recorded in the central PC directory. PARTICIPANTS: These comprised, firstly, all cases of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma registered between 1966 and 1983 in England and Wales (ED analysis) and, secondly, all childhood leukaemia and cancer deaths between 1953 and 1980, in England, Wales, and Scotland (PC analyses at birth and at death). MAIN RESULTS: Short range spatial clustering was demonstrated (a) for leukaemia at place of registration, and (b) for leukaemia and cancer (separately and jointly) at both birth and death addresses. There was evidence of additional case pairing in adjacent PCs. Both data sets showed a relative local pair excess of about 1.5, within diameters of 300 metres. Secondary case densities, measured within 600 metres of a sample of unpaired index cases, were raised by the same ratio. The raised risk then tapered with increasing distance to about 3 km. Forty-four non-twin pairs had died at exactly the same address, far in excess of random expectation. This same house excess was due entirely to 31 sibling pairs. They also showed a relative excess of central nervous system and other solid tumours; but without the exact tumour type sibling concordances sometimes seen in MZ twins. The sibling pairs were only a small part of the overall excess of same PC pairs. CONCLUSIONS: Short range geographical clustering probably reflects two separate causes of childhood cancer, namely (a) an uncommon familial susceptibility to solid cancers, probably inherited, and (b) a group of long standing focal environmental hazards, most effective within a few hundred metres of the source, but detectable as far as 3 km.","['Knox, E G', 'Gilman, E A']","['Knox EG', 'Gilman EA']","['Department of Public Health and Epidemiology, University of Birmingham.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Family Health', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jech.50.3.313 [doi]'],ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 1996 Jun;50(3):313-9. doi: 10.1136/jech.50.3.313.,,,PMC1060289,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In protocol TCL 842, children with ALL received CrRT 18 Gy in 12 fractions, and 5 concomitant doses of intrathecal methotrexate 15 mg/m2/dose with 15 mg as the maximum, for CNSP after remission achieved. The first IQ test was performed immediately after CNSP. Those who had no CNS relapse for more than 5 years after CNSP had a second IQ test. For children between 3 and 6 years old, the Stanford-Binet (S-B) IV test was used, and for older children, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) was used. Fourteen consecutive children at our hospital were enrolled. There were 7 boys and 7 girls. The age at diagnosis ranged from 3 to 9 years old. Two of them were in the high-risk group, eight in the intermediate-risk group, and four in the standard-risk group. The IQ scores of all patients fell within the average range. In the first IQ tests, the mean IQ score was 104.29 (range 83-124, S.D. 14.55). In the second IQ tests, the mean IQ score was 100.93 (range 85-128, S.D. 11.57). Statistically, there was no significant difference between the first and second IQ scores (paired t-test, two-tailed P = 0.4232; one-tailed P = 0.2116).

The apoptotic response appears to be a function of both the sensitizer and the cell line. In this study, we examined photodynamic effects of several photosensitizers on murine leukemia P388 cells. Two drugs, a porphycene dimer (PcD) and tin etiopurpurin (SnET2), which localized at lysosomal sites, were tested at PDT doses that resulted in 50% loss of viability (LD50), measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. An oligonucleosomal pattern of DNA degradation was observed within 1 h after irradiation. Neither sensitizer antagonized PDT-mediated internucleosomal DNA cleavage by the other. Very high PDT doses with either agent abolished this rapid internucleosomal cleavage. Exposure of cells to high concentrations of either sensitizer in the dark also resulted in rapid DNA fragmentation to nucleosomes and nucleosome multimers; this effect was not altered by the antioxidant 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-chroman-2-carboxylic acid (trolox), although the latter could protect cells from cytotoxicity and apoptotic effects caused by LD50 PDT doses. Photodamage from two cationic sensitizers, which localized at membrane sites, caused rapid DNA cleavage to 50 kb particles; however, no further fragmentation was detected after 1 h under LD10, LD50 or LD95 PDT conditions. Moreover, the presence of either cationic sensitizer inhibited the rapid internucleosomal cleavage induced by SnET2 or PcD photodamage. The site of photodynamic action may therefore be a major determinant of the initiation and rate of progression of apoptosis.","['Luo, Y', 'Chang, C K', 'Kessel, D']","['Luo Y', 'Chang CK', 'Kessel D']","['Department of Pharmacology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '100572-96-1 (porphycene)', '466G63QE7G (tin etiopurpurin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/pharmacology', 'Porphyrins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1751-1097.1996.tb03079.x [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1996 Apr;63(4):528-34. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-1097.1996.tb03079.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Defects in the function of the CDK inhibitors may lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and potentially facilitate tumorigenesis. The p16INK4 family of CDK inhibitors specifically prevent the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product, pRb, by inhibiting the kinase activity of CDK4 and CDK6, thereby keeping pRb in its active form as a growth suppressor. The loss of p16INK4 inhibitory activity would, therefore, have the same consequence as the loss of pRb growth suppressing activity. The p16INK4 family currently includes four members, p15INK4b, pl6INK4a, pl8INK4c and p19INK4d. Two members, p15INK4b and pl6INK4a have been found to be deleted and mutated in a variety of human tumor-derived cell lines and primary tumors. In the present study we have examined the genomic status of the newly isolated p19INK4d gene in 75 tumor-derived cell lines; 13 immortalized, transformed or normal cell lines; 19 ovarian tumors and 18 acute myelogenous leukemias. No deletions or point mutations were observed in the pl9INK4d gene. A genetic polymorphism at codon 30 (CGC-->CGG) in exon 1 of the pl9INK4d gene was observed in 10% of the samples under investigation.

These results together with our previous data that showed a 22% deletion frequency in p15INK4b and rare alterations in the pl8INK4c gene, indicating that the p16INK4a and pl5INK4b, but not the p18INK4c and pl9INK4d genes, are frequently mutated in human tumors.

ALL-1 is the human homologue of Drosophila trithorax which transregulates the homeotic genes of the Antennapedia and bithorax complexes controlling body segment identity. ALL-1 encodes a very large protein of 3968 amino acids which presumably interacts with many proteins. Here we applied yeast two hybrid screening to identify proteins interacting with the N-terminal segment of ALL-1. One protein obtained in this way was the product of the unr gene. This protein consists of multiple repeats homologous to the cold shock domain (CSD), a motif common to some bacterial and eukaryotic nucleic acids-binding proteins. The minimal region on unr required for the interaction with ALL-1 included two CSD and two intervening polypeptides. The interaction was confirmed by in vitro binding studies, and by coimmunoprecipitation from COS cells overexpressing the relevant segments of the two proteins. These results suggest that unr is involved in an interaction of ALL-1 with DNA or RNA.","['Leshkowitz, D', 'Rozenblatt, O', 'Nakamura, T', 'Yano, T', 'Dautry, F', 'Croce, C M', 'Canaani, E']","['Leshkowitz D', 'Rozenblatt O', 'Nakamura T', 'Yano T', 'Dautry F', 'Croce CM', 'Canaani E']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CSDE1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hemagglutinins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Hemagglutinins/genetics/immunology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Plasmids/genetics/immunology', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Biosynthesis', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Yeasts/genetics']",1996/11/07 00:00,1996/11/07 00:01,['1996/11/07 00:00'],"['1996/11/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/07 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/07 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Nov 7;13(9):2027-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gene is expressed in all hematopoietic cells with the exception of T-cells and plasma cells. For this expression pattern the first 280 bp upstream of the major transcriptional start site seems to be sufficient. In vitro footprinting analysis within this part of the promoter revealed two Sp1 binding sites as well as a PU-box. The transcription factor Spi-1/PU.1 as well as the closely related factor Spi-B bound to the PU-box in B-cells. In the erythroleukemia cell line K562, due to the absence of Spi-B, only PU.1 bound to the Btk promoter. Mutation of either site reduced the expression in transient transfection experiments. However, mutation of the PU box had no effect in the T-cell line Jurkat, where none of the Spi-1 family members is expressed. In addition Spi-B as well as PU.1 were able to transactivate Btk expression. In fetal liver of PU.1-/- mice, which lack lymphoid and myeloid cells, expression of Btk was reduced two- to threefold but not abolished.

The target gene at 11q23, MLL, is disrupted by the translocation and becomes fused to various translocation partner genes such as AF4/FEL, LTG9/AF9 and LTG19/ENL. The resulting chimeric mRNAs are fused in frame and have been predicted to encode leukemia-specific chimeric proteins. In the present study, we raised antibodies against MLL, LTG9 and LTG19 and demonstrated that MLL and chimeric MLL-LTG9 and MLL-LTG19 products are synthesized in vivo and are localized in the nuclei, using immunofluorescence and cell fractionation studies. The truncated N-terminal portion of the MLL product common to the various types of 11q23 translocation was also localized in the nuclei in a similar fashion. Murine 32Dc13 cells stably expressing the truncated N-terminal MLL protein exhibited an inhibition of differentiation and a growth advantage following stimulation by granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, although the IL-3 dependency was not significantly changed in comparison to the parental cells. These results suggest that the N-terminal portion common to various MLL-chimeric products plays an important role in leukemogenesis.","['Joh, T', 'Kagami, Y', 'Yamamoto, K', 'Segawa, T', 'Takizawa, J', 'Takahashi, T', 'Ueda, R', 'Seto, M']","['Joh T', 'Kagami Y', 'Yamamoto K', 'Segawa T', 'Takizawa J', 'Takahashi T', 'Ueda R', 'Seto M']","['Laboratory of Chemotherapy, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (Mllt3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/immunology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', '*Nuclear Proteins', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Rabbits', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Staining and Labeling/methods', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/07 00:00,1996/11/07 00:01,['1996/11/07 00:00'],"['1996/11/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/07 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/07 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Nov 7;13(9):1945-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The spacing between the scFv and the SU glycoprotein was varied by fusing the scFv to residue +7 or to residue +1 of Moloney SU and by inserting linker sequences of different lengths between the domains. All of the chimeric envelopes were efficiently incorporated into vector particles and could bind to human cells through their displayed antibody fragments, but did not infect them. The spacing between the scFvs and the SU glycoproteins had no significant effect on the efficiency of envelope expression or viral incorporation and did not affect the binding properties of the chimeric envelopes, nor did it influence the efficiency of targeted gene delivery to human cells by scFv-displaying vectors. However, on murine fibroblasts the infectivity of vectors incorporating the chimeric envelopes was strongly influenced by the length of the interdomain spacer. The titers were very low when the single-chain antibodies were fused through a tripeptide linker to SU residue +7 and were greatly enhanced (up to 10(5)-fold) when they were fused to SU residue +1 through a heptapeptide linker.

Complement activation and the activation of the various enzymatic activities associated with cytotoxic granules have strikingly similar modes of action and both lead to pore formation in their respective targets. We report here that by using antisera to early and late complement components we were able to inhibit CTL, NK and ADCC cytotoxicity up to 100%, even though binding of EC to TC was unaffected. Furthermore, we showed that addition of C1q or C1s (two serine proteases) antisera to C9 antisera, at titers too low to inhibit separately, resulted in synergistic inhibition of CMC. Anti-C1s together with anti-C1q (or anti-C8 with anti-C9) did not result in synergy. This finding supports a cascade model of activation for lytic molecules released from EC. In addition, we demonstrated that anti-C1q and anti-C1s bind to proteins in the 30-kD region and anti-C9 binds to proteins in the 70-kD region, coinciding with published molecular weights of granzymes and perforin, respectively. Finally, lytic ability of purified granules was also inhibited by complement antisera, further suggesting that activation occurs outside of TC. Taken as a whole, these data indicate that TC lysis may be the result of a cascade of events involving granzymes and perforin, analogous to that seen with the complement system.","['Brahmi, Z', 'Csipo, I', 'Bochan, M R', 'Su, B', 'Montel, A H', 'Morse, P A Jr']","['Brahmi Z', 'Csipo I', 'Bochan MR', 'Su B', 'Montel AH', 'Morse PA Jr']","['Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5128, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Nat Immun,Natural immunity,9206126,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Complement Membrane Attack Complex)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (Serine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects/immunology', 'Binding, Competitive/immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'Complement Membrane Attack Complex/immunology', 'Complement System Proteins/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/*drug effects', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*analysis', 'Serine Proteinase Inhibitors/*immunology/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/09/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nat Immun. 1995 Sep;14(5-6):271-85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human NK activities of 125 individuals consisting of 68 healthy donors and 57 patients (36 autoimmune disease and 21 cancer patients) were measured by Eu-DTPA release assay in which the target cells were labeled by nonradioactive materials-Eu-DTPA, and they were phenotypically analyzed with three-color flow cytometry. Furthermore, a part of these donors was functionally studied on NK cells sorted out from PBL. 23.3% of healthy donors and approximately 70% of patients had low NK activity (LNK). In these healthy LNK and patient LNK, the population of CD3-CD16+CD56+ subset in PBL was significantly lower than that of the same subset in healthy individuals with high and medium NK activity (HMNK). The cytotoxicity of CD3-CD16+CD56+ cells sorted out from PBL in healthy LNK and patient LNK were approximately the same with or higher than that in healthy HMNK. No differences were found either in the expression of CD2 and LFA-1 antigens on the CD3-CD56+ NK cells or in the amount of granulous proteins such as perforin and granzyme A in these cells among healthy HMNK, healthy LNK and patient LNK. These results suggested that low NK activity of healthy LNK and patient LNK was more reflected by the diminution of the population of CD3-CD16+CD56+ subset in PBL rather than the functional defects of NK cells. A phenotypical and functional study on healthy LNK has not been reported extensively, and we found several differences between healthy LNK and patient LNK in this study. By stimulation with IL-2, the cytotoxicity of healthy LNK increased more rapidly than that of patient LNK, and at high effector:target cell ratio (> or = 40) it was significantly higher than that of patient LNK.

The ability to alter cytokine-dependent growth and differentiation in hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells appears to be a property of agents with leukemogenic potential. We have previously reported that BZ and HQ specifically stimulate granulopoiesis in mice and cause granulocytic differentiation in normal murine interleukin (IL)-3-dependent, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-inducible 32D myeloblasts. BZ induces granulocytic differentiation by upregulating the production of leukotriene D4 (LTD4), an essential intracellular mediator of G-CSF signaling. We report here that HQ (0.5-4.0 microM), as well as LTD4 (1 nM-10 microM), causes a concentration-dependent induction of granulocytic differentiation in 32D myeloblasts. Unlike LTD4, which induces terminal granulocytic differentiation, HQ undergoes a myeloperoxidase-dependent oxidation to bioreactive p-benzoquinone (BQ), which induces differentiation predominantly to the myelocyte stage. Studies with the highly specific LTD4 receptor antagonist, MK-571, suggest that BQ induces granulocytic differentiation in myeloblasts by activating the LTD4 receptor, thus obviating the requirement for LTD4. This was confirmed by the demonstration that HQ, in the presence of LTD4, shifts the stage-specific pattern of terminal differentiation induced by LTD4 to the incomplete (myelocyte) profile induced by HQ. The inability of HQ to induce a complete program of terminal granulocytic differentiation in myeloblasts, as well as its ability to compete with induction by LTD4, may have a bearing on the leukemogenic potential of BZ.","['Hazel, B A', 'Kalf, G F']","['Hazel BA', 'Kalf GF']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Recept Signal Transduct,Receptors & signal transduction,9617134,"['0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Leukotriene Antagonists)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Propionates)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Receptors, Leukotriene)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5Q9O54P0H7 (verlukast)', '73836-78-9 (Leukotriene D4)', 'AJT72OTM42 (cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'LRF7RW46ID (leukotriene D4 receptor)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/metabolism/toxicity', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced', 'Leukotriene Antagonists', 'Leukotriene D4/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Peroxidase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Propionates/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Leukotriene/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Recept Signal Transduct. 1996;6(1):1-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results show that the hormone differentially regulates the cytokine mRNA in the two cell types. 1,25-(OH)2D3 augments M-CSF and LIF mRNA in C6 glioma cells, while lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has minimal effects. When LPS and 1,25-(OH)2D3 are used in combination, a strong synergistic effect upon the induction of M-CSF and LIF genes is observed. No TNF-alpha transcript has been detected in C6 glioma cells under any stimulus conditions used. In contrast, 1,25-(OH)2D3 has no pronounced effect on M-CSF, LIF, and TNF-alpha transcripts in primary astrocytes when used as a sole stimulus, while treatment with LPS strongly enhances the levels of the three cytokines. However, when 1,25-(OH)2D3 is used in combination with LPS, a partial reduction in LPS-induced levels of M-CSF and TNF-alpha mRNA is observed. The overall results indicate that genes coding for some inflammatory cytokines obey distinct regulatory mechanisms in C6 cells and in primary astrocytes. They also suggest that 1,25-(OH)2D3, by altering the response of astrocytes to an inflammatory stimulus, could participate in the regulation of the CNS immune response.","['Furman, I', 'Baudet, C', 'Brachet, P']","['Furman I', 'Baudet C', 'Brachet P']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medical, INSERM U298, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Angers, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Glioma/*genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Lymphokines/genetics', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Rats', 'Reference Values', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics', 'Vitamin D/*pharmacology']",1996/11/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4547(19961101)46:3<360::AID-JNR9>3.0.CO;2-I [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4547(19961101)46:3<360::AID-JNR9>3.0.CO;2-I [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 1996 Nov 1;46(3):360-6. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4547(19961101)46:3<360::AID-JNR9>3.0.CO;2-I.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to study the mechanism(s) by which Met-ENK mediates-antiviral effects, when used in combination with AZT in Friend leukemia virus infected mice, an in vitro focus forming assay was used. AZT at 1 ng/ml inhibited FLV replication by 30-50% in the susceptible Mus dunni cell line. By contrast, the immunostimulatory neuropeptide, Met-ENK, displayed no direct inhibition of viral replication. This suggests that Met-ENK does not have any direct anti-retroviral activity. Subsequent testing of Met-ENK in the presence of AZT showed no ability of this peptide to promote inhibition of viral replication due to AZT. By contrast, in the presence of mouse spleen cells, as a source of lymphocytes, in vitro combination treatments using AZT and Met-ENK reduced FLV replication by 67%, compared to 47% using AZT alone. The inhibition due to Met-ENK was abrogated when spleen cells were pretreated with naloxone, an opioid antagonist. Therefore, we conclude that Met-ENK effects are mediated via opioid receptors on spleen cells and that the observed anti-FLV activity is dependent on the use of Met-ENK stimulated spleen cells in combination with AZT.","['Sin, J I', 'Plotnikoff, N', 'Specter, S']","['Sin JI', 'Plotnikoff N', 'Specter S']","['Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of South Florida, College of Medicine, Tampa 33612, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Immunopharmacol,International journal of immunopharmacology,7904799,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '36B82AMQ7N (Naloxone)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', '58569-55-4 (Enkephalin, Methionine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enkephalin, Methionine/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Naloxone/pharmacology', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'Virus Replication/drug effects', 'Zidovudine/*pharmacology']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0192056196000331 [pii]', '10.1016/0192-0561(96)00033-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopharmacol. 1996 May;18(5):305-9. doi: 10.1016/0192-0561(96)00033-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, secondary acute myeloid leukemias (AML) that occur as the result of chemotherapy agents, which are known to inhibit DNA topoisomerase II, often manifest the same MLL abnormalities. It has been hypothesized that de novo infant leukemias may occur as a result of maternal exposure to agents in diet and medications that inhibit DNA topoisomerase II. Three epidemiologic studies of childhood leukemia with similar methodologies were conducted in the United States and Canada over the past 10 years by the Children's Cancer Group (CCG). Of the total 771 mothers of infants diagnosed at one year of age or less (< 12.5 months) who originally were interviewed (303 infant cases and 468 matched controls) across the three studies, follow-up questionnaire data on maternal exposure to potential DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors during pregnancy were available on 84 cases and 97 matched controls in the US. For maternal diet, a composite variable was created that consisted of 10 foods identified alpha priori as containing DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors. There were no significant trends with increasing maternal consumption for either the overall group, or the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) stratum. However, within the AML stratum, there was a statistically significant positive association (P trend = 0.04) with increasing consumption of DNA topoisomerase II-inhibitor containing foods (odds ratio [OR] = 9.8, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-84.8; OR = 10.2, CI = 1.1-96.4; for medium and high consumption, respectively).

Here, we describe a two-stage cell culture system for expansion of functionally active human DC from CD34+ marrow precursors. Optimal outgrowth was achieved by initially culturing CD34+ cells for 5 days in medium containing GM-CSF, MGF and TNF-alpha. Substitution of CD40L and IL-4 for TNF-alpha during a subsequent 5-day subculture increased DC content, such that by 10 days the cultures contained approximately 40% DC as determined by immunophenotype and morphology. An increase in DC purity to 84% at 10 days was achieved by immunomagnetic separation for CD1a+ cells from 5-day cultures and subculturing these cells in medium with IL-4 and CD40L. Reversing the sequence of growth factors during culture and subculture decreased the yield and purity of DC. Expression of CD80 and CD86 was enhanced by adding CD40L and IL-4, and the DC showed stimulatory activity in MLC.

Patients received a preparative regimen consisting of busulfan 16 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg or busulfan 14 mg/kg, cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg and etoposide (VP-16) 50 mg/kg. For GVHD prevention, patients received cyclosporine with either methotrexate or steroids or FK506 with methotrexate. Fourteen patients were leukemia-free survivors at a median of 6.5 years (range 1-11 years) following transplantation. For the group as a whole, the estimated leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 5 years is 20% (95% confidence interval 10-30%). Ten of the 14 leukemia-free survivors developed acute GVHD greater than grade II and chronic GVHD and two developed only chronic GVHD. Significantly better relapse rates and disease-free survival were associated with the development of acute and/or chronic GVHD. In the absence of acute GVHD and/or chronic GVHD, patients who underwent transplantation for advanced leukemia, after preparation with Bu/CY or Bu/CY/VP-16, were very likely to experience disease recurrence. Novel strategies designed to promote development of GVHD present a promising area for investigation to improve outcome in patients with leukemia at high risk for relapse.","['Copelan, E A', 'Penza, S L', 'Elder, P J', 'Belt, P S', 'Scholl, M D', 'Hehmeyer, D M', 'Ezzone, S A', 'Bechtel, T P', 'Avalos, B R']","['Copelan EA', 'Penza SL', 'Elder PJ', 'Belt PS', 'Scholl MD', 'Hehmeyer DM', 'Ezzone SA', 'Bechtel TP', 'Avalos BR']","['Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Ohio State University, Arthur G James Cancer Hospital and Research Institute, Columbus 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', '*Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Nov;18(5):907-11.,,['P30CA16058-21/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifteen patients had CML in first chronic phase (CP), and two in accelerated phase (AP). Three patients had been previously treated with interferon alpha 2a (IFN). Twelve patients underwent leukaphereses and a mean of 4.7 x 10(8)/kg mononuclear cells were obtained. Four CP patients did not show a significant mobilization peak of CD34+ cells and leukapheresis was not performed; finally, one patient died before apheresis could be performed. Six of the 12 who underwent leukaphereses obtained more than 1.0 x 10(6)/kg CD34+ cells. Eight of the 12 mobilized patients (67%) obtained a major cytogenetic response, including two complete and six partial; in the remaining four patients minimal or absent cytogenetic responses were observed. A higher rate of Ph purging was obtained in patients mobilized early or showing residual Ph-negative cells before mobilization, even if they were in AP. Infectious complications were frequent with a 38% rate of bacteremia recorded and one case of pulmonary aspergillosis resulting in a toxicity similar to that occurring in acute myeloid leukemia-induction chemotherapy. The ICE regimen can promote 'in vivo' purging of the Ph+ cells in 67% of CML mobilized patients (8/12). Failure of mobilization occurs in 65% of patients (11/17), mainly because of poor CD34+ cell yield.","['Boque, C', 'Petit, J', 'Sarra, J', 'Cancelas, J A', 'Munoz, J', 'Espanol, J I', 'de la Banda, E', 'Aventin, A', 'Berlanga, J', 'Ferra, C', 'Amill, B', 'Torrico, C', 'Azqueta, C', 'Llucia, M', 'Garcia, J', 'Granena, A']","['Boque C', 'Petit J', 'Sarra J', 'Cancelas JA', 'Munoz J', 'Espanol JI', 'de la Banda E', 'Aventin A', 'Berlanga J', 'Ferra C', 'Amill B', 'Torrico C', 'Azqueta C', 'Llucia M', 'Garcia J', 'Granena A']","[""Servei d'Hematologia Clinica, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)', 'ICE protocol 1']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', '*Cell Separation', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Nov;18(5):879-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Busulphan (1.90-6.02 mg/kg/day) was administered orally as a single dose or twice daily. Busulphan kinetics were found to be linear within the studied range. Children with inherited disorders eliminated busulphan significantly faster after the first and the last dose with half-lives (t1/2) of 1.93 and 1.71 h, respectively compared to children with leukemia (3.16 and 2.70 h, respectively). The area under plasma concentration curves (AUCs, corrected for mg/kg) as an expression for the systemic exposure of busulphan were significantly higher in children with leukemia, 22.4 and 19.04 mumol/l.h (5527 and 4690 ng.h.ml-1) after the first and the last dose, respectively, compared to 11.2 and 8.2 mumol/l.h (2768 and 2029 ng.h.ml-1) found in children with inherited disorders. The present results confirm those reported by others, ie busulphan pharmacokinetics can be influenced by the underlying disease and its status. Our population pharmacokinetic analysis showed a negative correlation between the weight corrected clearance and the age in both groups of children. However, clearance was about 42% higher in children with inherited disorders compared to those with leukemia. To estimate AUC for the first dose, we evaluated a limited sampling model based on three concentrations (1, 3 and 6 h). A high correlation (r = 0.998, P < 0.0001, n = 40) between the estimated and the determined AUC was found. The present model is reliable and adequate for studying more patients, with a long-term follow-up combined with drug monitoring in correlation with drug efficacy and toxicity to define the optimal busulphan dosage required.","['Hassan, M', 'Fasth, A', 'Gerritsen, B', 'Haraldsson, A', 'Syruckova, Z', 'van den Berg, H', 'Sandstrom, M', 'Karlsson, M', 'Kumlien, S', 'Vossen, J']","['Hassan M', 'Fasth A', 'Gerritsen B', 'Haraldsson A', 'Syruckova Z', 'van den Berg H', 'Sandstrom M', 'Karlsson M', 'Kumlien S', 'Vossen J']","['Karolinska Pharmacy, Research Department, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Congenital Abnormalities/*therapy', 'Graft Rejection/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*therapy']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Nov;18(5):843-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CdA is exquisitely cytotoxic both to the dividing and to the non-dividing lymphocyte, which supports its use in lymphoproliferative disorders of low-grade malignancy. Indeed, the best clinical results with CdA are achieved in hairy-cell leukemia, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and in low-grade malignant lymphoma. Most patients with hairy-cell leukemia achieve a complete response with a single course of CdA. However, the disease is not eradicated and a fraction of complete responders will eventually relapse. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia and in malignant lymphoma, complete or partial responses can be achieved in approximately 40% of previously treated patients, even after classical chemotherapy has failed. However, few responses sustain beyond 1 to 2 years, while longer unmaintained responses may be obtained in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. More responses (70-80%) are achieved in patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders treated de novo with CdA but their impact on survival remains to be established.

To assess the value of transplantation with family mismatch donors or matched unrelated donors (MUD) basing on these data pool is not possible. The following decisions should be reached: 1) BMT for AML with mismatched or unrelated donors should be done only within cooperative European trials. 2) Generally accepted definitions of indications for BMT in AML are needed. 3) Study protocols concerning conditioning are necessary.","['Klingebiel, T', 'Pession, A', 'Paolucci, P', 'Rondelli, R']","['Klingebiel T', 'Pession A', 'Paolucci P', 'Rondelli R']","['Childrenis Hospital of the University, Tubingen, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Europe', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Nov;18 Suppl 2:49-52.,,,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The EBMT Paediatric Diseases Working Party.,43-6,"The development of chemotherapy in childhood ALL has been the leader of the success story of paediatric oncology. At least 2/3 of the children can be cured nowadays at the first attempt of treatment. From the remaining again 1/3 can be treated successfully for the relapse of their disease with conventional therapeutic strategies. This means, however, that there is no chance for cure with chemotherapy alone for 20 to 25% of the children. BMT has been shown for a long time to be an alternative therapy especially in those cases in which conventional chemotherapy fails. In spite of the fact that many children with ALL have been transplanted during recent years there is still no general agreement on the question which children need BMT. However a few statements can be made: The value of ABMT in ALL is probably not better than that of chemotherapy alone. In 1st CR a group of children can be defined, which might benefit from BMT. In 2nd CR the value of chemotherapy depends very much from the duration of 1st remission. Allogeneic BMT is the only chance for cure in very early relapses, superior to chemotherapy in early and late relapses and possibly equal to chemotherapy in very late relapses. The paper tries to summarise our current knowledge about the situation.","['Niethammer, D', 'Klingebiel, T', 'Ebell, W', 'Henze, G', 'Paolucci, P', 'Riehm, H']","['Niethammer D', 'Klingebiel T', 'Ebell W', 'Henze G', 'Paolucci P', 'Riehm H']","['Dept. of Paediatrics, Univ. of Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Nov;18 Suppl 2:43-6.,,,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The involvement of the cellular antioxidant system in the synergistic interactions of photosensitisation and VP-16 is proposed.","['Gantchev, T G', 'Brasseur, N', 'van Lier, J E']","['Gantchev TG', 'Brasseur N', 'van Lier JE']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine and Radiobiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sherbrooke, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '47822-79-7 (aluminum phthalocyanine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Interactions', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Nucleosomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Organometallic Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Photochemotherapy/*methods', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1996.591 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1996 Nov;74(10):1570-7. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1996.591.,,,PMC2074854,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chem., 7, 209). This paper presents initial studies on in vivo evaluation of Pluronic copolymers in the treatment of cancer. The anti-tumour activity of epirubicin (EPI) and doxorubicin (DOX), solubilised in micelles of Pluronic L61, P85 and F108, was investigated using murine leukaemia P388 and daunorubicin-sensitive Sp2/0 and -resistant Sp2/0(DNR) myeloma cells grown subcutaneously (s.c.). The study revealed that the lifespan of the animals and inhibition of tumour growth were considerably increased in mice treated with drug/copolymer compositions compared with animals treated with the free drugs. The anti-tumour activity of the drug/copolymer compositions depends on the concentration of the copolymer and its hydrophobicity, as determined by the ratio of the lengths of hydrophilic PEO and hydrophobic PPO segments. The data suggest that higher activity is associated with more hydrophobic copolymers. In particular, a significant increase in lifespan (T/C> 150%) and tumour growth inhibition (> 90%) was observed in animals with Sp2/0 tumours with EPI/P85 and DOX/L61 compositions. The effective doses of these compositions caused inhibition of Sp2/0 tumour growth and complete disappearance of tumour in 33-50% of animals. Future studies will focus on the evaluation of the activity of Pluronic-based compositions against human drug-resistant tumours.","['Batrakova, E V', 'Dorodnych, T Y', 'Klinskii, E Y', 'Kliushnenkova, E N', 'Shemchukova, O B', 'Goncharova, O N', 'Arjakov, S A', 'Alakhov, V Y', 'Kabanov, A V']","['Batrakova EV', 'Dorodnych TY', 'Klinskii EY', 'Kliushnenkova EN', 'Shemchukova OB', 'Goncharova ON', 'Arjakov SA', 'Alakhov VY', 'Kabanov AV']","['Moscow Institute of Biotechnology, Inc., and Russian Research Center of Molecular Diagnostics and Therapy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Micelles)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9003-11-6 (Poloxalene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Carriers', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Epirubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Micelles', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Poloxalene/*analogs & derivatives']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1996.587 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1996 Nov;74(10):1545-52. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1996.587.,,,PMC2074856,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies showed restricted EVI-1 RNA or protein expression during ontogeny; in a kidney and an endometrial carcinoma cell line; and in normal murine oocytes and kidney cells. EVI-1 expression was also detected in a subset of acute myeloid leukaemias (AMLs) and myelodysplasia. Because EVI-1 is expressed in the urogenital tract during development, we examined ovarian cancers and normal ovaries for EVI-1 RNA expression using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and RNAase protection. Chromosome abnormalities were examined using karyotypes and whole chromosome 3 and 3q26 fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). RNA from six primary ovarian tumours, five normal ovaries and 47 tumour cell lines (25 ovarian, seven melanoma, three prostate, seven breast and one each of bladder, endometrial, lung, epidermoid and histiocytic lymphoma) was studied. Five of six primary ovarian tumours, three of five normal ovaries and 22 of 25 ovarian cell lines expressed EVI-1 RNA. A variety of other non-haematological cancers also expressed EVI-1 RNA. Immunostaining of ovarian cancer cell lines revealed nuclear EVI-1 protein. In contrast, normal ovary stained primarily within oocytes and faintly in stroma. Primary ovarian tumours showed nuclear and intense, diffuse cytoplasmic staining. Quantitation of EVI-1 RNA, performed using RNAase protection, showed ovarian carcinoma cells expressed 0 to 40 times the EVI-1 RNA in normal ovary, and 0-6 times the levels in leukaemia cell lines. Southern analyses of ovarian carcinoma cell lines showed no amplification or rearrangements involving EVI-1. In some acute leukaemias, activation of EVI-1 transcription is associated with translocations involving 3q26, the site of the EVI-1 gene. Ovarian carcinoma karyotypes showed one line with quadruplication 3(q24q27), but no other clonal structural rearrangements involving 3q26. However, whole chromsome 3 and 3q26 FISH performed on lines with high EVI-1 expression showed translocations involving chromosome 3q26. EVI-1 is overexpressed in ovarian cancer compared with normal ovaries, suggesting a role for EVI-1 in solid tumour carcinogenesis or progression. Mechanisms underlying EVI-1 overexpression remain unclear, but may include rearrangements involving chromosome 3q26.","['Brooks, D J', 'Woodward, S', 'Thompson, F H', 'Dos Santos, B', 'Russell, M', 'Yang, J M', 'Guan, X Y', 'Trent, J', 'Alberts, D S', 'Taetle, R']","['Brooks DJ', 'Woodward S', 'Thompson FH', 'Dos Santos B', 'Russell M', 'Yang JM', 'Guan XY', 'Trent J', 'Alberts DS', 'Taetle R']","['Department of Medicine, University of Arizona and Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson 85724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.2.1.- (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Zinc Fingers/*physiology']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1996.583 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1996 Nov;74(10):1518-25. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1996.583.,,"['CA23074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2074868,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While effectively preventing GVHD, ex vivo T-lymphocyte depletion of the graft unfortunately increases graft rejection and reduces the graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) effect. The ex vivo transfer to the herpes simplex thymidine kinase (HS-tk) suicide gene into T-cells before their infusion with the hematopoietic stem cells should allow for selective in vivo depletion of these T-cells with ganciclovir (GCV) if subsequent GVHD was to occur. In patients not experiencing GVHD, and therefore at a higher risk of relapse, one could preserve the beneficial effects of the donor T-cells on tumor control. Lastly, the early presence of donor T-cells in all patients should contribute to successful engraftment. We have demonstrated that retroviral-mediated transfer of HS-tk and Neomycine resistance genes in T-lymphocytes, followed by G418 selection, results in T-cells specifically inhibited by GCV with no bystander effect. In a phase I study, escalating amounts of HS-tk expressing T-cells will be infused in conjunction with a T-cell depleted marrow graft to allogenic HLA identical recipients. Toxicity, survival, alloreactivity and GCV-sensitivity of the gene-modified cells will be monitored. If successful, such an approach could significantly contribute to expanding the use of alloreactivity as a treatment modality.","['Tiberghien, P', 'Cahn, J Y', 'Contassot, E', 'Ferrand, C', 'Reynolds, C W', 'Herve, P']","['Tiberghien P', 'Cahn JY', 'Contassot E', 'Ferrand C', 'Reynolds CW', 'Herve P']","[""Laboratoire de Therapeutique, Service d'Hematologie, CHU, Besancon, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Hematol Cell Ther,Hematology and cell therapy,9613253,['EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)'],IM,"['*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Simplexvirus/enzymology', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00282-996-0221-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Cell Ther. 1996 Apr;38(2):221-4. doi: 10.1007/s00282-996-0221-7.,,,,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous refractoriness was the main factor associated with poor prognosis for achieving CR, DFS and survival in a multivariate analysis. There was no difference in DFS between patients receiving the different modalities of intensive post-remission therapy. These results confirm initial reports on TSC and show that some patients with first relapse off therapy can enjoy prolonged DFS using chemotherapy only.","['Archimbaud, E', 'Leblond, V', 'Fenaux, P', 'Dombret, H', 'Cordonnier, C', 'Dreyfus, F', 'Cony-Makhoul, P', 'Tilly, H', 'Troussard, X', 'Auzanneau, G', 'Thomas, X', 'Ffrench, M', 'Marie, J P']","['Archimbaud E', 'Leblond V', 'Fenaux P', 'Dombret H', 'Cordonnier C', 'Dreyfus F', 'Cony-Makhoul P', 'Tilly H', 'Troussard X', 'Auzanneau G', 'Thomas X', 'Ffrench M', 'Marie JP']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",France,Hematol Cell Ther,Hematology and cell therapy,9613253,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00282-996-0161-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Cell Ther. 1996 Apr;38(2):161-7. doi: 10.1007/s00282-996-0161-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Are there implications for the retinoic acid syndrome?,139-49,"Differentiation therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) using all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) has improved the prognosis of the disease. ATRA therapy also causes a newly recognized clinical syndrome, the ""retinoic acid syndrome"" (RAS), which can be successfully managed with dexamethasone. Because aberrant function of maturing leukemic granulocytes may cause this syndrome, and because dexamethasone is useful clinically, we studied functional properties of maturing HL60 cells cultured in the presence and absence of dexamethasone. HL60 cells were cultured for 4 days with ATRA and studied daily to determine acquisition of mature neutrophil-like properties including phagocytosis, NBT reduction, actin polymerization, chemotaxis and adhesion molecule expression. Undifferentiated HL60 cells could not polymerize actin or reduce NBT, and exhibited only a minimal ability to undergo chemotaxis or ingest latex beads. Following 4 days of maturation with ATRA, the cells would increase F-actin content in response to interleukin-8, ingest latex beads, migrate in a chemotaxis chamber, reduce NBT, and express CD11b. When dexamethasone was added to the cells in culture, there was no major enhancement or suppression of these properties. We also studied the effect of dexamethasone on functional properties of normal neutrophils and found minimal if any effect on their function. Overall, these studies suggest that in vitro, dexamethasone has little effect on the function of leukemic and normal granulocytes. To further investigate the pathophysiology of the retinoic acid syndrome, future studies may need to use endothelial cells, cytokines, or granulocytes obtained from APL patients.","['Sham, R L', 'Phatak, P D', 'Belanger, K A', 'Packman, C H']","['Sham RL', 'Phatak PD', 'Belanger KA', 'Packman CH']","['Department of Medicine, Rochester General Hospital, NY 14621, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Actins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Actins/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chemotaxis/*drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Dimerization', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Phagocytosis/*drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(96)90021-2 [pii]', '10.1006/bcmd.1996.0021 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 1996;22(2):139-49. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.1996.0021.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An azapeptide prodrug of ara-C was obtained by condensation of an amino acid hydrazide with an activated nucleotide urea. The use of unnatural amino acid residues at N4 prevented nonspecific proteolytic cleavage in biological medium. Ara-C prodrugs 10, 15, 17, and 19 released active drug with half-lives from a few minutes to several days, respectively. Activation via intramolecular N4-deacylation did not require enzymatic intervention but was strictly dependent on the structure of the peptide chain. The prodrugs 10, 15, and 17 produced similar growth inhibition as ara-C in cultured murine leukemia cells while the azapeptide prodrug 19 was less potent reflecting the slow release of active drug with this compound. All four prodrugs retained the ability to induce apoptosis in human HL-60 leukemia cells with kinetics dictated by the rate of intramolecular N4-deacylation.

There is often considerable disagreement about the need for such confirmatory trials. PURPOSE: Our aim is to provide a general statistical framework for evaluating whether a confirmatory trial is warranted in a particular situation. METHODS AND RESULTS: The results of two clinical trials are considered: 1) a Cancer and Leukemia Group B trial comparing induction chemotherapy plus radiotherapy with radiotherapy alone in the treatment of patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer and 2) a North Central Cancer Treatment Group trial comparing surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy with surgery alone in the treatment of patients with advanced colon cancer. In our analysis, we argue that differences in the interpretation of results from a randomized trial are based on differences in prior beliefs about the efficacy of the treatment(s) under study. We believe that a major factor in the decision to perform a confirmatory trial is prior skepticism about the clinical worth of the treatment in question. Both the level of prior skepticism and the minimum treatment effect deemed clinically worthwhile require subjective judgment. We develop a Bayesian framework to allow differences in interpretation to be examined systematically and the need for a confirmatory trial to be assessed. Our model allows the addition of prior belief (specified in the form of a prior distribution of treatment effect) to the results of a trial to yield a posterior distribution. The interpretation of trial results is based on the posterior distribution and will vary as the prior distribution (i.e., the prior belief) varies. To aid in the interpretation of trial results, we also advocate the specification of a minimum clinically worthwhile treatment effect at the start of a trial. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our approach acknowledges that a number of different prior beliefs are possible, giving rise to a range of interpretations of results from a clinical trial. This approach provides a formal and systematic basis for considering both the range of likely opinions and the subsequent decision to be made with regard to the need for a confirmatory trial. We recommend that this approach be considered in the discussion of future confirmatory randomized clinical trials.","['Parmar, M K', 'Ungerleider, R S', 'Simon, R']","['Parmar MK', 'Ungerleider RS', 'Simon R']","['Medical Research Council, Cancer Trials Office, Cambridge, U.K.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '2880D3468G (Levamisole)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/therapeutic use', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/therapy', 'Colonic Neoplasms/therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Fluorouracil/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Levamisole/therapeutic use', 'Lung Neoplasms/therapy', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Observer Variation', '*Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', '*Reproducibility of Results', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/11/20 00:00,1996/11/20 00:01,['1996/11/20 00:00'],"['1996/11/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/20 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/88.22.1645 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1996 Nov 20;88(22):1645-51. doi: 10.1093/jnci/88.22.1645.,,,,,,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1996 Nov 20;88(22):1606-7.

In this paper we have shown by DNase I sensitivity that the chromatin conformation of the 5-lipoxygenase gene changes following differentiation of HL60 cells with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Moreover, run-on analysis suggests that transcription of the 5-lipoxygenase gene is enhanced after differentiation. We proposed that the chromatin conformation represses the expression of the 5-lipoxygenase gene in HL60 cell line and that differentiation of these cells with DMSO changes the chromatin conformation, which allows the expression of the 5-lipoxygenase gene. The HeLa cells which, like the HL60 cells, do not express the 5-lipoxygenase, were insensitive to DNase I treatment.

Previous data were re-analysed using the proportion of households having no car, taken from the 1981 census of England and Wales, as an additional explanatory factor. A specialist registry of haematopoietic malignancies covering one-third of England and Wales (3270 electoral wards) recorded 438 cases of ALL in children diagnosed 1984-89, including 304 in the childhood peak (at ages 1-7 years). Relative risks were derived by Poisson regression of total childhood ALL and at ages 1-7 years for groups of electoral wards classified by isolation and car ownership. Multivariable analyses included adjustment for socio-economic status. No evidence of increased risk of childhood ALL in areas where more households own cars was found. ALL at ages 1-7 years was inversely associated with car ownership (risk in wards with least cars relative to those with most cars = 2.28, 95% CI: 1.12-4.64). The associations with geographic isolation persisted after allowing for car ownership (risks for ALL in young children in isolated relative to built-up areas = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.44-3.33). Levels of car ownership cannot explain the increased rates of childhood ALL which have been observed in isolated areas. No support has been found for a hypothesis relating these excesses to benzene exposure of children transported in cars. The previous explanation for the small area variation of childhood ALL in terms of geographical isolation and interpretation in terms of exposure to common infections continues to be justified.","['Alexander, F E', 'Leon, D A', 'Cartwright, R A']","['Alexander FE', 'Leon DA', 'Cartwright RA']","['Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Edinburgh Medical School, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol,Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,8709766,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Automobiles/*statistics & numerical data', 'Censuses', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Residence Characteristics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Space-Time Clustering', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3016.1996.tb00066.x [doi]'],ppublish,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol. 1996 Oct;10(4):411-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3016.1996.tb00066.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mobile phase consisted of a non-linear binary gradient of methanol and 0.03 M aqueous sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.3). Good separation of the eight congeners was achieved. On increasing the methanol content of the eluent, the bis(amidinohydrazones) eluted in the order of increasing number of carbon atoms in the side-chains. The method was also applied to the quantitative analysis of the compounds in aqueous solution and, combined with ultrafiltration, for the separation of the eight congeners in spiked human blood serum. A separate simplified method for the quantitative determination of each of the compounds in spiked human blood serum samples was also developed. The methods developed made for the first time possible the simultaneous HPLC analysis of more than one bis(amidinohydrazones). The results obtained indicate that the bis(amidinohydrazones) studied obviously have a distinct tendency to form ion associates with acetate ions and probably also other carboxylate ions in aqueous solution. This aspect may be of biochemical significance, especially concerning the intracellular binding of the compounds. Each one of the compounds studied invariably gave rise to one peak only, this result supporting the theory that the conventional synthesis of each of the compounds gives rise to one geometrical isomer only.

This producer cell line was shown to be helper virus free using an assay for horizontal spread of virus. Virus supernatant from PA317/LNSSN#19 was used to transduce Sanfilippo A fibroblasts, resulting in complete correction of both the enzymatic defect and the storage phenotype as assessed by intracellular accumulation of 35SO4(-)-labeled material. Phenotypic correction was seen even when the levels of viral transduction were low. These results show that gene therapy of the Sanfilippo A syndrome is practicable, although the nature of the disorder suggests that careful consideration needs to be given to the choice of the cellular target for gene transfer.","['Bielicki, J', 'Hopwood, J J', 'Anson, D S']","['Bielicki J', 'Hopwood JJ', 'Anson DS']","[""Department of Chemical Pathology, Women's and Children's Hospital, North Adelaide, South Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', 'EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.10.1.1 (N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/*metabolism', '*Gene Transfer, Horizontal', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Glycosaminoglycans/metabolism', 'Hydrolases/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mucopolysaccharidosis III/therapy', 'Skin/cytology', 'Transfection']",1996/10/20 00:00,1996/10/20 00:01,['1996/10/20 00:00'],"['1996/10/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/20 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1996.7.16-1965 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1996 Oct 20;7(16):1965-70. doi: 10.1089/hum.1996.7.16-1965.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reported here are simple techniques (e.g., physical examination, necropsy to identify lesions, hematocrit, Wright stain) used routinely by our laboratory to screen for the presence of age-related disease in studies using Fischer 344 and Wistar rats. Routine health screening by physical examination and blood testing in our studies has allowed us either to eliminate moribund rats or to assess whether deficient performance was related to health status when these animals had been included in behavioral investigations. Additional health screens (e.g., antibodies for specific tumors) need to be developed.

However, there is controversy regarding the mechanism leading to its antiproliferative effects. CoA-independent transacylase (CoA-IT) is an enzyme that remodels arachidonate between specific phospholipid donor and acceptor molecules in a variety of mammalian cells. ET-18-O-CH3 was found to be a potent inhibitor of CoA-IT (IC50, 0.5 microM), and kinetic analysis revealed that its inhibition was competitive with the lyso-phospholipid substrate. The goal of the current study was to explore the connection between inhibition of CoA-IT and antiproliferative effects using several structurally distinct inhibitors of CoA-IT. ET-18-O-CH3 and other inhibitors of CoA-IT were found to inhibit cell proliferation and thymidine incorporation into the DNA, as well as to induce apoptosis in human HL-60 monocytic leukemia cells. The mechanism of apoptosis induced by ET-18-O-CH3 appeared to be different from that induced by tumor necrosis factor; the former failed to activate NF-kappa B, whereas tumor necrosis factor did. Closer examination of the pharmacology of apoptosis in this model revealed that compounds that were structurally related to CoA-IT inhibitors, but lacked CoA-IT inhibitory activity, also failed to induce apoptosis. In addition, compounds that inhibited other enzymes that participate in arachidonic acid metabolism, cyclooxygenase, 5-lipoxygenase and phospholipase A2, did not induce apoptosis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that inhibition of CoA-IT can be linked to blockade of proliferation and the induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells.","['Winkler, J D', 'Eris, T', 'Sung, C M', 'Chabot-Fletcher, M', 'Mayer, R J', 'Surette, M E', 'Chilton, F H']","['Winkler JD', 'Eris T', 'Sung CM', 'Chabot-Fletcher M', 'Mayer RJ', 'Surette ME', 'Chilton FH']","['Department of Immunopharmacology, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (arachidonyl transacylase)', 'SAA04E81UX (Coenzyme A)']",IM,"['Acyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Coenzyme A/*physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phospholipid Ethers/*pharmacology', 'Phospholipids/metabolism']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1996 Nov;279(2):956-66.,,"['AI24985/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI26771/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ara-CTP acts as a competitive inhibitor of DNA polymerase and may also be incorporated into DNA. Accumulation of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) induced by Ara-C may indicate disruption of DNA synthesis in susceptible leukemia cells. A procedure has been developed for the quantification of Ara-CTP and dNTPs from small samples of leukaemia cells from patients (4 x 10(7) cells) activated with concanavalin A (10 micrograms/ml, 48 hr) and grown in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate (1.1 microM, 9 x 10(6) Ci/mol, 16 hr).

By contrast, an Ara-C-resistant derivative of HL-60 cells (IC50 = 400 nM) accumulated only low concentrations of Ara-CTP (71 amol/cell) without significant changes in dNTPs. High concentrations of Ara-CTP in leukemia cells induce accumulations of dATP, dGTP and dTTP due to inhibition of DNA synthesis, and depletion of dCTP. This imbalance in the pools of the four dNTPs could lead to genetic miscoding and cell death.","['Crisp, L B', 'Smith, S M', 'Mathers, M A', 'Young, G A', 'Lyons, S D', 'Christopherson, R I']","['Crisp LB', 'Smith SM', 'Mathers MA', 'Young GA', 'Lyons SD', 'Christopherson RI']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['1357-2725(96)00028-3 [pii]', '10.1016/1357-2725(96)00028-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 1996 Sep;28(9):1061-9. doi: 10.1016/1357-2725(96)00028-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MFG retroviral vector was designed to yield improved expression over the widely used N2 or LN vectors; however, the molecular basis for this effect has not been examined. Using the human glucocerebrosidase (GC) enzyme as a reporter, we compared expression from the MFG and N2 vector backbones in transduced murine hematopoietic cells after syngeneic bone marrow transplantation. Reporter enzyme activities in primary spleen colonies of transplanted mice were seven-fold higher per vector copy in cells transduced with the (MFG-based) MGC vector than in cells bearing the (N2-based) G2 vector. In spleen colonies harboring the MGC vector, the ratio of spliced to unspliced vector RNA was increased four-fold relative to the G2 vector transcripts in Northern blot analyses. Further analyses indicated that MGC-transduced cells contained five-fold higher levels of spliced RNA per vector copy. Since translation of spliced RNA species (in which the complex secondary structure of the packaging signal has been excised) is likely to proceed with enhanced efficiency, the augmented levels of spliced RNA produced by MFG may represent the key element of increased protein expression from this vector. These findings suggest that the MFG retroviral vector may provide higher level expression of target genes used in human gene therapy.","['Krall, W J', 'Skelton, D C', 'Yu, X J', 'Riviere, I', 'Lehn, P', 'Mulligan, R C', 'Kohn, D B']","['Krall WJ', 'Skelton DC', 'Yu XJ', 'Riviere I', 'Lehn P', 'Mulligan RC', 'Kohn DB']","['Division of Research Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Codon, Initiator)', 'EC 3.2.1.45 (Glucosylceramidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Codon, Initiator', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Glucosylceramidase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Protein Biosynthesis', '*RNA Splicing', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Spleen/cytology/metabolism']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gene Ther. 1996 Jan;3(1):37-48.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although corticotrophin seemed to produce a more rapid response, overall improvement was similar with both treatments. Long-term neurological morbidity was a major problem with 91% of children suffering either persisting symptoms or repeated relapses. A persisting disability was found in 88% and was considered severe in 61% of patients. No features prognostic of neurological severity or outcome were identified.

Furthermore, lymphocytes from HSV-infected nontransgenic mice, adoptively transferred into HSV-infected TL-transgenic mice, promoted viral clearance and led to an increase in IFN-gamma production. Transgenic mice which were subcutaneously injected with IFN-gamma in the right footpad were also capable of clearing the viral challenge; however, clearance was restricted solely to the right footpad. These studies support the possibility of perturbations in the immune system of TL-transgenic mice and effectively demonstrate the utility of this model system in the study of HSV clearance, persistence, and potential spontaneous reactivation. Moreover, the TL-transgenic animals may provide a useful model system for additional studies requiring a host system skewed toward a Th2 phenotype.","['Sharma, P', 'Johnson, C A', 'Bonneau, R H', 'Lang, C M', 'Chorney, M J']","['Sharma P', 'Johnson CA', 'Bonneau RH', 'Lang CM', 'Chorney MJ']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Herpes Simplex/*immunology', '*Herpesvirus 1, Human', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Th2 Cells/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/*immunology']",1996/11/25 00:00,1996/11/25 00:01,['1996/11/25 00:00'],"['1996/11/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/25 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008-8749(96)90296-8 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1996.0296 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1996 Nov 25;174(1):84-9. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1996.0296.,,"['2-T32-RR07006/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '5RO1CA53445-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 1287 animals were used in the experiments. Survival of irradiated animals was reduced significantly only in the mice receiving the highest doses (1 Gy neutrons, 3 Gy X rays ). Mice exposed to the lowest doses (0.125 Gy neutrons, 0.5 Gy X rays) lived significantly longer than controls, apparently reflecting a reduction in non-neoplastic lung and liver diseases. All malignant tumors increased significantly from (and including) doses of 0.5 Gy neutrons and 1 Gy X rays. Hepatocellular carcinoma was the principal contributor to the increase in tumor incidence, at least after exposure to neutrons. No significant increase in hepatocellular carcinoma was seen in 21-day-old mice exposed to X rays. An increase, especially after 3 Gy X rays, was also observed for all leukemias. Controls in the present study lived significantly longer than those in our earlier studies of irradiated adult mice, making a direct comparison of the radiation-induced effects in adult and infant mice difficult. Based on percentage life shortening, it appears that exposure during infancy does not shorten total survival or survival from cancer much more than exposure of adults, although such exposure, especially to neutrons, causes more hepatocellular carcinoma. Due to the nonlinearity of the dose-effect relationships, it is difficult to calculate the RBE of neutrons. For survival time at higher doses an RBE of about 3 is obtained. When the incidence of all malignant tumors and of hepatocellular cancer is fitted to a linear or a linear-quadratic function, an RBE from 5 to 8 is obtained. No RBE can be estimated for hepatocellular carcinoma in mice of an age of 21 days because exposure to X rays does not seem to cause this tumor at that age.","['Maisin, J R', 'Gerber, G B', 'Vankerkom, J', 'Wambersie, A']","['Maisin JR', 'Gerber GB', 'Vankerkom J', 'Wambersie A']","['Universite Catholique de Louvain, Unite de Radiobiologie et de Radioprotection, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Fast Neutrons/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/etiology', 'Longevity/*radiation effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Radiobiology', 'Relative Biological Effectiveness']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1996 Oct;146(4):453-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dose-response curves for induction of apoptosis in HL60 cells 6 h after irradiation with 280 kVp X rays in air and hypoxia give an oxygen enhancement ratio (OER) of 2.7. This is similar to the OER of 2.8 obtained from survival curves for HL60 cells using a soft agar clonogenic assay. However, HL60 cells are much more sensitive to radiation-induced loss of clonogenicity than to induction of apoptosis at 6 h. For example, 12 Gy in air reduces the surviving fraction to about 0.002 in a clonogenic assay, but 12 Gy does not cause any significant increase in the percentage of apoptosis-like DNA fragmentation 6 h after irradiation compared to unirradiated controls. However, if apoptosis is assayed 2-4 days after irradiation, the HL60 cells show greater sensitivity, with 5 Gy in air causing 45-50% apoptosis at 3 days. When apoptosis is measured 3 days after irradiation, the OER is similar to that obtained for survival and for apoptosis at 6 h. Although the HL60 cells exhibit radiation-induced apoptosis if one waits 2-4 days after low doses of radiation, rather than just 6 h, to conduct the assay, the amount of cells undergoing apoptosis is still not sufficient to account for all the loss of clonogenicity seen when HL60 cells are exposed to ionizing radiation.","['Hopcia, K L', 'McCarey, Y L', 'Sylvester, F C', 'Held, K D']","['Hopcia KL', 'McCarey YL', 'Sylvester FC', 'Held KD']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Aerobiosis', 'Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Survival/*radiation effects', 'Clone Cells', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Time Factors', 'X-Rays']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1996 Mar;145(3):315-23.,,"['CA18614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['Radiat Res. 1996 Jul;146(1):116-9.

Since the first BMT up to the end of 1995, 168 BMT were performed. The number of transplantations since 1990 to our days was gradually increasing. As a result of this activity in the three transplantation centers (National Institute of Haematology and Immunology, St. Laszlo Hospital and County Hospital in Miskolc) 36 allogeneic and 12 autologous BMT were performed in 1995. Out of the allogeneic BMT cases, 14% of them were completed with unrelated, donors in the last three years. The most frequent indications for allogenic BMT are: chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), myelodysplasia, severe aplastic anaemia. Child allogenic BMTs are carried out on pediatric patients in St. Laszlo Hospital in leukaemia, severe aplastic anaemia cases and children born with immunodeficiency. Autologous BMTs started in an organised way in 1995 for adult patients in cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and for children with solid tumour indication in the Miskolc Centre. BMT activity in Hungary compared with international data, especially within Europe, shows a significant drop behind. To calculate for ten million inhabitants, the optimal BMT activity should be between 100-200 transplantations (allogeneic and autologous BMT together) in 1994. Among the Central European countries Hungary and Poland fall most behind. Autologous BMTs in most countries of Europe are above of allogeneic BMTs in numbers as indication in cases of lymphoma and solid tumours (first of all mamma carcinoma) comes into focus.

All the patients were off-therapy and without symptoms of relapse except for one case. The examination of the male and female gonadal function was done on the basis of hormonal assay, ultrasonographic examinations, Tanner's determination of the pubertal development, monitoring of the ovulation and seminal fluid evaluation. The clinical results obtained showed an absence of negative effects both on the gonadal function and on pubertal development. Combined chemotherapy for ALL during pre- and pubertal stage without alkylating agents does not alter the normal gonadal function during the following ten years.

Available data were insufficient in 19 of these. Regarding 125 patients, 80 with PV and 45 with ET, the survival and the frequency of acute leukaemia with various forms of treatment (32P, busulfan or combination of several treatment modalities) were studied. Moreover, in the PV group the duration of survival was compared with the expected duration of survival in a comparable group of the population. RESULTS: Of the 80 PV patients, five developed acute leukaemia: two in the 32P group (5%), two in the busulfan group (12%) and one in the group given combination therapy (4%). Of the 26 patients of the ET group treated with busulfan, one developed acute leukaemia (4%). The survival in the PV group was 4 years shorter than the expected duration of survival in a comparable group of the population. CONCLUSION: Since 32P is efficacious and causes little inconvenience, it should be the drug of first choice in the treatment of PV in the elderly.","['Tesselaar, M E', 'Wijermans, P W', 'Metsaars, J A', 'Gerrits, W B', 'Haak, H L']","['Tesselaar ME', 'Wijermans PW', 'Metsaars JA', 'Gerrits WB', 'Haak HL']","['Afd.

Between 1977 and 1994, 68 children and adolescents between 1.0 and 18 years of age with CML in chronic phase and 7 presenting with blast crisis at diagnosis were reported to the study center in Munster. The Philadelphia-chromosome and/or BCR/ABL rearrangement could be detected in 66 children. The 4 Philadelphia-negative patients and 5 patients without karyotyping fulfilled the morphological criteria of CML. Clinical symptoms and hematological findings at presentations were similar to adult patients. THERAPY: Until 1985 chemotherapy consisted predominantly in busulfan (BU), later in hydroxyurea (HU) or a combination of both and since 1987 increasingly in HU plus interferon-alpha. 47 patients (6 in blast crisis) were allografted once or twice (n = 4) (27 HLA-identical, 16 unrelated, 4 haplo-identical) within 2.3-135 months (median 12 months) after diagnosis. RESULTS: 38 of 75 patients (3 in blast crisis at diagnosis) were alive after a median follow-up of 5.5 years. The probability of 12 years survival was 27%, SE 9% for patients in chronic phase. All deaths (n = 19) were leukemia-related in the 27 non-transplanted children. A comparison of survival for patients with or without bone-marrow transplantation (BMT) showed a significant difference in favour of the BMT-group (42%, SE 13% vs. 10%, SE 8%, p log-rank 0.003). The probability of survival increased to 62%, SE 10%, if patients transplanted later than 3 years after diagnosis were excluded. Only few patients (4/39 with information about the cause of death = 10%) died due to recurrent CML after BMT. CONCLUSION: Our data confirm the unfavourable outcome of CML in pediatric patients if treated with chemotherapy alone. With early BMT high cure rates can be achieved. If transplant-related mortality which in our patient group was 21% (8/39) can be reduced, even a higher cure rate appear realistic for the future.","['Creutzig, U', 'Ritter, J', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Klingebiel, T']","['Creutzig U', 'Ritter J', 'Zimmermann M', 'Klingebiel T']",['Universitats-Kinderklinik Munster.'],['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/mortality/therapy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*mortality/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/mortality/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1046479 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1996 Jul-Aug;208(4):236-41. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1046479.,,,,,Prognose von Kindern mit chronischer myeloischer Leukamie: Eine retrospektive Analyse von 75 Patienten.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The success rate of relapse treatment correlates with the length of first remission. Thus early relapses and primarily refractory diseases have a grave prognosis. New chemotherapeutic regimens could be useful for those patients. Patients treated for newly diagnosed or relapsed AML with polychemotherapy regimen of the AML-BFM-studies containing induction, consolidation and high-dose cytarabine combined with mitoxantrone (HAM) and relapsed within 2 up to 31 months after the first CR entered a pilot trial, the so called IDA-FLAG regimen. This regimen includes G-CSF (day 0 up to ANC > 1000/microliter, 400 micrograms/m2.d), fludarabine (day 1-4, 30 mg/m2.d), high-dose cytarabine (day 1-4, 2000 mg/m2.d) and idarubicin (day 2-4, 12 mg/m2.d). 10 patients aged 1,8 to 28,1 years (mean = 9,6 years) having the first (n = 8) or second relapse (n = 1) of AML or an acute blastcrisis of myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 1) (FAB classification: M1/M2 = 3, M4/M5 = 5, M7 = 1, CMML = 1) received 14 courses.

Further important side effects were fever, mucositis and pneumonia. One patient died from an fulminant aspergillus sepsis during long-term neutropenia. The sequential administration of G-CSF, fludarabine, cytarabine and idarubicin is effective in treatment of relapsed AML in childhood and an advisable option prior to allogenic or autologous bone marrow transplantation.

The goal of this study was to determine if patterns of cell surface antigens could be identified on CD34+ subpopulations which may allow distinction between normal and leukemic stem cells. Expression of the progenitor cell antigen CD34 on leukemic blasts was very heterogeneous and varied between 0.5 and 100% in 20 patients analyzed in this study. In cALL and pre-B-ALL, a variable percentage of the leukemic cells coexpressed CD20 in addition to CD10. Only in one case, differentiation characteristic for normal B cell development with coordinated downregulation of CD10 with increasing expression of CD20 was observed. By analysing 5 x 10(6)-1 x 10(6) cells, a CD34+ cell population could be identified in 8 out of 8 patients which did not express CD19 and comprised less than 0.1% of all bone marrow or peripheral blood cells. Within this population, there was differentiation from primitive CD34-CD38- to more mature CD34+CD38+ cells. In 4 of these patients, an additional CD34+ population with low expression of CD19 (CD34+CD19lo) was detected. The lack of CD45 expression on the leukemic cells of 2 patients was used as a marker for the leukemic cell clone. In both patients, the CD34+CD19- cells did express CD45 while CD34+CD19lo/+ cells were CD45 negative. This suggests that the CD34+CD19lo cells were part of the leukemic clone and that the CD34+CD38-CD19- cells may represent residual normal primitive hematopoietic cells. In conclusion, flow cytometry allowed identification of primitive CD34+ cell populations in children with ALL, which can now be functionally characterized by transplantation onto immune-deficient mice.","['Baersch, G', 'Baumann, M', 'Meltzer, J', 'Mollers, T', 'Ritter, J', 'Jurgens, H', 'Vormoor, J']","['Baersch G', 'Baumann M', 'Meltzer J', 'Mollers T', 'Ritter J', 'Jurgens H', 'Vormoor J']","['Klinik und Poliklinik fur Kinderheilkunde, Westfalische Wilhelms-Universitat Munster.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Child', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Prognosis']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1046467 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1996 Jul-Aug;208(4):160-7. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1046467.,,,,,Durchflusszytometrische Charakterisierung von Reifungsvorgangen und stammzellnahen Zellpopulationen bei der B-Vorlauferzell-ALL im Kindesalter.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pharmacokinetics of Ara-CTP in leukemic cells was reported to be of clinical importance in adult nonlymphoblastic leukemia. Therefore, the role of intracellular Ara-CTP formation and retention was investigated in blast cells from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: At the time of diagnosis, peripheral or bone marrow blast cells from 41 children with ALL and 13 with relapsed ALL were incubated in Ara-C containing medium (1 hour, 1 or 3 micrograms/ml) followed by reincubation in Ara-C free medium (3 h). Intracellular Ara CTP formation and Ara-CTP retention were determined. MAIN RESULTS: Ara-CTP formation did not show marked differences between the different immunological subtypes. Ara-CTP retention, however, was significantly lower in T-ALL (37 +/- 15%, n = 8) compared to non-T-ALL (67 +/- 25%, n = 33; p < 0.003). Ara-CTP retention was also significantly different in children with and without persistence of peripheral blast cells after one week of prednison treatment (71 +/- 30%, n = 9 and 53 +/- 19%, n = 21; p = 0.031) as well as in children with and without complete bone marrow remission on day 15 of the ALL-BFM treatment protocol (66 +/- 17%, n = 19 and 43 +/- 18%, n = 11; p = 0.018). Ara-CTP retention was inversely correlated with the risk groups defined by the ALL-BFM treatment protocols (standard 79 +/- 29, intermediate 59 +/- 25, high risk 47 +/- 21%). A trend towards lower Ara-CTP retention was observed in relapsed leukemias (relapsed non-T-ALL 51 +/- 17%, p = 0.061). The difference in the probability of event free survival (following risk group adapted treatment according to ALL-BFM trials) between children with high (> or = 72%; 0.92 +/- 0.08) and low (< 72%: 0.58 +/- 0.15) Ara-CTP retention up to now did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.12). CONCLUSIONS: The more rapid decrease of cellular Ara-CTP in T-cell leukemia and children at higher clinical risk groups provide a pharmacokinetic rationale for prolonged infusion duration as an alternative to the intensification by dose escalation alone.","['Schiller, M', 'Hohenlochter, B', 'Schulze-Westhoff, P', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Ritter, J', 'Jurgens, H', 'Boos, J']","['Schiller M', 'Hohenlochter B', 'Schulze-Westhoff P', 'Zimmermann M', 'Ritter J', 'Jurgens H', 'Boos J']","['Klinik und Poliklinik fur Kinderheilkunde, Westfalische Wilhelms-Universitat Munster.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/*pharmacokinetics', 'Blast Crisis/*blood/drug therapy/mortality', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1046466 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1996 Jul-Aug;208(4):151-9. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1046466.,,,,,Intrazellulare Retention von Cytarabin-Triphosphat (Ara-CTP) in Blasten von Kindern mit akuter lymphoblastischer Leukamie.

Therefore, here IL-10 production in patients after allogeneic BMT was investigated and correlated with the incidence of acute GvHD. PATIENTS: 14 patients after allogeneic BMT have been investigated. Patients' age ranged from 2.6 to 22 yrs. (median 7 yrs.). Patients were diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma (1), ALL (4), AML (3), CML (2), Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS;1), MDS (1) and SAA (2). GvHD > II degrees occurred in 5/14 patients. As control served 20 healthy volunteers. METHODS: Mononuclear cells (MNC's) isolated from patients and 20 healthy controls were stimulated with an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody for 72 hr. IL-10 was detected in cell-free supernatants by ELISA. RESULTS: Anti-CD3-induced IL-10 production in MNC's isolated from patients (range/median: 0-1579 pg/10(6) MNC; 221 pg/10(6) MNC) was significantly reduced compared to healthy controls (160-5093 pg/10(6) MNC; 1250 pg/10(6) MNC; p < 0.01). 4/5 patients with low IL-10 production, but only 1/9 with a normal IL-10 production presented with GvHD > II degrees (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Ex vivo IL-10 production was decreased in about one third of patients early after allogeneic BMT. The low IL-10 production was associated with a significantly increased risk of severe GvHD. Thus, supplementation of IL-10 might become a useful therapy to prevent GvHD.","['Korholz, D', 'Hempel, L', 'Packeisen, J', 'Kunst, D', 'Zintl, F', 'Burdach, S']","['Korholz D', 'Hempel L', 'Packeisen J', 'Kunst D', 'Zintl F', 'Burdach S']","['Klinik fur Padiatrische Hamatologie and Onkologie, Medizinische Einrichtungen der Heinrich-Heine-Universitat, Dusseldorf.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,['130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*blood', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Risk Factors']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1046464 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1996 Jul-Aug;208(4):141-4. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1046464.,,,,,Die Bedeutung des Interleukin 10 fur die akute Graft versus Host Erkrankung bei Kindern und Jugendlichen nach allogener Knochenmarktransplantation.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The intracellular ACh content determined by a specific and sensitive radioimmunoassay in the human leukemic T cell lines, HSB-2, MOLT-3, and CEM, was 79.6, 36.2, and 9.5 pmol/10(6) cells, respectively. These values were 9-70-fold higher than those of other cell lines, including a helper T cell line, Jurkat. Stimulation of HSB-2 and MOLT-3 by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) increased both the intracellular content and release of ACh into the culture medium, but did not influence the intracellular content and release of ACh in CEM. ACh synthesis activity was found in all the T cell lines tested. Bromoacetylcholine (100 microM), a choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) inhibitor, and bromoacetyl-L-carnitine (100 microM), a carnitine acetyltransferase (CarAT) inhibitor, decreased ACh-synthesizing activity in MOLT-3, and HSB-2 and CEM, by about 50% and 30%, respectively, indicating that both ChAT, and to a lesser extent CarAt, are involved in ACh synthesis in T cells.

The disease produced in the recipients 8 weeks after transfusion was characterized by splenomegaly, disseminated lymphadenopathy, leukopenia with neutrophilia, abrogation of the primary immune response to SRBC, decreased in vitro proliferation of spleen cells co-stimulated with phorbol ester and IL-2 or ionomycin and abrogation of synergistic effect of the co stimulators. Quantitative analysis of the blood or blood products used for transfusion show that a single transfusion of 0.2 ml of PBS containing 0.2 mu 1 of whole blood or 2 microliters of plasma or 400 Ficoll-isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells was sufficient for the inducing the disease. The results suggest that the retroviruses were present in preparations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma of mice with the disease. However, the latter was 10-fold less efficient in inducing the disease. Transfusion of 1.8 x 10(6) isolated erythrocytes failed to induce the disease suggesting a marginal role, if any, in transmission of the disease via transfusion of these cells.

The Tsup-1 line of human T lymphoblastoma cells expresses both type I and type II G protein-coupled VIP receptors (Rs), as shown by detection of the encoding mRNAs with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses. Northern blot quantification of the relative amounts of mRNA encoding the two VIPRs in Tsup-1 cells indicated that type II predominates over type I, as it does in human blood CD4+ T cells. Tsup-1 cells bound 125I-VIP to 8.95 x 10(4) high-affinity sites/cell (Kd = 6.0 nM) and 7.45 x 10(5) low-affinity sites/cell (Kd = 210 nM). VIP increased [cAMP]i in Tsup-1 cells (EC50 = 14.4 nM) and stimulated a rapid and transient increase in [Ca2+]i (EC50 = 30 nM). Functional coupling of G proteins to type II VIPRs was suggested by the change in binding of 125I-VIP to Tsup-1 cell membranes from two sites with Kd values of 3.8 and 109 nM to one site of Kd 30 nM by GTP-gamma-S and the suppression by pertussis toxin of increases in [Ca2+]i evoked by VIP. The VIP antagonists, VIP4-28 and (4-Cl-D-Phe6-Leu17) VIP, inhibited 125I-VIP binding by type II VIPRs, as well as VIP-elicited increases in [Ca2+]i and [cAMP]i.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 255 patients (144 men, 111 women, median age 67 [14-97] years) in whom primary MDS had been diagnosed between 1986 and 1995 (refractory anaemia [RA]: n = 40; RA with ring sideroblasts: n = 38; RA with increased blasts: n = 76; RA with increased blasts in transformation: n = 45; chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia: n = 56). 69 healthy persons (28 men, 41 women, median age 33 [24-62] years) served as controls. The normal laboratory range for sTK was between 0.9 and 4.9 U/microliter. RESULTS: At time of diagnosis 83% of patients had sTK levels higher than 5 U/microliter. There was no relationship between sTK levels and the proportion of medullary blasts. But serum sTK levels correlated with LDH activity (P < 0.0005) and with peripheral leukocyte count (P = 0.003). At all times patients with sTK levels < 10 U/microliter had a higher survival rate than those > or = 10 U/microliter. Cumulative survival rates in both groups was 69 +/- 10% (< 10 U/microliter) and 43 +/- 11% (> or = 10 U/microliter), respectively, after 2 years and 37 +/- 9% (< 10 U/microliter) and 20 +/- 7% (> or = 10 U/microliter) after 5 years (P = 0.0002). Multivariate analysis showed that sTK, haemoglobin concentration and proportion of medullary blasts were independent prognostic survival factors. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with MDS have an increased sTK level when the diagnosis is made. This reflects the impaired proliferation and differentiation of haematopoiesis. sTK is a simply and rapidly measured prognostic indicator for estimating survival probability of patients with MDS.","['Aul, C', 'Germing, U', 'Gattermann, N', 'Sohngen, D', 'Heyll, A']","['Aul C', 'Germing U', 'Gattermann N', 'Sohngen D', 'Heyll A']","['Abteilung fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und klinische Immunologie, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik, Universitat Dusseldorf.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),0006723,['EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Clinical Enzyme Tests/methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/classification/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Thymidine Kinase/*blood']",1996/09/13 00:00,1996/09/13 00:01,['1996/09/13 00:00'],"['1996/09/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/13 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1043114 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 1996 Sep 13;121(37):1113-8. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1043114.,,,,,Prognostische Bedeutung der Serum-Thymidinkinase beim myelodysplastischen Syndrom.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its etiology is multifactorial-bone marrow infiltration, cytokines production, renal failure and effect of chemotherapy are main contributing factors. The red cell substitution therapy, which is administrated in 34 - 53% of patients, is frequently associated with the risk of well-known side effects. The use of recombinant erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) is a novel therapy in patients with MM. METHODS AND RESULTS: We have investigated the effect of r-HuEPO (Eprex. Cilag) in the group of 8 patients with MM. The growth factor was administrated in the dose of 150 U/kg. 3 times/ week s.c. The criterium of response was the increase of Hb levels of 20 g/L. All patients responded to r-HuEPO treatment. The medium period of response was 6,5 weeks. In two patients the doses of r-HuEPO could be reduced due to excellent effect of therapy. The energy level, ability to daily activities and overall quality of life significantly improved during the course of therapy. Neither effect of growth factor on thrombopoiesis and/or leukopoiesis nor serious adverse events due to r-HuEPO therapy were observed. The activity of underlying disease did not seem to be affected by r-HuEPO. In one patient the disease rapidly progressed after the end of study. The progression had some features of plasmablastic leukemia and leads to the death of patient. CONCLUSIONS: According to our experience, r-HuEPO is highly effective in the treatment of anemia in MM. The stimulation of erythropoiesis was associated with significant improvement of quality of life of patients. The effect of r-HuEPO treatment on activity of MM was not found, however, in one patient rapid progression of disease was observed after the end of study.","['Spicka, I', 'Haber, J', 'Petruzelka, L', 'Koleskova, E', 'Salkova, J', 'Straub, J', 'Zounar, R', 'Klener, P']","['Spicka I', 'Haber J', 'Petruzelka L', 'Koleskova E', 'Salkova J', 'Straub J', 'Zounar R', 'Klener P']","['I. interni klinika 1.

In addition, we demonstrate evidence of serologic response to REV. This is the first time definitive evidence of exposure to ALSV or REV has been demonstrated in human sera. The significance of this is not known. Further investigation into whether these findings mean that virus has been integrated into the human genome is needed, to assess the public health implications of these results.","['Johnson, E S', 'Overby, L', 'Philpot, R']","['Johnson ES', 'Overby L', 'Philpot R']","['Environmental and Molecular Epidemiology Section, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Detect Prev,Cancer detection and prevention,7704778,,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Avian Leukosis/*immunology', 'Blotting, Western/*methods', 'Chick Embryo', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oncogenic Viruses', 'Reticuloendotheliosis Viruses, Avian/*immunology', 'Sarcoma, Avian/*immunology', 'Serology']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Detect Prev. 1995;19(6):472-86.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Correlation coefficient is interpreted not as a measure of relationship between signs, but as an indicator of regulation processes in a live organism. The coefficients of correlation are most frequently different for the signs whose mean values are unchanged under the same conditions. This means that a comparative analysis of relationship between the signs largely contributes to such branches of medicine in which the conclusions are based on analysis of the mean tendencies. Such branches are primarily new tests for early diagnosis of tumorous diseases, assessment of dissemination and malignancy of the process, understanding of the processes of malignant degeneration, etc. Automated analysis of differences in correlations may be useful to decipher the ambiguous and dynamic relationships between different submultiplicities of immunocompetent elements in different forms of immune response (and in various states of the organism). Use of the new system opens new vistas in studies of the signs of vital activity of cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Not only new mechanisms regulating the hemodynamics, respiration, and cardiorespiratory relationships were disclosed; relationships between physiological parameters and cellular elements were revealed, which could be hardly suspected before. A fragment of a study of survival factors in acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (carried out in cooperation with N.N. Mamayev) is presented for illustration. A close positive relationship between the humoral and cellular immunity (at least of their components analyzed in this study) is demonstrated to be destructive for patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia.

While studying the sequence selectivity for a series of CNU, a dramatic increase in the formation of N7-alkyldeoxyguanosine was observed when Tris buffer was used rather than phosphate or cacodylate buffers. Moreover, the formation of N7-alkyldeoxyguanosine lesions continues in Tris long after all of the CNU has hydrolyzed. These effects are not seen with the monofunctional alkylating analogues, e.g., N-methyl- and N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-N-nitrosourea. In order to determine if the nature of the CNU-mediated DNA damage was altered by Tris, studies were initiated on the following: (1) alkylation of N7-G in end-labeled DNA restriction fragments; (2) covalent modification of DNA with [ethyl-3H]-N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-nitrosourea; and (3) cytotoxicity in L1210 cells. The data presented demonstrate that Tris increases the yield of the ""normal"" CNU monofunctional cross-linked adducts, i.e., N7-(2-hydroxyethyl)deoxyguanosine, N7-(2-chloroethyl)deoxyguanosine, O6-(2-chloroethyl)deoxyguanosine, and bifunctional adducts, i.e., 1-(deoxycytid-3-yl)-2-(deoxyguanosin-1-yl)ethane and 1,2-bis(deoxyguanosin-7-yl)ethane. In addition, CNU appears to react with Tris to give a long-lived alkylating intermediate that affords large amounts of DNA adducts not seen with CNU in the absence of Tris. However, in vivo toxicity of CNU in L1210 cells is not affected by the presence of Tris, indicating that the reaction pathway(s) responsible for cross-linking is not significantly sensitive to the nature of the buffer.","['Chen, F X', 'Bodell, W J', 'Liang, G', 'Gold, B']","['Chen FX', 'Bodell WJ', 'Liang G', 'Gold B']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha 68198-6805, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '023C2WHX2V (Tromethamine)', '2365-30-2 (1-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea)', 'P8M1T4190R (Ethylnitrosourea)']",IM,"['Alkylation/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence/drug effects', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/chemistry/*toxicity', 'DNA Adducts/chemistry/*drug effects/*toxicity', 'DNA Damage', 'Drug Interactions', 'Ethylnitrosourea/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/toxicity', 'Leukemia L1210/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Tromethamine/*pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/tx950097g [doi]', 'tx950097g [pii]']",ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 1996 Jan-Feb;9(1):208-14. doi: 10.1021/tx950097g.,,"['CA13525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA29088/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Study of mortality. SETTING: Province of Huelva. PATIENTS: All deaths and their causes were studied, using the Death Register of the National Institute of Statistics. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mortality due to the most common malign tumours (MI) was analysed (lung, lip, mouth cavity and pharynx, breast, body and neck of uterus, ovaries, oesophagus, stomach, colon, liver, pancreas, prostate, bladder, leukaemia, Hodgkin's, bones and cartilages, brain and skin). The standardised and theoretical rates were calculated for age, year, gender and specific rates. Cancer accounted for 20.8% of deaths (males, 25.29%; women, 16%). The mortality rates for cancer tended to rise significantly, both overall and for both genders (men in 1980, 201 per 100,000 and in 1991, 230; women in 1980, 112 and in 1991, 124). The highest rates for males were for lung, prostate and stomach MTs; and for women, breast, stomach and colon MTs. Lung MT and leukaemia increased in men; whereas breast, neck of uterus, ovaries and Hodgkin's disease increased in women. Bladder, mouth cavity, colon, pancreas and skin MTs were on the rise in both sexes. The highest specific rate was in under-45s for Leukaemia; and in over-45s, for lung MT in men and breast MT in women. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer is the second cause of death in Huelva and is on the rise. The rates of death in men due to lung MT and in women to breast MT are particularly high.","['Marquez Contreras, E', 'Casado Martinez, J J', 'Aguado Nunez-Cornejo, A', 'Ruiz Bonilla, R']","['Marquez Contreras E', 'Casado Martinez JJ', 'Aguado Nunez-Cornejo A', 'Ruiz Bonilla R']","['Centro de Salud, La Orden y Ayuntamiento de Huelva.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Aten Primaria,Atencion primaria,9111075,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Regression Analysis', 'Sex Distribution', 'Spain/epidemiology']",1996/06/30 00:00,1996/06/30 00:01,['1996/06/30 00:00'],"['1996/06/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/30 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Aten Primaria. 1996 Jun 30;18(2):58-63.,,,,,Tendencias de la mortalidad por cancer en la provincia de Huelva (1980-1991).,['Aten Primaria. 1997 Apr 15;19(6):328-30.

Radioactivity was reversibly incorporated into the mitochondria, suggesting that AZT toxicity may result in part from its toxic effects on human mitochondria rather than on human nuclear DNA.","['Nusbaum, N J', 'Joseph, P E']","['Nusbaum NJ', 'Joseph PE']","['Lee Streich Flow Cytometry Laboratory, Brookdale Hospital Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY 11212, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Scintillation Counting', 'Thymidine/pharmacokinetics', 'Zidovudine/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/dna.1996.15.363 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 1996 May;15(5):363-6. doi: 10.1089/dna.1996.15.363.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report describes the isolation and characterization of the human homolog of murine EKLF. The human EKLF transcription unit shares a number of structural properties with its marine counterpart. Human EKLF is contained within 3 kb of genomic DNA, and its coding region is interrupted by two introns whose locations are conserved with the murine gene. The three zinc fingers share >90% sequence similarity with and are predicted to bind the same target sequence as the mouse EKLF. The rest of the protein is proline-rich and retains approximately 70% sequence similarity to the mouse gene. Human EKLF is expressed in bone marrow and HEL, JK1, and OCIM1 erythroleukemic cell lines but not in K562 nor in myeloid or lymphoid cell lines. These results indicate that the genomic structure and erythroid-restricted expression of EKLF are highly conserved between the murine and human homologues. Availability of human EKLF will enable initiation of studies to molecularly assess whether it is functionally compromised in those cases of beta-thalassemia that contain a normal beta-globin gene locus.","['Bieker, J J']",['Bieker JJ'],"['Brookdale Center for Molecular Biology and Department of Biochemistry, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (erythroid Kruppel-like factor)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Regulator/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organ Specificity', 'Proline', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Zinc Fingers']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/dna.1996.15.347 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 1996 May;15(5):347-52. doi: 10.1089/dna.1996.15.347.,['GENBANK/U37106'],['DK 46865/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LIF induces adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) secretion in vitro and potently synergizes with both corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and cAMP-induced pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) transcription. We therefore investigated the effects of intra-carotid administration of recombinant human LIF to chronically catheterized fetal non-human primates. LIF induced fetal monkey ACTH secretion in a time- and dose dependent manner. Maximal ACTH induction (12-fold) was achieved with 100 micrograms/kg after 60 minutes (p < 0.01). CRH (10 micrograms/kg) also induced ACTH secretion 4.8-fold at 60 minutes. Co-injection of LIF (50 micrograms/kg) and CRH (10 micrograms/kg) synergistically induced ACTH levels in a time-dependent manner up to 23-fold after 60 minutes. Thus, LIF alone induces ACTH secretion and LIF acts in synergy with CRH in vivo. As LIF is expressed early in human fetal pituitary development, and potentiates corticotroph function both in vitro and in vivo, this immuno-regulatory cytokine may be useful for clinical testing of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.","['Akita, S', 'Conn, P M', 'Melmed, S']","['Akita S', 'Conn PM', 'Melmed S']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute - UCLA School of Medicine 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', '9015-71-8 (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone)']",IM,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/blood/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Fetus/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/drug effects/physiology', 'Injections, Intra-Arterial', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Pituitary Gland, Anterior/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System/drug effects/physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/pharmacology']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/jcem.81.11.8923879 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1996 Nov;81(11):4170-8. doi: 10.1210/jcem.81.11.8923879.,,"['DK50238/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HD19899/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00163/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-five patients became colonized, of whom six developed clinical infections. Of the 53 isolates of GRE, 49 were Enterococcus faecium, multiply-resistant to vancomycin and ampicillin. DNA fingerprinting of 48 E. faecium isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified six DNA types. One strain of VanB phenotype E. faecium predominated during the initial outbreak, and an unrelated strain of the VanA phenotype was present in a second cluster. Environmental and patient isolates of E. faecium were indistinguishable by DNA typing. The VanA phenotype enterococci probably arose by transfer from the renal ward at a nearby hospital, and a patient with persistent diarrhoea may have contributed to contamination and cross-infection. GRE may cause significant infections in immunocompromised patients, and are readily transmitted between them. GRE were controlled, but not eradicated on the unit; infection control measures included improved environmental cleaning and modification of antibiotic use. In order to control GRE, it is necessary to educate healthcare workers and implement the traditional, effective values of good personal hygiene and environmental cleanliness.","['Chadwick, P R', 'Oppenheim, B A', 'Fox, A', 'Woodford, N', 'Morgenstern, G R', 'Scarffe, J H']","['Chadwick PR', 'Oppenheim BA', 'Fox A', 'Woodford N', 'Morgenstern GR', 'Scarffe JH']","['Public Health Laboratory, Withington Hospital, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hosp Infect,The Journal of hospital infection,8007166,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '6Q205EH1VU (Vancomycin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cross Infection/epidemiology/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA, Bacterial', 'Disease Outbreaks/*prevention & control', '*Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'England/epidemiology', '*Enterococcus faecium/drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/epidemiology/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Infection Control/methods', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Vancomycin/pharmacology']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0195-6701(96)90063-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0195-6701(96)90063-8 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hosp Infect. 1996 Nov;34(3):171-82. doi: 10.1016/s0195-6701(96)90063-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These circumstances have prompted the International Agency for Research on Cancer to consider an International data evaluation programme in cancer prevention, analogous to the Monographs programme for carcinogens. Aspects of the Monographs programme that have contributed to its success merit examination in this context. It is clear that any new data evaluation programme must be grounded in a multidisciplinary assessment of data: relevant expertise extends from molecular genetics through to the design and evaluation of clinical trials. At the end, preventive efficacy for whole populations is unlikely: evaluations will probably indicate efficacy of an agent in relation to a particular organ or tumour type and in high-risk groups. Virtually all putative chemopreventive agents have adverse effects; many are carcinogenic. Such indications of hazard impinge upon the possible usage of these same agents to prevent cancer. Quantitative data concerning dose-specific effects, where available, will be relevant. It will also be important to elucidate the biological processes that account for chemoprevention and carcinogenesis - and to consider mechanisms relevant to other biological end points. Publication of evaluations of chemopreventive data may cause difficulty if such evaluations are misused or quoted out of context. This consideration and other complexities associated with the wider use of chemopreventive agents are discussed.","['Stewart, B W']",['Stewart BW'],"[""Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Prince of Wales Children's Hospital, Sydney, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",France,IARC Sci Publ,IARC scientific publications,8009542,['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)'],IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chemoprevention/*methods/standards', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*prevention & control']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,IARC Sci Publ. 1996;(139):303-12.,,,,48,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We incubated highly differentiated human hepatoma cells (Hep G2) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) for 24 h with recombinant human leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and oncostatin M (OSM)--cytokines that are implicated in acute phase reactions during inflammation and which bind to the same cell surface receptor unit (glycoprotein gp 130). LIF was also given to mice in vivo. Contents of coagulation and fibrinolytic system proteins in cell culture supernatants and in mouse liver were determined. RESULTS: LIF increased the accumulation of urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA) in the Hep G2 cell culture supernatants determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (0.21 +/- 0.03 (SE) ng/ml at baseline; 0.40 +/- 0.05 ng/ml at 100 U/ml, P < 0.05; 0.57 +/- 0.06 ng/ml at 500 U/ml, P < 0.01; n = 9) without altering total protein content. OSM elicited a similar effect (0.25 +/- 0.04 ng/ml at baseline, 0.62 +/- 0.19 ng/ml at 1 ng/ml; P < 0.05, n = 6). A monoclonal antibody against gp 130 abrogated the response to both agents (n = 9). Plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) (assayed by ELISA, n = 9), the PAI-1 binding protein, vitronectin (immunoprecipitation, n = 3) and tissue factor (ELISA, n = 3) were not affected by LIF, but fibrinogen production increased up to twofold with LIF (500 U/ml; Western blot, n= 3). In HUVECs, synthesis of tissue type plasminogen activator or PAI-1 was not altered by LIF or OSM (ELISA, n = 9). In vivo, intraperitoneal recombinant murine LIF (2 mu g) increased liver concentrations of u-PA by 30% and fibrinogen by 220% in mice. CONCLUSIONS: LIF and OSM produced by immune cells may modify fibrinolysis and coagulation by altering expression of u-PA and fibrinogen, thereby contributing to coagulopathy.","['Okada, H', 'Woodcock-Mitchell, J', 'Fujii, S']","['Okada H', 'Woodcock-Mitchell J', 'Fujii S']","['Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington 05405, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Coron Artery Dis,Coronary artery disease,9011445,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/enzymology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fibrinogen/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Liver/cytology/*enzymology', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Umbilical Veins/cytology/*enzymology', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/*drug effects/metabolism']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00019501-199608000-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,Coron Artery Dis. 1996 Aug;7(8):561-7. doi: 10.1097/00019501-199608000-00001.,,['HL-17646/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conclude that plakophilins 2a and 2b are basic nuclear proteins that in certain cell types additionally assemble with other proteins to form the desmosomal plaque and serve general nuclear functions as well as a function specific to many but not all desmosomes.","['Mertens, C', 'Kuhn, C', 'Franke, W W']","['Mertens C', 'Kuhn C', 'Franke WW']","['Division of Cell Biology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (PKP1 protein, human)', '0 (PKP2 protein, human)', '0 (Plakophilins)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing/physiology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Caco-2 Cells/chemistry', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Cattle', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics', 'Desmosomes/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/chemistry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Glioma', 'Guinea Pigs', 'HT29 Cells/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Isomerism', 'Keratinocytes/chemistry', 'Kidney/cytology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Macropodidae', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Animal', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'PC12 Cells/chemistry', 'Plakophilins', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Rats', 'Vulvar Neoplasms']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.135.4.1009 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1996 Nov;135(4):1009-25. doi: 10.1083/jcb.135.4.1009.,['GENBANK/X97675'],,PMC2133394,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared the HLA frequencies of 25 black patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) referred to the National Cancer Institute for therapy with a racially similar, asymptomatic control population of human T-cell lymphotrophic virus, type I (HTLV-I)-seropositive individuals (n = 45). Serological typing was performed for MHC class I and II antigens. Antigen frequencies were calculated, and corresponding gene frequencies were estimated using the maximum likelihood method. Comparisons between the ATL and control group were made with chi 2 or Fisher's exact test. Three antigens (A36, B18, and DR53) were found to have a higher frequency in the ATL patients than in the controls (uncorrected two-tailed P < 0.05). The gene frequencies for these antigens also were statistically significant in the uncorrected analysis. However, only A36 approached statistical significance after correction of the P value for multiple comparisons (P = 0.08). The results of this pilot study indicate that black patients with ATL may have increased frequencies of certain class I HLA when compared with a racially similar HTLV-I-positive reference population. This suggests that either these antigens may represent markers for a population at greater risk of developing ATL once infected with HTLV-I or that they were acquired at some point in the process of malignant transformation or progression from the carrier state to onset of ATL. These antigens should be targeted in larger studies to confirm or refute these findings.","['White, J D', 'Johnson, J A', 'Nam, J M', 'Cranston, B', 'Hanchard, B', 'Waldmann, T A', 'Manns, A']","['White JD', 'Johnson JA', 'Nam JM', 'Cranston B', 'Hanchard B', 'Waldmann TA', 'Manns A']","['Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Blacks/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'HLA Antigens/*analysis/genetics', 'HTLV-I Infections/complications/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/epidemiology/genetics/*immunology/virology', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/epidemiology/genetics/*immunology/virology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Survival Analysis']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 1996 Nov;5(11):873-7.,,['N01-CP-31006/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The management is controversial and clear recommendations cannot be made because: 1) Most series include patients with CM that has arisen from different primary malignancies which are associated with different median survival intervals. 2) There have been no prospective randomised investigations of treatment modalities in patients with CM from a particular tumour type. 3) The definition of response varies from one report to another so that some response rates refer to cytological changes in the CSF while others take clinical, cytological and biochemical parameters into account. 4) Reports include patients with and without parenchymal metastases and the natural history of carcinomatous meningitis in the two situations may differ. The median survival of solid tumour carcinomatous meningitis (excluding leukaemia and lymphoma) is approximately 2-3 months and patients with breast cancer have the longest survival (median 3 months). Currently patients are treated with radiotherapy to part or all of the neuraxis with either intrathecal or intravenous chemotherapy but the relative contribution of these modalities to survival or quality of life remains unknown. Approximately 50% of patients with carcinomatous meningitis die from other causes, including systemic disease. The two most important endpoints for the patient, neurological improvement and overall survival, are seldom used in isolation in the literature. Many reports have focused on surrogate markers of response, namely biochemical and cytological data points but the correlation between clinical status and these parameters is poor because of differences between lumbar and ventricular CSF and disturbances of CSF flow in CM. The current literature does not provide clear guidelines for the treatment of this condition. Multicentre, prospective, randomised trials should be conducted that address questions of most relevance to the patient, namely neurological status and overall survival.","['Jayson, G C', 'Howell, A']","['Jayson GC', 'Howell A']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Christie Hospital and NHS Trust, Withington, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/cerebrospinal fluid/complications/drug therapy/*secondary', 'Meningitis/cerebrospinal fluid/*etiology', 'Neoplasms/complications/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a010755 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)61571-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1996 Oct;7(8):773-86. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a010755.,,,,112,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our findings indicate that different cell types transcribe MLL mRNA species lacking exons that generally encode putative regulatory domains such as AT hooks (exon 3), repression domain (exon 6), zinc finger motifs (exon 8) and activation domain (exon 18).

Downstream of gp130, two signal-transducing pathways have been recognized, the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway and the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. To determine whether these two signaling pathways through gp130 are present in cardiac myocytes, we examined their activation by using leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which is a member of the IL-6 cytokine family. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lysates from neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were immunoprecipitated with anti-gp130, anti-JAK1, or anti-STAT3 antibody and blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130, JAK1, and STAT3 was observed after LIF stimulation in cardiac myocytes. MAPKs were maximally activated 5 minutes after LIF stimulation. Furthermore, anti-gp130 antibody significantly inhibited the LIF-induced activation of JAK1, STAT3, and MAPKs. To examine whether these signaling pathways were also activated in the adult heart in vivo, LIF was injected intravenously into a 6-week-old mouse, and the heart was examined subsequently. gp130, STAT3, and MAPKs were activated in the heart after LIF treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate for the first time that a JAK-STAT pathway and a MAPK pathway are present down-stream of gp130 in cardiac myocytes and are rapidly activated by LIF both in vitro and in vivo.

Recently, we developed the CMV antigenemia assay: a rapid and quantitative method based on the detection of CMC antigens in peripheral blood leukocytes by flow cytometry. Heparinized peripheral blood was obtained from healthy donors, bone marrow transplantation patients, patient with collagen disease and patients with adult T cell leukemia. To determine the phenotype of HCMV-infected mononuclear cells, the following phycoerythrin-conjugated mAb were used: CD8, CD15. These mAds were added to the whole blood and incubated. After the hemolysis, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.3% NP-40. To determine the HCMV-infected cells, the following mAb were used in flow cytometry analysis: E13 (Chemicon Inc., Toyo) against HCMV IEA. As a secondary antibody, a FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. In the bone marrow transplant patients, CMV-associated antigen was positive in their monocytes and polymorphocytes. In the patient with collagen disease, CMV-antigen was positive in their lymphocytes and monocytes. Our study demonstrates that the detection of CMV antigen-positive blood leukocytes by FACScan is a rapid and quantitative method and useful for the diagnosis and monitoring of CMV-associated CMV-associated disease.

METHOD: A cohort of 201 confirmed HTLV-I seropositive Jamaican food service workers and 225 seronegative controls of similar age and sex from the same population was examined. A health questionnaire, physical examination, and laboratory tests were performed at enrollment into the cohort in 1987-1988. RESULTS: One of 201 HTLV-I seropositives, but no controls were diagnosed with HAM, for a prevalence of 0.5% (95% confidence interval) (CI) 0.01-2.7%); no cases of ATL were diagnosed. While there was no difference in current symptoms, the HTLV-I seropositive group was more likely to report a past medical history of hepatitis or jaundice (OR = 3.49, 95% CI: 0.93-13.08), malaria (OR = 2.13, 95% CI: 0.96-4.73), and dengue fever (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 0.82-2.29); however, these differences were of borderline statistical significance. Low income HTLV-I seropositive women had lower body weight (P < 0.01) and body mass index (P < 0.009) than their seronegative counterparts; similar differences were seen in the smaller male group. A trend toward higher prevalence of severe anaemia (haemoglobin < 10 g/dl) (12.6% versus 7.7%, P < 0.105) and a significantly lower prevalence of eosinophilia (1.0% versus 6.3%, P < 0.004) was seen among HTLV-I seropositives compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Although most HTLV-I seropositives are asymptomatic, HAM may be diagnosed in approximately 0.5% of carriers. Chronic HTLV-I infection may also exert subtle effects on body mass and haematological parameters.","['Murphy, E L', 'Wilks, R', 'Morgan, O S', 'Hanchard, B', 'Cranston, B', 'Figueroa, J P', 'Gibbs, W N', 'Murphy, J', 'Blattner, W A']","['Murphy EL', 'Wilks R', 'Morgan OS', 'Hanchard B', 'Cranston B', 'Figueroa JP', 'Gibbs WN', 'Murphy J', 'Blattner WA']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco 94143, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,,IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia/blood/epidemiology/etiology', 'Body Mass Index', 'Cohort Studies', 'Eosinophilia/blood/epidemiology/etiology', 'Eosinophils/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Jamaica/epidemiology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/blood/*complications/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ije/25.5.1090 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 1996 Oct;25(5):1090-7. doi: 10.1093/ije/25.5.1090.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we verified the contribution of Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) to cardiac allograft rejection by utilizing the Fas-deficient lpr or FasL-deficient gld mice as the donor or recipient. Cardiac myocytes prepared from normal mice, but not those from lpr mice, constitutively expressed Fas and were susceptible to FasL-mediated lysis. Survival of cardiac allografts was substantially prolonged when gld or lpr mice were used as the recipient. In contrast, cardiac allografts from lpr mice were normally rejected without a delay. Histological examination of the grafts in the gld or lpr recipients demonstrated a lesser cellular infiltration and much milder myocyte damage. Proliferative response and cytotoxic T lymphocyte induction against the donor-type alloantigens were not impaired in the gld or lpr recipients. These results indicate a substantial contribution of FasL to cardiac allograft rejection, independent of Fas in the grafts. This ralses a possibility that FasL may be more generally involved in tissue damage associated with various diseases than expected from the expression of Fas in the target organs.","['Seino, K', 'Kayagaki, N', 'Bashuda, H', 'Okumura, K', 'Yagita, H']","['Seino K', 'Kayagaki N', 'Bashuda H', 'Okumura K', 'Yagita H']","['Department of Immunology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Fetal Heart/cytology', 'Graft Rejection/*immunology/pathology', 'Heart Transplantation/*immunology', 'Leukemia L5178/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Myocardium/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Transfection', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*immunology', 'fas Receptor/genetics/*physiology']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/intimm/8.9.1347 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Immunol. 1996 Sep;8(9):1347-54. doi: 10.1093/intimm/8.9.1347.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have now mapped the physical location of BLIMP1 near the marker D6S447 on human chromosome 6q21-q22.1; we have also mapped Blimp1 to mouse Chromosome 10 at 14 cM distal to the Myb locus and to a region homologous to the location of BLIMP1.

Based on the finding that the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) plays an important role in mediating these changes in sympathetic neurons, its participation in triggering changes in sensory neurons was examined. By the use of transgenic mice in which the LIF gene had been knocked out, LIF was found to contribute to the induction of galanin expression in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) after sciatic nerve lesion. On the other hand, two other neuropeptide changes that occur in DRG under these conditions, the reduction of substance P and induction of neuropeptide Y, were independent of LIF expression. In the sympathetic superior cervical ganglion, transection of the postganglionic nerves close to the ganglion resulted in a rapid induction of LIF mRNA in the ganglion and in the lesioned nerve trunk. In contrast, transection of the sciatic nerve close to or distant from the DRG caused a rapid induction of LIF mRNA in the lesioned nerve, but not in the DRG. DRG were capable of making substantial amounts of LIF mRNA when placed in explant cultures, but, in vivo, only a slight induction was found even when both central and peripheral nerve processes of these sensory neurons were transected. These latter observations suggest that, in contrast to the superior cervical ganglia, the DRG environment inhibits the lesion-induced expression of LIF in vivo and/or explanted DRG produce stimulatory signals not found in vivo. Together with the data on the induction of galanin, these observations provide evidence that LIF, generated at a site at some distance from the ganglion, is involved in triggering part of the cell body reaction in sensory neurons.","['Sun, Y', 'Zigmond, R E']","['Sun Y', 'Zigmond RE']","['Department of Neurosciences, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106-4975, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",France,Eur J Neurosci,The European journal of neuroscience,8918110,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neuropeptide Y)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)', '88813-36-9 (Galanin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Axons/*physiology', 'Culture Techniques', 'Galanin/*biosynthesis', 'Ganglia, Spinal/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis/deficiency/*physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/deficiency/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neurons, Afferent/*metabolism', 'Neuropeptide Y/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reference Values', 'Sciatic Nerve/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Substance P/biosynthesis']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1460-9568.1996.tb00744.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Neurosci. 1996 Oct;8(10):2213-20. doi: 10.1111/j.1460-9568.1996.tb00744.x.,,"['MH00162/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'NS17512/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neurons allowed to survive and differentiate in high K+ medium for several days in vitro are still induced to undergo apoptosis when switched back to physiological (low) concentrations of K+ (5 mM). Here we have investigated the effects of various cytokines and growth factors in these two well-defined paradigms of neuronal apoptosis. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha, leukaemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, interleukin-10 and interleukin-13 delayed apoptosis and prolonged survival of cerebellar granule neurons maintained in low K+ medium. The effect observed required continuous exposure of the cultures to the cytokines and appeared not to involve modulation of Bcl-2 protein expression. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor accelerated neuronal death in low K+ medium. In contrast, when apoptosis of the neurons was precipitated by switching mature high K+ neurons to low K+ medium, neither tumour necrosis factor-alpha, leukaemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, interleukin-10 nor interleukin-13 prevented apoptosis. When testing the cytokines and growth factors for their capacity to alter N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated excitotoxicity of differentiated cerebellar granule neurons, no significant effect was observed.

Gel filtration chromatography of ganglion proteins followed by a specific radioimmunoassay revealed that SN is the predominant cleavage product of secretogranin II, a member of the chromogranin/secretogranin protein family, in adult ganglia. SN was detected within the majority of nerve endings surrounding postganglionic neurons that were identified by the presence of synaptophysin and, in part, colocalized leu-encephalin. Applying immuno-electronmicroscopy, SN was localized to large dense core vesicles of neuronal and small intensely fluorescent (SIF) cells. In situ hybridization revealed the presence of secretogranin II mRNA in postganglionic neurons and, to a lesser extent, in SIF cells. One week after transection of the postganglionic branches SN levels were not significantly altered; however, a decrease of secretogranin II mRNA was observed in postganglionic neurons but not in SIF cells. After decentralization of the ganglion, SN-immunoreactive nerve terminals disappeared and intraganglionic SN levels were reduced by 70%, indicating the preganglionic origin of SN-positive nerve fibres and varicosities. Secretogranin II mRNA was slightly reduced under this condition. Combined axotomy and decentralization further diminished intraganglionic secretogranin II mRNA, although peptide levels increased significantly above control values under these conditions. Double-labelling immunofluorescence with antibodies against the somatodendritic marker microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) revealed that the increase in SN immunoreactivity was due to an accumulation of SN in axonal processes of postganglionic neurons. SN immunoreactivity was also detected in dissociated neonatal superior cervical ganglion cultures and increased significantly upon treatment with nerve growth factor, the survival and differentiation factor of sympathetic neurons during perinatal development. Co-culture with non-neuronal cells or addition of leukaemia inhibitory factor, a cytokine known to stimulate synthesis of various peptides after nerve transection, did not influence SN immunoreactivity. Therefore, since no fixed relationship between SN and any of the known neuropeptides or neurotransmitters expressed in sympathetic neurons was observed, the expression of this novel peptide appears to be independently regulated.","['Klimaschewski, L', 'Kroesen, S', 'Eder, U', 'Leitner, B', 'Fischer-Colbrie, R']","['Klimaschewski L', 'Kroesen S', 'Eder U', 'Leitner B', 'Fischer-Colbrie R']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur J Neurosci,The European journal of neuroscience,8918110,"['0 (Chromogranins)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Secretogranin II)', '149146-12-3 (secretoneurin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Axons/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromogranins', 'Female', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Male', 'Nerve Endings/chemistry', 'Nerve Fibers/chemistry', 'Neuropeptides/*analysis/genetics/physiology', 'Protein Precursors/metabolism', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Secretogranin II', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/*chemistry']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1460-9568.1996.tb01339.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Neurosci. 1996 Sep;8(9):1953-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1460-9568.1996.tb01339.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gp130 immunoreactivity was observed in both glial and neuronal cells. Two distinct neuronal staining patterns were observed. The first showed neuropil staining, observed mainly in telencephalic structures including the hippocampus, cerebral cortex and caudate-putamen. The second pattern was observed on the cytoplasmic membrane of neuronal somata and was found primarily in the lower brainstem, in the large neurons of the reticular formation, and in spinal and cranial motor neurons. Electron-microscopic analysis revealed that both types of gp130 immunoreactivity were primarily associated with the cytoplasmic membrane and were not localized exactly at synaptic sites. Further, gp130 immunoreactivity was also observed in the oligodendrocytes and subependymal zone. These widespread but characteristic patterns of gp130 immunoreactivity overlap well with those of IL-6 receptor and CNTF alpha chains, suggesting a role of cytokines and growth factors such as IL-6 and CNTF via gp130 in certain specific regions of the brain.","['Watanabe, D', 'Yoshimura, R', 'Khalil, M', 'Yoshida, K', 'Kishimoto, T', 'Taga, T', 'Kiyama, H']","['Watanabe D', 'Yoshimura R', 'Khalil M', 'Yoshida K', 'Kishimoto T', 'Taga T', 'Kiyama H']","['Department of Neuroanatomy, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur J Neurosci,The European journal of neuroscience,8918110,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Il11ra1 protein, rat)', '0 (Il6st protein, rat)', '0 (Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-11)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Brain Chemistry/*physiology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*analysis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Receptors, Cytokine/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-11', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/analysis', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1460-9568.1996.tb01307.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Neurosci. 1996 Aug;8(8):1630-40. doi: 10.1111/j.1460-9568.1996.tb01307.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have evaluated the potential of a retroviral vector with an internal opsin promoter fragment to direct gene expression to retinal photoreceptor cells. METHODS: Two recombinant retroviral vectors were prepared; in each Vector, a 1.4 kb fragment of the mouse opsin promoter was placed downstream from the neoR gene in the Moloney murine leukemia virus-based vector G1Na. The opsin promoter fragment was linked either to the cDNA for mouse rod photoreceptor phosphodiesterase (PDE) beta-subunit or to the bacterial lacZ reporter gene. These vectors were tested for their ability to direct gene expression after transduction of 3T3 and Y79 cells, or of dissociated retinal cell cultures or retinal explants from neonatal mice. RESULTS: As expected, PDE beta-subunit and beta-galactosidase mRNAs were expressed only at low levels in 3T3 fibroblasts and Y79 retinoblastoma cells. Northern blot analysis indicated that expression was derived from the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. Infection of primary retinal cell cultures or explants from neonatal mice with BAG retrovirus, in which beta-galactosidase is driven by the viral LTR, resulted in expression in many cell types, while the opsin-lacZ vector mediated the expression of the lacZ reporter gene specifically in photoreceptor cells. CONCLUSIONS: The internal opsin promoter fragment appears capable of selectively directing gene expression to photoreceptor cells after retroviral-mediated gene transfer. These findings serve as a basis for future studies using the opsin promoter-beta PDE retroviral vector to rescue photoreceptor cells in the rd mutant mouse, in which the beta-PDE gene is mutated resulting in degeneration of photoreceptor cells during the early postnatal period.","['Kido, M', 'Rich, K A', 'Yang, G', 'Barron, E', 'Kohn, D B', 'al-Ubaidi, M R', 'Blanks, J C']","['Kido M', 'Rich KA', 'Yang G', 'Barron E', 'Kohn DB', 'al-Ubaidi MR', 'Blanks JC']","['Doheny Eye Institute Department of Ophthalmology, USC School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Curr Eye Res,Current eye research,8104312,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Rod Opsins)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Eye Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lac Operon/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Photoreceptor Cells/*enzymology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Retina/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma/metabolism', 'Rod Opsins/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/02713689609017624 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Eye Res. 1996 Aug;15(8):833-44. doi: 10.3109/02713689609017624.,,"['EY03040/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY03042/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['Curr Eye Res 1996 Nov;15(11):1148.

It induces growth arrest and differentiation of HL-60 human promyelocytic leukaemia cells along the monocytic pathway and the production of the cytokines interleukin 1, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin 6 in human monocytes and monocytic cell lines. The cDNA for P48 was cloned from Reh cellular RNA using 3' reverse amplification of cDNA ends. Southern blot probing with P48 cDNA revealed hybridization with DNA from Reh and Molt-4 cells, but not with DNA from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Subsequent studies using PCR and Southern analysis revealed P48 sequences in DNA isolated from Mycoplasma fermentans but not M. hominis, M.iowae, M.synoviae or M.lypophilum. Although initial studies using Mycoplasma culture and hybridization techniques had failed to reveal Mycoplasma infection in our Reh and Molt-4 cell lines, subsequent PCR studies using Mycoplasma genus-specific rRNA primrs revealed Mycoplasma sequences in these cell lines. Using the P48 cDNA probe, we isolated a genomic clone from M. fermentans DNA which was found to be 98.5% identical with the P48 cDNA clone, and the deduced amino acid sequence agreed with N-terminal microsequencing data for P48 protein purified from the Reh cell line conditioned medium. The 5' end of the gene has a number of consensus sequences characteristic of prokaryotic genes, and the deduced amino acid sequence has a number of features suggesting that P48 is a lipoprotein. The P48 cDNA was expressed in pMAL in Escherichia coli, and the 60 kDa expressed fusion protein was found to react with anti-P48 antibodies on Western blots. This is consistent with a pMAL fusion protein representing the sum of the 42 kDa maltose-binding protein and 18 kDa of P48 recombinant protein, suggesting that native P48 has significant post-translational modification. Consistent with this, Northern blot studies revealed a single 1 kb transcript. The recombinant fusion protein was found to possess anti-proliferative activity against HL-60 cells, and antibodies against recombinant P48 were found to block the biological activity of native P48 isolated from conditioned medium. These studies demonstrate that P48, a molecule with immunomodulatory and haematopoietic differentiation activities, is derived from M. fermentans or a closely related species. P48 may be important in the pathophysiology of Mycoplasma infections and may be useful in dissecting the mechanisms involved in mammalian haematopoietic cell differentiation, immune function and cytokine biosynthesis.","['Hall, R E', 'Agarwal, S', 'Kestler, D P', 'Cobb, J A', 'Goldstein, K M', 'Chang, N S']","['Hall RE', 'Agarwal S', 'Kestler DP', 'Cobb JA', 'Goldstein KM', 'Chang NS']","['Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee Medical Center/Graduate School of Medicine, Knoxville 37920, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (monocytic differentiation factor P48)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Genes, Bacterial', 'Growth Substances/*biosynthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, B-Cell', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mycoplasma fermentans/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3190919 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1996 Nov 1;319 ( Pt 3):919-27. doi: 10.1042/bj3190919.,['GENBANK/U70254'],['CA-58205/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC1217876,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate that in human erythroleukaemic cells (K562) alpha 1-AT enhances the binding affinity of iron-regulatory protein (IRP), the central regulator of cellular iron metabolism, to iron-responsive elements. Activation of IRP by alpha 1-AT is associated with a marked increase in transferrin receptor (trf-rec) mRNA levels in K562 and enhanced cell-surface expression of transferrin-binding sites, whereas ferritin production is decreased, although ferritin mRNA levels remain unchanged. In agreement with the well-established mechanism of cellular iron regulation, alpha 1-AT seems to modulate trf-rec and ferritin expression primarily post-transcriptionally/translationally by influencing IRP activity. In contrast, alpha 1-AT produces only minor changes in IRP activity, and subsequently in trf-rec expression and ferritin synthesis in THP-1 cells. Moreover the effects of alpha 1-AT on iron homeostasis in K562 cannot be overcome by the addition of iron salts, whereas concomitant treatment of THP-1 with iron and alpha 1-AT results in the same metabolic changes as the addition of iron alone. Because alpha 1-AT blocks transferrin binding on K562 as well as on THP-1 cells, it is suggested, on the basis of the results presented here, (1) that erythroid and monocytic cells might differ in their dependence on transferrin-mediated iron supply and (2) that THP-1 might be able to acquire iron by a transferrin-independent iron uptake system. alpha 1-AT might therefore be involved in the diversion of iron traffic between various cellular compartments under inflammatory conditions.","['Weiss, G', 'Graziadel, I', 'Urbanek, M', 'Grunewald, K', 'Vogel, W']","['Weiss G', 'Graziadel I', 'Urbanek M', 'Grunewald K', 'Vogel W']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Iron-Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Iron-Sulfur Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (alpha 1-Antitrypsin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Deferoxamine/*pharmacology', 'Ferritins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron-Regulatory Proteins', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin/*pharmacology']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3190897 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1996 Nov 1;319 ( Pt 3):897-902. doi: 10.1042/bj3190897.,,,PMC1217872,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL13 is structurally related to IL4, competes with IL4 for binding to cell surface receptors and exhibits many similar biological effects. The molecular basis for this functional overlap between IL4 and IL13 has been attributed mainly to a shared use of the 140 kDa IL4R alpha, since these cytokines appear to be uniquely different in that, according to several recent reports, IL13 does not recruit the IL2R gamma or JAK3. This notion has been supported by the identification of a novel 70 kDa IL13 receptor in certain IL13-responsive cell lines that lack IL2R gamma. The present study sheds new light on the issue of functional overlap between IL13 and IL4, by demonstrating for the first time that, in cells that express both IL2R gamma and IL4R alpha, IL13 can mimic IL4-induced heterodimerization of IL2R gamma and IL4R alpha, with consequent marked activation of JAK3 and the transcription factor STAT6 (IL4-STAT). Reconstitution experiments in BA/F3 cells showed that both cytokines require the simultaneous presence of IL4R alpha and IL2R gamma to mediate JAK3 and proliferative responses, and analysis of 12 IL4R alpha variants showed that IL4 and IL13 signals were equally affected by mutations of the cytoplasmic domain. We conclude that IL13 activates the IL2R gamma-associated JAK3 tyrosine kinase in appropriate cell types, and propose that IL13 is capable of interacting with multiple receptor subunits in a cell-dependent and combinatorial manner. Consequently, we predict that partial disruption of IL13 signal transduction also contributes to the severe combined immuno-deficiency syndromes associated with inactivation of the IL2R gamma or JAK3 genes.","['Malabarba, M G', 'Rui, H', 'Deutsch, H H', 'Chung, J', 'Kalthoff, F S', 'Farrar, W L', 'Kirken, R A']","['Malabarba MG', 'Rui H', 'Deutsch HH', 'Chung J', 'Kalthoff FS', 'Farrar WL', 'Kirken RA']","['Division of Basic Science, IRSP, SAIC Frederick, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '0 (STAT6 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT6 protein, human)', '0 (Stat6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-13/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 3', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/immunology', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4', 'STAT6 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3190865 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1996 Nov 1;319 ( Pt 3):865-72. doi: 10.1042/bj3190865.,,,PMC1217868,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also expressed by leukaemic blasts of a small group of patients suffering from acute or chronic lymphoid leukaemia. CD13-specific monoclonal antibodies do not bind to the surface of normal B lymphocytes, and APN mRNA was not detectable by Northern analysis in normal lymphocytes or in T-cell lines. Recently the expression of the APN gene in T-cell lines as well as the ability of these cells to cleave chromogenic substrates preferred by APN have been demonstrated [Lendeckel, Wex, Kahne, Frank, Reinhold and Ansorge (1994) Cell. Immunol. 153, 214-226]. Here, by means of dot-blot hybridization and RNase protection assay, evidence is provided that human peripheral T-cells as well as derived cell lines contain significant amounts of APN mRNA, comparable to that in the promyeloic cell line U937, and that mitogenic activation of peripheral human T-cells leads to a more than 4-fold increase in their APN mRNA content. In the course of activation, T-cells increase their total alanine p-nitroanilide-hydrolysing activity to approx. 7-fold that of resting cells. Furthermore these cells become immunoreactive towards CD13 to a significant extent (up to 51%) as shown by surface staining and confirmed by activity staining and immunostaining after isoelectric focusing (pI of T-cell APN = 4.6). In addition it is demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy that viable, activated T-cells effectively cleave the fluorogenic aminopeptidase substrate bis-glycyl-rhodamine 110 and that the corresponding aminopeptidase activity is associated with the cell surface. We show that specific inhibitors of APN, probestin and actinonin, strongly decrease DNA synthesis in phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated T-cells. In summary, evidence is presented that in the course of mitogenic activation human peripheral T-cells increase the expression of APN both at the transcriptional level and at the cell surface. This has been demonstrated both at the APN mRNA level and at the protein level with respect to aminopeptidase enzymic activity and CD13 immunoreactivity.","['Lendeckel, U', 'Wex, T', 'Reinhold, D', 'Kahne, T', 'Frank, K', 'Faust, J', 'Neubert, K', 'Ansorge, S']","['Lendeckel U', 'Wex T', 'Reinhold D', 'Kahne T', 'Frank K', 'Faust J', 'Neubert K', 'Ansorge S']","['University of Magdeburg, Center of Internal Medicine, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (leukoagglutinins, plants)', '123652-87-9 (probestin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'I0J33N5627 (ubenimex)', 'P18SPA8N0K (actinonin)']",IM,"['CD13 Antigens/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leucine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Phytohemagglutinins', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*enzymology/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3190817 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1996 Nov 1;319 ( Pt 3):817-21. doi: 10.1042/bj3190817.,,,PMC1217861,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High titer producer clones expressing ZAP-70 were generated in the Gibbon ape leukemia virus packaging line PG13. After transduction, ZAP-70 was detected at levels equivalent to those observed in normal cells, and was appropriately phosphorylated on tyrosine after receptor engagement. The kinase activity of ZAP-70 in the reconstituted cells was also appropriately upregulated by receptor aggregation. Moreover, normal and transduced cells, but not ZAP-70-deficient cells, were able to mobilize calcium after receptor ligation, indicating that proximal TCR signaling was reconstituted. These results indicate that this form of SCID may be corrected by gene therapy.","['Taylor, N', 'Bacon, K B', 'Smith, S', 'Jahn, T', 'Kadlecek, T A', 'Uribe, L', 'Kohn, D B', 'Gelfand, E W', 'Weiss, A', 'Weinberg, K']","['Taylor N', 'Bacon KB', 'Smith S', 'Jahn T', 'Kadlecek TA', 'Uribe L', 'Kohn DB', 'Gelfand EW', 'Weiss A', 'Weinberg K']","[""Division of Research Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital, Los Angeles, California 90027, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.184.5.2031 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1996 Nov 1;184(5):2031-6. doi: 10.1084/jem.184.5.2031.,,['AI-40581/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2192882,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it remains to be understood how tumor cells adhere to endothelium and infiltrate into underlying tissue. We studied mechanisms of extravasation of leukemic cells using adult T cell leukemia (ATL) cells and report the following novel features of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan on ATL cells in ATL cell adhesion to endothelium: ATL cells adhere to endothelial cells through already activated integrins without exogenous stimulation; different from any other hematopoietic cells, ATL cells express a characteristic heparan sulfate capable of immobilizing heparin-binding chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 beta, a potent T cell integrin trigger, produced by the cells themselves; competitive interruption of endogenous heparan sulfate proteoglycan synthesis reduces cell surface MIP-1 beta and prevents ATL cells from integrin-mediated adhesion to endothelial cells or intercellular adhesion molecule-1 triggered through G-protein. We propose that leukemic cells adhere to endothelial cells through the adhesion cascade, similar to normal leukocyte, and that the cell surface heparan sulfate, particularly on ATL cells, is pivotally involved in chemokine-dependent autocrine stimulation of integrin triggering by immobilizing the chemokine on them.","['Tanaka, Y', 'Kimata, K', 'Wake, A', 'Mine, S', 'Morimoto, I', 'Yamakawa, N', 'Habuchi, H', 'Ashikari, S', 'Yamamoto, H', 'Sakurai, K', 'Yoshida, K', 'Suzuki, S', 'Eto, S']","['Tanaka Y', 'Kimata K', 'Wake A', 'Mine S', 'Morimoto I', 'Yamakawa N', 'Habuchi H', 'Ashikari S', 'Yamamoto H', 'Sakurai K', 'Yoshida K', 'Suzuki S', 'Eto S']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Medicine, Kitakyushu, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Glycosides)', '0 (Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (xylosides)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '9050-30-0 (Heparitin Sulfate)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', '*Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glycosides/pharmacology', 'Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans', 'Heparitin Sulfate/analysis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*metabolism', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Phenotype', 'Proteoglycans/analysis/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.184.5.1987 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1996 Nov 1;184(5):1987-97. doi: 10.1084/jem.184.5.1987.,,,PMC2192873,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Perforin-dependent cytotoxicity is a major effector function of CD8+ MHC class I-restricted T cells and of NK cells. Here, we used perforin-deficient C57BL/6 (PKO) mice to study involvement of perforin and Fas ligand in tumor surveillance in vivo. We induced tumors in PKO and normal C57BL/6 mice by (a) injection of different syngeneic tumor cell lines of different tissue origin in naive and primed mice; (b) administration of the chemical carcinogens methylcholanthrene (MCA) or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) plus 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA), or (c) by injection of acutely oncogenic Moloney sarcoma virus. The first set of models analyzes the defense against a tumor load given at once, whereas the last two sets give information on immune defense against tumors at the very moment of their generation. Most of the tumor cell lines tested were eliminated 10-100-fold better by C57BL/6 mice in an unprimed situation; after priming, the differences were more pronounced. Lymphoma cells transfected with Fas were controlled 10-fold better by PKO and C57BL/6 mice when compared to untransfected control cells, indicating some role for FasL in tumor control. MCA-induced tumors arose more rapidly and with a higher incidence in PKO mice compared to C57BL/6 or CD8-deficient mice. DMBA+TPA-induced skin papillomas arose with similar high incidence and comparable kinetics in both mouse strains. C57BL/6 and PKO mice have a similar incidence of Moloney murine sarcoma and leukemia virus-induced sarcomas, but tumors are larger and regression is retarded in PKO mice. Thus, perforin-dependent cytotoxicity is not only a crucial mechanism of both cytotoxic T lymphocyte- and NK-dependent resistance to injected tumor cell lines, but also operates during viral and chemical carcinogenesis in vivo. Experiments addressing the role of Fas-dependent cytotoxicity by studying resistance to tumor cell lines that were stably transfected with Fas neither provided evidence for a major role of Fas nor excluded a minor contribution of Fas in tumor surveillance.","['van den Broek, M E', 'Kagi, D', 'Ossendorp, F', 'Toes, R', 'Vamvakas, S', 'Lutz, W K', 'Melief, C J', 'Zinkernagel, R M', 'Hengartner, H']","['van den Broek ME', 'Kagi D', 'Ossendorp F', 'Toes R', 'Vamvakas S', 'Lutz WK', 'Melief CJ', 'Zinkernagel RM', 'Hengartner H']","['Institute of Experimental Immunology, University of Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '56-49-5 (Methylcholanthrene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Fibrosarcoma/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', '*Immunologic Surveillance', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Melanoma, Experimental/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Methylcholanthrene/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Transfection', 'fas Receptor/genetics']",1996/11/01 00:00,1996/11/01 00:01,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.184.5.1781 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1996 Nov 1;184(5):1781-90. doi: 10.1084/jem.184.5.1781.,,,PMC2192859,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the morphological changes during apoptosis provide the most reliable markers, in the present study we utilized a nuclear stain based on ethidium bromide (EtBr) for the rapid qualitative and quantitative measurement of circulating apoptotic cells directly in PB suspensions without fractionation. By using a fluorescent microscope the apoptotic cells appeared clearly visible, making the estimation of their percentage straightforward. We studied apoptosis before and during the onset of chemotherapy in PB from 16 children with ALL at diagnosis, and one upon relapse. In the cases studied at diagnosis the circulating apoptotic cells were found in variable percentages after 24 hours of treatment. Maximal apoptosis was observed after 24 hours of treatment in five cases and after 48 hours in two cases. After 96 hours of treatment the cases studied at diagnosis could be divided into three groups: those with a) negligible apoptotic cells, b) between 8% and 12% apoptotic cells and c) a high percentage of apoptotic cells (more than 20%). The relapsed case was characterized by P-glycoprotein positive blast cells, and circulating apoptotic cells which remained very low at all time points. Thus, it is possible to evaluate the response to treatment by studying apoptosis directly in peripheral blood. Therefore, the maximum apoptotic effect and the percentage of circulating apoptotic cells at the different time intervals must be considered.","['Tsangaris, G T', 'Moschovi, M', 'Mikraki, V', 'Vrachnou, E', 'Tzortzatou-Stathopoulou, F']","['Tsangaris GT', 'Moschovi M', 'Mikraki V', 'Vrachnou E', 'Tzortzatou-Stathopoulou F']","[""University Research Institute for the Study and Treatment of Childhood Genetic and Malignant Diseases, University of Athens, Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital, Greece.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/blood', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/blood', 'Neutrophils/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Time Factors']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1996 Sep-Oct;16(5B):3133-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The abnormal banding patterns obtained in a proportion of the B- and T-cell cases was not readily discernible by nondenaturing-acrylamide or agarose-separation methods.","['Short, M A', 'Evans, P A', 'Shiach, C R', 'Jack, A', 'Richards, S', 'Morgan, G J']","['Short MA', 'Evans PA', 'Shiach CR', 'Jack A', 'Richards S', 'Morgan GJ']","['Department of Molecular Haematology, Leeds General Infirmary, England.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Diagn Mol Pathol,"Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B",9204924,"['0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel/methods', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics', 'Temperature']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00019606-199603000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Mol Pathol. 1996 Mar;5(1):26-32. doi: 10.1097/00019606-199603000-00005.,,,,,,['Diagn Mol Pathol. 1996 Dec;5(4):297-8.

At age 2 years she had been diagnosed as having acute lymphoblastic leukemia L1, for which she was treated with systemic chemotherapy. She also received telecobalt therapy to the whole cranium for prophylaxis of meningeal leukosis. Having rejected other possible causes that can favor the appearance of basal cell carcinoma during childhood (basal cell nevus syndrome, nevus sebaceus, albinism, etc.), we believe that this case should be added to the five previously reported in the literature as basal cell carcinoma developing at an early age in cranial radiation portals with megavoltage radiotherapy. We draw attention to the need to explore radiated areas of skin as part of the long-term follow-up of these patients, and to the advisability of obtaining a biopsy from any persistent lesion in these areas.","['Garcia-Silva, J', 'Velasco-Benito, J A', 'Pena-Penabad, C', 'Armijo, M']","['Garcia-Silva J', 'Velasco-Benito JA', 'Pena-Penabad C', 'Armijo M']","['Department of Dermatology, University Hospital, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Pediatr Dermatol,Pediatric dermatology,8406799,['0 (Cobalt Radioisotopes)'],IM,"['Carcinoma, Basal Cell/*etiology/pathology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cobalt Radioisotopes/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*radiotherapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Radiation Dosage', '*Radioisotope Teletherapy/methods', 'Skin Neoplasms/*etiology/pathology', 'Skull/radiation effects']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1525-1470.1996.tb01190.x [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Dermatol. 1996 Jan-Feb;13(1):54-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1525-1470.1996.tb01190.x.,,,,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found the analytical uncertainty of LAP assays to range from over 100% coefficient of variation at low scores to about 20% at high scores. However, the receiver-operator characteristics derived from LAP determinations in 50 consecutive cases suggest that a suitably high diagnostic decision threshold still can eliminate false negatives. As a consequence of such a strategy, as many as half the tested patients, classified unequivocally as the negatives, can avoid further invasive and costly workup.

The non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are reviewed here. Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, collectively, represent the sixth most common cancer in the United States as well as the sixth most common cause of cancer deaths. The overall incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has risen steadily over the past four decades. Although some of this is attributable to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated lymphoma, HIV-associated disease accounts for only a small part of the increase in lymphoma. As our knowledge of normal as well as neoplastic lymphoid development has expanded on the basis of histopathology as well as adjunct cellular and molecular techniques, multiple classifications have been proposed to take these into account. The clinical relevance to our understanding of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is the concept that various lymphoid cancers are counterparts of stages of normal lymphoid development. Stages of lymphoid development in terms of cell surface markers and immunoglobulin gene rearrangements have been well characterized. These are particularly applicable to the early B-cell development, which is antigen-independent and occurs in the bone marrow. Diseases correlating with these stages are largely acute lymphocytic and lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and high-grade lymphomas, such as Burkitt's lymphomas. Much has been learned recently about subsequent antigen-dependent B-cell development in secondary lymphoid organs to improve our understanding of the corresponding stages of B-cell neoplasia. Many of these stages correlate with more recently described entities such as mantle cell and marginal zone lymphomas. Histologic study remains crucial in determining the subtype of NHLs, whereas immunohistochemistry, surface phenotype, and molecular studies are useful in selected cases. Although some lymphoma classifications may be better in terms of understanding the lymphoma biology, the working formulation remains useful to guide clinical decision making. Lymphomas classified as low grade are considered incurable with standard therapy when diagnosed, as is usual, at advanced stages. Different subtypes may have different median survivals, but the goal has typically been palliation, whereas experimental approaches are clearly needed. Intermediate and high-grade lymphomas are potentially curable with aggressive combination chemotherapy. Recent evidence suggests that CHOP chemotherapy is as effective as more complex regimens. Still, 40% to 50% of patients are cured. Prognostic factor analysis has allowed separation of subgroups with much better survival in whom CHOP is adequate versus those with much poorer survival in whom experimental approaches are rational. Additional subtypes of lymphomas have been described and characterized since the working formulation was developed, including mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue tumors (MALT-oma), mantle zone lymphoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma and AILD-like T-cell lymphoma. Approaches to these entities are still being optimized. Newer approaches, including high-dose therapy with stem cell support, biologic agents, and newer chemotherapeutic agents are discussed, as are special situations such as localized lymphoma of certain sites and lymphoma in immunosuppressed patients.","['Smith, M R']",['Smith MR'],"['Department of Medical Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Probl Cancer,Current problems in cancer,7702986,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/epidemiology/physiopathology/therapy', 'Prognosis']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0147-0272(96)80303-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0147-0272(96)80303-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Probl Cancer. 1996 Jan-Feb;20(1):6-77. doi: 10.1016/s0147-0272(96)80303-5.,,,,288,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study included all parishes in the six most contaminated counties classified after aerial mapping of ground radiation from 137Cs and investigated 746 cases of neoplasms in ages 0-19 y, diagnosed in the six counties. Incidence and relative risks of neoplasms were compared in areas with high, intermediate, and low contamination after versus before the Chernobyl accident in 1986. A continuous increase of brain tumor incidence in the ages 0-19 y during the period 1978-92 without clear relationship to the Chernobyl fallout was discovered. No clear relationship between the incidence of brain tumor and the exposure to varying levels of radiation from 137Cs was apparent. A somewhat decreased relative risk of acute lymphatic leukemia appeared in areas with increased exposure. Other neoplasms showed no changes in incidence over time or with regard to exposure. Until now, there is no indication that the Chernobyl accident has affected the incidence of childhood and adolescence neoplasms in Sweden, but it is still too early for any final conclusion about the effect of this event.","['Tondel, M', 'Carlsson, G', 'Hardell, L', 'Eriksson, M', 'Jakobsson, S', 'Flodin, U', 'Skoldestig, A', 'Axelson, O']","['Tondel M', 'Carlsson G', 'Hardell L', 'Eriksson M', 'Jakobsson S', 'Flodin U', 'Skoldestig A', 'Axelson O']","['Dept of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, University Hospital, Linkoping, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,"['0 (Cesium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Radioactive Fallout)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Brain Neoplasms/*epidemiology', '*Cesium Radioisotopes', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Geography', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Nuclear Reactors', 'Power Plants', '*Radioactive Fallout', '*Radioactive Hazard Release', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Ukraine']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00004032-199612000-00012 [doi]'],ppublish,Health Phys. 1996 Dec;71(6):947-50. doi: 10.1097/00004032-199612000-00012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
